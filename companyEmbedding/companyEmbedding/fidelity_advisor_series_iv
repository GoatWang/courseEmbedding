          In general the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk, liquidity risk, call risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties.

          ETFs are subject to market fluctuation and the risks of their underlying investments. ETFs are subject to management fees and other expenses. Unlike mutual funds, ETF shares are bought and sold at market price, which may be higher or lower than their NAV, and are not individually redeemed from the fund.
	
    

          Because of their narrow focus, sector funds tend to be more volatile than funds that diversify across many sectors and companies.

            Fidelity® Launches New Program to Help Independent Advisors Grow Through Mergers and Acquisitions
        


                
                06/11/2013 
            
















            Announces Strategic Alliance with Live Oak Bank to Offer Financing Options
        
        
        
            
        
                  
        BOSTON -- Fidelity Institutional Wealth Services, a division of Fidelity Investments®, today unveiled a new program designed to help registered investment advisors (RIAs) plan and execute mergers and acquisitions (M&A). This comprehensive offering includes the three components that advisors need to successfully execute an effective M&A program: insights and education regarding M&A strategy, connections to firms that are looking to buy another firm or be acquired and access to financing.
According to a 2011 Fidelity studyi, within the next three years, nearly two-thirds (63 percent) of RIAs that participated in the study would consider acquiring another firm, while more than one-third (38 percent) of the participating advisors would consider merging with another firm. Fewer -- just 16 percent of the participating firms -- were interested in selling their firms. 
“While many RIAs are interested in M&A, the pace of deals has not been commensurate with the interest we’ve seen from advisors,” said David Canter, executive vice president and head of practice management and consulting at Fidelity Institutional Wealth Services. “We believe that is largely due to the lack of organizational focus, tools and third-party support needed to facilitate M&A -- so we’ve designed a program that combines those factors with the financing needed to implement a deal.”
Through a strategic alliance with Live Oak Bank, Fidelity is providing its RIA clients access to discounted pricing on loans and a dedicated servicing team that can help streamline the loan acceptance processii. Live Oak Bank is a small business lender and can provide financing to certain advisors for loans up to $5 million. In addition to providing loans for mergers and acquisitions, Live Oak Bank will also offer loans for internal succession plans and for breakaways.
“We chose to align with Fidelity because of their commitment to the RIA business and the comprehensive M&A program they’ve implemented,” said Chip Mahan, CEO of Live Oak Bank. “We’re thrilled about the opportunity to collaborate with Fidelity, and to help support its clients’ growth.”
According to the research firm Cerulli, firms that participate in mergers and acquisitions are more likely to achieve scale, which can significantly reduce costs. Also, those firms with access to capital, either via private equity or a banking affiliation, are leading the transactions in the industryiii. 
In addition to financing through Live Oak, Fidelity offers advisor access to special pricing from M&A consultants who can assist them in navigating this process. Fidelity’s program also provides the connections and insights advisors need to design strategic M&A programs:Connections
• In-person workshops and events – a series of client events Fidelity hosts throughout the year with workshops, as well as networking opportunities focused on M&A. Advisors can benefit by meeting potential transaction partners, including prospective sellers, as well as gaining access to M&A specialists in the RIA space.
• RIA Match – a third-party owned and operated website that matches financial advisors who want to buy, sell, merge or join practices. Fidelity maintains a relationship with RIA Match whereby it acts as the exclusive custodian to provide content, participate in webinars, and arrange for its clients to contract with RIA Match for services at discounted pricing. Education & Insights 
• Expanding Your Practice – a series including a guide, workbook, white paper and checklist that offers a step-by-step approach to help advisors assess their readiness for a potential merger or acquisition. Based on interviews with recognized RIA M&A specialists, the series looks at what firms need to have in place to be viewed as a “viable buyer,” including a well-defined business strategy, a scalable structure and the resources to complete a deal.• Seize Opportunity: Acquisitions Can Be Your Catalyst – a white paper sharing best practices of leading firms who have completed acquisitions. Three investment advisory firms that have completed successful acquisitions – Buckingham Asset Management, Mariner Wealth Advisors and Rehmann – all offer insights, including why they chose to pursue acquisitions and their criteria for evaluating a target firm.
• Realizing the Power of Two: The Art and Science of a Successful Merger – a white paper focused on mergers – designed for both growth and succession planning – that takes advisors step-by-step through a successful deal. 
• Buy-out Benefits: When an Offer is Too Good to Pass Up – a white paper that offers examples of two advisory firms that were acquired. It addresses when firms should start thinking about liquidity options, whether advisors should consider entertaining offers if they weren’t planning to sell, and how they can determine the right buyer for their business.
“We believe that to be high-performing, a firm needs to continually re-evaluate its existing business model against its goals to stay competitiveiv. This offering was built to address the understanding that many high-performing firms evolve and are looking to build their businesses through M&A,” said Canter. “Our goal is to help firm leaders craft and execute strategic M&A programs -- from planning to financing a deal -- and ensure they’re using a ’1+1=3‘ model, where firms become stronger through M&A.”About Fidelity Practice Management and Consulting ProgramThe Fidelity Practice Management and Consulting Program is a multi-faceted client service that provides advisors access to a wide array of insights, best practices, strategic consulting services and business-oriented tools and programs to help accelerate business growth, maximize productivity and protect their practicesv.

Laura J. Riegel, Senior Counsel, at (202) 551-6873 or Dalia Osman Blass, Assistant Director, at (202) 551-6821 (Division of Investment Management, Office of Investment Company Regulation).
 
 
 
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained via the Commission's Web site by searching for the file number, or an applicant using the Company name box, at http://www.sec.gov/search/search.htm or by calling (202) 551-8090.
Applicants' Representations
1. Each Trust is formed as a business trust or limited liability company under the laws of Massachusetts or Delaware, as applicable. Each Trust is registered under the Act as an open-end management investment company.[2] 
           FMR Co., SAI or another FMR entity serves as investment adviser or sub-adviser to each of the Funds. FMR Co. and SAI are investment advisers registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”). Any investment adviser to the Funds will be registered under the Advisers Act.
2. The Prior Order permits the Funds to participate in a credit facility administered by FMR (the “IFL Program”). The IFL Program enables the Funds to lend money to each other for temporary purposes, such as when redemptions exceed anticipated levels. The IFL Program is designed both to reduce the cost of borrowing for the Funds and enhance the lending Funds' ability to earn higher rates of interest of investment on their short-term balances. The Prior Order requires that the interest rate for loans made through the IFL Program (the “IFL Rate”) be based on the average of: (a) the higher of the overnight time deposit rate (the “OTD Rate”) and the Funds' current overnight repurchase agreement rate (the “FICASH Rate”); [3] 
           and (b) a benchmark rate representing the lowest bank loan rate available for borrowing by the Funds (“Benchmark Rate”). The board of trustees (each, a “Fund Board” and collectively, the “Fund Boards”) of each Fund, including a majority of the trustees who are not “interested persons,” as defined in section 2(a)(19) of the Act, (“Independent Trustees”) establishes the Benchmark Rate, and, reviews, no less frequently than annually, the continuing appropriateness of the Benchmark Rate. The Benchmark Rate is currently set each day based on the average actual spread between the lowest quoted bank loan rate and the Federal Funds rate over the previous 60 days.
3. Applicants state that their business purposes and operational preferences over time have made inclusion of the OTD Rate in calculation of the IFL Rate unnecessary. Therefore, applicants seek to amend the Prior Order to eliminate the use of the OTD Rate in the IFL Rate calculation provided in conditions 1 and 2 (“Rate Conditions”). Applicants also request an exemption from section 17(a)(2) of the Act.
Applicants' Legal Analysis
1. Section 17(a)(3) of the Act generally prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or affiliated person of an affiliated person, from borrowing money or other property from the registered investment company. Section 21(b) of the Act generally prohibits any registered management company from lending money or other property to any person, directly or indirectly, if that person controls or is under common control with that company. Section 2(a)(3)(C) of the Act defines an “affiliated person” of another person, in part, to be any person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with, such other person. Section 2(a)(9) of the Act defines “control” as the “power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of a company,” but excludes circumstances in which “such power is solely the result of an official position with such company.” Because the Funds share a common investment adviser or have an investment adviser  that is under common control with those of the other Funds, applicants state that each Fund may be deemed to be under common control with all the other Funds, and, therefore, an affiliated person of those Funds.
2. Section 17(a)(1) of the Act generally prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of such a person, from selling securities or other property to the investment company. Section 17(a)(2) of the Act generally prohibits an affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of such a person, from purchasing securities or other property from the investment company. Section 12(d)(1) of the Act prohibits a registered investment company from purchasing or otherwise acquiring any security issued by any other investment company except in accordance with the limitations set forth in that section.
3. Section 18(f)(1) of the Act prohibits registered open-end investment companies from issuing any senior security except that a company is permitted to borrow from any bank, if immediately after the borrowing, there is asset coverage of at least 300 per centum for all borrowings of the company. Under section 18(g) of the Act, the term “senior security” generally includes any bond, debenture, note or similar obligation or instrument constituting a security and evidencing indebtedness.
4. Section 17(b) of the Act authorizes the Commission to exempt a proposed transaction from section 17(a) provided that the terms of the transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are fair and reasonable and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned, and the transaction is consistent with the policy of the investment company as recited in its registration statement and with the general purposes of the Act. Section 6(c) of the Act provides that an exemptive order may be granted where an exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Section 12(d)(1)(J) of the Act provides that the Commission may exempt persons or transactions from any provision of section 12(d)(1) if and to the extent such exception is consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors.
5. Section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 under the Act generally prohibit any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of an affiliated person, when acting as principal, from effecting any joint transaction in which the company participates unless the transaction is approved by the Commission. Rule 17d-1(b) provides that in passing upon applications filed under the rule, the Commission will consider whether the participation of a registered investment company in a joint enterprise on the basis proposed is consistent with the provisions, policies, and purposes of the Act and the extent to which the company's participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants.
6. Applicants request an order under (a) section 6(c) of the Act granting an exemption from sections 18(f) and 21(b) of the Act; (b) section 12(d)(1)(J) of the Act granting an exemption from section 12(d)(1) of the Act; (c) sections 6(c) and 17(b) of the Act granting an exemption from sections 17(a)(1), 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) of the Act; and (d) section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 under the Act to permit certain joint arrangements. The requested order would amend the Rate Conditions in the Prior Order and grant applicants an exemption from section 17(a)(2) of the Act.
7. As noted previously, applicants state that their business purposes and operational preferences over time have made inclusion of the OTD Rate in calculation of the IFL Rate unnecessary. Applicants state further that the IFL Rate, as amended, would make it more likely that lending Funds would receive a market rate of return in excess of other market alternatives and that borrowing Funds would not be harmed because they would only participate in the IFL Program if the IFL Rate is lower than the lowest quoted bank loan rate. Applicants state that the Rate Conditions will prove to be a more efficient means for achieving savings to the Funds in connection with their routine daily cash management activities and for providing Funds with alternative sources of liquidity in times of substantial net redemption activity.
8. Applicants also state that the IFL Program, as modified by the Rate Conditions, will not involve any potential that one Fund might receive a preferential interest rate to the disadvantage of another Fund. Applicants state that under the IFL Program, as modified by the Rate Conditions, rates will be set under a pre-established formula, approved by the Fund Boards. Applicants state that all Funds participating in the IFL Program, as revised by the Rate Conditions, on any given day will receive the same interest rate.
9. Applicants therefore submit that the modifications to the Rate Conditions are necessary or appropriate in the public interest, consistent with the protection of investors and the policy and provisions of the Act, and meet the standards set forth in sections 6(c), 12(d)(1)(J), 17(b) and 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 under the Act. Applicants represent that the transactions conducted subject to the Rate Conditions would be reasonable and fair, would not involve overreaching, and would be consistent with the investment policies of the Funds and with the general purposes of the Act. Applicants submit further that each Fund's participation in the IFL Program would be consistent with the provisions, policies and purposes of the Act, and would be on a basis which is no different from, or less advantageous than that of any other participant.
Applicants' Conditions
Applicants agree that any order of the Commission granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions:
1. The IFL Rate to be charged to the Funds under the IFL Program will be the average of: (a) the FICASH Rate and (b) the Benchmark Rate.
2. On each business day, the Cash Management Services Department (“Cash Management Department”) of Fidelity Service Company, Inc. will compare the IFL Rate calculated as provided in condition 1 with the FICASH Rate that day and all short-term borrowing rates quoted to any of the Funds by any bank with which any Fund has a loan agreement. At least three such quotations will be obtained each day in which any Fund borrows through the IFL Program prior to such borrowing. The Cash Management Department will make cash available for interfund loans only if the IFL Rate is more favorable to the lending Fund than the FICASH Rate and more favorable to the borrowing Fund than the lowest quoted bank loan rate.
3. If a Fund has outstanding borrowings, any interfund loans to the Fund (i) will be at an interest rate equal to or lower than any outstanding bank loan, (ii) will be secured at least on an equal priority basis with at least an equivalent percentage of collateral to loan value as any outstanding bank loan that requires collateral, (iii) will have a maturity no longer than any outstanding bank loan (and in any event not over seven days), and (iv) will provide that, if an event of default by the Fund occurs under any agreement evidencing an outstanding bank loan to the Fund, that event of default will automatically (without need for action or notice by the lending Fund) constitute an immediate event of default under the interfund  loan agreement entitling the lending Fund to call the loan (and exercise all rights with respect to any collateral) and that such call will be made if the lending bank exercises its right to call its loan under its agreement with the borrowing Fund.
4. A Fund may make an unsecured borrowing through the IFL Program if its outstanding borrowings from all sources immediately after the interfund borrowing total 10% or less of its total assets, provided that if the Fund has a secured loan outstanding from any other lender, including but not limited to another Fund, the Fund's interfund borrowing will be secured on at least an equal priority basis with at least an equivalent percentage of collateral to loan value as any outstanding loan that requires collateral. If a Fund's total outstanding borrowings immediately after an interfund borrowing would be greater than 10% of its total assets, the Fund may borrow through the IFL Program only on a secured basis. A Fund could not borrow through the IFL Program or from any other source if its total outstanding borrowings immediately after the interfund borrowing would be more than 331/3% of its total assets.
5. Before any Fund that has outstanding interfund borrowings may, through additional borrowings, cause its outstanding borrowings from all sources to exceed 10% of its total assets, the Fund must first secure each outstanding interfund loan by the pledge of segregated collateral with a market value at least equal to 102% of the outstanding principal value of the loan. If the total outstanding borrowings of a Fund with outstanding interfund loans exceed 10% of its total assets for any other reason (such as a decline in net asset value or because of shareholder redemptions), the Fund will within one business day thereafter (i) repay all its outstanding interfund loans, (ii) reduce its outstanding indebtedness to 10% or less of its total assets, or (iii) secure each outstanding interfund loan by the pledge of segregated collateral with a market value at least equal to 102% of the outstanding principal value of the loan until the Fund's total outstanding borrowings cease to exceed 10% of its total assets, at which time the collateral called for by this condition shall no longer be required. Until each interfund loan that is outstanding at any time that a Fund's total outstanding borrowings exceed 10% is repaid or the Fund's total outstanding borrowings cease to exceed 10% of its total assets, the Fund will mark the value of the collateral to market each day and will pledge such additional collateral as is necessary to maintain the market value of the collateral that secures each outstanding interfund loan at least equal to 102% of the outstanding principal value of the interfund loan.
6. No Fund may lend to another Fund through the IFL Program if the loan would cause its aggregate outstanding loans through the IFL Program to exceed 15% of the lending Fund's current net assets at the time of the loan.
7. A Fund's interfund loans to any one Fund shall not exceed 5% of the lending Fund's net assets.
8. The duration of interfund loans will be limited to the time required to receive payment for securities sold, but in no event more than seven days. Loans effected within seven days of each other will be treated as separate loan transactions for purposes of this condition.
9. Each interfund loan may be called on one business day's notice by a lending Fund and may be repaid on any day by a borrowing Fund.
10. A Fund's participation in the IFL Program must be consistent with its investment objectives and limitations and organizational documents. No Fund may borrow through the IFL Program unless the Fund has a fundamental policy that prevents the Fund from borrowing for other than temporary or emergency purposes (and not for leveraging), except that certain Funds may engage in reverse repurchase agreements for any purpose.
11. The Cash Management Department will calculate total Fund borrowing and lending demand through the IFL Program, and allocate loans on an equitable basis among the Funds, without the intervention of any portfolio manager of the Funds. The Cash Management Department will not solicit cash for the IFL Program from any Fund or prospectively publish or disseminate loan demand data to portfolio managers. Cash amounts remaining after satisfaction of borrowing demand will be invested in FICASH, or in shares of one or more money market funds that are advised by FMR Co. or another FMR entity, or will be returned to be invested directly by the portfolio managers of the Funds.
12. FMR will monitor the IFL Rate and the other terms and conditions of the interfund loans and will make a quarterly report to the Fund Boards concerning the participation of the Funds in the IFL Program and the terms and other conditions of any extensions of credit under the IFL Program.
13. Each Fund Board, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, will: 
(a) Review, no less frequently than quarterly, each Fund's participation in the IFL Program during the preceding quarter for compliance with the conditions of any order permitting such transactions, 
(b) Establish the Benchmark Rate formula used to determine the interest rate on interfund loans, and review, no less frequently than annually, the continuing appropriateness of the Benchmark Rate formula, and 
(c) Review, no less frequently than annually, the continuing appropriateness of each Fund's participation in the IFL Program.
14. In the event an interfund loan is not paid according to its terms and such default is not cured within two business days from its maturity or from the time the lending Fund makes a demand for payment under the provisions of the interfund loan agreement, FMR will promptly refer such loan for arbitration to an independent arbitrator selected by each Fund Board involved in the loan who will serve as arbitrator of disputes concerning interfund loans.[4] 
           The arbitrator will resolve any problem promptly, and the arbitrator's decision will be binding on both Funds. The arbitrator will submit, at least annually, a written report to the Fund Boards setting forth a description of the nature of any dispute and the actions taken by the Funds to resolve the dispute.
15. Each Fund will maintain and preserve, for a period of not less than six years from the end of the fiscal year in which any transaction by it under the IFL Program occurred, the first two years in an easily accessible place, written records of all such transactions setting forth a description of the terms of the transactions, including the amount, the maturity and the IFL Rate, the rate of interest available at the time on overnight repurchase agreements and commercial bank borrowings, and such other information presented to the Fund's respective Fund Board in connection with the review required by conditions 12 and 13.
16. Each Fund's independent auditors, in connection with their audit examination of the Fund, will review the operation of the IFL Program for compliance with the conditions of the application and their review will form the basis, in part, of the auditor's report on internal accounting controls in Form N-SAR. Applicants will report on the operations of the IFL Program at the Fund Board meetings on a quarterly basis. 

17. No Fund will be permitted to participate in the IFL Program unless the Fund has fully disclosed in its prospectus and/or statement of additional information all material facts about its intended participation.

 
For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority.
Kevin O'Neill,
Deputy Secretary.

	Fund Summary





	Investment Summary







	Investment Objective





	Institutional Short-Intermediate Government Fund

	seeks a high level of current income consistent with preserving principal.







	Principal Investment Strategies




	Fidelity Management & Research Company (FMR)'s principal investment strategies include:



	Normally investing at least <R>80%</R> ofassets in U.S. Government securities <R>and repurchase agreements for those securities</R>.

	Investing in instruments related to U.S. Government securities.

	Managing the fund to have similar overall interest rate risk to an index, which as of November 30, <R>2001</R>, was the Lehman Brothers 1-5
	Year U.S. Government Bond Index.

	Normally maintaining a dollar-weighted average maturity between two and five years.

	Allocating assets across different market sectors and maturities.

	Analyzing a security's structural features and current pricing, trading opportunities, and the credit quality of its issuer to select investments.







	Principal Investment Risks




	The fund is subject to the following principal investment risks:




	Interest Rate Changes.

	Interest rate increases can cause the price of a debt security to decrease.


	Prepayment.

	The ability of an issuer of a debt security to repay principal prior to a security's maturity can cause greater price volatility if interest
	rates change.


	Issuer-Specific Changes.

	The value of an individual security or particular type of security can be more volatile than the market as a whole and can
	perform differently from the value of the market as a whole.


	An investment in the fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other
	government agency.


	When you sell your shares of the fund, they could be worth more or less than what you paid for them.








	Performance



	The following information illustrates the changes in the fund's performance from year to year and compares the fund's performance to the performance
	of a market index and an average of the performance of similar funds over various periods of time. Returns are based on past results and are not an
	indication of future performance.

	seeks a high level of current income in a manner consistent with preserving principal.







	Principal Investment Strategies




	FMR normally invests the fund's assets in U.S. Government securities and instruments related to U.S. Government securities. FMR normally invests at least
	<R>80%</R> of the fund'sassets in U.S. Government securities <R>and repurchase agreements for those securities</R>. FMR does not currently intend
	to invest more than 40% of the fund's assets in mortgage securities.


	FMR uses an index that represents the market for the types of securities in which the fund invests as a guide in structuring the fund and selecting its
	investments. FMR manages the fund to have similar overall interest rate risk to the index. As of November 30, <R>2001</R>, FMR was using the
	Lehman Brothers 1-5 Year U.S. Government Bond Index in managing the fund's investments. In addition, the fund normally maintains a dollar-weighted
	average maturity between two and five years. As of November 30, <R>2001</R>, the <R>fund's</R> dollar-weighted average maturity <R>was
	approximately 3.0 years</R> and the <R>index's dollar-weighted average maturity</R> was approximately <R>2.6 years.</R> In determining a
	security's maturity for purposes of calculating the fund's average maturity, an estimate of the average time for its principal to be paid may be used. This
	can be substantially shorter than its stated maturity.


	FMR allocates the fund's assets among different market sectors (for example, U.S. Treasury or U.S. Government agency securities) and different
	maturities based on its view of the relative value of each sector or maturity.


	In buying and selling securities for the fund, FMR analyzes a security's structural features and current price compared to its estimated long-term value,
	any short-term trading opportunities resulting from market inefficiencies, and the credit quality of its issuer.


	FMR may use various techniques, such as buying and selling futures contracts <R>and exchange traded funds</R>, to increase or decrease the
	fund's exposure to changing security prices, interest rates, or other factors that affect security values. If FMR's strategies do not work as intended,
	the fund may not achieve its objective.




	Description of Principal Security Types





	Debt securities

	are used by issuers to borrow money. The issuer usually pays a fixed, variable, or floating rate of interest, and must repay the amount
	borrowed at the maturity of the security. Some debt securities, such as zero coupon bonds, do not pay current interest but are sold at a discount from
	their face values.



	U.S. Government securities

	are high-quality securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury or by an agency or instrumentality of the U.S.
	Government. U.S. Government securities may be backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Treasury, the right to borrow from the U.S. Treasury, or
	the agency or instrumentality issuing or guaranteeing the security. U.S. Government securities include mortgage and other asset-backed securities.

	Fund Basics - continued



	<R>A

	</R>repurchase agreement

	is an agreement to buy a security at one price and a simultaneous agreement to sell it back at an agreed-upon price.




	Principal Investment Risks




	Many factors affect the fund's performance. The fund's yield and share price change daily based on changes in interest rates and market conditions and
	in response to other economic, political, or financial developments. The fund's reaction to these developments will be affected by the types and
	maturities of securities in which the fund invests, the financial condition, industry and economic sector, and geographic location of an issuer, and the
	fund's level of investment in the securities of that issuer. It is important to note that neither the fund's share price nor its yield is guaranteed by the
	U.S. Government. When you sell your shares of the fund, they could be worth more or less than what you paid for them.


	The following factors can significantly affect the fund's performance:



	Interest Rate Changes.

	Debt securities have varying levels of sensitivity to changes in interest rates. In general, the price of a debt security can fall
	when interest rates rise and can rise when interest rates fall. Securities with longer maturities and mortgage securities can be more sensitive to
	interest rate changes. In other words, the longer the maturity of a security, the greater the impact a change in interest rates could have on the
	security's price. In addition, short-term and long-term interest rates do not necessarily move in the same amount or the same direction. Short-term
	securities tend to react to changes in short-term interest rates, and long-term securities tend to react to changes in long-term interest rates.



	Prepayment.

	Many types of debt securities, including mortgage securities, are subject to prepayment risk. Prepayment occurs when the issuer of a
	security can repay principal prior to the security's maturity. Securities subject to prepayment can offer less potential for gains during a declining
	interest rate environment and similar or greater potential for loss in a rising interest rate environment. In addition, the potential impact of prepayment
	features on the price of a debt security can be difficult to predict and result in greater volatility.



	Issuer-Specific Changes.

	Changes in the financial condition of an issuer, changes in specific economic or political conditions that affect a particular
	type of security or issuer, and changes in general economic or political conditions can affect the credit quality or value of an issuer's securities.


	In response to market, economic, political, or other conditions, FMR may temporarily use a different investment strategy for defensive purposes. If FMR
	does so, different factors could affect the fund's performance and the fund may not achieve its investment objective.

	Fund Basics - continued




	Fundamental Investment Policies



	The policy discussed below is fundamental, that is, subject to change only by shareholder approval.



	Institutional Short-Intermediate Government Fund

	seeks a high level of current income in a manner consistent with preserving principal.



	<R>Shareholder Notice</R>



	<R>The following policy is subject to change only upon 60 days' prior notice to shareholders:</R>


	<R>

	</R>Institutional Short-Intermediate Government Fund

	normally invests at least 80% of its assets in U.S. Government securities and
	repurchase agreements for those securities.








	Valuing Shares



	The fund is open for business each day the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is open.


	The fund's net asset value per share (NAV) is the value of a single share. Fidelity normally calculates the fund's NAV as of the close of business of the
	NYSE, normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time. However, NAV may be calculated earlier if trading on the NYSE is restricted or as permitted by the Securities and
	Exchange Commission (SEC).


	The fund's assets are valued as of this time for the purpose of computing the fund's NAV.


	To the extent that the fund's assets are traded in other markets on days when the fund is <R>not open for business</R>, the value of the fund's assets
	may be affected on <R>those days</R>. In addition, trading in some of the fund's assets may not occur on days when the fund is open for business.


	The fund's assets are valued primarily on the basis of information furnished by a pricing service or market quotations. Certain short-term securities are
	valued on the basis of amortized cost. If market quotations or information furnished by a pricing service is not readily available or does not accurately
	reflect fair value for a security or if a security's value has been materially affected by events occurring after the close of the exchange or market on
	which the security is principally traded, that security may be valued by another method that the Board of Trustees believes accurately reflects fair
	value. A security's valuation may differ depending on the method used for determining value.

	Buying Shares



	The


	price to buy


	one share of the fund is the fund's NAV. The fund's shares are sold without a sales charge.


	Your shares will be bought at the next NAV calculated after your order is received in proper form.


	Short-term or excessive trading into and out of the fund may harm performance by disrupting portfolio management strategies and by increasing
	expenses. Accordingly, the fund may reject any purchase orders, including exchanges, particularly from market timers or investors who, in FMR's
	opinion, have a pattern of short-term or excessive trading or whose trading has been or may be disruptive to the fund. For these purposes, FMR may
	consider an investor's trading history in the fund or other Fidelity funds, and accounts under common ownership or control.


	The fund may stop offering shares completely or may offer shares only on a limited basis, for a period of time or permanently.


	When you place an order to buy shares, note the following:



	All of your purchases must be made in U.S. dollars and checks must be drawn on U.S. banks.

	Fidelity does not accept cash.

	When making a purchase with more than one check, each check must have a value of at least $50.

	Fidelity reserves the right


	to limit the number of checks processed at one time.

	If your check does not clear, your purchase will be canceled and you could be liable for any losses or fees the fund or Fidelity has incurred.


	Shares can be bought or sold through investment professionals using an automated order placement and settlement system that guarantees payment
	for orders on a specified date.


	Certain financial institutions that meet creditworthiness criteria established by Fidelity Distributors Corporation (FDC) may enter confirmed purchase
	orders on behalf of customers by phone, with payment to follow no later than close of business on the next business day. If payment is not received by that
	time, the order will be canceled and the financial institution will be liable for any losses.

	However, you should note the following policies and restrictions governing exchanges:



	The fund may temporarily or permanently terminate the exchange privilege of any investor who makes more than four exchanges out of the fund
	per calendar year. Accounts under common ownership or control will be counted together for purposes of the four exchange limit.

	The exchange limit may be modified for accounts held by certain institutional retirement plans to conform to plan exchange limits and Department of
	Labor regulations. See your <R>retirement</R> plan materials for further information.

	The fund may refuse exchange purchases by any person or group if, in FMR's judgment, the fund would be unable to invest the money effectively in
	accordance with its investment objective and policies, or would otherwise potentially be adversely affected.

	Before exchanging into a fund, read its prospectus.

	The fund you are exchanging into must be available for sale in your state.





	Prospectus






	Shareholder Information - continued




	Exchanges may have tax consequences for you.

	<R>If you are exchanging between accounts that are not registered in the same name, address, and taxpayer identification number, there may be
	additional requirements.</R>


	The fund may terminate or modify the exchange privilege in the future.


	Other funds may have different exchange restrictions, and may impose trading fees of up to 2.00% of the amount exchanged. Check each fund's
	prospectus for details.





	Account Features and Policies






	Features



	The following feature is available to buy and sell shares of the fund.







	Wire



	To purchase and sell shares via the Federal Reserve Wire System.









	You must sign up for the wire feature before using it.

	To sell shares by wire, you must designate the U.S. commercial bank account(s) into which you wish the redemption proceeds deposited.

	To add the wire feature or to change the bank account designated to receive redemption proceeds at any time prior to making a redemption request, you should send a letter of instruction, including a
	signature guarantee, to Fidelity at the address found in "General Information."








	Policies



	The following policies apply to you as a shareholder.



	Statements and reports

	that Fidelity sends to you include the following:



	Confirmation statements (after transactions affecting your account balance except reinvestment of distributions in the fund).

	Monthly or quarterly account statements (detailing account balances and all transactions completed during the prior month or quarter).

	Financial reports (every six months).


	To reduce expenses, only one copy of most financial reports and prospectuses <R>may</R> be mailed, <R>even if more than one person in a
	household holds shares of the fund</R>. Call Fidelity at 1-888-622-3175 if you need additional copies of financial reports or prospectuses. If you do not
	want the mailing of these documents to be combined with those for other members of your household, call Fidelity at 1-877-208-0098.


	You may initiate many

	transactions by telephone or electronically.

	Fidelity will not be responsible for any losses resulting from unauthorized
	transactions if it follows reasonable security procedures designed to verify the identity of the investor. Fidelity will request personalized security codes
	or other information, and may also record calls. For transactions conducted through the Internet, Fidelity recommends the use of an Internet
	browser with 128-bit encryption. You should verify the accuracy of your confirmation statements immediately after you receive them. If you do not
	want the ability to sell and exchange by telephone, call Fidelity for instructions. Additional documentation may be required from corporations,
	associations, and certain fiduciaries.





	Prospectus






	Shareholder Information - continued



	When you sign your

	account application,

	you will be asked to certify that your social security or taxpayer identification number is correct and that
	you are not subject to 31% backup withholding for failing to report income to the IRS. If you violate IRS regulations, the IRS can require the fund to
	withhold 31% of your taxable distributions and redemptions.


	If your

	account balance

	falls below $40,000 (<R>$500 for retirement accounts) for any reason, including solely due to declines in the fund's NAV,</R>
	you will be given 30 days' notice to reestablish the minimum balance. If you do not increase your balance, Fidelity may close your account and send the
	proceeds to you. Your shares will be sold at the NAV on the day your account is closed. Accounts not subject to account minimums will not be closed for
	failure to maintain a minimum balance.


	Fidelity may charge a

	fee for certain services,

	such as providing historical account documents.








	Dividends and Capital Gain Distributions



	The fund earns interest, dividends, and other income from its investments, and distributes this income (less expenses) to shareholders as dividends.
	The fund also realizes capital gains from its investments, and distributes these gains (less any losses) to shareholders as capital gain distributions.


	The fund normally declares dividends daily and pays them monthly. The fund normally pays capital gain distributions in December and January.



	Earning Dividends



	Shares purchased by an automated purchase order begin to earn dividends on the day your payment is received.


	Shares purchased by a confirmed purchase order begin to earn dividends on the first business day following the day your payment is received.


	Shares purchased by all other purchase orders begin to earn dividends on the first business day following the day of purchase.


	Shares earn dividends until, but not including, the next business day following the day of redemption.





	Distribution Options



	When you open an account, specify on your application how you want to receive your distributions. The following <R>distribution</R> options
	<R>are</R> available for the <R>fund</R>:



	1. Reinvestment Option.

	Your dividends and capital gain distributions will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of the fund. If you do not
	indicate a choice on your application, you will be assigned this option.





	Prospectus






	Shareholder Information - continued




	2. Income-Earned Option.

	Your capital gain distributions will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of the fund. Your dividends will be paid
	in cash.



	3. Cash Option.

	Your dividends and capital gain distributions will be paid in cash.


	Not all distribution options are available for every account. If the option you prefer is not listed on your account application, or if you want to change
	your current option, call Fidelity.


	If you elect to receive distributions paid in cash by check and the U.S. Postal Service does not deliver your checks, your distribution option may be
	converted to the Reinvestment Option. You will not receive interest on amounts represented by uncashed distribution checks.





	Tax Consequences



	As with any investment, your investment in the fund could have tax consequences for you. If you are not investing through a tax-advantaged retirement
	account, you should consider these tax consequences.



	Taxes on distributions.

	Distributions you receive from the fund are subject to federal income tax, and may also be subject to state or local taxes.


	For federal tax purposes, <R>certain of the fund's distributions, including</R> dividends and distributions of short-term capital gains<R>,</R> are
	taxable to you as ordinary income, while <R>certain of the fund's distributions, including</R> distributions of long-term capital gains<R>,</R> are
	taxable to you generally as capital gains.


	If a fund's distributions exceed its income and capital gains realized in any year, all or a portion of those distributions may be treated as a return of
	capital to shareholders for tax purposes. A return of capital generally will not be taxable to you but will reduce the cost basis of your shares and result
	in a higher reported capital gain or a lower reported capital loss when you sell your shares.


	If you buy shares when a fund has realized but not yet distributed income or capital gains, you will be "buying a dividend" by paying the full price for
	the shares and then receiving a portion of the price back in the form of a taxable distribution.


	Any taxable distributions you receive from the fund will normally be taxable to you when you receive them, regardless of your distribution option. If you
	elect to receive distributions in cash, you will receive certain December distributions in January, but those distributions will be taxable as if you
	received them on December 31.



	Taxes on transactions.

	Your redemptions, including exchanges, may result in a capital gain or loss for federal tax purposes. A capital gain or loss on
	your investment in the fund generally is the difference between the cost of your shares and the price you receive when you sell them.

	Fund Services








	Fund Management



	Institutional Short-Intermediate Government is a


	mutual fund, an investment that pools shareholders' money and invests it toward a specified goal.


	FMR is the fund's manager.


	As of <R>January 31, 2001</R>, FMR <R>and its affiliate, FMR Co., Inc.</R>, had approximately $612 billion in discretionary assets under
	management.


	As the manager, FMR is responsible for choosing the fund's investments and handling its business affairs.


	Fidelity Investments Money Management, Inc. (FIMM), in Merrimack, New Hampshire, serves as a sub-adviser for the fund. FIMM is primarily
	responsible for choosing investments for the fund.


	FIMM is an affiliate of FMR. As of <R>January 31, 2001</R>, FIMM had approximately $300 billion in discretionary assets under management.


	<R>Andrew Dudley is vice president and manager of Institutional Short-Intermediate Government, which he has managed since December 1998.
	He also manages other Fidelity funds. Mr. Dudley joined Fidelity in 1996 as a portfolio manager.</R>


	From time to time a manager, analyst, or other Fidelity employee may express views regarding a particular company, security, industry, or market sector.
	The views expressed by any such person are the views of only that individual as of the time expressed and do not necessarily represent the views of
	Fidelity or any other person in the Fidelity organization. Any such views are subject to change at any time based upon market or other conditions and
	Fidelity disclaims any responsibility to update such views. These views may not be relied on as investment advice and, because investment decisions for a
	Fidelity fund are based on numerous factors, may not be relied on as an indication of trading intent on behalf of any Fidelity fund.


	The fund pays a management fee to FMR. The management fee is calculated and paid to FMR every month. FMR pays all of the other expenses of the
	fund with limited exceptions.


	The fund's annual management fee rate is 0.45% of its average net assets.


	FMR pays FIMM for providing sub-advisory services.


	FMR may, from time to time, agree to reimburse the fund for management fees above a specified limit. FMR retains the ability to be repaid by the fund if
	expenses fall below the specified limit prior to the end of the fiscal year. Reimbursement arrangements, which may be discontinued by FMR at any time,
	can decrease the fund's expenses and boost its performance.





	Fund Distribution



	FDC distributes the fund's shares.


	The fund has adopted a Distribution and Service Plan pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 that recognizes that FMR may
	use its management fee revenues, as well as its past profits or its resources from any other source, to pay FDC for expenses incurred in connection with
	providing services intended to result in the sale of fund shares and/or shareholder support services. FMR, directly or through FDC, may pay significant
	amounts to intermediaries, such as banks, broker-dealers, and other service-providers, that provide those services. Currently, the Board of Trustees of
	the fund has authorized such payments.





	Prospectus






	Fund Services - continued



	If payments made by FMR to FDC or to intermediaries under the Distribution and Service Plan were considered to be paid out of the fund's assets on
	an ongoing basis, they might increase the cost of your investment and might cost you more than paying other types of sales charges.


	To receive payments made pursuant to a Distribution and Service Plan, intermediaries must sign the appropriate agreement with FDC in advance.


	FMR may allocate brokerage transactions in a manner that takes into account the sale of shares of the fund, provided that the fund receives brokerage
	services and commission rates comparable to those of other broker-dealers.


	No dealer, sales representative, or any other person has been authorized to give any information or to make any representations, other than those
	contained in this prospectus and in the related statement of additional information (SAI), in connection with the offer contained in this prospectus. If
	given or made, such other information or representations must not be relied upon as having been authorized by the fund or FDC. This prospectus and
	the related SAI do not constitute an offer by the fund or by FDC to sell shares of the fund to or to buy shares of the fund from any person to whom it is
	unlawful to make such offer.

	Appendix







	Financial Highlights



	The financial highlights table is intended to help you understand the fund's financial history for the past 5 years. Certain information reflects financial
	results for a single fund share. The total returns in the table represent the rate that an investor would have earned (or lost) on an investment in the
	fund (assuming reinvestment of all dividends and distributions). This information has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent
	accountants, whose report, along with the fund's financial highlights and financial statements, is included in the fund's annual report. A free copy of the

	INVESTMENT POLICIES AND LIMITATIONS




	The following policies and limitations supplement those set forth in the prospectus. Unless otherwise noted, whenever an investment policy or
	limitation states a maximum percentage of the fund's assets that may be invested in any security or other asset, or sets forth a policy regarding quality
	standards, such standard or percentage limitation will be determined immediately after and as a result of the fund's acquisition of such security or other
	asset. Accordingly, any subsequent change in values, net assets, or other circumstances will not be considered when determining whether the
	investment complies with the fund's investment policies and limitations.


	The fund's fundamental investment policies and limitations cannot be changed without approval by a "majority of the outstanding voting
	securities" (as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act)) of the fund. However, except for the fundamental investment
	limitations listed below, the investment policies and limitations described in this SAI are not fundamental and may be changed without shareholder
	approval.



	The following are the fund's fundamental investment limitations set forth in their entirety. The fund may not:



	(1) with respect to 75% of the fund's total assets, purchase the securities of any issuer (other than securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S.
	Government or any of its agencies or instrumentalities, or securities of other investment companies) if, as a result, (a) more than 5% of the fund's total
	assets would be invested in the securities of that issuer, or (b) the fund would hold more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of that issuer;


	(2) issue senior securities, except in connection with the insurance program established by the fund pursuant to an exemptive order issued by the
	Securities and Exchange Commission or as otherwise permitted under the Investment Company Act of 1940;


	(3) borrow money, except that the fund may borrow money for temporary or emergency purposes (not for leveraging or investment) in an amount
	not exceeding 33 1/3% of its total assets (including the amount borrowed) less liabilities (other than borrowings). Any borrowings that come to exceed
	this amount will be reduced within three days (not including Sundays and holidays) to the extent necessary to comply with the 33 1/3% limitation;


	(4) underwrite securities issued by others, except to the extent that the fund may be considered an underwriter within the meaning of the Securities
	Act of 1933 in the disposition of restricted securities;


	(5) purchase the securities of any issuer (other than securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government or any of its agencies or
	instrumentalities) if, as a result, more than 25% of the fund's total assets would be invested in the securities of companies whose principal business
	activities are in the same industry;


	(6) purchase or sell real estate unless acquired as a result of ownership of securities or other instruments (but this shall not prevent the fund from
	investing in securities or other instruments backed by real estate or securities of companies engaged in the real estate business);


	(7) purchase or sell physical commodities unless acquired as a result of ownership of securities or other instruments (but this shall not prevent the
	fund from purchasing or selling options and futures contracts or from investing in securities or other instruments backed by physical commodities); or


	(8) lend any security or make any loan if, as a result, more than 33 1/3% of its total assets would be lent to other parties (but this limitation does not
	apply to purchases of debt securities or to repurchase agreements).


	(9) The fund may, notwithstanding any other fundamental investment policy or limitation, invest all of its assets in the securities of a single
	open-end management investment company with substantially the same fundamental investment objective, policies, and limitations as the fund.



	The following investment limitations are not fundamental and may be changed without shareholder approval.



	(i) The fund does not currently intend to sell securities short, unless it owns or has the right to obtain securities at no additional cost (other than
	ancillary transaction and settlement costs) equivalent in kind and amount to the securities sold short, and provided that transactions in futures contracts
	and options are not deemed to constitute selling securities short.


	(ii) The fund does not currently intend to purchase securities on margin, except that the fund may obtain such short-term credits as are necessary for
	the clearance of transactions, and provided that margin payments in connection with futures contracts and options on futures contracts shall not constitute
	purchasing securities on margin.


	(iii) The fund may borrow money only (a) from a bank or from a registered investment company or portfolio for which FMR or an affiliate serves
	as investment adviser or (b) by engaging in reverse repurchase agreements with any party (reverse repurchase agreements are treated as borrowings
	for purposes of fundamental investment limitation (3)).


	(iv) The fund does not currently intend to purchase any security if, as a result, more than 10% of its net assets would be invested in securities that are
	deemed to be illiquid because they are subject to legal or contractual restrictions on resale or because they cannot be sold or disposed of in the ordinary
	course of business at approximately the prices at which they are valued.


	(v) The fund does not currently intend to lend assets other than securities to other parties, except by (a) lending money (up to 15% of the fund's
	net assets) to a registered investment company or portfolio for which FMR or an affiliate serves as investment adviser or (b) acquiring loans, loan
	participations, or other forms of direct debt instruments and, in connection therewith, assuming any associated unfunded commitments of the sellers.
	(This limitation does not apply to purchases of debt securities or to repurchase agreements.)


	(vi) The fund does not currently intend to invest all of its assets in the securities of a single open-end management investment company with
	substantially the same fundamental investment objective, policies, and limitations as the fund.


	With respect to limitation (iv), if through a change in values, net assets, or other circumstances, the fund were in a position where more than 10% of
	its net assets were invested in illiquid securities, it would consider appropriate steps to protect liquidity.


	For the fund's limitations on futures and options transactions, see the section entitled "Limitations on Futures and Options Transactions" on page

	<Click Here>

	.


	<R>The fund has been advised that the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) does not consider proprietary strips of securities
	issued by the U.S. Government or its agencies or instrumentalities, and privately sponsored collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) backed by
	the U.S. Government or its agencies or instrumentalities to be U.S. Government securities for purposes of investment limitation (5). Accordingly, the
	fund may establish the following four industry groups: (1) custodian banks for proprietary strips of obligations of the U.S. Government and its
	agencies and instrumentalities that are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government; (2) custodian banks for proprietary strips of
	obligations of the U.S. Government and its agencies and instrumentalities that are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government; (3)
	custodian banks for CMOs that are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government; (4) custodian banks for CMOs that are backed by U.S.
	Government agencies and instrumentalities but not by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. If the fund concludes that, under applicable
	legal principles, any of these securities is a U.S. Government security, it will exclude the security from investment limitation (5). </R>


	The following pages contain more detailed information about types of instruments in which the fund may invest, strategies Fidelity Management &
	Research Company (FMR) may employ in pursuit of the fund's investment objective, and a summary of related risks. FMR may not buy all of these
	instruments or use all of these techniques unless it believes that doing so will help the fund achieve its goal.




	Affiliated Bank Transactions.


	A fund may engage in transactions with financial institutions that are, or may be considered to be, "affiliated
	persons" of the fund under the 1940 Act. These transactions may involve repurchase agreements with custodian banks; short-term obligations of, and
	repurchase agreements with, the 50 largest U.S. banks (measured by deposits); municipal securities; U.S. Government securities with affiliated
	financial institutions that are primary dealers in these securities; short-term currency transactions; and short-term borrowings. In accordance with
	exemptive orders issued by the SEC, the Board of Trustees has established and periodically reviews procedures applicable to transactions involving
	affiliated financial institutions.




	Borrowing.


	The fund may borrow from banks or from other funds advised by FMR or its affiliates, or through reverse repurchase agreements. If
	the fund borrows money, its share price may be subject to greater fluctuation until the borrowing is paid off. If the fund makes additional investments
	while borrowings are outstanding, this may be considered a form of leverage.




	Cash Management.


	A fund can hold uninvested cash or can invest it in cash equivalents such as money market securities, repurchase
	agreements<R>,</R> or shares of money market <R>or short-term bond funds</R>. Generally, these securities offer less potential for gains than other
	types of securities.




	Central Funds


	are money market <R>or short-term bond</R> funds managed by FMR or its affiliates<R>. The money market central funds
	</R>seek to earn a high level of current income (free from federal income tax in the case of a municipal money market fund) while maintaining a
	stable $1.00 share price. The <R>money market central </R>funds comply with industry-standard requirements for money market funds regarding
	the quality, maturity, and diversification of their investments. The short-term bond central funds seek to obtain a high level of current income
	consistent with preservation of capital.




	Dollar-Weighted Average Maturity


	is derived by multiplying the value of each investment by the time remaining to its maturity, adding these
	calculations, and then dividing the total by the value of the fund's portfolio. An obligation's maturity is typically determined on a stated final maturity
	basis, although there are some exceptions to this rule.


	For example, if it is probable that the issuer of an instrument will take advantage of a maturity-shortening device, such as a call, refunding, or
	redemption provision, the date on which the instrument will probably be called, refunded, or redeemed may be considered to be its maturity date.
	Also, the maturities of mortgage securities, including collateralized mortgage obligations, and some asset-backed securities are determined on a
	weighted average life basis, which is the average time for principal to be repaid. For a mortgage security, this average time is calculated by estimating
	the timing of principal payments, including unscheduled prepayments, during the life of the mortgage. The weighted average life of these securities is
	likely to be substantially shorter than their stated final maturity.




	Futures and Options.


	The following paragraphs pertain to futures and options: Combined Positions, Correlation of Price Changes, Futures
	Contracts, Futures Margin Payments, Limitations on Futures and Options Transactions, Liquidity of Options and Futures Contracts, OTC Options,
	Purchasing Put and Call Options, and Writing Put and Call Options.



	Combined Positions

	involve purchasing and writing options in combination with each other, or in combination with futures or forward contracts,
	to adjust the risk and return characteristics of the overall position. For example, purchasing a put option and writing a call option on the same
	underlying instrument would construct a combined position whose risk and return characteristics are similar to selling a futures contract. Another
	possible combined position would involve writing a call option at one strike price and buying a call option at a lower price, to reduce the risk of the
	written call option in the event of a substantial price increase. Because combined options positions involve multiple trades, they result in higher
	transaction costs and may be more difficult to open and close out.



	Correlation of Price Changes.

	Because there are a limited number of types of exchange-traded options and futures contracts, it is likely that the
	standardized contracts available will not match a fund's current or anticipated investments exactly. A fund may invest in options and futures contracts
	based on securities with different issuers, maturities, or other characteristics from the securities in which the fund typically invests, which involves a
	risk that the options or futures position will not track the performance of the fund's other investments.


	Options and futures prices can also diverge from the prices of their underlying instruments, even if the underlying instruments match a fund's
	investments well. Options and futures prices are affected by such factors as current and anticipated short-term interest rates, changes in volatility of the
	underlying instrument, and the time remaining until expiration of the contract, which may not affect security prices the same way. Imperfect
	correlation may also result from differing levels of demand in the options and futures markets and the securities markets, from structural differences in
	how options and futures and securities are traded, or from imposition of daily price fluctuation limits or trading halts. A fund may purchase or sell
	options and futures contracts with a greater or lesser value than the securities it wishes to hedge or intends to purchase in order to attempt to
	compensate for differences in volatility between the contract and the securities, although this may not be successful in all cases. If price changes in a
	fund's options or futures positions are poorly correlated with its other investments, the positions may fail to produce anticipated gains or result in
	losses that are not offset by gains in other investments.



	Futures Contracts.

	In purchasing a futures contract, the buyer agrees to purchase a specified underlying instrument at a specified future date. In
	selling a futures contract, the seller agrees to sell a specified underlying instrument at a specified future date. The price at which the purchase and sale
	will take place is fixed when the buyer and seller enter into the contract. Some currently available futures contracts are based on specific securities,
	such as U.S. Treasury bonds or notes, and some are based on indices of securities prices. Futures can be held until their delivery dates, or can be closed
	out before then if a liquid secondary market is available.


	The value of a futures contract tends to increase and decrease in tandem with the value of its underlying instrument. Therefore, purchasing futures
	contracts will tend to increase a fund's exposure to positive and negative price fluctuations in the underlying instrument, much as if it had purchased
	the underlying instrument directly. When a fund sells a futures contract, by contrast, the value of its futures position will tend to move in a direction
	contrary to the market. Selling futures contracts, therefore, will tend to offset both positive and negative market price changes, much as if the
	underlying instrument had been sold.



	Futures Margin Payments.

	The purchaser or seller of a futures contract is not required to deliver or pay for the underlying instrument unless the
	contract is held until the delivery date. However, both the purchaser and seller are required to deposit "initial margin" with a futures broker, known as a
	futures commission merchant (FCM), when the contract is entered into. Initial margin deposits are typically equal to a percentage of the contract's value.
	If the value of either party's position declines, that party will be required to make additional "variation margin" payments to settle the change in value on a
	daily basis. The party that has a gain may be entitled to receive all or a portion of this amount. Initial and variation margin payments do not constitute
	purchasing securities on margin for purposes of a fund's investment limitations. In the event of the bankruptcy of an FCM that holds margin on behalf of a
	fund, the fund may be entitled to return of margin owed to it only in proportion to the amount received by the FCM's other customers, potentially resulting
	in losses to the fund.





	Limitations on Futures and Options Transactions.

	The fund has filed a notice of eligibility for exclusion from the definition of the term
	"commodity pool operator" with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the National Futures Association, which regulate trading
	in the futures markets. The fund intends to comply with Rule 4.5 under the Commodity Exchange Act, which limits the extent to which the fund can
	commit assets to initial margin deposits and option premiums.


	In addition, the fund will not: (a) sell futures contracts, purchase put options, or write call options if, as a result, more than 25% of the fund's total
	assets would be hedged with futures and options under normal conditions; (b) purchase futures contracts or write put options if, as a result, the fund's
	total obligations upon settlement or exercise of purchased futures contracts and written put options would exceed 25% of its total assets; or (c)
	purchase call options if, as a result, the current value of option premiums for call options purchased by the fund would exceed 5% of the fund's total
	assets. These limitations do not apply to options attached to or acquired or traded together with their underlying securities, and do not apply to
	securities that incorporate features similar to options.


	The fund further limits its options and futures investments to options and futures contracts relating to U.S. Government securities.


	The above limitations on the fund's investments in futures contracts and options, and the fund's policies regarding futures contracts and options
	discussed elsewhere in this SAI may be changed as regulatory agencies permit.



	Liquidity of Options and Futures Contracts.

	There is no assurance a liquid secondary market will exist for any particular options or futures
	contract at any particular time. Options may have relatively low trading volume and liquidity if their strike prices are not close to the underlying
	instrument's current price. In addition, exchanges may establish daily price fluctuation limits for options and futures contracts, and may halt trading if
	a contract's price moves upward or downward more than the limit in a given day. On volatile trading days when the price fluctuation limit is reached or
	a trading halt is imposed, it may be impossible to enter into new positions or close out existing positions. If the secondary market for a contract is not
	liquid because of price fluctuation limits or otherwise, it could prevent prompt liquidation of unfavorable positions, and potentially could require a
	fund to continue to hold a position until delivery or expiration regardless of changes in its value. As a result, a fund's access to other assets held to cover
	its options or futures positions could also be impaired.



	OTC Options.

	Unlike exchange-traded options, which are standardized with respect to the underlying instrument, expiration date, contract size,
	and strike price, the terms of over-the-counter (OTC) options (options not traded on exchanges) generally are established through negotiation with the
	other party to the option contract. While this type of arrangement allows the purchaser or writer greater flexibility to tailor an option to its needs, OTC
	options generally involve greater credit risk than exchange-traded options, which are guaranteed by the clearing organization of the exchanges where
	they are traded.



	Purchasing Put and Call Options.

	By purchasing a put option, the purchaser obtains the right (but not the obligation) to sell the option's
	underlying instrument at a fixed strike price. In return for this right, the purchaser pays the current market price for the option (known as the option
	premium). Options have various types of underlying instruments, including specific securities, indices of securities prices, and futures contracts. The
	purchaser may terminate its position in a put option by allowing it to expire or by exercising the option. If the option is allowed to expire, the purchaser
	will lose the entire premium. If the option is exercised, the purchaser completes the sale of the underlying instrument at the strike price. A purchaser
	may also terminate a put option position by closing it out in the secondary market at its current price, if a liquid secondary market exists.


	The buyer of a typical put option can expect to realize a gain if security prices fall substantially. However, if the underlying instrument's price does
	not fall enough to offset the cost of purchasing the option, a put buyer can expect to suffer a loss (limited to the amount of the premium, plus related
	transaction costs).


	The features of call options are essentially the same as those of put options, except that the purchaser of a call option obtains the right to purchase,
	rather than sell, the underlying instrument at the option's strike price. A call buyer typically attempts to participate in potential price increases of the
	underlying instrument with risk limited to the cost of the option if security prices fall. At the same time, the buyer can expect to suffer a loss if security
	prices do not rise sufficiently to offset the cost of the option.



	Writing Put and Call Options.

	The writer of a put or call option takes the opposite side of the transaction from the option's purchaser. In return
	for receipt of the premium, the writer assumes the obligation to pay the strike price for the option's underlying instrument if the other party to the
	option chooses to exercise it. The writer may seek to terminate a position in a put option before exercise by closing out the option in the secondary
	market at its current price. If the secondary market is not liquid for a put option, however, the writer must continue to be prepared to pay the strike price
	while the option is outstanding, regardless of price changes. When writing an option on a futures contract, a fund will be required to make margin
	payments to an FCM as described above for futures contracts.


	If security prices rise, a put writer would generally expect to profit, although its gain would be limited to the amount of the premium it received. If
	security prices remain the same over time, it is likely that the writer will also profit, because it should be able to close out the option at a lower price. If
	security prices fall, the put writer would expect to suffer a loss. This loss should be less than the loss from purchasing the underlying instrument
	directly, however, because the premium received for writing the option should mitigate the effects of the decline.


	Writing a call option obligates the writer to sell or deliver the option's underlying instrument, in return for the strike price, upon exercise of the
	option. The characteristics of writing call options are similar to those of writing put options, except that writing calls generally is a profitable strategy if
	prices remain the same or fall. Through receipt of the option premium, a call writer mitigates the effects of a price decline. At the same time, because a
	call writer must be prepared to deliver the underlying instrument in return for the strike price, even if its current value is greater, a call writer gives up
	some ability to participate in security price increases.




	Illiquid Securities


	cannot be sold or disposed of in the ordinary course of business at approximately the prices at which they are valued. Difficulty in
	selling securities may result in a loss or may be costly to a fund. Under the supervision of the Board of Trustees, FMR determines the liquidity of a fund's
	investments and, through reports from FMR, the Board monitors investments in illiquid securities. In determining the liquidity of a fund's investments,
	FMR may consider various factors, including (1) the frequency and volume of trades and quotations, (2) the number of dealers and prospective
	purchasers in the marketplace, (3) dealer undertakings to make a market, and (4)<R> </R>the nature of the security and the market in which it trades
	(including any demand, put or tender features, the mechanics and other requirements for transfer, any letters of credit or other credit enhancement
	features, any ratings, the number of holders, the method of soliciting offers, the time required to dispose of the security, and the ability to assign or offset
	the rights and obligations of the security).




	Indexed Securities


	are instruments whose prices are indexed to the prices of other securities, securities indices, or other financial indicators.
	Indexed securities typically, but not always, are debt securities or deposits whose value at maturity or coupon rate is determined by reference to a
	specific instrument or statistic.


	Mortgage-indexed securities, for example, could be structured to replicate the performance of mortgage securities and the characteristics of direct
	ownership.


	The performance of indexed securities depends to a great extent on the performance of the security or other instrument to which they are indexed,
	and may also be influenced by interest rate changes. Indexed securities may be more volatile than the underlying instruments. Indexed securities are
	also subject to the credit risks associated with the issuer of the security, and their values may decline substantially if the issuer's creditworthiness
	deteriorates. Recent issuers of indexed securities have included banks, corporations, and certain U.S. Government agencies.




	Interfund Borrowing and Lending Program.


	Pursuant to an exemptive order issued by the SEC, a fund may lend money to, and borrow money
	from, other funds advised by FMR or its affiliates. A fund will borrow through the program only when the costs are equal to or lower than the costs of
	bank loans, and will lend through the program only when the returns are higher than those available from an investment in repurchase agreements.
	Interfund loans and borrowings normally extend overnight, but can have a maximum duration of seven days. Loans may be called on one day's notice.
	A fund may have to borrow from a bank at a higher interest rate if an interfund loan is called or not renewed.


	Any delay in repayment to a lending fund
	could result in a lost investment opportunity or additional borrowing costs.




	Investment-Grade Debt Securities.


	Investment-grade debt securities <R>include all types of debt instruments that are of </R>medium and
	<R>high-quality. Some may possess speculative characteristics and may be more sensitive to economic changes and to changes in the financial
	conditions of issuers. A debt security is considered to be investment-grade if it is rated investment-grade by Moody's Investors Service, Standard &
	Poor's

	<M®>®

	<R>(S&P

	®

	)</R>, or Fitch Inc., or is unrated but considered to be of equivalent quality by FMR.




	Mortgage Securities


	are issued by government and non-government entities such as banks, mortgage lenders, or other institutions. A mortgage
	security is an obligation of the issuer backed by a mortgage or pool of mortgages or a direct interest in an underlying pool of mortgages. Some
	mortgage securities, such as collateralized mortgage obligations (or "CMOs"), make payments of both principal and interest at a range of specified
	intervals; others make semiannual interest payments at a predetermined rate and repay principal at maturity (like a typical bond). Mortgage securities
	are based on different types of mortgages, including those on commercial real estate or residential properties. Stripped mortgage securities


	are created
	when the interest and principal components of a mortgage security are separated and sold as individual securities. In the case of a stripped mortgage
	security, the holder of the "principal-only" security (PO) receives the principal payments made by the underlying mortgage, while the holder of the
	"interest-only" security (IO) receives interest payments from the same underlying mortgage.


	Fannie Maes and Freddie Macs are pass-through securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, respectively. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,
	which guarantee payment of interest and repayment of principal on Fannie Maes and Freddie Macs, respectively, are federally chartered corporations
	supervised by the U.S. Government that act as governmental instrumentalities under authority granted by Congress. Fannie Mae is authorized to
	borrow from the U.S. Treasury to meet its obligations. Fannie Maes and Freddie Macs are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S.
	Government.


	The value of mortgage securities may change due to shifts in the market's perception of issuers and changes in interest rates. In addition, regulatory
	or tax changes may adversely affect the mortgage securities market as a whole. Non-government mortgage securities may offer higher yields than
	those issued by government entities, but also may be subject to greater price changes than government issues. Mortgage securities are subject to
	prepayment risk, which is the risk that early principal payments made on the underlying mortgages, usually in response to a reduction in interest rates,
	will result in the return of principal to the investor, causing it to be invested subsequently at a lower current interest rate. Alternatively, in a rising
	interest rate environment, mortgage security values may be adversely affected when prepayments on underlying mortgages do not occur as
	anticipated, resulting in the extension of the security's effective maturity and the related increase in interest rate sensitivity of a longer-term
	instrument. The prices of stripped mortgage securities tend to be more volatile in response to changes in interest rates than those of non-stripped
	mortgage securities.


	To earn additional income for a fund, FMR may use a trading strategy that involves selling mortgage securities and simultaneously agreeing to
	purchase similar securities on a later date at a set price. This trading strategy may <R>increase interest rate exposure and</R> result in an increased
	portfolio turnover rate which increases costs and may increase taxable gains.




	Repurchase Agreements


	involve an agreement to purchase a security and to sell that security back to the original seller at an agreed-upon price. The
	resale price reflects the purchase price plus an agreed-upon incremental amount which is unrelated to the coupon rate or maturity of the purchased
	security. As protection against the risk that the original seller will not fulfill its obligation, the securities are held in a separate account at a bank,
	marked-to-market daily, and maintained at a value at least equal to the sale price plus the accrued incremental amount. The value of the security
	purchased may be more or less than the price at which the counterparty has agreed to purchase the security. In addition, delays or losses could result if the
	other party to the agreement defaults or becomes insolvent. The fund will engage in repurchase agreement transactions with parties whose
	creditworthiness has been reviewed and found satisfactory by FMR.




	Reverse Repurchase Agreements.


	In a reverse repurchase agreement, a fund sells a security to another party, such as a bank or broker-dealer, in
	return for cash and agrees to repurchase that security at an agreed-upon price and time. The fund will enter into reverse repurchase agreements with
	parties whose creditworthiness has been reviewed and found satisfactory by FMR. Such transactions may increase fluctuations in the market value of
	fund assets and a fund's yield and may be viewed as a form of leverage.




	Securities Lending.


	A fund may lend securities to parties such as broker-dealers or other institutions, including Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC
	(FBS LLC). FBS LLC is a member of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and an indirect subsidiary of FMR Corp.


	Securities lending allows a fund to retain ownership of the securities loaned and, at the same time, earn additional income. The borrower provides
	the fund with collateral in an amount at least equal to the value of the securities loaned. The fund maintains the ability to obtain the right to vote or
	consent on proxy proposals involving material events affecting securities loaned. If the borrower defaults on its obligation to return the securities
	loaned because of insolvency or other reasons, a fund could experience delays and costs in recovering the securities loaned or in gaining access to the
	collateral. If a fund is not able to recover the securities loaned, a fund may sell the collateral and purchase a replacement investment in the market. The
	value of the collateral could decrease below the value of the replacement investment by the time the replacement investment is purchased. Loans will
	be made only to parties deemed by FMR to be in good standing and when, in FMR's judgment, the income earned would justify the risks.


	Cash received as collateral through loan transactions may be invested in other eligible securities, including shares of a money market fund.
	Investing this cash subjects that investment, as well as the securities loaned, to market appreciation or depreciation.




	Stripped Securities


	are the separate income or principal components of a debt security. The risks associated with stripped securities are similar to
	those of other debt securities, although stripped securities may be more volatile, and the value of certain types of stripped securities may move in the
	same direction as interest rates. U.S. Treasury securities that have been stripped by a Federal Reserve Bank are obligations issued by the U.S. Treasury.


	Privately stripped government securities are created when a dealer deposits a U.S. Treasury security or other U.S. Government security with a
	custodian for safekeeping. The custodian issues separate receipts for the coupon payments and the principal payment, which the dealer then sells.




	Swap Agreements


	can be individually negotiated and structured to include exposure to a variety of different types of investments or market
	factors. Depending on their structure, swap agreements may increase or decrease a fund's exposure to long- or short-term interest rates, mortgage
	securities, corporate borrowing rates, or other factors such as security prices or inflation rates. Swap agreements can take many different forms and are
	known by a variety of names.


	In a typical cap or floor agreement, one party agrees to make payments only under specified circumstances, usually in return for payment of a fee
	by the other party. For example, the buyer of an interest rate cap obtains the right to receive payments to the extent that a specified interest rate exceeds
	an agreed-upon level, while the seller of an interest rate floor is obligated to make payments to the extent that a specified interest rate falls below an
	agreed-upon level. An interest rate collar combines elements of buying a cap and selling a floor.


	Swap agreements will tend to shift a fund's investment exposure from one type of investment to another. For example, if the fund agreed to pay
	fixed rates in exchange for floating rates while holding fixed-rate bonds, the swap would tend to decrease the fund's exposure to long-term interest
	rates. Caps and floors have an effect similar to buying or writing options. Depending on how they are used, swap agreements may increase or decrease
	the overall volatility of a fund's investments and its share price and yield.


	The most significant factor in the performance of swap agreements is the change in the specific interest rate, or other factors that determine the
	amounts of payments due to and from a fund. If a swap agreement calls for payments by the fund, the fund must be prepared to make such payments
	when due. In addition, if the counterparty's creditworthiness declined, the value of a swap agreement would be likely to decline, potentially resulting
	in losses. A fund may be able to eliminate its exposure under a swap agreement either by assignment or other disposition, or by entering into an
	offsetting swap agreement with the same party or a similarly creditworthy party.




	Temporary Defensive Policies.


	The fund reserves the right to invest without limitation in investment-grade money market or short-term debt
	instruments for temporary, defensive purposes.




	Variable and Floating Rate Securities


	provide for periodic adjustments in the interest rate paid on the security. Variable rate securities provide
	for a specified periodic adjustment in the interest rate, while floating rate securities have interest rates that change whenever there is a change in a
	designated benchmark rate <R>or the issuer's credit quality</R>. Some variable or floating rate securities are structured with put features that permit
	holders to demand payment of the unpaid principal balance plus accrued interest from the issuers or certain financial intermediaries.




	When-Issued and Forward Purchase or Sale Transactions


	involve a commitment to purchase or sell specific securities at a predetermined
	price or yield in which payment and delivery take place after the customary settlement period for that type of security. Typically, no interest accrues to
	the purchaser until the security is delivered.


	When purchasing securities pursuant to one of these transactions, the purchaser assumes the rights and risks of ownership, including the risks of
	price and yield fluctuations and the risk that the security will not be issued as anticipated. Because payment for the securities is not required until the
	delivery date, these risks are in addition to the risks associated with a fund's investments. If a fund remains substantially fully invested at a time when a
	purchase is outstanding, the purchases may result in a form of leverage. When a fund has sold a security pursuant to one of these transactions, the fund
	does not participate in further gains or losses with respect to the security. If the other party to a delayed-delivery transaction fails to deliver or pay for
	the securities, a fund could miss a favorable price or yield opportunity or suffer a loss.


	A fund may renegotiate a when-issued or forward transaction and may sell the underlying securities before delivery, which may result in capital
	gains or losses for the fund.




	Zero Coupon Bonds


	do not make interest payments; instead, they are sold at a discount from their face value and are redeemed at face value when
	they mature. Because zero coupon bonds do not pay current income, their prices can be more volatile than other types of fixed-income securities when
	interest rates change. In calculating a fund's dividend, a portion of the difference between a zero coupon bond's purchase price and its face value is
	considered income.









	PORTFOLIO TRANSACTIONS




	<R>All orders for the purchase or sale of portfolio securities are placed on behalf of the fund by FMR pursuant to authority contained in the
	management contract. FMR may also be responsible for the placement of portfolio transactions for other investment companies and investment
	accounts for which it has or its affiliates have investment discretion. In selecting brokers or dealers (including affiliates of FMR), FMR generally
	considers: the execution price; the size and type of the transaction; the nature and character of the markets for the security to be purchased or sold; the
	execution efficiency, settlement capability, and financial condition of the firm; the execution services rendered on a continuing basis; the
	reasonableness of any commissions; and the provision of additional brokerage and research products and services.</R>


	<R>For futures transactions, the selection of an FCM is generally based on the overall quality of execution and other services, including research,
	provided by the FCM.</R>


	If FMR grants investment management authority to a sub-adviser (see the section entitled "Management Contract"), that sub-adviser is authorized
	to provide the services described in the sub-advisory agreement, and will do so in accordance with the policies described in this section.


	Purchases and sales of securities on a securities exchange are effected through brokers who charge a commission for their services.


	Securities may be purchased from underwriters at prices that include underwriting fees.


	Ordinarily commissions are not charged on OTC orders because the fund pays a spread which is included in the cost of the security, and is the
	difference between the dealer's cost and the cost to the fund. When the fund executes an OTC order with an electronic communications network, an
	alternative trading system, or a non-market maker, a commission is charged because there is no spread on the trade.


	Futures transactions are executed and cleared through FCMs who receive commissions for their services.


	<R>The fund may execute portfolio transactions with brokers or dealers that provide products and services. These products and services may
	include: economic, industry, or company research reports or investment recommendations; subscriptions to financial publications or research data
	compilations; compilations of securities prices, earnings, dividends, and similar data; computerized databases; quotation equipment and services;
	research or analytical computer software and services; products or services that assist in effecting transactions, including services of third-party
	computer systems developers directly related to research and brokerage activities; and effecting securities transactions and performing functions
	incidental thereto (such as clearance and settlement). The receipt of these products and services has not reduced FMR's normal research activities in
	providing investment advice to the fund. FMR's expenses could be increased, however, if it attempted to generate these additional products and
	services through its own efforts.</R>


	<R>Certain of the products and services FMR receives from brokers or dealers are furnished by brokers or dealers on their own initiative, either in
	connection with a particular transaction or as part of their overall services. In addition, FMR may request a broker or dealer to provide a specific
	proprietary or third-party product or service. While FMR takes into account the products and services provided by a broker or dealer in determining
	whether commissions are reasonable, neither FMR nor the fund incurs an obligation to the broker, dealer, or third party to pay for any product or service
	(or portion thereof) by generating a certain amount of commissions or otherwise.</R>


	<R>Brokers or dealers that execute transactions for the fund on an agency basis may receive commissions that are in excess of the amount of
	commissions that other brokers or dealers might have charged, in recognition of the products and services they have provided. Before causing the fund
	to pay such higher commissions, FMR will make a good faith determination that the commissions are reasonable in relation to the value of the
	products and services provided viewed in terms of the particular transaction for the fund or FMR's overall responsibilities to the fund or other
	investment companies and investment accounts. Typically, these products and services assist FMR or its affiliates in terms of its overall investment
	responsibilities to the fund and other investment companies and investment accounts; however, each product or service received may not benefit the
	fund.</R>


	FMR is authorized to allocate portfolio transactions in a manner that takes into account assistance received in the distribution of shares of the fund
	or other Fidelity funds and to use the research services of brokerage and other firms that have provided such assistance. <R>FMR may place trades
	with certain brokers with which it is under common control, including National Financial Services LLC (NFS) and Fidelity Brokerage Services
	(Japan) LLC (FBSJ), provided it determines that these affiliates' products, services, and costs are comparable to those of non-affiliated, qualified
	brokerage firms. FMR may also place trades</R> with REDIBook ECN LLC (REDIBook), an electronic communication network (ECN) in which a
	wholly-owned subsidiary of FMR Corp. has an equity ownership interest, if the commissions are fair, reasonable, and comparable to commissions
	charged by non-affiliated, qualified brokerage firms for similar services.


	FMR may allocate brokerage transactions to brokers <R>or</R> dealers (including affiliates of FMR) who have entered into arrangements with
	FMR under which the broker-dealer allocates a portion of the commissions paid by a fund toward the reduction of that fund's expenses. The
	transaction quality must, however, be comparable to that of other qualified broker-dealers.


	The Trustees <R>of the fund</R> periodically review FMR's performance of its responsibilities in connection with the placement of portfolio
	transactions on behalf of the fund and review the commissions paid by the fund over representative periods of time to determine if they are reasonable
	in relation to the benefits to the fund.


	For the fiscal periods ended November 30, <R>2001</R> and <R>2000</R>, the fund's portfolio turnover rates were <R>173</R>% and
	<R>91</R>%, respectively. Variations in turnover rate may be due to a fluctuating volume of shareholder purchase and redemption orders, market
	conditions, or changes in FMR's investment outlook.


	<R>The fund may pay both commissions and spreads in connection with the placement of portfolio transactions. For the fiscal years ended
	November 30, 2001, 2000, and 1999, the fund paid no brokerage commissions.</R>


	During the fiscal year ended November 30, <R>2001</R>, the fund paid no brokerage commissions to firms for providing research services.


	The Trustees of the fund have approved procedures in conformity with Rule 10f-3 under the 1940 Act whereby a fund may purchase securities that
	are offered in underwritings in which an affiliate of FMR participates. These procedures prohibit the fund from directly or indirectly benefiting an
	FMR affiliate in connection with such underwritings. In addition, for underwritings where an FMR affiliate participates as a principal underwriter,
	certain restrictions may apply that could, among other things, limit the amount of securities that the fund could purchase in the underwritings.


	From time to time the Trustees will review whether the recapture for the benefit of the fund of some portion of the brokerage commissions or
	similar fees paid by the fund on portfolio transactions is legally permissible and advisable. The fund seeks to recapture soliciting broker-dealer fees on
	the tender of portfolio securities, but at present no other recapture arrangements are in effect. The Trustees intend to continue to review whether
	recapture opportunities are available and are legally permissible and, if so, to determine in the exercise of their business judgment whether it would be
	advisable for the fund to seek such recapture.


	Although the Trustees and officers of the fund are substantially the same as those of other funds managed by FMR or its affiliates, investment
	decisions for the fund are made independently from those of other funds or investment accounts managed by FMR or its affiliates. <R>The</R> same
	security is<R> often</R> held in the portfolio of more than one of these funds or investment accounts. Simultaneous transactions are inevitable when
	several funds and investment accounts are managed by the same investment adviser, particularly when the same security is suitable for the investment
	objective of more than one fund or investment account.


	When two or more funds are simultaneously engaged in the purchase or sale of the same security, <R>including a futures contract,</R> the prices
	and amounts are allocated in accordance with procedures believed to be appropriate and equitable for each fund. In some cases this system could have
	a detrimental effect on the price or value of the security as far as the fund is concerned. In other cases, however, the ability of the fund to participate in
	volume transactions will produce better executions and prices for the fund. It is the current opinion of the Trustees that the desirability of retaining
	FMR as investment adviser to the fund outweighs any disadvantages that may be said to exist from exposure to simultaneous transactions.






	VALUATION




	The fund's net asset value per share (NAV) is the value of a single share. The NAV of the fund is computed by adding the value of the fund's
	investments, cash, and other assets, subtracting its liabilities, and dividing the result by the number of shares outstanding.


	Portfolio securities are valued by various methods depending on the primary market or exchange on which they trade. <R>Debt </R>securities
	and other assets for which market quotations are readily available




	may be valued at market values determined by such securities' most recent bid
	prices (sales prices if the principal market is an exchange) in the principal market in which they normally are traded, as furnished by recognized
	dealers in such securities or assets. Or, <R>debt</R> securities


	may be




	valued on the basis of information furnished by a pricing service that uses a
	valuation matrix which incorporates both dealer-supplied valuations and electronic data processing techniques. Use of pricing services has been
	approved by the Board of Trustees. A number of pricing services are available, and the fund may use various pricing services or discontinue the use of
	any pricing service.


	Futures contracts and options are valued on the basis of market quotations, if available. Securities of other open-end investment companies are
	valued at their respective NAVs.


	Short-term securities with remaining maturities of sixty days or less for which market quotations and information furnished by a pricing service
	are not readily available are valued either at amortized cost or at original cost plus accrued interest, both of which approximate current value.


	The procedures set forth above need not be used to determine the value of the securities owned by the fund if, in the opinion of a committee
	appointed by the Board of Trustees, some other method would more accurately reflect the fair value of such securities. For example, securities and
	other assets for which there is no readily available market value may be valued in good faith by a committee appointed by the Board of Trustees. In
	making a good faith determination of the value of a security, the committee may review price movements in futures contracts and American
	Depositary Receipts (ADRs), market and trading trends, the bid/ask quotes of brokers and off-exchange institutional trading.









	PERFORMANCE




	The fund may quote performance in various ways. All performance information supplied by the fund in advertising is historical and is not intended
	to indicate future returns. The fund's share price, yield and return fluctuate in response to market conditions and other factors, and the value of fund
	shares when redeemed may be more or less than their original cost.




	Yield Calculations.


	Yields for the fund are computed by dividing the fund's interest and income for a given 30-day or one-month period, net of
	expenses, by the average number of shares entitled to receive distributions during the period, dividing this figure by the fund's


	NAV at the end of the
	period, and annualizing the result (assuming compounding of income) in order to arrive at an annual percentage rate. Income is calculated for purposes of
	yield quotations in accordance with standardized methods applicable to all stock and bond funds. In general, interest income is reduced with respect to
	bonds trading at a premium over their par value by subtracting a portion of the premium from income on a daily basis, and is increased with respect to
	bonds trading at a discount by adding a portion of the discount to daily income. Income is adjusted to reflect gains and losses from principal repayments
	received by a fund with respect to mortgage-related securities and other asset-backed securities. Other capital gains and losses generally are excluded
	from the calculation.


	Income calculated for the purposes of calculating the fund's yield differs from income as determined for other accounting purposes. Because of the
	different accounting methods used, and because of the compounding of income assumed in yield calculations, the fund's yield may not equal its
	distribution rate, the income paid to an investor's account, or the income reported in the fund's financial statements.


	Yield information may be useful in reviewing the fund's performance and in providing a basis for comparison with other investment alternatives.
	However, the fund's yield fluctuates, unlike investments that pay a fixed interest rate over a stated period of time. When comparing investment
	alternatives, investors should also note the quality and maturity of the portfolio securities of respective investment companies they have chosen to
	consider.


	Investors should recognize that in periods of declining interest rates the fund's yield will tend to be somewhat higher than prevailing market rates,
	and in periods of rising interest rates the fund's yield will tend to be somewhat lower. Also, when interest rates are falling, the inflow of net new money
	to the fund from the continuous sale of its shares will likely be invested in instruments producing lower yields than the balance of the fund's holdings,
	thereby reducing the fund's current yield. In periods of rising interest rates, the opposite can be expected to occur.




	Return Calculations.


	Returns quoted in advertising reflect all aspects of the fund's return, including the effect of reinvesting dividends and
	capital gain distributions, and any change in the fund's NAV over a stated period. A cumulative return reflects actual performance over a stated period
	of time.


	Average annual returns are calculated by determining the growth or decline in value of a hypothetical historical investment in the fund over a
	stated period, and then calculating the annually compounded percentage rate that would have produced the same result if the rate of growth or decline
	in value had been constant over the period. For example, a cumulative return of 100% over ten years would produce an average annual return of
	7.18%, which is the steady annual rate of return that would equal 100% growth on a compounded basis in ten years.


	While average annual returns are a
	convenient means of comparing investment alternatives, investors should realize that the fund's performance is not constant over time, but changes
	from year to year, and that average annual returns represent averaged figures as opposed to the actual year-to-year performance of the fund.


	In addition to average annual returns, the fund may quote unaveraged or cumulative returns reflecting the simple change in value of an investment
	over a stated period. Average annual and cumulative returns may be quoted as a percentage or as a dollar amount, and may be calculated for a single
	investment, a series of investments, or a series of redemptions, over any time period. Returns may be broken down into their components of income
	and capital (including capital gains and changes in share price) to illustrate the relationship of these factors and their contributions to return. Returns
	may be quoted on a before-tax or after-tax basis. After-tax returns reflect the return of a hypothetical <R>investment</R> after payment of federal
	and/or state taxes using assumed tax rates. After-tax returns may assume that taxes are paid at the time of distribution or once a year or are paid in cash
	or by selling shares, that shares are held through the entire period, sold on the last day of the period, or sold at a future date, and distributions are
	reinvested or paid in cash. Returns, yields and other performance information may be quoted numerically or in a table, graph, or similar illustration.




	Net Asset Value.


	Charts and graphs using the fund's NAVs, adjusted NAVs, and benchmark indexes may be used to exhibit performance. An
	adjusted NAV includes any distributions paid by the fund and reflects all elements of its return. Unless otherwise indicated, the fund's adjusted NAVs
	are not adjusted for sales charges, if any.

	If FMR had not reimbursed certain fund expenses during these periods, the fund's returns would have been lower.


	The following table shows the income and capital elements of the fund's cumulative return. The table compares the fund's return to the record of
	the Standard & Poor's 500

	SM

	  Index (S&P 500

	®

	), the Dow Jones Industrial Average

	  (DJIA

	SM

	 ), and the cost of living, as measured by the Consumer
	Price Index (CPI), over the same period. The S&P 500 and DJIA comparisons are provided to show how the fund's return compared to the record of a
	market capitalization-weighted index of common stocks and a narrower set of stocks of major industrial companies, respectively, over the same
	period. Because the fund invests in<R> debt</R> securities, common stocks represent a different type of investment from the fund. Common stocks
	generally offer greater growth potential than the fund, but generally experience greater price volatility, which means greater potential for loss. In
	addition, common stocks generally provide lower income than <R>an</R> investment such as the fund. The S&P 500 and DJIA returns are based on
	the prices of unmanaged groups of stocks and, unlike the fund's returns, do not include the effect of brokerage commissions or other costs of investing.


	During the 10-year period ended November 30,<R> 2001</R>, a hypothetical $10,000 investment in Institutional Short-Intermediate

	not an indication of future performance. Tax consequences of different investments have not been factored into the figures below.

	Explanatory Notes: With an initial investment of $10,000 in the fund on December 1, 1991, the net amount invested in fund shares was $10,000.
	The cost of the initial investment ($10,000) together with the aggregate cost of reinvested dividends and capital gain distributions for the period
	covered (their cash value at the time they were reinvested) amounted to $<R>18,770</R>. If distributions had not been reinvested, the amount of
	distributions earned from the fund over time would have been smaller, and cash payments for the period would have amounted to $<R>6,271</R> for
	dividends and $<R>10</R> for capital gain distributions.




	Performance Comparisons.


	The fund's performance may be compared to the performance of other mutual funds in general, or to the
	performance of particular types of mutual funds. These comparisons may be expressed as mutual fund rankings prepared by Lipper Inc. (Lipper), an
	independent service located in Summit, New Jersey that monitors the performance of mutual funds. Generally, Lipper rankings are based on return,
	assume reinvestment of distributions, do not take sales charges or trading fees into consideration, and are prepared without regard to tax
	consequences. Lipper may also rank based on yield. In addition to the mutual fund rankings, the fund's performance may be compared to stock, bond,
	and money market mutual fund performance indexes prepared by Lipper or other organizations. When comparing these indexes, it is important to
	remember the risk and return characteristics of each type of investment. For example, while stock mutual funds may offer higher potential returns,
	they also carry the highest degree of share price volatility. Likewise, money market funds may offer greater stability of principal, but generally do not
	offer the higher potential returns available from stock mutual funds.


	From time to time, the fund's performance may also be compared to other mutual funds tracked by financial or business publications and
	periodicals. For example, the fund may quote Morningstar, Inc. in its advertising materials. Morningstar, Inc. is a mutual fund rating service that rates
	mutual funds on the basis of risk-adjusted performance. Rankings that compare the performance of Fidelity funds to one another in appropriate
	categories over specific periods of time may also be quoted in advertising. The fund may advertise risk ratings, including symbols or numbers,
	prepared by independent rating agencies.


	The fund's performance may also be compared to that of the benchmark index representing the universe of securities in which the fund may invest.
	The return of the index reflects reinvestment of <R>any dividends, interest,</R> and capital gains paid by securities included in the index. Unlike the
	fund's returns, however, the index's returns do not reflect brokerage commissions, transaction fees, or other costs of investing directly in the securities
	included in the index.


	Institutional Short-Intermediate Government may compare its performance to that of the Lehman Brothers

	®

	1-5 Year U.S. Government Bond
	Index, a market value-weighted index for government fixed-rate debt issues. Issues included in the index have an outstanding par value of at least
	$100 million and maturities between one and five years. Government issues include all public obligations of the U.S. Treasury (excluding flower
	bonds and foreign targeted issues) and U.S. Government agencies.


	The fund may be compared in advertising to Certificates of Deposit (CDs) or other investments issued by banks or other depository institutions.
	Mutual funds differ from bank investments in several respects. For example, the fund may offer greater liquidity or higher potential returns than CDs,
	the fund does not guarantee an investor's principal or return, and fund shares are not FDIC insured.


	Fidelity may provide information designed to help individuals understand their investment goals and explore various financial strategies. Such
	information may include information about current economic, market, and political conditions; materials that describe general principles of investing,
	such as asset allocation, diversification, risk tolerance, and goal setting; questionnaires designed to help create a personal financial profile; worksheets
	used to project savings needs based on assumed rates of inflation and hypothetical rates of return; and action plans offering investment alternatives.
	Materials may also include discussions of Fidelity's asset allocation funds and other Fidelity funds, products, and services.


	Ibbotson Associates of Chicago, Illinois (Ibbotson) provides historical returns of the capital markets in the United States, including common
	stocks, small capitalization stocks, long-term corporate bonds, intermediate-term government bonds, long-term government bonds, Treasury bills,
	the U.S. rate of inflation (based on the


	CPI), and combinations of various capital markets. The performance of these capital markets is based on the
	returns of different indexes.


	Fidelity funds may use the performance of these capital markets in order to demonstrate general risk-versus-reward investment scenarios.
	Performance comparisons may also include the value of a hypothetical investment in any of these capital markets. The risks associated with the
	security types in any capital market may or may not correspond directly to those of the funds. Ibbotson calculates returns in the same method as the
	funds. The funds may also compare performance to that of other compilations or indexes that may be developed and made available in the future.


	In advertising materials, Fidelity may reference or discuss its products and services, which may include other Fidelity funds; retirement investing;
	brokerage products and services; model portfolios or allocations; saving for college or other goals; and charitable giving. In addition, Fidelity may
	quote or reprint financial or business publications and periodicals as they relate to current economic and political conditions, fund management,
	portfolio composition, investment philosophy, investment techniques, the desirability of owning a particular mutual fund, and Fidelity services and
	products. Fidelity may also reprint, and use as advertising and sales literature, articles from Fidelity Focus

	®

	, a quarterly magazine provided free of
	charge to Fidelity fund shareholders.


	The fund may present its fund number, Quotron

	®

	number, and CUSIP number, and discuss or quote its current portfolio manager.




	Volatility.


	The fund may quote various measures of volatility and benchmark correlation in advertising. In addition, the fund may compare these
	measures to those of other funds. Measures of volatility seek to compare the fund's historical share price fluctuations or returns to those of a
	benchmark. Measures of benchmark correlation indicate how valid a comparative benchmark may be. All measures of volatility and correlation are
	calculated using averages of historical data. In advertising, the fund may also discuss or illustrate examples of interest rate sensitivity.




	Momentum Indicators


	indicate the fund's price movements over specific periods of time. Each point on the momentum indicator represents the
	fund's percentage change in price movements over that period.


	The fund may advertise examples of the effects of periodic investment plans, including the principle of dollar cost averaging. In such a program, an
	investor invests a fixed dollar amount in a fund at periodic intervals, thereby purchasing fewer shares when prices are high and more shares when
	prices are low. While such a strategy does not assure a profit or guard against loss in a declining market, the investor's average cost per share can be
	lower than if fixed numbers of shares are purchased at the same intervals. In evaluating such a plan, investors should consider their ability to continue
	purchasing shares during periods of low price levels.


	As of November 30, <R>2001</R>, FMR advised over $<R>45</R> billion in municipal fund assets, $<R>197</R> billion in taxable
	fixed-income fund assets, $<R>198</R> billion in money market fund assets, $<R>495</R> billion in equity fund assets, and $<R>19</R> billion in
	international fund assets. The fund may reference the growth and variety of money market mutual funds and the adviser's innovation and participation
	in the industry. The equity funds under management figure represents the largest amount of equity fund assets under management by a mutual fund
	investment adviser in the United States, making FMR America's leading equity (stock) fund manager. FMR, its subsidiaries, and affiliates maintain a
	worldwide information and communications network for the purpose of researching and managing investments abroad.


	In addition to performance rankings, <R>the</R> fund may compare its total expense ratio to the average total expense ratio of similar funds
	tracked by Lipper. The fund's total expense ratio is a significant factor in comparing <R>debt</R> and money market investments because of its
	effect on yield.






	<R>BUYING, SELLING, AND EXCHANGING </R>INFORMATION




	The fund may make redemption payments in whole or in part in readily marketable securities or other property pursuant to procedures approved by
	the Trustees if FMR determines it is in the best interests of the fund. Such securities or other property will be valued for this purpose as they are valued
	in computing the fund's NAV. Shareholders that receive securities or other property will realize, upon receipt, a gain or loss for tax purposes, and will
	incur additional costs and be exposed to market risk prior to and upon sale of such securities or other property.









	DISTRIBUTIONS AND TAXES






	Dividends.




	Because the fund's income is primarily derived from interest, dividends from the fund generally will not qualify for the
	dividends-received deduction available to corporate shareholders. Short-term capital gains are taxable as dividends, but do not qualify for the
	dividends-received deduction.




	Capital Gain Distributions.


	The fund's long-term capital gain distributions are federally taxable to shareholders generally as capital gains.


	As of November 30, <R>2001</R>, the fund had an aggregate capital loss carryforward of approximately $<R>26,267,000</R>. This loss
	carryforward, of which $<R>8,624,000</R>, $<R>3,288,000</R>, $<R>4,169,000, $101,000, $5,916,000, and $4,169,000 </R>will expire on
	November 30, <R>2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2007, and 2008, </R>respectively, is available to offset future capital gains.




	State and Local Tax Issues.


	For mutual funds organized as business trusts, state law provides for a pass-through of the state and local income tax
	exemption afforded to direct owners of U.S. Government securities. Some states limit this pass-through to mutual funds that invest a certain amount in
	U.S. Government securities, and some types of securities, such as repurchase agreements and some agency-backed securities, may not qualify for this
	benefit. The tax treatment of your dividends from a fund will be the same as if you directly owned a proportionate share of the U.S. Government
	securities. Because the income earned on certain U.S. Government securities is exempt from state and local personal income taxes, the portion of
	dividends from a fund attributable to these securities will also be free from state and local personal income taxes. The exemption from state and local
	personal income taxation does not preclude states from assessing other taxes on the ownership of U.S. Government securities.




	Tax Status of the Fund.


	The fund intends to qualify each year as a "regulated investment company" under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue
	Code so that it will not be liable for federal tax on income and capital gains distributed to shareholders. In order to qualify as a regulated investment
	company, and avoid being subject to federal income or excise taxes at the fund level, the fund intends to distribute substantially all of its net investment
	income and net realized capital gains within each calendar year as well as on a fiscal year basis, and intends to comply with other tax rules applicable to
	regulated investment companies.




	Other Tax Information.


	The information above is only a summary of some of the tax consequences generally affecting the fund and its
	shareholders, and no attempt has been made to discuss individual tax consequences. It is up to you or your tax preparer to determine whether the sale of
	shares of the fund resulted in a capital gain or loss or other tax consequence to you. In addition to federal income taxes, shareholders may be subject to
	state and local taxes on fund distributions, and shares may be subject to state and local personal property taxes. Investors should consult their tax advisers
	to determine whether a fund is suitable to their particular tax situation.

	A

	Information is for the calendar year ended December 31, 200<R>1</R> for 2<R>64</R> funds in the complex. Compensation figures
	include cash, amounts required to be deferred, and may include amounts deferred at the election of Trustees. For the calendar year ended
	December 31, 200<R>1</R>, the Trustees accrued required deferred compensation from the funds as follows:<R> J. Michael Cook,
	$111,000;</R> Ralph F. Cox, $111,000; Phyllis Burke Davis, $111,000; Robert M. Gates, $111,000; Donald J. Kirk, $111,000;<R> Marie
	L. Knowles, $111,000;</R> Ned C. Lautenbach, $111,000; Marvin L. Mann, $1<R>4</R>1,000; William O. McCoy, $111,000; and
	<R>William S. Stavropoulos</R>, $<R>26</R>,<R>734</R>. Certain of the non-interested Trustees elected voluntarily to defer a
	portion of their compensation as follows:<R> J. Michael Cook, $30,723;</R> Ralph F. Cox, $3<R>0</R>,7<R>23</R>; Ned C.
	Lautenbach, $<R>38</R>,<R>103</R>;<R> and</R> William O. McCoy, $3<R>8</R>,<R>103</R>.


	Under a deferred compensation plan adopted in September 1995 and amended in November 1996 and January 2000 (the Plan), non-interested
	Trustees must defer receipt of a portion of, and may elect to defer receipt of an additional portion of, their annual fees. Amounts deferred under the
	Plan are treated as though equivalent dollar amounts had been invested in shares of a cross-section of Fidelity funds including funds in each major
	investment discipline and representing a majority of Fidelity's assets under management (the Reference Funds). The amounts ultimately received by
	the <R>non-interested</R> Trustees under the Plan will be directly linked to the investment performance of the Reference Funds. Deferral of fees in
	accordance with the Plan will have a negligible effect on a fund's assets, liabilities, and net income per share, and will not obligate a fund to retain the
	services of any <R>non-interested</R> Trustee or to pay any particular level of compensation to the <R>non-interested</R> Trustee. A fund may
	invest in the Reference Funds under the Plan without shareholder approval.


	As of November 30, <R>2001</R>, the Trustees, Member of the Advisory Board, and officers of the fund owned, in the aggregate, less than
	<R>1</R>% of the fund's total outstanding shares.


	<R>As of November 30, 2001,


	the following owned of record or beneficially 5% or more (up to and including 25%) of the fund's outstanding
	shares:</R>


	<R>Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, NM (19.92%).</R>


	<R>Sherwin-Williams Company, Cleveland, OH (5.20%).</R>






	CONTROL OF INVESTMENT ADVISERS




	FMR Corp., organized in 1972, is the ultimate parent company of FMR and Fidelity Investments Money Management, Inc. (FIMM). The voting
	common stock of FMR Corp. is divided into two classes. Class B is held predominantly by members of the Edward C. Johnson 3d family and is
	entitled to 49% of the vote on any matter acted upon by the voting common stock. Class A is held predominantly by non-Johnson family member
	employees of FMR Corp. and its affiliates and is entitled to 51% of the vote on any such matter. The Johnson family group and all other Class B
	shareholders have entered into a shareholders' voting agreement under which all Class B shares will be voted in accordance with the majority vote of
	Class B shares. Under the 1940 Act, control of a company is presumed where one individual or group of individuals owns more than 25% of the voting
	stock of that company. Therefore, through their ownership of voting common stock and the execution of the shareholders' voting agreement,
	members of the Johnson family may be deemed, under the 1940 Act, to form a controlling group with respect to FMR Corp.


	At present, the primary business activities of FMR Corp. and its subsidiaries are: (i) the provision of investment advisory, management,
	shareholder, investment information and assistance and certain fiduciary services for individual and institutional investors; (ii) the provision of
	securities brokerage services; (iii) the management and development of real estate; and (iv) the investment in and operation of a number of emerging
	businesses.


	The fund, FMR, FIMM, and Fidelity Distributors Corporation (FDC) have adopted a code of ethics under Rule 17j-1 of the 1940 Act that sets forth
	employees' fiduciary responsibilities regarding the fund, establishes procedures for personal investing, and restricts certain transactions. Employees
	subject to the code of ethics, including Fidelity investment personnel, may invest in securities for their own investment accounts, including securities that
	may be purchased or held by the fund.






	MANAGEMENT CONTRACT




	The fund has entered into a management contract with FMR, pursuant to which FMR furnishes investment advisory and other services.




	Management Services.


	Under the terms of its management contract with the fund, FMR acts as investment adviser and, subject to the supervision
	of the Board of Trustees, directs the investments of the fund in accordance with its investment objective, policies and limitations. FMR also provides
	the fund with all necessary office facilities and personnel for servicing the fund's investments, compensates all officers of the fund and all Trustees
	who are "interested persons" of the trust or of FMR, and all personnel of the fund or FMR performing services relating to research, statistical and
	investment activities.


	In addition, FMR or its affiliates, subject to the supervision of the Board of Trustees, provide the management and administrative services
	necessary for the operation of the fund. These services include providing facilities for maintaining the fund's organization; supervising relations with
	custodians, transfer and pricing agents, accountants, underwriters and other persons dealing with the fund; preparing all general shareholder
	communications and conducting shareholder relations; maintaining the fund's records and the registration of the fund's shares under federal securities
	laws and making necessary filings under state securities laws; developing management and shareholder services for the fund; and furnishing reports,
	evaluations and analyses on a variety of subjects to the Trustees.




	Management-Related Expenses.


	Under the terms of the fund's management contract, FMR is responsible for payment of all operating expenses
	of the fund with certain exceptions. Specific expenses payable by FMR include expenses for typesetting, printing, and mailing proxy materials to
	shareholders, legal expenses, fees of the custodian, auditor, and interested Trustees, the fund's proportionate share of insurance premiums and
	Investment Company Institute dues, and the costs of registering shares under federal securities laws and making necessary filings under state
	securities laws. The fund's management contract further provides that FMR will pay for typesetting, printing, and mailing prospectuses, statements of
	additional information, notices, and reports to shareholders; however, under the terms of the fund's transfer agent agreement, the transfer agent bears
	the costs of providing these services to existing shareholders. FMR also pays all fees associated with transfer agent, dividend disbursing, and
	shareholder services, pricing and bookkeeping services, and the cost of administration of the fund's securities lending program.


	FMR pays all other expenses of the fund with the following exceptions: fees and expenses of the non-interested Trustees, interest, taxes, brokerage
	commissions (if any), and such non-recurring expenses as may arise, including costs of any litigation to which the fund may be a party, and any
	obligation it may have to indemnify its officers and Trustees with respect to litigation.




	Management Fee.


	For the services of FMR under the management contract, the fund pays FMR a monthly management fee at the annual rate of
	0.45% of the fund's average net assets throughout the month. The management fee paid to FMR by the fund is reduced by an amount equal to the fees
	and expenses paid by the fund to the non-interested Trustees.


	For the fiscal years ended November 30, <R>2001, 2000, and 1999,</R> the fund paid FMR management fees of <R>$1,682,727, $1,635,757,
	and $1,833,261,</R> respectively, after reduction of fees and expenses paid by the fund to the non-interested Trustees. In addition, for the fiscal years
	ended November 30, <R>2001, 2000, and 1999,</R> credits reducing management fees amounted to <R>$20,891, $53,205, and $40,412,</R>
	respectively.


	FMR may, from time to time, voluntarily reimburse all or a portion of the fund's operating expenses (exclusive of interest, taxes, brokerage
	commissions, and extraordinary expenses), which is subject to revision or discontinuance. FMR retains the ability to be repaid for these expense
	reimbursements in the amount that expenses fall below the limit prior to the end of the fiscal year.


	Expense reimbursements by FMR will increase the fund's returns and yield, and repayment of the reimbursement by the fund will lower its returns
	and yield.




	Sub-Adviser - <R>FIMM</R>.


	On behalf of the fund, FMR has entered into a sub-advisory agreement with FIMM pursuant to which FIMM
	has primary responsibility for choosing investments for the fund.


	Under the terms of the sub-advisory agreement, FMR pays FIMM fees equal to 50% of the management fee payable to FMR under its
	management contract with the fund. The fees paid to FIMM are not reduced by any voluntary or mandatory expense reimbursements that may be in
	effect from time to time.


	On behalf of the fund, for the fiscal years ended November 30, 2001<R>, 2000, and 1999</R>, FMR paid FIMM fees of $841,364, $817,879, and
	$844,807, respectively.






	DISTRIBUTION SERVICES




	The fund has entered into a distribution agreement with FDC, an affiliate of FMR. FDC is a broker-dealer registered under the Securities Exchange
	Act of 1934 and a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. The distribution agreement calls for FDC to use all reasonable
	efforts, consistent with its other business, to secure purchasers for shares of the fund, which are continuously offered at NAV. Promotional and
	administrative expenses in connection with the offer and sale of shares are paid by FMR.


	The Trustees have approved a Distribution and Service Plan on behalf of the fund (the Plan) pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act (the Rule).
	The Rule provides in substance that a mutual fund may not engage directly or indirectly in financing any activity that is primarily intended to result in
	the sale of shares of the fund except pursuant to a plan approved on behalf of the fund under the Rule. The Plan, as approved by the Trustees, allows the
	fund and FMR to incur certain expenses that might be considered to constitute indirect payment by the fund of distribution expenses.


	Under the Plan, if the payment of management fees by the fund to FMR is deemed to be indirect financing by the fund of the distribution of its
	shares, such payment is authorized by the Plan. The Plan specifically recognizes that FMR may use its management fee revenue, as well as its past
	profits or its other resources, to pay FDC for expenses incurred in connection with providing services intended to result in the sale of fund shares
	and/or shareholder support services. In addition, the Plan provides that FMR, directly or through FDC, may pay significant amounts to intermediaries,
	such as banks, broker-dealers, and other service-providers, that provide those services. Currently, the Board of Trustees has authorized such payments
	for Institutional Short-Intermediate Government shares.


	<R>Prior to approving the Plan, the Trustees carefully considered all pertinent factors relating to the implementation of the Plan, and determined
	that there is a reasonable likelihood that the Plan will benefit the fund and its shareholders. In particular, the Trustees noted that the Plan does not
	authorize payments by the fund other than those made to FMR under its management contract with the fund. To the extent that the Plan gives FMR and
	FDC greater flexibility in connection with the distribution of fund shares, additional sales of fund shares or stabilization of cash flows may result.
	Furthermore, certain shareholder support services may be provided more effectively under the Plan by local entities with whom shareholders have
	other relationships. </R>


	The fund may execute portfolio transactions with, and purchase securities issued by, depository institutions that receive payments under the Plan.
	No preference for the instruments of such depository institutions will be shown in the selection of investments.


	FDC may compensate intermediaries that satisfy certain criteria established from time to time by FDC relating to the level or type of services
	provided by the intermediary, the sale or expected sale of significant amounts of shares, or other factors.






	TRANSFER AND SERVICE AGENT AGREEMENTS




	The fund has entered into a transfer agent agreement with <R>Fidelity Investments Institutional Operations Company, Inc. (FIIOC)</R>, an
	affiliate of FMR. Under the terms of the agreement, FIIOC performs transfer agency, dividend disbursing, and shareholder services for the fund.


	For providing transfer agency services, FIIOC receives<R> a position</R> fee and an asset-based fee each paid monthly with respect to each
	<R>position</R> in the fund. For retail accounts and certain institutional accounts, these fees are based on size <R>of position</R> and fund type.
	For certain institutional retirement accounts, these fees are based on fund type. For certain other institutional retirement accounts, these fees are based
	on account type and fund type. The <R>position </R>fees are subject to increase based on postage rate changes.


	FIIOC pays out-of-pocket expenses associated with providing transfer agent services. In addition, FIIOC bears the expense of typesetting,
	printing, and mailing prospectuses, statements of additional information, and all other reports, notices, and statements to existing shareholders, with
	the exception of proxy statements.


	The fund has also entered into a service agent agreement with FSC, an affiliate of FMR. Under the terms of the agreement, FSC calculates the NAV
	and dividends for the fund, maintains the fund's portfolio and general accounting records, and administers the fund's securities lending program.


	For providing pricing and bookkeeping services, FSC receives a monthly fee based on the fund's average daily net assets throughout the month.


	For administering the fund's securities lending program, FSC is paid based on the number and duration of individual securities loans.


	FMR bears the cost of transfer agency, dividend disbursing, and shareholder services, pricing and bookkeeping services, and administration of the
	securities lending program under the terms of its management contract with the fund.






	DESCRIPTION OF THE TRUST






	Trust Organization.


	Fidelity Institutional Short-Intermediate Government Fund is a fund of Fidelity Advisor Series IV, an open-end
	management investment company organized as a


	Massachusetts business trust on May 6, 1983. Currently, there are two funds in the trust: Fidelity
	Institutional Short-Intermediate Government Fund and Fidelity Real Estate High Income Fund

	.

	The Trustees are permitted to create additional funds
	in the trust and to create additional classes of the fund.


	The assets of the trust received for the issue or sale of shares of each fund and all income, earnings, profits, and proceeds thereof, subject to the
	rights of creditors, are allocated to such fund, and constitute the underlying assets of such fund. The underlying assets of each fund in the trust shall be
	charged with the liabilities and expenses attributable to such fund. Any general expenses of the trust shall be allocated between or among any one or
	more of the funds.




	Shareholder Liability.


	The trust is an entity commonly known as a "Massachusetts business trust." Under Massachusetts law, shareholders of
	such a trust may, under certain circumstances, be held personally liable for the obligations of the trust.


	The Declaration of Trust contains an express disclaimer of shareholder liability for the debts, liabilities, obligations, and expenses of the trust or
	fund. The Declaration of Trust provides that the trust shall not have any claim against shareholders except for the payment of the purchase price of
	shares and requires that each agreement, obligation, or instrument entered into or executed by the trust or the Trustees relating to the trust or to a fund
	shall include a provision limiting the obligations created thereby to the trust or to one or more funds and its or their assets. The Declaration of Trust
	further provides that shareholders of a fund shall not have a claim on or right to any assets belonging to any other fund.


	The Declaration of Trust provides for indemnification out of each fund's property of any shareholder or former shareholder held personally liable
	for the obligations of the fund solely by reason of his or her being or having been a shareholder and not because of his or her acts or omissions or for
	some other reason. The Declaration of Trust also provides that each fund shall, upon request, assume the defense of any claim made against any
	shareholder for any act or obligation of the fund and satisfy any judgment thereon. Thus, the risk of a shareholder incurring financial loss on account of
	shareholder liability is limited to circumstances in which a fund itself would be unable to meet its obligations. FMR believes that, in view of the above,
	the risk of personal liability to shareholders is remote.




	Voting Rights.


	Each fund's capital consists of shares of beneficial interest. As a shareholder, you are entitled to one vote for each dollar of net asset
	value you own. The voting rights of shareholders can be changed only by a shareholder vote. Shares may be voted in the aggregate, by fund, and by
	class.


	The shares have no preemptive or conversion rights. Shares are fully paid and nonassessable, except as set forth under the heading "Shareholder
	Liability" above.


	The trust or a fund may be terminated upon the sale of its assets to, or merger with, another open-end management investment company or series
	thereof, or upon liquidation and distribution of its assets. Generally, the merger of the trust or a fund with another operating mutual fund or the sale of
	substantially all of the assets of the trust or a fund to another operating mutual fund requires approval by a vote of shareholders of the trust or the fund.
	The Trustees may, however, reorganize or terminate the trust or a fund without prior shareholder approval. In the event of the dissolution or liquidation
	of the trust, shareholders of each of its funds are entitled to receive the underlying assets of such fund available for distribution. In the event of the
	dissolution or liquidation of a fund, shareholders of that fund are entitled to receive the underlying assets of the fund available for distribution.




	Custodians.


	The Bank of New York, 110 Washington Street, New York, New York, is custodian of the assets of the fund. The custodian is
	responsible for the safekeeping of the fund's assets and the appointment of any subcustodian banks and clearing agencies. <R>JPMorgan Chase</R>
	Bank, headquartered in New York, also may serve as a special purpose custodian of certain assets in connection with repurchase agreement
	transactions.


	FMR, its officers and directors, its affiliated companies, Member<R>s</R> of the Advisory Board, and Members of the Board of Trustees may,
	from time to time, conduct transactions with various banks, including banks serving as custodians for certain funds advised by FMR. Transactions that
	have occurred to date include mortgages and personal and general business loans. In the judgment of FMR, the terms and conditions of those
	transactions were not influenced by existing or potential custodial or other fund relationships.




	Auditor.


	PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, 160 Federal Street, Boston, Massachusetts, serves as independent accountant for the fund. The auditor
	examines financial statements for the fund and provides other audit, tax, and related services.









	FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

	Item 24.

	Trusts Controlled by or under Common Control with this Trust



	The Board of Trustees of the Trust is the same as the board of other Fidelity funds,


	each of which has Fidelity
	Management & Research Company, or an affiliate, as its investment adviser. In addition, the officers of the Trust are
	substantially identical to those of the other Fidelity funds. Nonetheless, the Trust takes the position that it is not under
	common control with other Fidelity funds because the power residing in the respective boards and officers arises as the
	result of an official position with the respective trusts.





	Item 25.

	Indemnification



	Article XI, Section 2 of the Declaration of Trust sets forth the reasonable and fair means for determining whether
	indemnification shall be provided to any past or present Trustee or officer. It states that the Trust shall indemnify any present
	or past trustee or officer to the fullest extent permitted by law against liability, and all expenses reasonably incurred by him or
	her in connection with any claim, action, suit or proceeding in which he or she is involved by virtue of his or her service as a
	trustee or officer and against any amount incurred in settlement thereof. Indemnification will not be provided to a person
	adjudged by a court or other adjudicatory body to be liable to the Trust or its shareholders by reason of willful misfeasance,
	bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of his or her duties (collectively, "disabling conduct"), or not to have acted in
	good faith in the reasonable belief that his or her action was in the best interest of the Trust. In the event of a settlement, no
	indemnification may be provided unless there has been a determination, as specified in the Declaration of Trust, that the
	officer or trustee did not engage in disabling conduct.


	Pursuant to Section 11 of the Distribution Agreement, the Trust agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the
	Distributor and each of its directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls the Distributor within the meaning of
	Section 15 of the 1933 Act against any loss, liability, claim, damages or expense (including the reasonable cost of
	investigating or defending any alleged loss, liability, claim, damages, or expense and reasonable counsel fees incurred in
	connection therewith) arising by reason of any person acquiring any shares, based upon the ground that the registration
	statement, Prospectus, Statement of Additional Information, shareholder reports or other information filed or made public by
	the Trust (as from time to time amended) included an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
	required to be stated or necessary in order to make the statements not misleading under the 1933 Act, or any other statute or
	the common law. However, the Trust does not agree to indemnify the Distributor or hold it harmless to the extent that the
	statement or omission was made in reliance upon, and in conformity with, information furnished to the Trust by or on behalf
	of the Distributor. In no case is the indemnity of the Trust in favor of the Distributor or any person indemnified to be deemed
	to protect the Distributor or any person against any liability to the Issuer or its security holders to which the Distributor or such
	person would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of its
	duties or by reason of its reckless disregard of its obligations and duties under this Agreement.


	Pursuant to the agreement by which Fidelity Investments Institutional Operations Company, Inc. ("FIIOC") is
	appointed transfer agent, the Registrant agrees to indemnify and hold FIIOC harmless against any losses, claims, damages,
	liabilities or expenses (including reasonable counsel fees and expenses) resulting from:


	(1) any claim, demand, action or suit brought by any person other than the Registrant, including by a
	shareholder, which names FIIOC and/or the Registrant as a party and is not based on and does not result from FIIOC's willful
	misfeasance, bad faith or negligence or reckless disregard of duties, and arises out of or in connection with FIIOC's
	performance under the Transfer Agency Agreement; or


	(2) any claim, demand, action or suit (except to the extent contributed to by FIIOC's willful misfeasance, bad
	faith or negligence or reckless disregard of duties) which results from the negligence of the Registrant, or from FIIOC's acting
	upon any instruction(s) reasonably believed by it to have been executed or communicated by any person duly authorized by
	the Registrant, or as a result of FIIOC's acting in reliance upon advice reasonably believed by FIIOC to have been given by
	counsel for the Registrant, or as a result of FIIOC's acting in reliance upon any instrument or stock certificate reasonably
	believed by it to have been genuine and signed, countersigned or executed by the proper person.

Summary







 


Overall Rating

3 out of 5 Stars

Morningstar has awarded this fund 3 stars based on its risk-adjusted performance compared to the 1277 funds within its Morningstar Category.



How is it determined?


The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics, which are based on risk-adjusted returns, as of the date stated.





3 Yrs





                         Out of
1,277
 funds
                     	




What does it mean?


A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.











 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Above Average


This fund scores Above Average because it delivered returns that were in the top 22.5% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category: top 10% - High next 22.5% - Above Average middle 35% - Average next 22.5% - Below Average bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Expenses


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Low


This fund's expenses are rated as Low because they are below the 20th percentile when compared with other funds in the category.





How is it calculated?


This Morningstar data point compares the fund's net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its Morningstar Category grouping.





What does it mean?


Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Risk


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average

This fund scores Average because Morningstar has rated its risk between the 40th and 60th percentiles when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.




How is it calculated?


Risk is calculated using the Sharpe ratio, which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to U.S. Treasury bonds, relative to the fund's overall volatility. For this measure, Morningstar has compared the Sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in it's Morningstar Category.




What does it mean?


A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.










 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Above Average


This fund scores Above Average because it delivered returns that were in the top 22.5% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category: top 10% - High next 22.5% - Above Average middle 35% - Average next 22.5% - Below Average bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. (Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.) It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of  funds in each fund category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

© 2016 Morningstar, Inc. All rights reserved. The Morningstar information contained herein: (1) is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers; (2) may not be copied or redistributed; and (3) is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.

The "Mutual Funds" area at the top of each page allows access to mutual fund holdings with individual and joint Fidelity non-retirement accounts. Individual stock positions, ETFs and 529 funds are not available through this view. For the full list of your holdings visit Portfolio Summary.Mutual Funds are priced as of the previous business day's market close when the market is open. Mutual fund positions are priced as of the official market close (typically 4p.m.) and prices are generally available between 5 p.m. and 6p.m.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. No Transaction Fee Fidelity funds are available without paying a trading fee to Fidelity or a sales load to the fund. However, the fund may charge a short-term trading or redemption fee to protect the interests of long-term shareholders of the fund. Shares are subject to the fund's management and operating expenses. See Expenses & Fees for more information.
2. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated.  Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.
3. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
4. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
5. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time.  They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments.  The Top Ten Holdings and Top 5 Issuers do not include money market instruments or futures contracts, if any.  Depository receipts are normally combined with the underlying security.  Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different.Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment option reports its holdings. Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section. Some report them in this section in addition to the equity, bond and other allocation shown. Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown. If the allocation without the foreign component equals (or rounds to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
6. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
7. The percent of net assets invested in both domestic and foreign Equities (common stocks, preferred stocks, rights and warrants, convertible preferred stocks and stock index futures and options), Bond (all debt instruments, including investment grade, non-investment grade, non-rated securities and convertible bonds), and Cash & Net Other Assets (cash, repurchase agreements, receivables and payables).
8. "Tax-Advantaged Domiciles" represent countries whose tax policies may be favorable for company incorporation.
9. Net Other Assets can include fund receivables, fund payables, and offsets to other derivative positions, as well as certain assets that do not fall into any of the Portfolio Composition categories. Depending on the extent to which the fund invests in derivatives and the number of positions that are held for future settlement, Net Other Assets can be a negative number.
10. StyleMap® depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's equity holdings over two dimensions: market capitalization and valuation. The percentage of fund assets represented by these holdings is indicated beside each StyleMap. Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's equity holdings (e.g., domestic stocks, foreign stocks, and American Depositary Receipts), are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.
11. Expense Cap is a limit that the fund company has placed on the level of the expenses borne by the fund until 1/31/2021 and indicates the maximum level of expenses (with certain exceptions) that the fund would be paying until that time.  After the expiration date, the expense cap may be terminated or revised, which may lower the fund's yield and return.

Summary







 


Overall Rating

3 out of 5 Stars

Morningstar has awarded this fund 3 stars based on its risk-adjusted performance compared to the 1091 funds within its Morningstar Category.



How is it determined?


The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics, which are based on risk-adjusted returns, as of the date stated.

What does it mean?


A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.











 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average


This fund scores Average because it delivered returns that were in the middle 35% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category: top 10% - High next 22.5% - Above Average middle 35% - Average next 22.5% - Below Average bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Expenses


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Below Average


This fund's expenses are rated as Below Average because they fall between the 20th and 40th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category





How is it calculated?


This Morningstar data point compares the fund's net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its Morningstar Category grouping.





What does it mean?


Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Fund Overview




Objective



Seeks reasonable income. In pursuing this objective, the fund will also consider the potential for capital appreciation.




Strategy



Normally investing at least 80% of assets in equity securities. Normally investing primarily in income-producing equity securities, which tends to lead to investments in large cap "value" stocks. Potentially investing in other types of equity securities and debt securities, including lower-quality debt securities. Investing in domestic and foreign issuers. Using fundamental analysis of factors such as each issuer's financial condition and industry position, as well as market and economic conditions, to select investments. Potentially using covered call options as tools in managing the fund's assets.


Risk



Stock markets, especially foreign markets, are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments. Foreign securities are subject to interest rate, currency exchange rate, economic, and political risks. Fixed income investments entail interest rate risk (as interest rates rise bond prices usually fall), the risk of issuer default, issuer credit risk and inflation risk. Lower-quality bonds can be more volatile and have greater riskof default than higher-quality bonds. Value stocks can perform differently than other types of stocks and can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.

Risk


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Below Average

This fund scores Below Average because Morningstar has rated its risk between the 20th and 40th percentiles when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.




How is it calculated?


Risk is calculated using the Sharpe ratio, which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to U.S. Treasury bonds, relative to the fund's overall volatility. For this measure, Morningstar has compared the Sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in it's Morningstar Category.




What does it mean?


A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.










 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average


This fund scores Average because it delivered returns that were in the middle 35% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category: top 10% - High next 22.5% - Above Average middle 35% - Average next 22.5% - Below Average bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Risk



Stock markets, especially foreign markets, are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments. Foreign securities are subject to interest rate, currency exchange rate, economic, and political risks. Fixed income investments entail interest rate risk (as interest rates rise bond prices usually fall), the risk of issuer default, issuer credit risk and inflation risk. Lower-quality bonds can be more volatile and have greater riskof default than higher-quality bonds. Value stocks can perform differently than other types of stocks and can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. (Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.) It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of  funds in each fund category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.

The "Mutual Funds" area at the top of each page allows access to mutual fund holdings with individual and joint Fidelity non-retirement accounts. Individual stock positions, ETFs and 529 funds are not available through this view. For the full list of your holdings visit Portfolio Summary.Mutual Funds are priced as of the previous business day's market close when the market is open. Mutual fund positions are priced as of the official market close (typically 4p.m.) and prices are generally available between 5 p.m. and 6p.m.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. No Transaction Fee Fidelity funds are available without paying a trading fee to Fidelity or a sales load to the fund. However, the fund may charge a short-term trading or redemption fee to protect the interests of long-term shareholders of the fund. Shares are subject to the fund's management and operating expenses. See Expenses & Fees for more information.
2. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated.  Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.
3. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
4. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
5. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time.  They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments.  The Top Ten Holdings and Top 5 Issuers do not include money market instruments or futures contracts, if any.  Depository receipts are normally combined with the underlying security.  Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different.Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment option reports its holdings. Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section. Some report them in this section in addition to the equity, bond and other allocation shown. Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown. If the allocation without the foreign component equals (or rounds to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
6. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
7. The percent of net assets invested in both domestic and foreign Equities (common stocks, preferred stocks, rights and warrants, convertible preferred stocks and stock index futures and options), Bond (all debt instruments, including investment grade, non-investment grade, non-rated securities and convertible bonds), and Cash & Net Other Assets (cash, repurchase agreements, receivables and payables).
8. "Tax-Advantaged Domiciles" represent countries whose tax policies may be favorable for company incorporation.
9. Net Other Assets can include fund receivables, fund payables, and offsets to other derivative positions, as well as certain assets that do not fall into any of the Portfolio Composition categories. Depending on the extent to which the fund invests in derivatives and the number of positions that are held for future settlement, Net Other Assets can be a negative number.
10. StyleMap® depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's equity holdings over two dimensions: market capitalization and valuation. The percentage of fund assets represented by these holdings is indicated beside each StyleMap. Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's equity holdings (e.g., domestic stocks, foreign stocks, and American Depositary Receipts), are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.
11. Expense Cap is a limit that the fund company has placed on the level of the expenses borne by the fund until 3/31/2021 and indicates the maximum level of expenses (with certain exceptions) that the fund would be paying until that time.  After the expiration date, the expense cap may be terminated or revised, which may lower the fund's yield and return.


Generally, data on Fidelity mutual funds is provided by FMR, LLC, Morningstar ratings and data on non-Fidelity mutual funds is provided by Morningstar, Inc. and data on non-mutual fund products is provided by the product's investment manager, trustee or issuer or the plan sponsor whose plan is offering the product to  participants.  Although Fidelity believes the data gathered from these third-party sources is reliable, it does not review such information and cannot warrant it to be accurate, complete or timely.  Fidelity is not responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this third-party information.

Summary







 


Overall Rating

4 out of 5 Stars

Morningstar has awarded this fund 4 stars based on its risk-adjusted performance compared to the 356 funds within its Morningstar Category.



How is it determined?


The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics, which are based on risk-adjusted returns, as of the date stated.

What does it mean?


A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.











 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average


This fund scores Average because it delivered returns that were in the middle 35% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category: top 10% - High next 22.5% - Above Average middle 35% - Average next 22.5% - Below Average bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Expenses


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Low


This fund's expenses are rated as Low because they are below the 20th percentile when compared with other funds in the category.







How is it calculated?


This Morningstar data point compares the fund's net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its Morningstar Category grouping.





What does it mean?


Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.




How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Fund Overview




Objective



Seeks capital appreciation.




Strategy



Investing in securities of companies that possess valuable fixed assets or that FMR believes are undervalued in the marketplace in relation to factors such as assets, earnings, or growth potential (stocks of these companies are often called "value" stocks). Normally investing primarily in common stocks.


Risk



Stock markets, especially foreign markets, are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Foreign securities are subject to interest rate, currency exchange rate, economic, and political risks.  Value stocks can perform differently than other types of stocks and can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.



Short Term Redemption Fee
None



Who May Want To Invest

Someone who is seeking the potential for long-term share-price appreciation and, secondarily, dividend income.
Someone who is comfortable with value-style investments and the potentially greater volatility of investments in smaller companies.

Additional Disclosures

This description is only intended to provide a brief overview of the mutual fund. Read the fund's prospectus for more detailed information about the fund.
On May 9, 2008, an initial offering of the retirement (K) class took place.  Returns and expenses prior to that date are those of the non-K, non-advisor class. Had K class expenses been reflected in the returns shown, total returns would have been higher.

Risk


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average

This fund scores Average because Morningstar has rated its risk between the 40th and 60th percentiles when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.




How is it calculated?


Risk is calculated using the Sharpe ratio, which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to U.S. Treasury bonds, relative to the fund's overall volatility. For this measure, Morningstar has compared the Sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in it's Morningstar Category.




What does it mean?


A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.










 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average


This fund scores Average because it delivered returns that were in the middle 35% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category: top 10% - High next 22.5% - Above Average middle 35% - Average next 22.5% - Below Average bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.




How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Stock markets, especially foreign markets, are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Foreign securities are subject to interest rate, currency exchange rate, economic, and political risks.  Value stocks can perform differently than other types of stocks and can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. (Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.) It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of  funds in each fund category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

The Morningstar information contained herein: (1) is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers; (2) may not be copied or redistributed; and (3) is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated.  Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.
2. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
3. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
4. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time.  They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments.  The Top Ten Holdings and Top 5 Issuers do not include money market instruments or futures contracts, if any.  Depository receipts are normally combined with the underlying security.  Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different.Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment option reports its holdings. Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section. Some report them in this section in addition to the equity, bond and other allocation shown. Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown. If the allocation without the foreign component equals (or rounds to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
5. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
6. The percent of net assets invested in both domestic and foreign Equities (common stocks, preferred stocks, rights and warrants, convertible preferred stocks and stock index futures and options), Bond (all debt instruments, including investment grade, non-investment grade, non-rated securities and convertible bonds), and Cash & Net Other Assets (cash, repurchase agreements, receivables and payables).
7. "Tax-Advantaged Domiciles" represent countries whose tax policies may be favorable for company incorporation.
8. Net Other Assets can include fund receivables, fund payables, and offsets to other derivative positions, as well as certain assets that do not fall into any of the Portfolio Composition categories. Depending on the extent to which the fund invests in derivatives and the number of positions that are held for future settlement, Net Other Assets can be a negative number.
9. StyleMap® depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's equity holdings over two dimensions: market capitalization and valuation. The percentage of fund assets represented by these holdings is indicated beside each StyleMap. Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's equity holdings (e.g., domestic stocks, foreign stocks, and American Depositary Receipts), are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.


Generally, the issuer of a mutual fund is the fund or trust which issues the shares; the issuer of collective investment trusts is the underlying trust or investment vehicle which issues the units; the issuer of a stock fund is the company which issues the shares; the issuer of options such as separate accounts and strategies is the plan which makes them available; the issuer of a fixed return option is the insurance company or other company which offers the investment; the issuer of an annuity contract is the insurance company and/or the insurance company separate account.

Generally, data on Fidelity mutual funds is provided by FMR, LLC, Morningstar ratings and data on non-Fidelity mutual funds is provided by Morningstar, Inc. and data on non-mutual fund products is provided by the product's investment manager, trustee or issuer or the plan sponsor whose plan is offering the product to  participants.  Although Fidelity believes the data gathered from these third-party sources is reliable, it does not review such information and cannot warrant it to be accurate, complete or timely.  Fidelity is not responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this third-party information.

Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the fund or annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a free prospectus and, if available, summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.
