(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed financial statements and the notes thereto of the Direxion ETF Trust II (the "Trust") included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K.  Forward-Looking Information  This Annual Report on Form 10-K, including this "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," contains forward-looking statements regarding the plans and objectives of management for future operations. This information may involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the Funds' or the Trust's actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements, which involve assumptions and describe the Funds' or the Trust's future plans, strategies and expectations, are generally identifiable by use of the words "may," "will," "should," "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," "believe," "intend" or "project," the negative of these words, other variations on these words or comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements are based on assumptions that may be incorrect, and the Trust cannot assure investors that the projections included in these forward-looking statements will come to pass. None of the Trust, the Sponsor or the Trustee is under a duty to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform such statements to actual results. The Funds' and the Trust's actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors.  The Funds and the Trust have based the forward-looking statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K on information available to it on the date of this annual report on Form 10-K, and the Funds and the Trust assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Although the Trust Funds and the undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new  Table of Contents  information, future events or otherwise, investors are advised to consult any additional disclosures that the Funds and the Trust may make directly to them or through reports that the Funds and the Trust in the future files with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.  Introduction  As further described in Item 1 in the Annual Report on Form 10-K the Direxion Shares ETF Trust II (the "Trust") was organized as a Delaware statutory trust on July 12, 2010 and is currently organized into twelve separate series (each a "Fund" and collectively, the "Funds"): Direxion Daily Gold Bull 3X Shares, Direxion Daily Gold Bear 3X Shares, Direxion Daily Silver Bull 3X Shares, Direxion Daily Silver Bear 3X Shares, Direxion Daily Japanese Yen Bull 3X Shares, Direxion Daily Japanese Yen Bear 3X Shares, Direxion Daily Dollar Bull 3X Shares, Direxion Daily Dollar Bear 3X Shares, Direxion Daily Euro Bull 3X Shares, Direxion Daily Euro Bear 3X Shares, Direxion Daily Gold Bear 1X Shares and Direxion Daily Silver Bear 1X Shares. Each series of the Trust listed above issues common units of beneficial interest which represent units of fractional undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of that respective Fund ("Shares").  Direxion Asset Management, LLC (the "Sponsor") serves as the Trust's commodity pool operator and commodity trading advisor with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC") and is a member of the National Futures Association ("NFA"). Wilmington Trust Company serves as the Trustee of the Trust (the "Trustee"). The Funds are commodity pools, as defined under the Commodity Exchange Act (the "CEA") and the applicable regulations of the CFTC are operated by the Sponsor. The Trust is not an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. Each Fund seeks to provide daily leveraged investment results (before fees and expenses) which correspond to the performance of a particular index, commodity or currency on a given day. Groups of Funds are collectively referred to in the Annual Report on Report 10-K in several different ways. The Funds with the word "Bull" in their name attempt to provide daily leveraged investment results (before fees and expenses) that correlate positively to the return of an index or benchmark. The Funds with the word "Bear" in their name attempt to provide daily leveraged investment results that correlate negatively to the return of an index or benchmark.  The Bull 3X Funds attempt to provide daily leveraged investment results (before fees and expenses) that correlate positively to three times (300%) the daily return of its target benchmark. The Bear 3X Funds attempt to provide daily leveraged investment results (before fees and expenses) that correlate to three times the inverse (-300%) of the daily return of its target benchmark. The Bear 1X Funds attempt to provide daily investment results (before fees and expenses) that correlate negatively to the return of an index or benchmark. These Bear Funds seek -100% of the returns of their benchmark indices. None of the Funds seek to achieve their stated objective over a period greater than one day.  Each Fund intends to obtain exposure to its benchmark by taking long or short positions in futures contracts on its underlying commodity or currency, as applicable. In the event position accountability rules or position limits are reached with respect to the futures contracts, the Sponsor may, in its commercially reasonable judgment, cause the effected Fund to obtain exposure to its benchmark through cash-settled, exchanged-traded swaps and other over-the-counter transactions that are based on the price of the futures contracts ("Financial Instruments"), if such instruments tend to exhibit trading prices or returns that correlate with the related futures contract and will further the investment objective of such Fund.  Each Fund seeks investment results for a single day only, not for longer periods. A "single day" is measured from the time a Fund calculates its respective net asset value per Share to the time of the Fund's next NAV calculation. This is different from most exchange-traded funds and means that the return of such Fund for a period longer than a single trading day will be the result of each day's returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from -1 time, -3 times or 3 times of the return of the index to which such Fund is benchmarked for that period. In periods of higher market volatility, the volatility of the benchmark may be at least as important to a Fund's return for the period as the return of the benchmark. These Funds are riskier than  Table of Contents  similarly benchmarked exchange-traded funds that are not leveraged or inversed. Accordingly, these Funds may not be suitable for all investors and should be used only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged, inverse or inverse leveraged investment results. Shareholders who invest in the Funds should actively manage and monitor their investments, as frequently as daily.  Each Fund continuously offers and redeems its Shares in blocks of 50,000 Shares. Only Authorized Participants may purchase and redeem Shares from a Fund and then only in Creation Units. An Authorized Participant is an entity that has entered into an Authorized Participant Agreement with one or more of the Funds. Shares of the Funds are offered to Authorized Participants in Creation Units at each Fund's respective NAV. Authorized Participants may then offer to the public, from time to time, Shares from any Creation Unit they create at a per-Share market price that varies depending on, among other factors, the trading price of the Shares of each Fund on the NYSE Arca, the NAV and the supply of and demand for the Shares at the time of the offer. Shares from the same Creation Unit may be offered at different times and may have different offering prices based upon the above factors. The form of Authorized Participant Agreement and related Authorized Participant Handbook set forth the terms and conditions under which an Authorized Participant may purchase or redeem a Creation Unit. Authorized Participants do not receive from any Fund, the Sponsor, or any of their affiliates, any underwriting fees or compensation in connection with their sale of Shares to the public.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  A significant portion of the NAV of each Fund is likely to be held in cash and/or U.S. Treasury Securities or other high credit quality short-term fixed-income or similar securities as described above. A portion of these investments may be posted as collateral in connection with swap agreements and/or used as margin for each Fund's trading in futures. Margin requirements in respect of swap agreements are the subject of pending rule proposals issued by the CFTC and the U.S. bank regulators. It is possible that increased margin will apply to swap agreements upon adoption of the new requirements by these regulators. The percentage that U.S. Treasury bills and other short-term fixed-income securities will bear to the total net assets of each Fund will vary from period to period as the market values of the underlying swaps, futures contracts and forward contracts change. During the period ended June 30, 2014, each of the Funds earned interest income as follows:   Interest Income Period Ended June 30, 2014 Direxion Daily Gold Bull 3X Shares* $ 73 Direxion Daily Gold Bear 3X Shares* 80  * Funds commenced investment operations on April 10, 2014.  Each Fund's underlying futures and swaps, as the case may be, will be subject to periods of illiquidity because of market conditions, regulatory considerations and other reasons. For example, swaps are not presently traded on an exchange, do not have uniform terms and conditions, and in general are not transferable without the consent of the counterparty. Additionally, at the present time, most swaps are not centrally cleared and vary in terms of standardization, which may further contribute to their lack of liquidity. In the case of futures contracts, commodity exchanges may limit fluctuations in certain futures contract prices during a single day by regulations referred to as "daily limits." During a single day, no trades may be executed at prices beyond the daily limit. Once the price of a futures contract has increased or decreased by an amount equal to the daily limit, such positions can neither be taken nor liquidated unless the traders are willing to effect trades at or within the limit. Futures contract prices have occasionally moved the daily limit for several consecutive days with little or no trading. Such market conditions could prevent a Fund from promptly liquidating its futures positions.  Entry into non-cleared swap agreements or forward contracts will further impact liquidity because these contractual agreements are executed on a principal-to-principal basis between private parties and therefore, the time required to offset or "unwind" these positions may be greater than that for cleared and/or exchange-traded instruments. This potential delay could be exacerbated to the extent a counterparty is not a United States person.  Table of Contents  The large size of the positions in which a Fund may acquire increases the risk of illiquidity by both making their positions more difficult to liquidate and increasing the losses incurred while trying to do so. Any type of disruption or illiquidity will potentially be exacerbated due to the fact that the Funds will typically invest in Financial Investments related to one benchmark, which in many cases is highly concentrated.  Because each Fund will enter trade futures and may enter into swap agreements, its capital will be at risk due to changes in the value of these contracts (market risk) or the inability of counterparties to perform under the terms of the contracts (credit risk). Credit risk is greater for non-cleared swaps than for futures or cleared swaps.  Market Risk  Trading in futures contracts will involve each Fund entering into contractual commitments to purchase or sell a commodity underlying a Fund's benchmark at a specified date and price, should it hold such futures contract into the deliverable period. Should a Fund enter into a contractual commitment to sell a physical commodity, it would be required to make delivery of that commodity at the contract price and then repurchase the contract at prevailing market prices or settle in cash. Since the repurchase price to which the value of a commodity can rise is unlimited, entering into commitments to sell commodities would expose a Fund to theoretically unlimited risk.  Each Fund's exposure to market risk will be influenced by a number of factors including the liquidity of the markets in which the contracts are traded and the relationships among the contracts held. The inherent uncertainty of each Fund's trading as well as the development of drastic market occurrences could ultimately lead to a loss of all or substantially all of investors' capital. For more information, see "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" in this Annual Report on Form 10K.  Credit Risk  When a Fund enters into futures contracts, swap agreements or forward contract, the Fund will be exposed to credit risk that the counterparty to the contract will not meet its obligations.  The counterparty for futures contracts traded on exchanges is the clearing house associated with the particular exchange. In general, clearing houses are backed by their corporate members who may be required to share in the financial burden resulting from the nonperformance by one of their members and, as such, should significantly reduce this credit risk. In cases where the clearing house is not backed by the clearing members, it may be backed by a consortium of banks or other financial institutions.  Certain swap and forward agreements are contracted for directly with counterparties. There can be no assurance that any counterparty, clearing member or clearing house will meet its obligations to a Fund.  Forward agreements do not involve the delivery of assets at the onset of a transaction, but may be settled physically in the underlying asset if such contracts are held to expiration, particularly in the case of currency forwards. Thus, prior to settlement, if the counterparty to a forward contract defaults, a Fund's risk of loss will generally consist of the net amount of payments that the Fund is contractually entitled to receive, if any. However, if physically settled forwards are held until expiration (presently, there is no plan to do this), at the time of settlement, a Fund may be at risk for the full notional value of the forward contracts depending on the type of settlement procedures used.  Swap agreements do not generally involve the delivery of securities or other underlying assets either at the outset of a transaction or upon settlement. Accordingly, if the counterparty to a swap agreement defaults, the Fund's risk of loss consists of the net amount of payments that the Fund is contractually entitled to receive, if any.  Table of Contents  The Sponsor will attempt to minimize certain of these market and credit risks by normally:   executing and clearing trades with creditworthy counterparties, as determined by the Sponsor;   limiting the outstanding amounts due from counterparties of the Funds;   not posting margin directly with a counterparty;   limiting the amount of margin or premium posted at the FCM; and   ensuring that deliverable contracts are not held to such a date when delivery of an underlying asset could be called for.  The FCM for each Fund, in accepting orders for the purchase or sale of domestic futures contracts, will be required by CFTC regulations to separately account for and segregate as belonging to the Fund, all assets of the Fund relating to domestic futures trading, and the FCM will not be allowed to commingle such assets with other assets of the FCM.  On November 14, 2012, the CFTC proposed new regulations that would require enhanced customer protections, risk management programs, internal monitoring and controls, capital and liquidity standards, customer disclosures, and auditing and examination programs for FCMs. The proposed rules are intended to afford greater assurances to market participants that: customer segregated funds and secured amounts are protected; customers are provided with appropriate notice of the risks of futures trading and of the FCMs with which they may choose to do business; FCMs are monitoring and managing risks in a robust manner; the capital and liquidity of FCMs are strengthened to safeguard their continued operations; and the auditing and examination programs of the CFTC and the self-regulatory organizations ("SROs") are monitoring the activities of FCMs in a thorough manner. The final regulations have not yet been adopted.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations  As of June 30, 2014, the Funds have not utilized, nor do they expect to utilize in the future, special purpose entities to facilitate off balance sheet financing arrangements and have no loan guarantee arrangements or off balance sheet arrangements of any kind other than agreements entered into in the normal course of business, which may include indemnification provisions related to certain risks service providers undertake in performing services which are in the best interests of the Funds. While each Fund's exposure under such indemnification provisions cannot be estimated, these general business indemnifications are not expected to have a material impact on a Fund's financial position.  Each Fund's contractual obligations are with the Sponsor, certain service providers and with any counterparty to a Financial Instrument. Management fee payments made to the Sponsor are calculated as a fixed percentage of each Fund's NAV. As such, the Sponsor cannot anticipate the amount of payments that will be required under these arrangements for future periods as NAVs are not known until a future date. Historical expenses are shown in the Statement of Income and Expenses. The agreement with the Sponsor may be terminated by either party upon 30 days written notice to the other party.  Critical Accounting Policies  Preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires the application of appropriate accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates. The Sponsor's application of these policies involves judgments and actual results may differ from the estimates used. Each Fund expects to have significant exposure to Financial Instruments. The Funds hold a significant portion of their assets in futures, swaps or forward contracts, all of which are recorded on a trade date basis and at fair value in the financial statements, with changes in fair value reported in the Statement of Income and Expenses. Assets of each Fund not invested in Financial Instruments will be invested in cash and/or U.S. Treasury Securities or other high credit quality short-term fixed-income or  Table of Contents  similar securities (such as shares of money market funds, bank deposits, bank money market accounts, certain variable rate-demand notes and repurchase agreements collateralized by government securities, whether denominated in U.S. or the applicable foreign currency with respect to a Currency Fund) or other interest-bearing securities approved by the CFTC for investment of customer funds, each of which will be held at fair value.  The use of fair value to measure Financial Instruments, with related unrealized gains or losses recognized in earnings in each period, is fundamental to the Trust's and the Funds' financial statements. The fair value of a Financial Instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (the exit price). For financial reporting purposes, the Gold, Silver, Yen and Euro Funds value transactions based upon the daily last sale price value occurring on or before 4:00 p.m. E.T. of a standard futures contract for the current active month published by the CME on or before 4:00  Short-term investments are valued at amortized cost which approximates fair value for daily NAV purposes. For financial reporting purposes, short-term investments are valued at their market price using information provided by a third-party pricing service or market quotations.  Derivatives (e.g., futures, swaps and forward agreements) are generally valued using independent sources and/or agreements with counterparties or other procedures as determined by the Sponsor. Futures contracts, except for those entered into by the Gold, Silver, Yen, Euro and Dollar Funds, are generally valued at the last settled price on the applicable exchange on which that future trades. For financial reporting purposes, all futures contracts are valued at last settled price. If there was no sale on that day, and for non-exchange-traded derivatives, the Sponsor may in its sole discretion choose to determine a fair value price as the basis for determining the market value of such position for such day. Such fair value prices would be generally determined based on available inputs about the current value of the underlying financial instrument or commodity and would be based on principles that the Sponsor deems fair and equitable so long as such principles are consistent with normal industry standards. When market closing prices are not available, the Sponsor may fair value an asset of a Fund pursuant to the policies the Sponsor has adopted, which are consistent with normal industry standards.  The Funds disclose the fair value of their investments in a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. See Note 5 in the Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. Discounts on short-term securities purchased are amortized and reflected as Interest Income in the Statement of Income and Expenses. Realized gains (losses) and changes in unrealized gain (loss) on open positions are determined on a specific identification basis and recognized in the Statement of Income and Expenses in the period in which the contract is closed or the changes occur, respectively.  Each Fund pays its respective brokerage commissions, including applicable exchange fees, NFA fees, give-up fees, pit brokerage fees and other transaction related fees and expenses charged in connection with trading activities for each Fund's investment in U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulated investments. Brokerage commissions on futures contracts are recognized on a half-turn basis.  Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the 1933 Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an "emerging growth company" can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. The Trust has elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. The Trust and the Funds' financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.  Table of Contents  Results of Operations for the Period Ended June 30, 2014  The Sponsor contributed $1,000 to each of the Funds for 25 Units. This capital contribution represented the initial contribution to the Trust. On December 23, 2013, the Sponsor received a notice of effectiveness from the SEC on Form S-1 for its registration of 2,500,000 units, respectively, in the Direxion Daily Gold Bull 3X Shares and Direxion Daily Gold Bear 3X Shares, as well as, 1,250,000 units, respectively, in the Direxion Daily Japanese Yen Bull 3X Shares and Direxion Daily Japanese Yen Bear 3X Shares. The Direxion Daily Silver Bull 3X Shares, Direxion Daily Silver Bear 3X Shares, Direxion Daily Dollar Bull 3X Shares, Direxion Daily Dollar Bear 3X Shares, Direxion Daily Euro Bull 3X Shares, Direxion Daily Euro Bear 3X Shares, Direxion Daily Gold Bear 1X Shares and Direxion Daily Silver Bear 1X Shares were also deemed effective by the SEC on that same day for their registration of 50,000 units. On March 25, 2014, the Funds received approval for their disclosure document from the NFA.  Each Fund's Shares will be offered separately. The Shares of each Fund will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE Arca"). As of June 30, 2014, each of the Funds had seed capital of $1,000, but only two of the Funds, Direxion Daily Gold Bull 3X Shares, Direxion Daily Gold Bear 3X Shares ("Gold 3X Funds"), commenced trading on the NYSE Arca on April 10, 2014. For the period ended June 30, 2014 other than the Gold 3X Funds no other Funds had commenced operations.  Expenses incurred in connection with organizing the Funds and the offering of the Shares upon commencement of its trading operations will be paid by Rafferty Asset Management, LLC, the parent and sole owner of the Sponsor. Expenses incurred in connection with the continuous offering of Shares of the Funds after the commencement of its trading operations will be paid by the Funds. Rafferty Asset Management, LLC will also pay all expenses incurred by the Sponsor in connection with its organization and operation until the commencement of each Fund's trading operations.  The Bull 3X Funds attempt to provide daily leveraged investment results (before fees and expenses) that correlate positively to three times (300%) the daily return of its target benchmark. The Bear 3X Funds attempt to provide daily leveraged investment results (before fees and expenses) that correlate to three times the inverse (-300%) of the daily return of its target benchmark.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Direxion Shares Exchange Traded Fund Trust (JNUG): ‘Mother of All Bubbles’ Keeps Gold in Focus

 Frank Holmes-July 24, 2017, 7:25 PM EDT

Today I want to discuss reports that global debt levels are at all-time highs, and what this means for your investment decisions going forward.
But first, a few comments about last week. I recently returned from the Oxford Club’s Private Wealth Seminar, held at the historic Grand Hotel on Michigan’s Mackinac Island. The hotel, which some of you might remember as the setting for the 1980 film “Somewhere in Time,” starring Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour, took a mere 93 days to build in the 1880s—impossible by today’s standards, especially when you consider that it boasts the world’s largest front porch at 660 feet.
While there, I had the privilege of catching up with some old friends and contacts, including Alex Green, the Oxford Club’s chief investment strategist. You might have read some of his wonderful work for Investment U, the group’s educational arm.
Alex reminded me over lunch that the difference between Democrats and Republicans, in his view, is that Democrats are for personal freedom and some economic restrictions, while Republicans are for economic freedom and some personal restrictions.
I prefer to focus on policies instead of partisan politics, but Alex has a point. I’m convinced that Donald Trump, a Republican, won the presidential election because his pledge to reform the tax code and deregulate resonated with both white-collar and blue-collar Americans who felt as if the U.S. economy was no longer working for them. U.S. corporate taxes are among the highest in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), spurring large multinationals to move operations overseas, and out-of-control regulations threaten to strangle business growth.
But just as Green insinuated, the Trump administration has enacted, or has hinted at enacting, policies that rankle Americans of all political stripes, precisely because they could be used to encroach upon personal liberties.
Take Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ recent decision to strengthen the government’s ability to seize private property from suspected criminals. (The operative word here is “suspected.”) Many now are arguing this directive could be abused by police and other officials. It could, in fact, violate the Fourth Amendment, which of course protects Americans against “unreasonable searches and seizures.”
This is just one among numerous policy-making decisions that have members of both political parties, as well as independents, scratching their heads. Trump was elected to reform taxes, slash regulations and generally make business and capital formation run more smoothly. It’s unclear how private-asset seizures fit into that picture.
If this administration resolved to stay on message and on course, and worked to bring fiscal relief to everyday Americans, it might receive greater support from those who voted for Trump—and perhaps even from those who didn’t.
U.S. Dollar in Bear Market, a Boon for Gold
Since the start of the year, the five-year Treasury yield, adjusted for inflation, has risen about 150 percent. Normally this would put remarkable pressure on the price of gold—higher yields raise the opportunity cost of buying gold—but over the same period, the U.S. dollar has steadily weakened and is now officially in a bear market. Because gold is priced in dollars, this has been supportive for prices. Year-to-date, the yellow metal is up more than 8 percent.




As I said, the greenback’s been on the decline for most of the year so far, but it slumped to a 13-month low against the euro last week following European Central Bank (ECB) president Mario Draghi’s remark that “monetary accommodation” would continue in the European Union (EU) until at least the end of the year.







“We need to be persistent and patient and prudent, because we’re not there yet,” Draghi said, referring to the fact that EU inflation and wage growth have been disappointingly slow, despite the bloc’s economic recovery since the financial crisis. (Indeed, the June purchasing manager’s indexes for emerging European markets were all above the key 50 mark for the first time in recent memory.)
UBS: We’re Still Constructive on Gold
That gold is still holding at its current level—despite rising rates, despite a stock market that continues to rally—is “encouraging.”
That’s one of the key takeaways from a UBS note last week, in which the Swiss financial services firm maintains its constructive view of the yellow metal. Investor demand this year has been slower than expected, but UBS analyst Joni Teves makes the case that expectations of a good monsoon season in India this summer could help push consumption in the world’s second-largest importer of gold to a new record high by the end of the year. With India having imported a phenomenal 525 metric tons in the first half of 2017 alone, Teves writes that “we expect gold demand in India this year to be around historic averages,” which would be very supportive for prices.
ETPs Attracted a Record $245 Billion in the First Half of 2017
Like gold in India, exchange-traded products (ETPs) also had a knockout first half. As Deutsche Bank reports, ETPs attracted a record $245 billion in the first six months of 2017, in what has historically been the weaker half of the year. To put into perspective just how impressive this figure is, $245 billion would be the second-largest full-year record amount following 2016’s $283 billion. We could see ETP inflows climb as high as $500 billion by the end of this year, Deutsche estimates.



Of course, runaway demand for ETPs and other risk assets has contributed to muted interest in gold.
Having said that, though, BullionVault—the world’s number one online precious metals market—reported recently that private gold holdings among its users leaped to a record 38 metric tons, as of the beginning of July. That’s enough gold to make more than 10 million 18-carat wedding rings, BullionVault says, or to supply the microchips for 1.5 billion iPhones. The site points out that investor demand has lately been driven by lower prices, following three months of “light liquidation.”
Global Debt on Alert
All of what I’ve said so far pertains to the near-term. Gold’s medium- to long-term investment case, I believe, looks even brighter. Many unsettling risks loom on the horizon—not least of which is a record amount of global debt—that could potentially spell trouble for the investor who hasn’t adequately prepared with some allocation in a “safe haven.”
According to the highly-respected Institute of International Finance (IIF), global debt levels reached an astronomical $217 trillion in the first quarter of 2017—that’s 327 percent of world gross domestic product (GDP). Notice that before the financial crisis, global debt was “only” around $150 trillion, meaning we’ve added close to $120 trillion in as little as a decade. Much of the leveraging occurred in emerging markets, specifically China, which is spending big on international infrastructure projects.




It goes without saying that this is a huge risk. Some are calling this mountain of debt “the mother of all bubbles,” and we all remember how the last two bubbles ended, in 2000 (the tech or dotcom bubble) and 2007 (the housing bubble).
Paying down this debt will not be easy. As Scotiabank mentioned in a note last week: “Higher interest rates are going to make the burden of refinancing the debt considerably heavier, and as more money goes into servicing the debt, it means less money is available to spend on other things, which could lead to less infrastructure spending and increased austerity.”
Add to this the fact that global pension levels are also sharply on the rise, with people living longer and population growth—and therefore workforce growth—slowing in many advanced economies. In May, the World Economic Forum (WEF) estimated that by 2050, the size of the retirement savings gap—unfunded pensions, in other words—could be as much as $400 trillion, an unimaginably large number.
The U.S. alone adds about $3 trillion every year to the pension deficit. I shared with you earlier in the month that the State of Illinois’s unfunded pensions could be as high as $250 billion, putting each Illinoisan on the hook for $56,000.
Central banks’ efforts to promote economic growth through monetary easing haven’t exactly been a raging success, nor can they continue forever. Plus, near-zero interest rates are precisely what encouraged such inflated levels of borrowing in the first place.
You can probably tell where I’m headed with all of this. Another crisis could be in the works. Savvy investors and savers might very well see this as a sign to allocate a part of their portfolios in “safe haven” assets that have historically held their value in times of economic contraction.
Gold is one such asset that’s been a good store of value in such times, and gold stocks have tended to outperform the yellow metal as production costs have fallen, according to Seabridge Gold. I always recommend a 10 percent weighting in gold—5 percent in bars and coins; 5 percent in gold stocks, mutual funds or ETFs.

Direxion Shares Exchange Traded Fund Trust (JNUG): ‘Mother of All Bubbles’ Keeps Gold in Focus

 Frank Holmes-July 24, 2017, 7:25 PM EDT

Today I want to discuss reports that global debt levels are at all-time highs, and what this means for your investment decisions going forward.
But first, a few comments about last week. I recently returned from the Oxford Club’s Private Wealth Seminar, held at the historic Grand Hotel on Michigan’s Mackinac Island. The hotel, which some of you might remember as the setting for the 1980 film “Somewhere in Time,” starring Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour, took a mere 93 days to build in the 1880s—impossible by today’s standards, especially when you consider that it boasts the world’s largest front porch at 660 feet.
While there, I had the privilege of catching up with some old friends and contacts, including Alex Green, the Oxford Club’s chief investment strategist. You might have read some of his wonderful work for Investment U, the group’s educational arm.

    Exchange-Traded Funds  





+ Share 



 
 









 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production Select Industry Index (SPSIOPTR) is provided by Standard & Poor’s Index Provider and includes domestic companies from the oil and gas exploration and production sub-industry. The Index is designed to measure the performance of a sub-industry or group of sub-industries determined based on the Global Industry Classification Standards (GICS). One cannot directly invest in an index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

Overview of the Direxion All Cap Insider Sentiment ETF | Direxion


























 






























Why KNOW? Why now?
Since inception, the Direxion All Cap Insider Sentiment Shares ETF (Ticker: KNOW) has outperfomed the major U.S. stock indexes including the: S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400, S&P SmallCap 600 and S&P1500 (source: Morningstar Direct). 
It makes sense. Corporate insiders− top officers, boards of directors, and major shareholders − have a natural edge over retail investors, and even financial analysts, because they typically know their businesses and industries better than anyone. That’s why, no matter how much research you do, or how much financial news you consume, you’re always a step behind those “in the know”.
The Direxion All Cap Insider Sentiment Shares (KNOW) is designed to help long term-investors pursue better portfolio outcomes by using insider sentiment to seek alpha relative to S&P 500® Index.
With a net expense ratio of just 0.65%, this strategic index-based ETF provides investors with cost-effective access to stocks that corporate officers, directors, and shareholders who own more than 5% of each company’s stock, are accumulating.
This insider sentiment selection uses a screening methodology based on public-company filings and positive earnings analysis that provides the basis for the funds’ quantitatively-weighted indexes. The ETF is comprised of 100 companies selected from the S&P 1500 Index.

NEW YORK, May 26, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- The Direxion Shares ETF Trust II has decided to liquidate and close the Direxion Daily Gold Bull 3X Shares (Ticker: BAR) exchange-traded fund ("the Fund") based on the recommendation of Direxion Asset Management, LLC ("Direxion"), the Fund's Sponsor.
Due to the Fund's inability to attract sufficient investment assets, Direxion believes the Fund cannot continue to conduct its business and operations in an economically efficient manner. As a result, Direxion concluded that liquidating and closing the Fund would be in the best interests of the Fund and its shareholders.
Shares of the Fund will stop trading on the NYSE Arca, Inc., and will no longer be open to purchase by investors, after the close of regular trading on June 19, 2015. Shareholders may sell their holdings in the Fund prior to June 19, 2015, and those transactions may be subject to customary brokerage charges. Between June 22, 2015 and June 26, 2015, shareholders may only be able to sell their shares to certain broker-dealers and there is no assurance that there will be a market for the Fund during that time period.
On June 26, 2015, the Fund will liquidate its assets and distribute cash pro rata to shareholders who have not previously redeemed or exchanged their shares. These payments are taxable and will include any accrued capital gains and dividends. The Fund's net asset value will reflect the costs of closing the Fund as calculated on the liquidation date. The Fund will close when the distributions are complete.
The process of closing down and liquidating the Fund's portfolio, scheduled to take place between June 22, 2015 and June 26, 2015, will result in the Fund not tracking its underlying index and experiencing an increase in cash holdings. These developments may not be consistent with the Fund's investment objective and strategy.
For more information about the liquidation and termination process, please contact Direxion Investments at 800-851-0511. For media inquiries, please contact James Doyle at 973-850-7308 or jdoyle@jcprinc.com.

The prospectus and summary prospectus contains this and other information about Direxion ETFs. Download a prospectus and summary prospectus at www.direxioninvestments.com. The prospectus and summary prospectus should be read carefully before investing.
The Fund has a limited operating history, meaning there is little performance history that might serve as a basis to evaluate an investment in the Trust. The Sponsor has limited experience operating commodity pools.
The fund is not a mutual fund or any other type of investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and is not subject to regulation thereof. Unlike mutual funds, the fund generally will not distribute dividends to shareholders.
There is no guarantee that the fund will achieve its objective.
For more information on all Direxion ETFs, go to direxioninvestments.com, or call us at 866.476.7523.
Risks of the Fund: 
Investing in the Fund subjects an investor to the risks of the applicable commodity market, which investment could result in substantial fluctuations in the price of Fund shares and the possible loss of principal. Commodities and futures generally are volatile and are not suitable for all investors. The Fund is non-diversified and includes risks associated with concentration that results from the Fund's investment in a particular industry or sector, which can increase volatility. The use of derivatives such as futures contracts, forward contracts, options and swaps are subject to market risks that may cause their price to fluctuate over time. The Fund does not attempt to, and should not be expected to; provide returns which are a multiple of the return of the Index for periods other than a single day. For other risks including correlation, leverage, compounding, market volatility and specific risks regarding each sector, please read the prospectus.

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
