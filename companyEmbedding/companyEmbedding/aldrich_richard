Certificates of Analysis






A Certificate of Analysis is a document issued by Quality Assurance that confirms that a regulated product meets its product specification. 

They commonly contain the actual results obtained from testing performed as part of quality control of an individual batch of a product.

You can use the links to the right of this page to search for or request certificates of analysis for products. 

Certificates of Analysis can also be obtained by entering the relevant batch number in the appropriate box generally displayed to the left of a product description on our website (see image below).

Evolving Developments in Cyberlaw: 2017
As technology continues to evolve, the courts are being asked to apply existing laws to the new technology. In some cases, the answer is fairly straightforward, but in other cases it is more complicated and can yield varying outcomes based on how each court understands the technology and the legislators’ intent in passing the law.  The presentation addressed cases over the past year in three main areas: (1) “unauthorized access” under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), (2) encryption, and (3) searches and seizures generally.

His multimedia works are typically created in oil and wax, also incorporating elements such as pencil, collage, charcoal and metal. This new catalogue, published by Bortolami Gallery, is part traditional monograph and part artist�s book. It features a selection of 88 abstract, multimedia works made between 2003 and 2013, and as such is the most comprehensive survey of Aldrich�s work to date. The plates have been laid out to wrap around from one page to the next, across the book�s French folds, so that, literally and figuratively, each painting is viewed with a part of the next painting in mind. This unusual design feature creates elegant and sometimes jarring juxtapositions that are entirely unique to the book itself.PUBLISHER Bortolami GalleryBOOK FORMAT Paperback, 8.5 x 11 in. / 96 pgs / 88 color.PUBLISHING STATUS Pub Date 9/30/2013ActiveDISTRIBUTION D.A.P.

Introduction by Dominic Molon. Text by Laura Fried, Forrest Nash.Traversing abstraction, drawn or printed text, collage, sculptural effects and humorous figuration, the work of Richard Aldrich (born 1975) constitutes an index of possibilities in painting. Aldrich frequently integrates objects such as canvas scraps or book pages in his works, citing rather than deploying the idea of a picture plane, and also loads his works with literary and personal references. For his first solo museum exhibition at the Contemporary Art Museum St. Louis, Aldrich presents 20 large-scale works alongside paintings by Edouard Vuillard, Pierre Bonnard and the Irish portraitist Sir William Orpen, selected from the Museum's permanent collection. These three nineteenth-century artists have very little in common with Aldrich, and yet are ideally counterpointed against his paintings, refocusing the works of all four in fascinating ways. Published on the occasion of this exhibition, this volume records this exemplarily adventurous exhibition.PUBLISHER Contemporary Art Museum St. LouisBOOK FORMAT Paperback, 8 x 10.75 in. / 104 pgs / illustrated throughout.PUBLISHING STATUS Pub Date 9/30/2011ActiveDISTRIBUTION D.A.P.

 As we become ever-more aware of how our governments “eavesdrop” on our conversations, here is a gripping exploration of this unknown realm of the British secret service: Government Communication Headquarters (GCHQ).GCHQ is the successor to the famous Bletchley Park wartime code-breaking organisation and is the largest and most secretive intelligence organisation in the country. During the war, it commanded more staff than MI5 and MI6 combined and has produced a number of intelligence triumphs, as well as some notable failures. Since the end of the Cold War, it has played a pivotal role in shaping Britain's secret state. Still, we know almost nothing about it.In this ground-breaking new book, Richard Aldrich traces GCHQ's evolvement from a wartime code-breaking operation based in the Bedfordshire countryside, staffed by eccentric crossword puzzlers, to one of the world leading espionage organisations. It is packed full of dramatic spy stories that shed fresh light on Britain's role in the Cold War – from the secret tunnels dug beneath Vienna and Berlin to tap Soviet phone lines, and daring submarine missions to gather intelligence from the Soviet fleet, to the notorious case of Geoffrey Pine, one of the most damaging moles ever recruited by the Soviets inside British intelligence. The book reveals for the first time how GCHQ operators based in Cheltenham affected the outcome of military confrontations in far-flung locations such as Indonesia and Malaya, and exposes the shocking case of three GCHQ workers who were killed in an infamous shootout with terrorists while working undercover in Turkey.Today's GCHQ struggles with some of the most difficult issues of our time. A leading force of the state's security efforts against militant terrorist organisations like Al-Qaeda, they are also involved in fundamental issues that will mould the future of British society. Compelling and revelatory, Aldrich's book is the crucial missing link in Britain’s intelligence history.

Review
‘Thoroughly engaging’ Daily Telegraph‘Skilfully weaves together the personal, political, military and technological dimensions of electronic espionage’ Economist‘Aldrich packs in vast amounts of information, while managing to remain very readable. He paints the broad picture, but also introduces fascinating detail.’ Literary Review‘Richard J. Aldrich is an outstanding analyst and historian of intelligence and he tells this story well…an important book, which will make readers think uncomfortably not only about the state’s power to monitor our lives, but also the appalling vulnerability of every society in thrall to communications technology as we are.’ Max Hastings, Sunday Times‘This is a sober and valuable work of scholarship, which is as reliable as anything ever is in the twilight world of intelligence-gathering. Yet there is nothing dry about it. Aldrich knows how to write for a wider audience, while avoiding the speculations, inventions, sensationalism and sheer silliness of so much modern work on the subject’ Spectator

The line 'there are no secrets, just lazy researchers' is very apt.The information about some of the big stories of the last century are fascinating - the General Belgrano where SIGINT had picked up a command for it to proceed to task force and sink British ships, and its zig zag course meant that it was true when the Argentinians said it was outside exclusion zone, and sailing away from Falkland islands at the time it was hit.  There was no other real decision for the British commanders to take.As someone who lives in Cheltenham, it is great to see some of the big episodes of GCHQ, and also the relationship with the US.First class book and to be recommended for anyone with an interest in this area!Read more0Comment|

Stillwellon 18 October 2010Format: HardcoverAmerica's signals intelligence "special relationship" with the UK was surprising to me, as it really does (did?) seem to be close (as opposed to the "special relationship" much touted and abused as a concept by the media nowadays). So I found this book just as interesting from the wider political perspective, as well as the detail about GCHQ's activities.Only drawback for me was the one or two references to how other academics' writings were wrong. Academics can't resist an opportunity for an argument.Read more0Comment|

I do, however, that Aldrich or his proof-readers have devoted just a few seconds to UK locations; Chicksands is not near Baldoch (which is in Hertfordshire), rather Bedford. Likewise, Bletchley somehow landed up in Bedfordshire. Small criticisms, though. The notes and bibliography are breath-taking - and will keep me busy for years to come!Read more0Comment|

Gumbleyon 20 November 2010Format: HardcoverThis is a readable and factual book, which contains a series of accounts of episodes in the history of GCHQ and its associated organisations. The first chapters are a little slow, reading as a list or organisational changes, and I was surprised there were not more pages on the work at Bletchley Park in the Second World War. However, the sections on the Cold War, the Falklands and more recent events are gripping.Read more0Comment|

Item Description: HarperCollins Publishers, United Kingdom, 2011. Paperback. Book Condition: New. Language: English . Brand New Book. As we become ever-more aware of how our governments eavesdrop on our conversations, here is a gripping exploration of this unknown realm of the British secret service: Government Communication Headquarters (GCHQ). GCHQ is the successor to the famous Bletchley Park wartime code-breaking organisation and is the largest and most secretive intelligence organisation in the country. During the war, it commanded more staff than MI5 and MI6 combined and has produced a number of intelligence triumphs, as well as some notable failures. Since the end of the Cold War, it has played a pivotal role in shaping Britain s secret state. Still, we know almost nothing about it. In this ground-breaking new book, Richard Aldrich traces GCHQ s evolvement from a wartime code-breaking operation based in the Bedfordshire countryside, staffed by eccentric crossword puzzlers, to one of the world leading espionage organisations.It is packed full of dramatic spy stories that shed fresh light on Britain s role in the Cold War - from the secret tunnels dug beneath Vienna and Berlin to tap Soviet phone lines, and daring submarine missions to gather intelligence from the Soviet fleet, to the notorious case of Geoffrey Pine, one of the most damaging moles ever recruited by the Soviets inside British intelligence. The book reveals for the first time how GCHQ operators based in Cheltenham affected the outcome of military confrontations in far-flung locations such as Indonesia and Malaya, and exposes the shocking case of three GCHQ workers who were killed in an infamous shootout with terrorists while working undercover in Turkey. Today s GCHQ struggles with some of the most difficult issues of our time. A leading force of the state s security efforts against militant terrorist organisations like Al-Qaeda, they are also involved in fundamental issues that will mould the future of British society. Compelling and revelatory, Aldrich s book is the crucial missing link in Britain s intelligence history.  Bookseller Inventory # AA89780007312665
