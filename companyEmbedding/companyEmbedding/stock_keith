Brand Profile




BRAND PROFILE
 

CHARLES & KEITH was established in 1996 by fashion entrepreneurs Charles Wong and Keith Wong with the foresight of providing fashionable footwear that was tailored to the sizes of Asian women.
 
A lifestyle brand that transforms the latest trends into accessible fashion, CHARLES & KEITH’s product offerings have diversified to include bags, accessories and costume jewellery that inspire with experimental designs. The brand is the fashion destination for stylish urbanites and is synonymous with curated collections of relevant designs.
 
From a single store in Singapore, CHARLES & KEITH has grown to more than 500 stores in Asia Pacific, Europe and the Middle East. CHARLES & KEITH has garnered a strong presence both online at CHARLESKEITH.COM as well as in fashion cities such as Dubai, Seoul, Shanghai and Taipei. The brand has also began its foray into locations such as Macau’s The Venetian and pop-up stores in Paris’s Galeries Lafayette in the last three years.
 
CHARLES & KEITH also believes in being socially responsible by being an advocate for various Humanitarian Causes as well as Human Excellence and Environmental Initiatives. Since 2010, the brand has initiated the use of Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified paper to reduce its carbon footprint.
 
Through the years, CHARLES & KEITH has collaborated with international organisations such as United Nations Entity for Gender Equality (UNWOMEN), Breast Cancer Foundation and Earth Hour in support of various philanthropic and environmental causes.

Capture Growth In An Emerging Market Consumer Spending ETF









































































                        The emerging market consumer story may not be a new one, but it is certainly a compelling one. Would it surprise you to learn, however,
                        that some of the leading indexes focused on emerging market consumers do not typically incorporate valuation measures? We believe this may expose
                        investors to undue risk. The WisdomTree Emerging Markets Consumer Growth Fund, EMCG, seeks to help investors more fully capitalize on the
                        emerging market consumer growth trends, while maintaining a sensitivity to valuation.

Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Funds before investing. To obtain a prospectus containing this and other important information, please call 1-866-909-WISE (9473) or click here to download a prospectus online. Read the prospectus carefully before you invest.

                                    There are risks associated with investing, including possible loss of principal.  Foreign investing involves special risks, such as risk of loss from currency fluctuation or political or economic uncertainty.  Funds focusing on a single sector and/or smaller companies generally experience greater price volatility.  Investments in emerging, offshore or frontier markets are generally less liquid and less efficient than investments in developed markets and are subject to additional risks, such as risks of adverse governmental regulation, intervention and political developments.  Due to the investment strategy of this Fund it may make higher capital gain distributions than other ETFs.  Please read the Fund’s prospectus for specific details regarding the Fund’s risk profile.

Legal Weed Is Creating a Once in a Lifetime Opportunity 

By MONEY MORNING STAFF REPORTSSearch through your coat pockets… behind the sofa cushions…  the glove compartment of your car.
Because all it takes is some spare change to capitalize on the stock market opportunity of a lifetime: legal marijuana.
If you make the right picks, you could find yourself jumping for joy on top of an enormous pile of cash.
Like it or not, a growing number of states are becoming more  and more accepting of this once illicit practice.
Well over half of the country already has marijuana legally available in some form.
8 states, plus our nation’s capital have made it completely legal to anyone over the age of 21.
And the marijuana stock market is preparing to take off.
Just one tiny investment – even one under $100 – could soon put you in a new class of “marijuana millionaires.”
So take a few moments to watch the presentation below and see whether jumping on this moon-bound stock rocket is right for you.

WHY PENNY STOCKS?
The penny stock market gets a bad rap. If the Stock Market were the USA, the Penny Stock Market would likely be considered the Wild West. Many Investors have fallen prey to the bad newsletters, irresponsible companies, manipulative market makers and more.
So why do we love Penny Stocks?
Blue Chips are for Investors. Penny Stocks are for TRADERS. Penny Stocks may be driven by hype, news, technical setups, and future promise. In this market, the greater the volatility, the greater potential for ENORMOUS GAINS!
Think of this market like a Las Vegas Casino. An experienced Poker player profits because he knows when to strike and when to cut losses. The same is true for Penny Stocks traders. [Read More]
