Company Description


Eisenstat Capital Partners seeks to achieve risk-adjusted capital growth primarily through investments in European equity securities and other equity-related instruments. The firm may also may make investments in bonds or other fixed-income securities issued by private issuers or governmental entities. To increase the performance potential of the funds while mitigating general market risk, Eisenstat may employ a hedged approach by taking short positions, as well as long positions, in equity securities and other equity-related instruments. Eisenstat's investment strategy is based on a fundamental, research-intensive, security selection process. While attention is paid to general macroeconomic conditions, Eisenstat believes that the underlying stock selection process is the critical determinant to achieving superior investment results.
