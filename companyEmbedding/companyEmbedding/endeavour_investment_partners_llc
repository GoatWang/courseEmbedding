 A fundamental tenet of growing an institutional asset management business is to identify the right markets and understand how institutional needs differ from those of other investors.

 What channels are likely to be receptive?
 How do managers get selected? 
 Is my firm positioned correctly?
 What are the key operational elements I need?
 How do I effectively service clients after the sale?
