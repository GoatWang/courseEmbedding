Variable Annuities


We understand that your investment and retirement plans are unique and may change over time. Regardless of where you are along life's journey, Jackson® provides variable annuity options designed to help you pursue your financial goals.
The variety of investment choices and tax deferral* featured in each of our variable annuity offerings can support your investing and retirement objectives. It's important to work with your financial professional to select a variable annuity that suits your individual financial needs and comfort with risk.

*Tax deferral offers no additional value if an annuity is used to fund a qualified plan, such as a 401(k) or IRA. It also may not be available if the annuity is owned by a "non-natural person" such as a corporation or certain types of trusts.



What is a Variable Annuity? Variable annuities are long-term, tax-deferred investments designed for retirement, involve investment risks and may lose value. Earnings are taxable as ordinary income when distributed and may be subject to a 10% additional tax if withdrawn before age 59½.






Elite Access®


An investment only variable annuity (IOVA) designed to help increase return potential and manage risk through a diversified variable annuity investment platform. Elite Access features traditional investments, alternative assets and strategies, tactical and risk management, and asset allocation portfolios — all optimized through the benefit of tax deferral.

Perspective II®


Introduction
The Pursuit of Retirement Freedom. Today, with many people living longer, healthier, and more active lives, retirement has become a turning point — not an end point. But the prospect of a longer retirement raises important questions about whether traditional retirement income streams — such as Social Security, pensions, and personal savings — will be sufficient for you to sustain a comfortable lifestyle as you age.
With these challenges in mind, Jackson® offers Perspective II, one of America's top-selling* variable annuities that offers you the freedom to create your own distinctive portfolio plan with quality investments, optional benefits†, and tax deferral‡. It's a retirement investment vehicle designed to let you adapt your investment choices to your evolving needs and goals. 

*LIMRA Secure Retirement Institute U.S. Individual Annuities Sales Survey, Third Quarter, 2016. Jackson was first in total annuity sales out of 63 participating companies that provided LIMRA with quarterly data.
†Optional benefits are available for an extra charge in addition to the ongoing fees and expenses of the variable annuity.
‡Tax deferral offers no additional value if an annuity is used to fund a qualified plan, such as a 401(k) or IRA, and may not be available if the annuity is owned by a "non-natural person" such as a corporation or certain types of trusts.



What is a Variable Annuity? Variable annuities are long-term, tax-deferred investments designed for retirement, involve investment risks and may lose value. Earnings are taxable as ordinary income when distributed and may be subject to a 10% additional tax if withdrawn before age 59½.




The Power of Perspective



				Perspective II addresses investment challenges to help you pursue financial freedom in retirement.

Investment Options: A Foundation You Can Grow On


					To outpace rising costs and manage market expectations, it's important to implement a long-term investing strategy built to grow over time. Jackson gives you the freedom to create a portfolio allocation and level of risk that suits your evolving goals.
				
All Perspective II Investment Options


Living Benefits: Income You Can Count On


					With increasing life expectancy and more time spent in retirement, it's important to establish a steady income stream you won't outlive. Jackson's optional suite of living benefits can provide lifetime income** to help sustain your retirement lifestyle.
				
All Perspective II Optional Benefits

**On the contract anniversary on or immediately following the owner's (or older joint owner's) attained age 59½, the for-life guarantee becomes effective provided: 1) the contract value is greater than zero and 2) the contract has not been annuitized. If the owner (or older joint owner) is age 59½ on the effective date of the endorsement, then the for-life guarantee becomes effective on that date.



Death Benefits: A Legacy You Can Pass On


					If leaving an inheritance for future generations is a priority, consider an investment strategy that help grow your legacy. Plan to leave more than a memory with a death benefit backed by Jackson.
				
All Perspective II Optional Benefits

††Death benefits terminate if the contract value falls to zero.



Tax Advantages: An Advantage You Can Plan For


					Taxes can impact every phase of your retirement journey by constantly chipping away at your gains. Help keep more of your money at work by utilizing tax efficiencies at each investment stage.

Before investing, investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the variable annuity and its underlying investment options. The current contract prospectus and underlying fund prospectuses, which are contained in the same document, provide this and other important information. Please contact your representative or the Company to obtain the prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses carefully before investing or sending money.
The latest income date allowed is age 95, which is the required age to annuitize or take a lump sum. Please see the prospectus for important information regarding the annuitization of a contract.
We reserve the right to refuse any subsequent premium payments, subject to state applicability.
Optional benefits may be elected at issue and, once elected, may not be cancelled or changed. Optional benefits are available for an extra charge in addition to the ongoing fees and expenses of the variable annuity. Only one optional living benefit and one optional death benefit may be elected per contract. May not be available in all states or on all products, and state variations may apply. The long-term advantage of the optional benefits will vary with the terms of the benefit option, the investment performance of the variable investment options selected, and the length of time the annuity is owned. As a result, in some circumstances the cost of an option may exceed the actual benefit paid under the option.
Guarantees are backed by the claims-paying ability of Jackson National Life Insurance Company® or Jackson National Life Insurance Company of New York® and do not apply to the principal amount or investment performance of a variable annuity's separate account or its underlying investments.
Perspective II Variable and Fixed Annuity (VA620) is issued by Jackson National Life Insurance Company® (Home Office: Lansing, Michigan) and in New York, (VA620NY 09/12) by Jackson National Life Insurance Company of New York® (Home Office: Purchase, New York). Variable annuities are distributed by Jackson National Life Distributors LLC, member FINRA. May not be available in all states and state variations may apply. This contract has limitations and restrictions including possible withdrawal charges and excess interest adjustments (interest rate adjustments in New York) where applicable. Jackson® issues other annuities with similar features, benefits, limitations, and charges. Discuss them with your representative or contact Jackson for more information.
Jackson® is the marketing name for Jackson National Life Insurance Company® and Jackson National Life Insurance Company of New York®.

FIXED ACCOUNT - part of our General Account to which the Contract Value you     
allocate is guaranteed to earn a stated rate of return over the specified       
period.

           PURCHASES                  Premiums are accepted during the first six
                                   Contract Months only.  As a result, you

                                  meet your total annuity coverage goal.
                                   Multiple Contracts may result in higher
                                      charges and total expenses. There are also
                                     minimum and maximum premium requirements.

                                 protection option, namely the Capital

                                      21. There is a breakpoint schedule for the
                                   Mortality and Expense Risk Charge.  The
                                  breakpoints are based on the amount of
                                 Aggregate Premium.  Aggregate Premium
                                      at issue is equal to the anticipated total
                                 premium specified in the Statement of
                            Intention section of the annuity
                                      application.  If no Statement of Intention
                                 is provided, the Aggregate Premium at
                                issue will equal the initial premium
                               received.  The Aggregate Premium is
                                      re-determined only at the end of the sixth
                                Contract Month and is equal to total
                                    Premium actually paid less total partial
                                      withdrawals.  For more information, please
                               see "CONTRACT CHARGES" beginning on

                                  some unforeseen emergencies.  However,

                                     Contract Months may result in a change to
                                 the Mortality and Expense Risk Charge
                                    assessed after the sixth Contract Month.

Mortality And Expense Risk Charge                                   

             The Mortality and Expense Risk Charge is expressed as an annual
             percentage of the average daily account value of the Investment
               Divisions and is set initially based upon the breakpoint schedule
              below using the Aggregate Premium determined at issue. Aggregate
        Premium at issue is equal to the anticipated total premium
            specified in the Statement of Intention section of the annuity
         application. If no Statement of Intention is indicated, the
       Aggregate Premium at issue will equal the initial premium
               received. THE AGGREGATE PREMIUM WILL BE RE-DETERMINED ONLY AT THE
              END OF THE SIXTH CONTRACT MONTH, WHICH MAY RESULT IN A CHANGE TO
            THE MORTALITY AND EXPENSE RISK CHARGE ASSESSED AFTER THE SIXTH
  CONTRACT MONTH. At the time the Aggregate Premium is
          re-determined, the Mortality and Expense Risk Charge will be
  based on the newly determined Aggregate Premium. (6)

(5)     This charge is waived on Contract Value of $50,000 or more. This charge 
  is deducted proportionally from your allocations to the Investment
Divisions and Fixed Account either annually (on your Contract   
      Anniversary) or in conjunction with a total withdrawal, as applicable.

(6)     Premiums are accepted only during the first six Contract Months. The    
      Aggregate Premium re-determined at the end of the sixth Contract Month
     is equal to total Premium paid less total partial withdrawals. If the
       Contract Owner dies prior to the end of the sixth Contract Month, there
   will not be an adjustment to the Mortality and Expense Risk Charge.

(7)     The optional death benefits are only available to select when purchasing
    the Contract and once purchased cannot be canceled. In addition, the
    charges for the optional death benefits are based on average account
value but the charges for the optional GMWBs are not. Please see
     footnotes 8 -10 below and "CONTRACT CHARGES" beginning on page 13 for
      more information concerning those charges not based on average account
value.                                                          

(8)     The charge is quarterly, currently 0.1625% of the GWB, which is 0.65% of
        the GWB on an annual basis, subject to a maximum annual charge of 1.45%.
       But for Contracts purchased IN WASHINGTON STATE, the charge is monthly,
 currently 0.055% of the GWB, which, annually, is 0.66% of the GWB
     subject to a maximum annual charge of 1.47% as used in the Table. The
      charge is deducted at the end of each calendar quarter/Contract Month,
     or upon termination of the endorsement, from your Contract Value on a
     pro rata basis. We deduct the charge from the Investment Divisions by
        canceling Accumulation Units; the charge is not part of the Accumulation
      Unit calculation. While the charge is deducted from Contract Value, it
       is based on the applicable percentage of the GWB. For more information,
      including how the GWB is calculated, please see "5% Guaranteed Minimum
Withdrawal Benefit With Annual Step-Up" beginning on page 29. Please
      check with your representative to learn about the current level of the
charge, or contact us at the Annuity Service Center for more    
information. Our contact information is on the first page of the
prospectus.                                                     

(9)     1.47% is the maximum annual charge of the 5% for Life GMWB With Annual  
  Step-Up for a 65-69 year old, which charge is payable monthly. The
        charge for the 5% for Life GMWB With Annual Step-Up varies by age group.

       You pay the applicable percentage of the GWB each calendar quarter. But

A    Certain   Funds  pay  Jackson   National   Asset   Management,   LLC,   the
     Administrator,  an administrative  fee for certain services provided to the
     Fund  by  the  Administrator.   The  JNL/Select  Global  Growth  Fund,  the
     JNL/JPMorgan  International  Equity Fund,  the  JNL/JPMorgan  International
     Value Fund,  the  JNL/Lazard  Emerging  Markets Fund,  the  JNL/Oppenheimer
     Global  Growth  Fund and all of the  JNL/Mellon  Capital  Management  Funds
     except the JNL/Mellon  Capital  Management  S&P 500 Index Fund,  JNL/Mellon
     Capital Management S&P 400 MidCap Index Fund, JNL/Mellon Capital Management
     Small Cap Index  Fund,  JNL/Mellon  Capital  Management  Bond  Index  Fund,
     JNL/Mellon  Capital  Management  Enhanced  S&P 500 Stock Index Fund and the
     JNL/Mellon  Capital  Management Global 15 Fund pay an administrative fee of
     0.15%;  the  JNL/Mellon   Capital   Management   Global  15  Fund  pays  an
     administrative  fee of 0.20%; the five JNL/S&P Funds pay an  administrative
     fee of 0.05%; and the other Funds pay an  administrative  fee of 0.10%. The
     Management and Administrative Fee and the Annual Operating Expenses columns
   in this table reflect the inclusion of any applicable administrative fee.

B    Other expenses include registration fees, licensing costs, a portion of the
     Chief Compliance Officer costs, directors and officers insurance,  the fees
     and  expenses of the  disinterested  Trustees/Managers  and of  independent
legal counsel to the disinterested Trustees/Managers.                 

C    UNDERLYING FUND EXPENSES. The expenses shown above are the annual operating
     expenses for the JNL/S&P  Funds.  Because the JNL/S&P Funds invest in other
     Funds of the JNL Series Trust and JNL Variable  Fund LLC, the JNL/S&P Funds
     will  indirectly  bear its pro  rata  share  of fees  and  expenses  of the
underlying Funds in addition to the expenses shown.                   

     The total annual  operating  expenses for each JNL/S&P Fund (including both
     the  annual  operating  expenses  for the  JNL/S&P  Funds  and  the  annual
     operating  expenses for the underlying Funds) could range from ___% to ___%
     (this range reflects an investment in the Funds with the lowest and highest
     Annual  Operating  Expenses).  The table below shows estimated total annual
     operating  expenses  for each of the  JNL/S&P  Funds  based on the pro rata
     share of expenses  that the JNL/S&P  Funds would bear if they invested in a
     hypothetical  mix of underlying  Funds.  The Adviser  believes the expenses
     shown below to be a likely  approximation of the expenses the JNL/S&P Funds
     will incur based on the actual mix of underlying  Funds. The expenses shown
     below include both the annual  operating  expenses for the JNL/S&P Fund and
     the annual operating expenses for the underlying Funds. The actual expenses
     of each JNL/S&P Fund will be based on the actual mix of underlying Funds in
     which it  invests.  The actual  expenses  may be greater or less than those
shown.

        EXAMPLE. The example below is intended to help you compare the cost of
        investing in the Contract with the cost of investing in other variable
   annuity contracts. These costs include Contract owner transaction
         expenses, Contract fees, Separate Account annual expenses and Fund fees
        and expenses. (The Annual Contract Maintenance Charge is determined by
         dividing the total amount of such charges collected during the calendar
      year by the total market value of the Investment Divisions and Fixed
Account.)                                                     

     The example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Contract for the
       time periods indicated. Neither transfer fees nor premium tax charges
  are reflected in the example. The example also assumes that your
investment has a 5% annual return on assets each year.        

       The following example includes maximum Fund fees and expenses and the
  costs if you select the optional Highest Anniversary Value Death
  Benefit and the Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit (using the
       maximum possible charge). Although your actual costs may be higher or
lower, based on these assumptions, your costs would be:

         CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION. The Contracts have not been previously
    offered so there is no condensed financial information relating to
Accumulation Unit Values under the Contracts. The value of an 
    Accumulation Unit is determined on the basis of changes in the per
        share value of an underlying fund and Separate Account charges for the
      base Contract and the various combinations of optional endorsements.
       The financial statements of the Separate Account and Jackson National
        can be found in the Statement of Additional Information. The financial
      statements of the Separate Account include information about all the
contracts offered through the Separate Account. The financial 
       statements of Jackson National that are included should be considered
    only as bearing upon the company's ability to meet its contractual
obligations under the Contracts. Jackson National's financial 
   statements do not bear on the future investment experience of the
        assets held in the Separate Account. For your copy of the Statement of
  Additional Information, please contact us at the Annuity Service
Center. Our contact information is on the cover page of this  
prospectus.                                                   

THE ANNUITY CONTRACT

  Your Contract is a contract between you, the Owner, and us. Your
      Contract is intended to help facilitate your retirement savings on a
 tax-deferred basis, or other long-term investment purposes, and
   provides for a death benefit. Purchases under tax-qualified plans
         should be made for other than tax deferral reasons. Tax-qualified plans
       provide tax deferral that does not rely on the purchase of an annuity
     contract. We will not issue a Contract to someone older than age 90
     (age 85 for Contracts purchased in Oklahoma). Optional benefits may
have different requirements, as noted.                        

You may allocate your Contract Value to                       

               *    our Fixed Account, as may be made available by us, or as may
be otherwise limited by us,             

               *    Investment  Divisions of the Separate Account that invest in
underlying Funds.                       

     Your Contract, like all deferred annuity contracts, has two phases:

               *    the  ACCUMULATION  PHASE,  which is the period  between  the
           issue date of the Contract and the Income Date, and

               *    the INCOME  PHASE,  which  begins on the Income  Date and is
when we make income payments to you.    

        As the Owner, you can exercise all the rights under your Contract. You
        can assign your Contract at any time during your lifetime, but we will
       not be bound until we receive written notice of the assignment (there
       is an assignment form). We reserve the right to refuse an assignment,
  and an assignment may be a taxable event. Your ability to change
   ownership is limited on Contracts with one of the For Life GMWBs.
Please contact our Annuity Service Center for help and more   
information.                                                  

       The Contract is a modified single premium fixed and variable deferred
        annuity and may be issued as either an individual or a group contract.
   Contracts issued in your state may provide different features and
   benefits than those described in this prospectus. This prospectus
        provides a general description of the Contracts. Your Contract and any
   endorsements are the controlling documents. In those states where
    Contracts are issued as group contracts, references throughout the
prospectus to "Contract(s)" shall also mean "certificate(s)."
JACKSON NATIONAL

  state of Michigan in June 1961. Our legal domicile and principal
      business address is 1 Corporate Way, Lansing, Michigan 48951. We are
         admitted to conduct life insurance and annuity business in the District

   We are working to provide documentation electronically. When this
    program is available, we will, as permitted, forward documentation
     electronically. Please contact us at our Annuity Service Center for

 THE FIXED ACCOUNT
    CONTRACT VALUE THAT YOU ALLOCATE TO A FIXED ACCOUNT OPTION WILL BE
       PLACED WITH OTHER ASSETS IN OUR GENERAL ACCOUNT. THE FIXED ACCOUNT IS
NOT REGISTERED WITH THE SEC, AND THE SEC DOES NOT REVIEW THE  
         INFORMATION WE PROVIDE TO YOU ABOUT IT. DISCLOSURES REGARDING THE FIXED
   ACCOUNT, HOWEVER, MAY BE SUBJECT TO THE GENERAL PROVISIONS OF THE
      FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS RELATING TO THE ACCURACY AND COMPLETENESS OF
     STATEMENTS MADE IN PROSPECTUSES. BOTH THE AVAILABILITY OF THE FIXED
       ACCOUNT OPTIONS, AND TRANSFERS INTO AND OUT OF THE FIXED ACCOUNT, MAY
     BE SUBJECT TO CONTRACTUAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS. FOR MORE
    INFORMATION, PLEASE SEE THE APPLICATION, CHECK WITH THE REGISTERED
       REPRESENTATIVE HELPING YOU TO PURCHASE THE CONTRACT, OR CONTACT US AT
OUR ANNUITY SERVICE CENTER.                                   

Each Fixed Account option offers a base interest rate that we 
         established and will credit to your Contract Value in the Fixed Account
      for a specified period (currently, one, three, five or seven years),
subject to availability (and we reserve the right, in our sole
   discretion, to limit or suspend availability of the Fixed Account
     options), so long as the Contract Value in the Fixed Account is not
      withdrawn, transferred, or annuitized until the end of the specified
    period. The base interest rate is subject to your Contract's Fixed
         Account minimum interest rate, which will be 2% a year, credited daily,
    during the first ten Contract Years and 3% a year, credited daily,
        afterwards. Depending on the Issue Date of your Contract, however, the
       Fixed Account minimum interest rate may be 3% a year, credited daily,
      in all Contract Years. Subject to these minimum requirements, we may
declare different base interest rates at different times.     

       Your Contract Value in the Fixed Account may be subject to an "Excess
         Interest Adjustment" and a withdrawal charge, however, if you decide to
 withdraw or transfer your Contract Value allocated to the Fixed
  Account, or if you annuitize the Contract, before the end of the
      specified period. The Excess Interest Adjustment depends on the base
         interest rate that was available when you allocated Contract Value to a
  Fixed Account option versus the base interest rate available for
         allocations to the same Fixed Account option at the time of withdrawal,
       transfer, or annuitization. If your base interest rate is higher than
    the base interest rate available for allocations to the same Fixed
       Account option at the time of withdrawal, transfer, or annuitization,
        then the Excess Interest Adjustment will increase your Contract Value,
      and vice versa. However, there will be no Excess Interest Adjustment
         when the base interest rate available for allocations to the same Fixed
Account option at the time of the withdrawal, transfer, or    
     annuitization is less than your base interest rate by 0.5% or less.
     Also, there is no Excess Interest Adjustment on: the one-year Fixed
        Account option; death benefit proceed payments; payments pursuant to a
         life contingent income option or an income option resulting in payments
 spread over at least five years; amounts withdrawn for Contract
     charges; and free withdrawals. In no event will the Excess Interest
      Adjustment reduce the Contract Value below the minimum interest rate
applicable to the Fixed Account portion of your Contract.     

        Whenever a specified period ends, you will have 30 days to transfer or
         withdraw the Contract Value in the Fixed Account option, and there will
        not be an Excess Interest Adjustment. If you do nothing, then after 30
         days, the Contract Value that remains in that Fixed Account option will
         be subject to another specified period of the same duration, subject to
       availability, and provided that that specified period will not extend
       beyond the Income Date. Otherwise, the next closest specified period,
    or the one-year Fixed Account option (if there is one year or less
until the Income Date), will apply.                           

        You may allocate premiums to the one-year Fixed Account option, but we
may require that the amount in the one-year Fixed Account be  
       automatically transferred on a monthly basis in equal installments to
    your choice of Investment Division within 12 months of the date we
        received the premium, so that at the end of the period, all amounts in
        the one-year Fixed Account will have been transferred. The amount will
   be determined based on the amount allocated to the one-year Fixed
         Account and the base interest rate. Charges, withdrawals and additional
         transfers taken from the one-year Fixed Account will shorten the length
  of time it takes to deplete the account balance. These automatic
      transfers will not count against the 15 free transfers in a Contract
year.                                                         

    Interest will continue to be credited daily on the account balance
    remaining in the one-year Fixed Account as funds are automatically
    transferred into your choice of Investment Divisions. However, the
     effective yield over the 12-month automatic transfer period will be
        less than the base interest rate, as it will be applied to a declining
balance in the one-year Fixed Account.                        

         The DCA+ FIXED ACCOUNT, IF AVAILABLE, offers a fixed interest rate that
we guarantee for a period of up to one year in connection with
  dollar-cost-averaging transfers to one or more of the Investment
        Divisions or systematic transfers to other Fixed Account options. From
      time to time, we will offer special enhanced rates on the DCA+ Fixed
 Account. DCA+ Fixed Account is only available for new premiums.
  Premiums are accepted during the first six Contract Months only.

THE SEPARATE ACCOUNT

       We established the Separate Account on June 14, 1993, pursuant to the
        provisions of Michigan law. The Separate Account is a separate account
     under state insurance law and a unit investment trust under federal
         securities law and is registered as an investment company with the SEC.

 The assets of the Separate Account legally belong to us and the
      obligations under the Contracts are our obligations. However, we are
       not allowed to use the Contract assets in the Separate Account to pay
       our liabilities arising out of any other business we may conduct. All
         of the income, gains and losses resulting from these assets (whether or
        not realized) are credited to or charged against the Contracts and not
against any other Contracts we may issue.                     

      The Separate Account is divided into Investment Divisions. We do not
        guarantee the investment performance of the Separate Account or any of
its Investment Divisions.                                     

INVESTMENT DIVISIONS

      Each Investment Division purchases the shares of one underlying Fund
    (mutual fund portfolio) that has its own investment objective. The
       Investment Divisions are designed to offer the potential for a higher
         return than the Fixed Account options. HOWEVER, THIS IS NOT GUARANTEED.
        IT IS POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO LOSE YOUR CONTRACT VALUE ALLOCATED TO ANY OF
  THE INVESTMENT DIVISIONS. If you allocate Contract Values to the
      Investment Divisions, the amounts you are able to accumulate in your
         Contract during the accumulation phase will depend upon the performance
  of the Investment Divisions you select. The amount of the income
         payments you receive during the income phase also will depend, in part,
   on the performance of the Investment Divisions you choose for the
income phase.                                                 

        THE NAMES OF THE FUNDS THAT ARE AVAILABLE, ALONG WITH THE NAMES OF THE
    ADVISERS AND SUB-ADVISERS AND A BRIEF STATEMENT OF EACH INVESTMENT
OBJECTIVE, ARE BELOW:

        The investment objectives and policies of certain Funds are similar to
       the investment objectives and policies of other mutual funds that the
         Fund's investment sub-advisers also manage. Although the objectives and
     policies may be similar, the investment results of the Funds may be
         higher or lower than the results of those other mutual funds. We cannot
       guarantee, and make no representation, that the investment results of
      similar funds will be comparable even though the funds have the same
  investment sub-advisers. The underlying Funds are available only
         through variable annuity contracts issued by Jackson National. They are
NOT offered or made available to the general public directly. 

         A Fund's performance may be affected by risks specific to certain types
     of investments, such as foreign securities, derivative investments,
       non-investment grade debt securities, initial public offerings (IPOs)
     or companies with relatively small market capitalizations. IPOs and
        other investment techniques may have a magnified performance impact on
   a Fund with a small asset base. A Fund may not experience similar
performance as its assets grow.                               

       You should read the prospectuses for the JNL Series Trust and the JNL
    Variable Fund LLC carefully before investing. Additional Funds and
Investment Divisions may be available in the future.          

  VOTING PRIVILEGES. To the extent required by law, we will obtain
        instructions from you and other Owners about how to vote our shares of
         a Fund when there is a vote of shareholders of a Fund. We will vote all
    the shares we own in proportion to those instructions from Owners.

        SUBSTITUTION. We reserve the right to substitute a different Fund or a
       different mutual fund for the one in which any Investment Division is
       currently invested, or transfer money to the General Account. We will
        not do this without any required approval of the SEC. We will give you
notice of any substitution.                                   

CONTRACT CHARGES

         There are charges associated with your Contract, the deduction of which
 will reduce the investment return of your Contract. Charges are
         deducted proportionally from your Contract Value. Some of these charges
         are for optional endorsements, as noted, so they are deducted from your
         Contract Value only if you selected to add that optional endorsement to
       your Contract. These charges may be a lesser amount where required by
       state law or as described below, but will not be increased. We expect
   to profit from certain charges assessed under the Contract. These
charges (and certain other expenses) are as follows:          

         MORTALITY AND EXPENSE RISK CHARGE. Each day, as part of our calculation
     of the value of the Accumulation Units and Annuity Units, we make a
        deduction for the Mortality and Expense Risk Charge. The Mortality and
         Expense Risk Charge is expressed as an annual percentage of the average
       daily account value of the Investment Divisions and is set based upon
         the breakpoint schedule below using the Aggregate Premium determined at
     issue. Aggregate Premium at issue is equal to the anticipated total
   premium breakpoint specified by you in the Statement of Intention
         section of the application. If no Statement of Intention is provided by
       you in the application, the Aggregate Premium at issue will equal the
       initial premium received. THE AGGREGATE PREMIUM WILL BE RE-DETERMINED
    ONLY AT THE END OF THE SIXTH CONTRACT MONTH, WHICH MAY RESULT IN A
    CHANGE TO THE MORTALITY AND EXPENSE RISK CHARGE ASSESSED AFTER THE
SIXTH CONTRACT MONTH. At the time the Aggregate Premium is    
     re-determined, the Mortality and Expense Risk Charge will be set by
      reference to the newly determined Aggregate Premium. If the Contract
         Owner dies prior to the end of the sixth Contract Month, there will not
        be an adjustment to the Mortality and Expense Risk Charge. Thus, while
       the Contract may continue for a period of time after the death of the
        Owner, premium payments made after the initial premium will not result
         in a change in the Mortality and Expense Risk Charge. The Mortality and
Expense Risk Charge does not apply to the Fixed Account.

      Premiums are accepted during the first six Contract Months only. The
     Aggregate Premium is re-determined at the end of the sixth Contract
Month and is equal to total Premium paid less certain partial 
    withdrawals, as discussed below. For information about withdrawals
affecting Aggregate Premium, please see "Access To Your Money"
beginning on page 25.                                         

       The Mortality and Expense Risk Charge compensates us for the risks we
      assume in connection with all the Contracts, not just your Contract.
     Our mortality risks under the Contracts arise from our obligations:

               *    to make income payments for the life of the Annuitant during
the income phase;                       

               *    to waive the  withdrawal  charge in the event of the Owner's
death; and                              

             *    to provide a basic death benefit prior to the Income Date.

        Our expense risks under the Contracts include the risk that our actual
      cost of administering the Contracts and the Investment Divisions may
      exceed the amount that we receive from the administration charge and
      the annual contract maintenance charge. Included among these expense
risks are those that we assume in connection with increasing  
         distribution expenses, waivers of withdrawal charges under the Terminal
         Illness Benefit, the Specified Conditions Benefit and the Extended Care
Benefit.                                                      

     If your Contract Value were ever to become insufficient to pay this
charge, your Contract would terminate without value.          

       ANNUAL CONTRACT MAINTENANCE CHARGE. During the accumulation phase, we
 deduct a $35 annual contract maintenance charge on the Contract
        Anniversary of the Issue Date. We will also deduct the annual contract
       maintenance charge if you make a total withdrawal. This charge is for
         administrative expenses. The annual contract maintenance charge will be
     assessed on the Contract Anniversary or upon full withdrawal and is
         taken from the Investment Divisions and the Fixed Account options based
       on the proportion their respective value bears to the Contract Value.
      We will not deduct this charge if, when the deduction is to be made,
the value of your Contract is $50,000 or more.                

    ADMINISTRATION CHARGE. Each day, as part of our calculation of the
        value of the Accumulation Units and Annuity Units, we make a deduction
     for administration charges. On an annual basis, these charges equal
       X.XX% of the average daily net asset value of your allocations to the
        Investment Divisions. This charge does not apply to the Fixed Account.
       This charge compensates us for our expenses incurred in administering
the Contracts and the Separate Account.                       

        TRANSFER CHARGE. You must pay $25 for each transfer in excess of 15 in
  a Contract Year. This charge is deducted from the amount that is
        transferred prior to the allocation to a different Investment Division
      or the Fixed Account, as applicable. We waive the transfer charge in
    connection with Dollar Cost Averaging, Earnings Sweep, Rebalancing
        transfers and any transfers we require, and we may charge a lesser fee
where required by state law.                                  

WITHDRAWAL CHARGE. At any time during the accumulation phase (if and to
   the extent that Contract Value is sufficient to pay any remaining
      withdrawal charges that remain after a withdrawal), you may withdraw
the following with no withdrawal charge:                      

               *    PREMIUMS THAT ARE NO LONGER  SUBJECT TO A WITHDRAWAL  CHARGE
               (premiums in your annuity for at least six years), PLUS

               *    EARNINGS  (excess of your  Contract  Value  allocated to the
                    Investment   Divisions  and  the  Fixed  Account  over  your
       remaining premiums allocated to those accounts)

               *    during  each   Contract  Year  10%  OF  PREMIUM  that  would
                    otherwise  incur a  withdrawal  charge or be  reduced  by an
                    Excess Interest Adjustment, and that has not been previously
                    withdrawn  (this  can be  withdrawn  at once or in  segments
                    throughout  the Contract  Year),  MINUS  earnings  (required
                    minimum  distributions  will be  counted as part of the free
withdrawal amount).                     

WE WILL DEDUCT A WITHDRAWAL CHARGE ON:                        

           *    withdrawals in excess of the free withdrawal amounts, or

               *    withdrawals  under a tax-qualified  Contract that exceed its
required minimum distributions, or      

               *    withdrawals in excess of the free withdrawal amounts to meet
                    the  required   minimum   distribution  of  a  tax-qualified
                    Contract  purchased  with  contributions  from a  nontaxable
                    transfer,   after  the  Owner's  death,   of  an  Individual
                    Retirement  Annuity (IRA),  or to meet the required  minimum
distribution of a Roth IRA annuity, or  

*    amounts withdrawn in a total withdrawal, or  

               *    amounts applied to income payments on an Income Date that is
within one year of the Issue Date.      

         The amount of the withdrawal charge deducted varies (depending upon how
        many years prior to the withdrawal you made the premium payment(s) you
are withdrawing) according to the following schedule:         

                        WITHDRAWAL CHARGE (AS A PERCENTAGE OF PREMIUM PAYMENTS):

                                                                [Download Table]

BASE SCHEDULE                  5%  4%  3%  3%  2%  1%  0%

       For purposes of the withdrawal charge, we treat withdrawals as coming
        first from earnings and then from the oldest remaining premium. If you
         make a full withdrawal, or elect to commence income payments within one
     year of the date your Contract was issued, the withdrawal charge is
    based on premiums remaining in the Contract and no free withdrawal
amount applies. If you withdraw only part of the value of your
       Contract, we deduct the withdrawal charge from the remaining value in
your Contract. The withdrawal charge compensates us for costs 
associated with selling the Contracts.                        

        NOTE: Withdrawals under a non-qualified Contract will be taxable on an
"income first" basis. This means that any withdrawal from a   
    non-qualified Contract that does not exceed the accumulated income
     under the Contract will be taxable in full. Any withdrawals under a
       tax-qualified Contract will be taxable except to the extent that they
are allocable to an investment in the Contract (any after-tax 
         contributions). In most cases, there will be little or no investment in
      the Contract for a tax-qualified Contract because contributions will
have been made on a pre-tax or tax-deductible basis.          

    We do NOT assess the withdrawal charge on any amounts paid out as:

               *    income  payments (but the  withdrawal  charge is deducted at
                    the Income  Date if income  payments  are  commenced  in the
first Contract Year);                   

*    death benefits;                              

               *    withdrawals   necessary  to  satisfy  the  required  minimum
                    distribution  of  the  Internal  Revenue  Code  (but  if the
                    withdrawal    requested   exceeds   the   required   minimum
                    distribution;   if   the   Contract   was   purchased   with
                    contributions from a nontaxable transfer,  after the Owner's
                    death,  of an Individual  Retirement  Annuity (IRA); or is a
                    Roth IRA annuity,  then the entire  withdrawal  in excess of
                    the free withdrawal amount will be subject to the withdrawal
charge);                                

               *    if  permitted by your state,  withdrawals  of up to $250,000
                    from the Investment Divisions and Fixed Account if you incur
                    a  terminal  illness  or if you need  extended  hospital  or
          nursing home care as provided in your Contract; or

               *    if permitted by your state, withdrawals of up to 25% of your
                    Contract  Value  from the  Investment  Divisions  and  Fixed
                    Account (12 1/2% for each of two joint  Owners) if you incur
                    certain  serious  medical   conditions   specified  in  your
Contract.                               

         We may reduce or eliminate the amount of the withdrawal charge when the
     Contract is sold under circumstances that reduce our sales expense.
  Some examples are the purchase of a Contract by a large group of
      individuals or an existing relationship between us and a prospective
   purchaser. We may not deduct a withdrawal charge under a Contract
       issued to an officer, director, agent or employee of Jackson National
or any of our affiliates.                                     

         5% GUARANTEED MINIMUM WITHDRAWAL BENEFIT WITH ANNUAL STEP-UP CHARGE. If
         you select the 5% GMWB With Annual Step-Up, in most states you will pay
         0.1625% of the GWB each calendar quarter. In some states, the charge is
         monthly, currently 0.055% of the GWB, which we will waive at the end of
      a Contract Month to the extent that the charge exceeds the amount of
     your Contract Value allocated to the Investment Divisions. For more
         information about the GWB, please see "5% Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal
Benefit With Annual Step-Up" beginning on page 29. We deduct this
charge from your Contract Value on a pro rata basis over each 
applicable Investment Division and the Fixed Account. With the
      Investment Divisions, we deduct the charge by canceling Accumulation
        Units rather than as part of the calculation to determine Accumulation
     Unit Value. While the charge is deducted from Contract Value, it is
        based on the applicable percentage of the GWB. The charge is prorated,
       from the endorsement's effective date to the end of the first quarter
        or first month after selection. Similarly, the charge is prorated upon
         termination of the endorsement. The charge may be reduced if you do not
       take any withdrawals before the fifth Contract Anniversary, or before
         the tenth Contract Anniversary, after the endorsement's effective date.
         If the charge in your state is quarterly, and if you have not taken any
      withdrawals before the fifth Contract Anniversary, then you will pay
    0.1125% of the GWB each calendar quarter. After the tenth Contract
      Anniversary if no withdrawals have been taken, you will pay 0.05% of
        the GWB each calendar quarter. If the charge in your state is monthly,
     and if you have not taken any withdrawals before the fifth Contract
        Anniversary, then you will pay 0.0375% of the GWB each Contract Month.
         After the tenth Contract Anniversary if no withdrawals have been taken,
     you will pay 0.0175% of the GWB each Contract Month. We reserve the
    right to prospectively change the charge: on new Contracts; if you
      select this benefit after your Contract is issued; or with a step-up
      that you request (not on step-ups that are automatic) - subject to a
maximum charge of 1.45% annually in states where the charge is
     quarterly, 1.47% annually in states where the charge is monthly. We
       stop deducting this charge on the earlier date that you annuitize the
Contract, or your Contract Value is zero. Please consult the  
        representative who helped you purchase your Contract about the current
         GMWB charges. In addition, please consult the representative to be sure
        if a Step-Up is right for you and about any increase in charges upon a
       Step-Up. Upon election of the GMWB and a Step-Up, the applicable GMWB
     charge will be reflected in your confirmation. Also see "Guaranteed
Minimum Withdrawal Benefit General Considerations" and "Guaranteed
Minimum Withdrawal Benefit Important Special Considerations" beginning
  on page 27 for additional important information to consider when
purchasing a Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit.           

 5% FOR LIFE GUARANTEED MINIMUM WITHDRAWAL BENEFIT WITH ANNUAL STEP-UP
       CHARGE. The charge for this GMWB is expressed as an annual percentage
         of the GWB and depends on the Owner's age when the endorsement is added
        to the Contract. The charge varies by age group (see table below). For
    more information about the GWB, please see "5% For Life Guaranteed
Minimum Withdrawal Benefit With Annual Step-Up" beginning on page 33.
      With joint Owners, the charge is based on the older Owner's age. For
the Owner that is a legal entity, the charge is based on the  
     Annuitant's age. (With joint Annuitants, the charge is based on the
older Annuitant's age.)

   You pay the applicable annual percentage of the GWB each calendar
     quarter. For Contracts purchased IN WASHINGTON STATE, the charge is
       monthly, which charge is waived at the end of a Contract Month to the
      extent it exceeds the amount of your Contract Value allocated to the
      Investment Divisions. We deduct the charge from your Contract Value.
         Quarterly charges are pro rata deducted over each applicable Investment
        Division and the Fixed Account. Monthly charges are also pro rata, but
  deducted over the applicable Investment Divisions only. With the
      Investment Divisions, we deduct the charge by canceling Accumulation
        Units rather than as part of the calculation to determine Accumulation
     Unit Value. While the charge is deducted from Contract Value, it is
        based on the applicable percentage of the GWB. The charge is prorated,
        from the endorsement's effective date, to the end of the first quarter
        or first month after selection. Similarly, the charge is prorated upon
termination of the endorsement.                               

We reserve the right to prospectively change the charge on new
         Contracts, or if you select this benefit after your Contract is issued,
         subject to the applicable maximum annual charge. We may also change the
        charge when you elect a step-up, (not on step-ups that are automatic),
       again subject to the applicable maximum annual charge. Please consult
    the representative who helped you purchase your Contract about the
         current GMWB charges. In addition, please consult the representative to
         be sure if a Step-Up is right for you and about any increase in charges
         upon a Step-Up. Upon election of the GMWB and a Step-Up, the applicable
GMWB charge will be reflected in your confirmation.           

     You will continue to pay the charge for the endorsement through the
        earlier date that you annuitize the Contract or your Contract Value is
zero. Also, we will stop deducting the charge under the other 
       circumstances that would cause the endorsement to terminate. For more
     information, please see "Termination" under "5% For Life Guaranteed
Minimum Withdrawal Benefit With Annual Step-Up" beginning on page 33.
        Please check with your representative to learn about the current level

       about the GWB and for information on who is a Covered Life under this

   You pay the applicable annual percentage of the GWB each calendar
     quarter. For Contracts purchased IN WASHINGTON STATE, the charge is
       monthly, which charge is waived at the end of a Contract Month to the
      extent it exceeds the amount of your Contract Value allocated to the

         Quarterly charges are pro rata deducted over each applicable Investment

         DEATH BENEFIT CHARGES. There is no additional charge for the Contract's
        basic death benefit. However, for an additional charge, you may select
         one of the Contract's available optional death benefits in place of the
         basic death benefit. Please ask your agent whether there are variations
        on these benefits in your state or contact our Annuity Service Center.
  Our contact information is on the cover page of this prospectus.

               If you select the RETURN OF PREMIUM DEATH BENEFIT, you will
                 pay 0.20%, subject to a maximum of 0.55% on new issues, on an
             annual basis of the average daily net asset value of your
allocations to the Investment Divisions.    

                  If you select the HIGHEST ANNIVERSARY VALUE DEATH BENEFIT, you
                will pay 0.35%, subject to a maximum of 0.55% on new issues,
              on an annual basis of the average daily net asset value of
 your allocations to the Investment Divisions.

      We stop deducting either of these charges on the date you annuitize.

    COMMUTATION FEE. If you make a total withdrawal from your Contract
         after income payments have commenced under income option 4, or if after
      your death during the period for which payments are guaranteed to be
      made under income option 3 your Beneficiary elects to receive a lump
   sum payment, the amount received will be reduced by (a) minus (b)
where:                                                        

               *    (a) = the present value of the remaining income payments (as
                    of the  date  of  calculation)  for  the  period  for  which
                    payments are  guaranteed to be made,  discounted at the rate
       assumed in calculating the initial payment; and

               *    (b) = the present value of the remaining income payments (as
                    of the  date  of  calculation)  for  the  period  for  which
                    payments are guaranteed to be made,  discounted at a rate no
         more than 1.00% higher than the rate used in (a).

        OTHER EXPENSES. We pay the operating expenses of the Separate Account,
including those not covered by the mortality and expense and  
         administrative charges. There are deductions from and expenses paid out
 of the assets of the Funds. These expenses are described in the
     attached prospectuses for the JNL Series Trust and the JNL Variable
Fund LLC. For more information, please see the "Fund Operating
Expenses" table beginning on page 8.                          

   PREMIUM TAXES. Some states and other governmental entities charge
         premium taxes or other similar taxes. We pay these taxes and may make a
       deduction from your Contract Values for them. Premium taxes generally
      range from 0% to 3.5% (the amount of state premium tax, if any, will
vary from state to state).                                    

      INCOME TAXES. We reserve the right, when calculating unit values, to
     deduct a credit or charge with respect to any taxes we have paid or
  reserved for during the valuation period that we determine to be
attributable to the operation of the Separate Account, or to a
        particular Investment Division. No federal income taxes are applicable
       under present law and we are not presently making any such deduction.

   DISTRIBUTION OF CONTRACTS. Jackson National Life Distributors LLC
   ("JNLD"), located at 7601 Technology Way, Denver, Colorado 80237,
    serves as the distributor of the Contracts. JNLD is a wholly owned
subsidiary of Jackson National.                               

      Commissions are paid to broker-dealers who sell the Contracts. While
         commissions may vary, they are not expected to exceed 8% of any premium
     payment. Where lower commissions are paid up front, we may also pay
      trail commissions. We may also pay commissions on the Income Date if
     the annuity option selected involves a life contingency or a payout
over a period of ten or more years.                           

      Under certain circumstances, JNLD out of their own resources may pay
  bonuses, overrides, and marketing allowances, in addition to the
  standard commissions. These cash payments, or reimbursements, to
       broker-dealers are in recognition of their marketing and distribution
         and/or administrative services support and are sometimes referred to as
       "revenue sharing." They may not be offered to all broker-dealers, and
     the terms of any particular agreement may vary among broker-dealers
       depending on, among other things, the level and type of marketing and
       distribution support provided assets under management, and the volume
       and size of the sales of our insurance products. Such compensation is
       subject to applicable state insurance law and regulation and the NASD
rules of conduct.                                             

       The two primary forms of such compensation paid by JNLD are overrides
 and marketing support payments. Overrides are payments that are
designed as consideration for product placement, assets under 
       management and sales volume. Overrides are generally based on a fixed
     percentage of product sales and currently range from 10 to 50 basis
        points (0.10% to 0.50%). Marketing support payments may be in the form
   of cash and/or non-cash compensation and allow us to, among other
    things, participate in sales conferences and educational seminars.
Examples of such payments include, but are not limited to,    
  reimbursements for representative training meetings, prospecting
       seminars, and business development and educational enhancement items.
    Payments or reimbursements for meetings and seminars are generally
      based on the anticipated level of participation and/or accessibility

  Please see Appendix C for a complete list of broker-dealers that
      received amounts of marketing and distribution and/or administrative
     support in 2005 from the Distributor in relation to the sale of our
insurance products.                                           

        We may, under certain circumstances where permitted by applicable law,
     pay a bonus to a Contract purchaser to the extent the broker-dealer
        waives its commission. You can learn about the amount of any available
 bonus by calling the toll-free number on the cover page of this
         prospectus. Contract purchasers should inquire of the representative if
         such bonus is available to them and its compliance with applicable law.
We may use any of our corporate assets to cover the cost of   
      distribution, including any profit from the Contract's mortality and
      expense risk charge and other charges. Besides Jackson National Life
        Distributors LLC, we are affiliated with the following broker-dealers:

*    National Planning Corporation,               

*    SII Investments, Inc.,                       

         *    IFC Holdings, Inc. d/b/a Invest Financial Corporation,

*    Investment Centers of America, Inc., and     

*    Curian Clearing LLC                          

The Distributor also has the following relationships with the 
      sub-advisers and their affiliates. The Distributor receives payments
       from certain sub-advisers to assist in defraying the costs of certain
   promotional and marketing meetings in which they participate. The
  amounts paid depend on the nature of the meetings, the number of
       meetings attended, the costs expected to be incurred and the level of
the sub-adviser's participation. National Planning Corporation
       participates in the sales of shares of retail mutual funds advised by
   certain sub-advisers and other unaffiliated entities and receives
   selling and other compensation from them in connection with those
       activities, as described in the prospectus or statement of additional
     information for those funds. The fees range between 0.30% and 0.45%
  depending on these factors. In addition, the Distributor acts as
       distributor of variable annuity contracts and variable life insurance
  policies (the "Other Contracts") issued by Jackson National Life
       Insurance Company and its subsidiary, Jackson National Life Insurance
    Company of New York. Raymond James Financial Services, a brokerage
      affiliate of the sub-adviser to the JNL/Eagle Funds, participates in
       the sale of Contracts and is compensated by JNLD, as are unaffiliated
broker-dealers, for its activities at the standard rates of   
compensation. The compensation consists of commissions, trail 
 commissions and other compensation or promotional incentives as
  described above and in the prospectus or statement of additional
information for the Other Contracts.                          

   All of the compensation described here, and other compensation or
         benefits provided by JNL or our affiliates, may be greater or less than
        the total compensation on similar or other products. The amount and/or
structure of the compensation may influence your registered   
      representative, broker-dealer or selling institution to present this
Contract over other investment alternatives. The variations in
        compensation, however, may also reflect differences in sales effort or
        ongoing customer services expected of the registered representative or
         the broker-dealer. You may ask your registered representative about any
variations and how he or she and his or her broker-dealer are 
compensated for selling the Contract.                         

 PURCHASES

         -----------------------------------------------------------------------
         THE INITIAL OFFERING OF THIS CONTRACT WILL BE LIMITED TO THE INDIVIDUAL
       RETIREMENT ANNUITY (IRA) AND TAX-QUALIFIED PLAN MARKET. ALTHOUGH THIS
         PROSPECTUS CONTAINS REFERENCES TO NON-QUALIFIED CONTRACTS, APPLICATIONS
  FOR NON-QUALIFIED CONTRACTS ARE NOT CURRENTLY BEING SOLICITED OR
        ACCEPTED. THIS PROSPECTUS WILL BE REVISED SHOULD JACKSON NATIONAL LIFE
  INSURANCE COMPANY LATER OFFER THIS CONTRACT IN THE NON-QUALIFIED
MARKET.                                                       
         -----------------------------------------------------------------------

MINIMUM INITIAL PREMIUM:                                      

*    $50,000 under most circumstances             

MINIMUM ADDITIONAL PREMIUMS:                                  

               *    $500  for  a  qualified  or  non-qualified   plan;  HOWEVER,
                    ADDITIONAL  PREMIUMS  WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED  BEYOND THE SIXTH
CONTRACT MONTH.                         

         As a result of the six Contract Month limit on subsequent premiums, you
 may have to buy additional Contracts to meet your total annuity
    coverage goal. Multiple Contracts may result in higher charges and
      total expenses. However, we reserve the right to limit the number of
      Contracts that you may purchase. We also reserve the right to refuse
any premium payment.                                          

         The minimums apply to purchases, but do not preclude subsequent partial
         withdrawals that would reduce Contract Values below the minimum initial
purchase amounts, as long as the amount left in the account is
    sufficient to pay any remaining withdrawal charge. There is a $100
    minimum balance requirement for each Investment Division and Fixed
  Account. We reserve the right to restrict availability or impose
restrictions on the Fixed Account.                            

MAXIMUM PREMIUMS:                                             

               *    The maximum  total of all  premiums you may make without our
prior approval is $1 million.           

     The payment of subsequent premiums within the limited period of the
      first six Contract Months, relative to market conditions at the time
 the payments are made, may or may not contribute to the various
     benefits under your Contract, including the optional enhanced death
benefits or any GMWB.                                         

       ALLOCATIONS OF PREMIUM. You may allocate your premiums to one or more
        of the Investment Divisions and Fixed Account. Each allocation must be
    a whole percentage between 0% and 100%. The minimum amount you may
         allocate to the Investment Division or a Fixed Account is $100. We will
     allocate any additional premiums you pay in the same way unless you
         instruct us otherwise. These allocations will be subject to our minimum
allocation rules.                                             

        We will issue your Contract and allocate your first premium within two
        business days (days when the New York Stock Exchange is open) after we
        receive your first premium and all information that we require for the
     purchase of a Contract. If we do not receive all of the information
        that we require, we will contact you to get the necessary information.
       If for some reason we are unable to complete this process within five
business days, we will return your money.                     

         Each business day ends when the New York Stock Exchange closes (usually
4:00 p.m. Eastern time).                                      

  CAPITAL PROTECTION PROGRAM. If you select our Capital Protection
        Program at issue, we will allocate enough of your premium to the Fixed
       Account you select to assure that the amount so allocated will equal,
    at the end of a selected period of 1, 3, 5, or 7 years, your total
         original premium paid. You may allocate the rest of your premium to any
   Investment Division(s). If any part of the Fixed Account value is
      surrendered or transferred before the end of the selected guaranteed
         period, the value at the end of that period will not equal the original
      premium. This program is available only if Fixed Account options are
       available. There is no charge for the Capital Protection Program. You
    should consult your JNL representative with respect to the current
   availability of Fixed Account options, their limitations, and the
availability of the Capital Protection Program.               

         For an example of capital protection, assume you made a premium payment
        of $10,000 when the interest rate for the three-year guaranteed period
       was 3.00% per year. We would allocate $9,152 to that guarantee period
      because $9,152 would increase at that interest rate to $10,000 after
       three years, assuming no withdrawals are taken. The remaining $848 of
  the payment would be allocated to the Investment Division(s) you
selected.                                                     

      Alternatively, assume Jackson National receives a premium payment of
         $10,000 when the interest rate for the 7-year period is 6.75% per year.
        Jackson National will allocate $6,331 to that guarantee period because
      $6,331 will increase at that interest rate to $10,000 after 7 years.
         The remaining $3,669 of the payment will be allocated to the Investment
Division(s) you selected.                                     

    Thus, as these examples demonstrate, the shorter guarantee periods
     require allocation of substantially all your premium to achieve the
        intended result. In each case, the results will depend on the interest
rate declared for the guarantee period.                       

ACCUMULATION UNITS. Your Contract Value allocated to the Investment
  Divisions will go up or down depending on the performance of the
         Investment Divisions you select. In order to keep track of the value of
       your Contract during the accumulation phase, we use a unit of measure
         called an "Accumulation Unit." During the income phase we use a measure
called an "Annuity Unit."                                     

        Every business day, we determine the value of an Accumulation Unit for
each of the Investment Divisions by:                          

               *    determining   the  total   amount  of  assets  held  in  the
particular Investment Division;         

               *    subtracting  any  asset-based  charges and taxes  chargeable
under the Contract; and                 

               *    dividing   this   amount  by  the   number  of   outstanding
Accumulation Units.                     

         Charges deducted through the cancellation of units are not reflected in
this computation.                                             

      The value of an Accumulation Unit may go up or down from day to day.
     The base Contract has a different Accumulation Unit value than each
       combination of optional endorsements an Owner may elect, based on the
      differing amount of charges applied in calculating that Accumulation
Unit value.                                                   

When you make a premium payment, we credit your Contract with 
   Accumulation Units. The number of Accumulation Units we credit is
        determined at the close of that business day by dividing the amount of
      the premium allocated to any Investment Division by the value of the
  Accumulation Unit for that Investment Division that reflects the
 combination of optional endorsements you have elected and their
respective charges.                                           

TRANSFERS AND FREQUENT TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS

       You may transfer your Contract Value between and among the Investment
Divisions at any time, unless transfers are subject to other  
         limitations, but transfers between an Investment Division and the Fixed
       Account must occur prior to the Income Date. Transfers from the Fixed
       Account will be subject to any applicable Excess Interest Adjustment.
         There may be periods when we do not offer the Fixed Account, or when we
         impose special transfer requirements on the Fixed Account. If a renewal
       occurs within one year of the Income Date, we will continue to credit
      interest up to the Income Date at the then Current Interest Rate for
         the Fixed Account Option. You can make 15 transfers every Contract Year
during the accumulation phase without charge.                 

        A transfer will be effective as of the end of the business day when we
       receive your transfer request in Good Order, and we will disclaim all
      liability for transfers made based on your transfer instructions, or
 the instructions of a third party authorized to submit transfer
requests on your behalf.                                      

        RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFERS: MARKET TIMING. The Contract is not designed
        for frequent transfers by anyone. Frequent transfers between and among
 Investment Divisions may disrupt the underlying Funds and could
         negatively impact performance, by interfering with efficient management
      and reducing long-term returns, and increasing administrative costs.
         Frequent transfers may also dilute the value of shares of an underlying
   Fund. Neither the Contracts nor the underlying Funds are meant to
   promote any active trading strategy, like market timing. Allowing
     frequent transfers by one or some Owners could be at the expense of
    other Owners of the Contract. To protect Owners and the underlying
    Funds, we have policies and procedures to deter frequent transfers
between and among the Investment Divisions.                   

         Under these policies and procedures, there is a $25 charge per transfer
      after 15 in a Contract Year, and no round trip transfers are allowed
       within 15 calendar days. Also, we could restrict your ability to make
     transfers to or from one or more of the Investment Divisions, which
possible restrictions may include, but are not limited to:    

          *    limiting the number of transfers over a period of time;

         *    requiring a minimum time period between each transfer;

               *    limiting transfer requests from an agent acting on behalf of
                    one or more Owners or under a power of attorney on behalf of
one or more Owners; or                  

               *    limiting the dollar  amount that you may transfer at any one
time.                                   

    To the extent permitted by applicable law, we reserve the right to
        restrict the number of transfers per year that you can request, and to
     restrict you from making transfers on consecutive business days. In
     addition, your right to make transfers between and among Investment
       Divisions may be modified if we determine that the exercise by one or
   more Owners is, or would be, to the disadvantage of other Owners.

     We continuously monitor transfers under the Contract for disruptive
     activity based on frequency, pattern and size. We will more closely
     monitor Contracts with disruptive activity, placing them on a watch
      list, and if the disruptive activity continues, we will restrict the
    availability of electronic or telephonic means to make a transfer,
        instead requiring that transfer instructions be mailed through regular
     U.S. postal service, and/or terminate the ability to make transfers
completely, as necessary. If we terminate your ability to make
    transfers, you may need to make a partial withdrawal to access the
      Contract Value in the Investment Division(s) from which you sought a
        transfer. We will notify you and your representative in writing within
five days of placing the Contract on a watch list.            

   Regarding round trip transfers, we will allow redemptions from an
         Investment Division; however, once a complete or partial redemption has
      been made from an Investment Division through an Investment Division
     transfer, you will not be permitted to transfer any value back into
        that Investment Division within 15 calendar days of the redemption. We
will treat as short-term trading activity any transfer that is
    requested into an Investment Division that was previously redeemed
within the previous 15 calendar days, whether the transfer was
requested by you or a third party.                            

         Our policies and procedures do not apply to the money market Investment
       Division, the Fixed Account, Dollar Cost Averaging, Earnings Sweep or
     the Automatic Rebalancing program. We may also make exceptions that
        involve an administrative error, or a personal unanticipated financial
        emergency of an Owner resulting from an identified health, employment,
         or other financial or personal event that makes the existing allocation
         imprudent or a hardship. These limited exceptions will be granted by an
   oversight team pursuant to procedures designed to result in their
      consistent application. Please contact our Annuity Service Center if
  you believe your transfer request entails a financial emergency.

     Otherwise, we do not exempt any person or class of persons from our
policies and procedures. We have agreements allowing for asset
       allocation and investment advisory services that are not only subject
       to our policies and procedures, but also to additional conditions and
      limitations, intended to limit the potential adverse impact of these
    activities on other Owners of the Contract. We expect to apply our
         policies and procedures uniformly, but because detection and deterrence
        involves judgments that are inherently subjective, we cannot guarantee
   that we will detect and deter every Contract engaging in frequent
         transfers every time. If these policies and procedures are ineffective,
         the adverse consequences described above could occur. We also expect to
      apply our policies and procedures in a manner reasonably designed to
       prevent transfers that we consider to be to the disadvantage of other
      Owners, and we may take whatever action we deem appropriate, without
        prior notice, to comply with or take advantage of any state or federal
regulatory requirement.                                       

 TELEPHONE AND INTERNET TRANSACTIONS

     THE BASICS. You can request certain transactions by telephone or at
      www.jnl.com, our Internet website, subject to our right to terminate
   electronic or telephonic transfer privileges described above. Our
      Annuity Service Center representatives are available during business
      hours to provide you with information about your account. We require
       that you provide proper identification before performing transactions
  over the telephone or through our Internet website. For Internet
         transactions, this will include a Personal Identification Number (PIN).
You may establish or change your PIN at www.jnl.com.          

         WHAT YOU CAN DO AND HOW. You may make transfers by telephone or through
the Internet unless you elect not to have this privilege. Any 
       authorization you provide to us in an application, at our website, or
through other means will authorize us to accept transaction   
       instructions, including Investment Division transfers/allocations, by
   you and your financial representative unless you notify us to the
       contrary. To notify us, please call us at the Annuity Service Center.
         Our contact information is on the cover page of this prospectus and the
       number is referenced in your Contract or on your quarterly statement.

 WHAT YOU CAN DO AND WHEN. When authorizing a transfer, you must
 complete your telephone call by the close of the New York Stock
    Exchange (usually 4:00 p.m. Eastern time) in order to receive that
day's Accumulation Unit value for an Investment Division.     

    Transfer instructions you send electronically are considered to be
received by us at the time and date stated on the electronic  
         acknowledgement we return to you. If the time and date indicated on the
         acknowledgement is before the close of the New York Stock Exchange, the
       instructions will be carried out that day. Otherwise the instructions
     will be carried out the next business day. We will retain permanent
         records of all web-based transactions by confirmation number. If you do
     not receive an electronic acknowledgement, you should telephone our
Annuity Service Center immediately.                           

        HOW TO CANCEL A TRANSACTION. You may only cancel an earlier telephonic
    or electronic transfer request made on the same day by calling the
   Annuity Service Center before the New York Stock Exchange closes.
         Otherwise, your cancellation instruction will not be allowed because of
the round trip transfer restriction.                          

   OUR PROCEDURES. Our procedures are designed to provide reasonable
     assurance that telephone or any other electronic authorizations are
        genuine. Our procedures include requesting identifying information and
        tape-recording telephone communications and other specific details. We
  and our affiliates disclaim all liability for any claim, loss or
        expense resulting from any alleged error or mistake in connection with
         a transaction requested by telephone or other electronic means that you
        did not authorize. However, if we fail to employ reasonable procedures
       to ensure that all requested transactions are properly authorized, we
may be held liable for such losses.                           

        We do not guarantee access to telephonic and electronic information or
 that we will be able to accept transaction instructions via the
       telephone or electronic means at all times. We also reserve the right
    to modify, limit, restrict, or discontinue at any time and without
         notice the acceptance of instruction from someone other than you and/or
        this telephonic and electronic transaction privilege. Elections of any
      optional benefit or program must be in writing and will be effective
upon receipt of the request in Good Order.                    

Upon notification of the Owner's death, any telephone transfer
        authorization, other than by the surviving joint Owners, designated by
     the Owner ceases and we will not allow such transactions unless the
        executor/representative provides written authorization for a person or
persons to act on the executor's/representative's behalf.     

ACCESS TO YOUR MONEY

You can have access to the money in your Contract:            

     *    by making either a partial or complete withdrawal,

 *    by electing the Systematic Withdrawal Program,

               *    by  electing  a  Guaranteed   Minimum   Withdrawal   Benefit
("GMWB"), or                            

*    by electing to receive income payments.      

       Your Beneficiary can have access to the money in your Contract when a
death benefit is paid.                                        

         Except in connection with certain withdrawals associated with a GMWB or
      withdrawals made to satisfy minimum distribution requirements of the
 Internal Revenue Code, a withdrawal before the end of the sixth
      Contract month will affect the Aggregate Premium as re-determined at
 the end of the sixth Contract Month, and may result in a higher
     Mortality and Expense Risk Charge. At the end of the sixth Contract
Month, the Aggregate Premium is re-determined to equal:       

*    The actual Premium paid to date;             

               *    Less total partial withdrawals to date unless one of the two
following conditions apply:             

                    1.   Total  partial  withdrawals  are less than the  maximum
                         annual  withdrawal  permitted  in  accordance  with the
GMWB, if applicable, or       

                                                                [Download Table]

                                                            

*    Partial  Withdrawals are assumed to be the total amount
     withdrawn  from the Contract,  including any Withdrawal
     Charges and Excess Interest ADJUSTMENTS.               

*    All  withdrawals   including  systematic   withdrawals,
     required  minimum  distributions  prior  to the  Income
     Date,  withdrawals  of asset  allocation  and  advisory
     fees, and free withdrawals are counted toward the total
     amount withdrawn in a Contract Year.                   

                    2.   All  partial  withdrawals  taken  during  the first six
                         Contract  Months are made to satisfy  required  minimum
                         distributions  under the Internal Revenue Code for each
                         applicable  calendar  year  spanned by the six Contract
Month period.                 

    Withdrawals under the Contract may also be subject to a withdrawal
        charge. For purposes of the withdrawal charge, we treat withdrawals as
        coming first from earnings and then from the oldest remaining premium.
        When you make a complete withdrawal you will receive the value of your
        Contract as of the end of the business day your request is received by
   us in Good Order, MINUS any applicable taxes, the annual contract
        maintenance charge, charges due under any optional endorsement and all
   applicable withdrawal charges, adjusted for any applicable Excess
     Interest Adjustment. For more information about withdrawal charges,
please see "Withdrawal Charge" beginning on page 14.          

       Your withdrawal request must be in writing. We will accept withdrawal
       requests submitted via facsimile. There are risks associated with not
  requiring original signatures in order to disburse the money. To
     minimize the risks, the proceeds will be sent to your last recorded
     address in our records, so be sure to notify us, in writing with an
original signature of any address change. We do not assume    
         responsibility for improper disbursements if you have failed to provide
   us with the current address to which the proceeds should be sent.

       Except in connection with the Systematic Withdrawal Program, you must
    withdraw at least $500 or, if less, the entire amount in the Fixed
Account or Investment Division from which you are making the  
         withdrawal. If you are not specific, your withdrawal will be taken from
         your allocations to the Investment Divisions and Fixed Account based on
         the proportion their respective values bear to the Contract Value. With
        the Systematic Withdrawal Program, you may withdraw a specified dollar
    amount (of at least $50 per withdrawal) or a specified percentage.
        After your withdrawal, at least $100 must remain in each Fixed Account
or Investment Division from which the withdrawal was taken. A 
      withdrawal request that would reduce the remaining Contract Value to
        less than $100 will be treated as a request for a complete withdrawal.

         If you have an investment adviser who, for a fee, manages your Contract
  Value, you may authorize payment of the fee from the Contract by
        requesting a partial withdrawal. There are conditions and limitations,
        so please contact our Annuity Service Center for more information. Our
         contact information is on the cover page of this prospectus. We neither
     endorse any investment advisers, nor make any representations as to
      their qualifications. The fee for this service would be covered in a
        separate agreement between the two of you, and would be in addition to
the fees and expenses described in this prospectus.           

       INCOME TAXES, TAX PENALTIES AND CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS MAY APPLY TO ANY
WITHDRAWAL YOU MAKE. THERE ARE LIMITATIONS ON WITHDRAWALS FROM
        QUALIFIED PLANS. FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE SEE "TAXES" BEGINNING ON
PAGE 49.                                                      

         WAIVER OF WITHDRAWAL CHARGES FOR CERTAIN EMERGENCIES. We will waive the
      withdrawal charge (withdrawals from the Investment Divisions and the
   Fixed Account), but not any Excess Interest Adjustment that would
  otherwise apply in certain circumstances by providing you, at no
charge, the following:                                        

               *    TERMINAL  ILLNESS  BENEFIT,  under  which we will  waive any
                    withdrawal  charges  on amounts  of up to  $250,000  of your
                    Contract  Value  from the  Investment  Divisions  and  Fixed
                    Account  that  you  withdraw  after   providing  us  with  a
                    physician's  statement  that you have been diagnosed with an
                illness that will result in your death within 12 months;

               *    SPECIFIED  CONDITIONS  BENEFIT,  under  which you may make a
                    one-time  withdrawal  of up to 25% (for joint  Owners,  this
                    benefit  applies  to  each  of  them  for 12  1/2%)  of your
                    Contract  Value  from the  Investment  Divisions  and  Fixed
                    Account with no withdrawal  charge after having  provided us
                    with a physician's  statement  that you have been  diagnosed
with one of the following conditions:   

*    Heart attack               

*    Stroke                     

*    Coronary artery surgery    

*    Life-threatening cancer    

*    Renal failure or           

*    Alzheimer's disease; and   

               *    EXTENDED  CARE  BENEFIT,  under  which  we  will  waive  any
                    withdrawal  charges  on amounts  of up to  $250,000  of your
                    Contract  Value  from the  Investment  Divisions  and  Fixed
                    Account  that  you  withdraw  after   providing  us  with  a
                    physician's  statement  that you  have  been  confined  to a
                    nursing home or hospital for 90 consecutive days,  beginning
        at least 30 days after your Contract was issued.

You may exercise these benefits once under your Contract.     

GUARANTEED MINIMUM WITHDRAWAL BENEFIT GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS. Most
        people who are managing their investments to provide retirement income
        want to provide themselves with sufficient lifetime income and also to
        provide for an inheritance for their beneficiaries. The main obstacles
      they face in meeting these goals are the uncertainties as to (i) how
         much income their investments will produce, and (ii) how long they will
        live and will need to draw income from their investments. A Guaranteed
    Minimum Withdrawal Benefit (GMWB) is designed to help reduce these
uncertainties.                                                

       A GMWB is intended to address those concerns but does not provide any
   guarantee the income will be sufficient to cover any individual's
    particular needs. Moreover, the GMWB does not assure that you will
        receive any return on your investments. The GMWB also does not protect
     against loss of purchasing power of assets covered by a GMWB due to
inflation. Even relatively low levels of inflation may have a 
  significant effect on purchasing power if not offset by stronger
    positive investment returns. The step-up feature on certain of the
      GMWBs may provide protection against inflation when there are strong
       investment returns that coincide with the availability of effecting a
step-up.                                                      

      Payments under the GMWB will first be made from your Contract Value.
    Our obligations to pay you more than your Contract Value will only
         arise under limited circumstances. Thus, in considering the election of
        any GMWB you need to consider whether the value to you of the level of
   protection that is provided by a GMWB and its costs, which reduce
        Contract Value and offset our risks, are consistent with your level of
      concern and the minimum level of assets that you want to be sure are
guaranteed.                                                   

      The 5% For Life GMWB with the Joint Option available only to spouses
         differs from the 5% For Life GMWB without the Joint Option available to
    spouses and unrelated parties and enjoys the following advantages:

               o    If the Contract Value falls to zero,  benefit payments under
                    the  endorsement  will continue  until the death of the last
                    surviving   Covered  Life  if  the  For  Life  Guarantee  is
                    effective.   (For  more  information   about  the  For  Life
                    Guarantee and for information on who is a Covered Life under
                    this  form of  GMWB,  please  see  the  "Joint  5% For  Life
Guaranteed  Minimum  Withdrawal Benefit With Annual Step-Up"
beginning on page 38.)                  

               o    If an Owner dies  before the  automatic  payment of benefits
                    begins, the surviving Covered Life may continue the Contract
                    and the For Life Guarantee is not  automatically  terminated
                 (as it is on the For Life GMWB without the Joint Option).

 GUARANTEED MINIMUM WITHDRAWAL BENEFIT IMPORTANT SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS.
      Each of the GMWBs provides that the GMWB and all benefits thereunder
   will terminate on the Income Date, which is the date when annuity
         payments begin. The Income Date is either a date that you choose or the
     Latest Income Date. The Latest Income Date is the date on which the
       Owner attains age 90 under a Non-Qualified Contract, unless otherwise
  approved by the Company, or such earlier date as required by the
applicable qualified plan, law or regulation.                 

     Before (1) electing a GMWB, (2) electing to annuitize your Contract
      after having purchased a GMWB, or (3) when the Latest Income Date is
         approaching and you are thinking about electing or have elected a GMWB,
       you should consider whether the termination of all benefits under the
     GMWB and annuitizing produces the better financial results for you.
      Naturally, you should discuss with your JNL representative whether a
         GMWB is even suitable for you. Consultation with your financial and tax
advisor is also recommended.                                  

      These considerations are of greater significance if you are thinking
 about electing or have elected a GMWB For Life, as the For Life
     payments will cease when you annuitize voluntarily or on the Latest
      Income Date. To the extent that we can extend the Latest Income Date
         without adverse tax consequences to you, we will do so, as permitted by
   the applicable qualified plan, law, or regulation. After you have
       consulted your financial and tax advisors you will need to contact us
    to request an extension of the Latest Income Date. Please also see
    "Extension of Latest Income Date" beginning on page 52 for further
      information regarding possible adverse tax consequences of extending
the Latest Income Date.                                       

         In addition, with regard to required minimum distributions (RMDs) under
        an IRA only, it is important to consult your financial and tax advisor
     to determine whether the benefits of a particular GMWB will satisfy
       your RMD requirements. With regard to other qualified plans, you must
 determine what your qualified plan permits. Distributions under
        qualified plans and Tax-Sheltered Annuities must begin by the later of
       the calendar year in which you attain age 70 1/2 or the calendar year
    in which you retire. You do not necessarily have to annuitize your
Contract to meet the minimum distribution.                    

 5% GUARANTEED MINIMUM WITHDRAWAL BENEFIT WITH ANNUAL STEP-UP. THE
     FOLLOWING DESCRIPTION IS SUPPLEMENTED BY THE EXAMPLES IN APPENDIX B
   THAT MAY ASSIST YOU IN UNDERSTANDING HOW CALCULATIONS ARE MADE IN
   CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. For Owners 80 years old and younger on the
    Contract's Issue Date, or on the date on which this endorsement is
    selected if after the Contract's Issue Date, a 5% GMWB With Annual
  Step-Up may be available, which permits an Owner to make partial
         withdrawals, prior to the Income Date that, in total, are guaranteed to
   equal the Guaranteed Withdrawal Balance (GWB) (as defined below),
       regardless of your Contract Value. THE 5% GMWB WITH ANNUAL STEP-UP IS
        NOT AVAILABLE ON A CONTRACT THAT ALREADY HAS A GMWB (ONE GMWB ONLY PER
   CONTRACT). We may further limit the availability of this optional
       endorsement. Once selected, the 5% GMWB With Annual Step-Up cannot be
  canceled. If you select the 5% GMWB With Annual Step-Up when you
    purchase your Contract, your premium payment net of any applicable
      taxes will be used as the basis for determining the GWB. The 5% GMWB
         With Annual Step-Up may also be selected after the Issue Date within 30
     days before any Contract Anniversary, and the endorsement will take
         effect on the Contract Anniversary if your request is in Good Order. If
     you select the 5% GMWB With Annual Step-Up after the Issue Date, to
    determine the GWB, we will use your Contract Value on the date the
         endorsement is added to the Contract. THE GWB CAN NEVER BE MORE THAN $5
      MILLION (including upon "step-up"), and the GWB is reduced with each
withdrawal you take.                                          

      Once the GWB has been determined, we calculate the Guaranteed Annual
Withdrawal Amount (GAWA), which is the maximum annual partial 
   withdrawal amount, except for certain tax-qualified Contracts (as
       explained below). Upon selection, the GAWA is equal to 5% of the GWB.
      The GAWA will not be reduced if partial withdrawals taken within any
  one Contract Year do not exceed 5%. However, withdrawals are not
     cumulative. If you do not take 5% in one Contract Year, you may not
         take more than 5% the next Contract Year. If you withdraw more than 5%,
    the guaranteed amount available may be less than the total premium
      payments and the GAWA may be reduced. The GAWA can be divided up and
        taken on a payment schedule that you request. You can continue to take
the GAWA each Contract Year until the GWB has been depleted.  

        Withdrawal charges and Excess Interest Adjustments, as applicable, are
    taken into consideration in calculating the amount of your partial
    withdrawals pursuant to the 5% GMWB With Annual Step-Up, but these
charges or adjustments are offset by your ability to make free
      withdrawals under the Contract. For certain tax-qualified Contracts,
     the 5% GMWB With Annual Step-Up allows for withdrawals greater than
         GAWA to meet the required minimum distribution (RMD) under the Internal
        Revenue Code (Code) without compromising the endorsement's guarantees.
 Examples 3, 4, and 6 in Appendix B supplement this description.

  Premiums are accepted during the first six Contract Months only;
        however, any time a subsequent premium payment is made, we recalculate
        the GWB and the GAWA. Each time you make a premium payment, the GWB is
         increased by the amount of the net premium payment. Also, the GAWA will
        increase by 5% of the net premium payment or 5% of the increase in the
     GWB, if the maximum GWB is reached. We require prior approval for a
         subsequent premium payment, however, that would result in your Contract
     having $1 million of premiums in the aggregate. We also reserve the
right to refuse subsequent premium payments.                  

       If the total of your partial withdrawals made in the current Contract
      Year is greater than the GAWA, we will recalculate your GWB and your
        GAWA may be lower in the future. In other words, WITHDRAWING MORE THAN
         THE GAWA IN ANY CONTRACT YEAR COULD CAUSE THE GWB TO BE REDUCED BY MORE
         THAN THE AMOUNT OF THE WITHDRAWAL(S) AND EVEN RESET TO THE THEN CURRENT
         CONTRACT VALUE, LIKELY REDUCING THE GAWA, TOO. Recalculation of the GWB
 and GAWA may result in reducing or extending the payout period.
 Examples 3, 4 and 6 in Appendix B illustrate the impact of such
withdrawals.                                                  

      If the partial withdrawal plus all prior partial withdrawals made in
         the current Contract Year is less than or equal to the GAWA, the GWB is
equal to the greater of:                                      

               *    the GWB prior to the  partial  withdrawal  less the  partial
withdrawal; or                          

*    zero.                                        

      If the partial withdrawal plus all prior partial withdrawals made in
         the current Contract Year is greater than the GAWA, the GWB is equal to
the lesser of:                                                

      *    the Contract Value after the partial withdrawal; or

               *    the greater of the GWB prior to the partial  withdrawal less
the partial withdrawal or zero.         

       If all your partial withdrawals made in the current Contract Year are
less than or equal to the GAWA, the GAWA is the lesser of:    

*    the GAWA prior to the partial withdrawal; or 

*    the GWB after the partial withdrawal.        

      If the partial withdrawal plus all prior partial withdrawals made in
       the current Contract Year is greater than the GAWA, the GAWA is equal
to the lesser of:                                             

*    the GAWA prior to the partial withdrawal, or 

*    the GWB after the partial withdrawal, or     

         *    5% of the Contract Value after the partial withdrawal.

         For purposes of these calculations, all partial withdrawals are assumed
        to be the total amount withdrawn, including any withdrawal charges and
Excess Interest Adjustments.                                  

         Withdrawals made under the guarantee of this endorsement are considered
       to be the same as any other partial withdrawals, including systematic
         withdrawals, for the purposes of calculating any other values under the
   Contract and any other endorsements. They are subject to the same
 restrictions and processing rules as described in the Contract.
      Withdrawals under the guarantee of this endorsement are also treated
      the same for federal income tax purposes. For more information about
    your non-qualified Contract, please see "Non-Qualified Contracts -
Withdrawals and Income Payments" beginning on page 50. For more
information about your tax-qualified Contract, please see     
       "Tax-Qualified Contracts - Withdrawals and Income Payments" beginning
on page 51.                                                   

 REQUIRED MINIMUM DISTRIBUTION CALCULATIONS. Notice of an RMD is
  required at the time of your withdrawal request, and there is an
         administrative form for such notice. The administrative form allows for
   one time or systematic withdrawals. Eligible withdrawals that are
        specified as RMDs may only be taken based on the value of the Contract
      to which the endorsement applies, even where the Code allows for the
taking of RMDs for multiple contracts from a single contract. 
       Initiating and monitoring for compliance with the RMD requirements is
the sole responsibility of the Owner.                         

         Under the Code, RMDs are calculated and taken on a calendar year basis.
     But with the 5% GMWB With Annual Step-Up, GAWA is based on Contract
       Years. Because the intervals for the GAWA and RMDs are different, the
        endorsement's guarantees may be more susceptible to being compromised.
With tax-qualified Contracts, if the sum of your total partial
         withdrawals in a Contract Year exceed the greatest of either of the RMD
        for each of the two calendar years occurring in that Contract Year and
 the GAWA for that Contract Year, then the GWB and GAWA could be
       adversely recalculated, as described above. (If your Contract Year is
   the same as the calendar year, then the sum of your total partial
     withdrawals should not exceed the greater of the RMD and the GAWA.)
Below is an example of how this modified limit would apply.   

                  Assume a tax-qualified Contract with a Contract Year that runs
             from July 1 to June 30, and that there are no withdrawals
                other than as described. The GAWA for the 2006 Contract Year
             (ending June 30) is 10. The RMD requirements for calendar
    years 2005 and 2006 are 14 and 16, respectively.

              If the Owner takes 7 in each of the two halves of calendar
              year 2005 and 8 in each of the two halves of calendar year
              2006, then at the time the withdrawal in the first half of
                  calendar year 2006 is taken, the Owner will have withdrawn 15.
           Because the sum of the Owner's withdrawals for the 2006
             Contract Year is less than the higher RMD requirement for
               either of the two calendar years occurring in that Contract
               Year, the GWB and GAWA would not be adversely recalculated.

     An exception to this general rule is that with the calendar year in
      which your RMDs are to begin (generally, when you reach age 70 1/2),
         however, you may take your RMDs for the current and next calendar years
  during the same Contract Year, as necessary (see example below).

                The following example illustrates this exception. It assumes
                 an individual Owner, born January 1, 1935, of a tax-qualified
               Contract with a Contract Year that runs from July 1 to June
30.                                         

                 If the Owner delays taking his first RMD (the 2005 RMD) until
                  March 30, 2006, he may still take the 2006 RMD before the next
                Contract Year begins, June 30, 2006 without exposing the GWB
                  and GAWA to the possibility of adverse recalculation. However,
                  if he takes his second RMD (the 2006 RMD) after June 30, 2006,
               he should wait until the next Contract Year begins (that is
              after June 30, 2007) to take his third RMD (the 2007 RMD).
              Because, except for the calendar year in which RMDs begin,
                 taking two RMDs in a single Contract Year could cause the GWB
          and GAWA to be adversely recalculated (if the two RMDs
         exceeded the applicable GAWA for that Contract Year).

 EXAMPLES THAT ARE RELEVANT SPECIFIC TO TAX-QUALIFIED CONTRACTS,
  ILLUSTRATING THE GMWB IN VARYING CIRCUMSTANCES AND WITH SPECIFIC
      FACTUAL ASSUMPTIONS, ARE AT THE END OF THE PROSPECTUS IN APPENDIX B,
      PARTICULARLY EXAMPLES 3, 4, AND 6. PLEASE CONSULT THE REPRESENTATIVE
WHO IS HELPING, OR WHO HELPED, YOU PURCHASE YOUR TAX-QUALIFIED
         CONTRACT, AND YOUR TAX ADVISER, TO BE SURE THAT THE 5% GMWB WITH ANNUAL
STEP-UP ULTIMATELY SUITS YOUR NEEDS RELATIVE TO YOUR RMD.     

STEP-UPS. Step-ups with the 5% GMWB With Annual Step-Up reset your GWB
      to the greater of Contract Value or the GWB before step-up, and GAWA
  becomes the greater of 5% of the new GWB or GAWA before step-up.
 Step-ups occur automatically upon each of the first 12 Contract
       Anniversaries from the endorsement's effective date, then on or after
       the 13th Contract Anniversary, at any time upon your request, so long
    as there is at least one year between step-ups. UPON ELECTION OF A
   STEP-UP, THE GWMB CHARGE MAY BE INCREASED, SUBJECT TO THE MAXIMUM
      CHARGES LISTED ABOVE. The request will be processed and effective on
  the day we receive the request in Good Order. Before deciding to
      "step-up," please consult the representative who helped you purchase
      your Contract to be sure if a Step-Up is right for you and about any
     increase in charges upon a Step-Up. Upon election of a Step-Up, the
applicable GMWB charge will be reflected in your confirmation.

         SPOUSAL CONTINUATION. If you die before annuitizing a Contract with the
    5% GMWB With Annual Step-Up, the Contract's death benefit is still
      payable when Contract Value is greater than zero. Alternatively, the
    Contract allows the Beneficiary who is your spouse to continue it,
  retaining all rights previously held by the Owner. If the spouse
        continues the Contract and the 5% GMWB With Annual Step-Up endorsement
       already applies to the Contract, the 5% GMWB With Annual Step-Up will
       continue and no adjustment will be made to the GWB or the GAWA at the
  time of continuation. Step-ups will continue automatically or as
 permitted (as described above), and Contract Anniversaries will
    continue to be based on the anniversary of the original Contract's
         Issue Date. Upon spousal continuation of a Contract without the 5% GMWB
         With Annual Step-Up, if the 5% GMWB With Annual Step-Up is available at
         the time, the Beneficiary may request to add this endorsement within 30
     days before any Contract Anniversary, and the endorsement will take
   effect on the Contract Anniversary if the request is made in Good
Order.                                                        

TERMINATION. The 5% GMWB With Annual Step-Up endorsement terminates
     subject to a prorated GMWB Charge assessed for the period since the
         last quarterly or monthly statement charge on the date you annuitize or
        surrender the Contract. In surrendering the Contract, you will receive
        the Contract Value less any applicable charges and adjustments and not
    the GWB or the GAWA you would have received under the 5% GMWB With
       Annual Step-Up. The 5% GMWB With Annual Step-Up also terminates: with
         the Contract upon your death (unless the beneficiary who is your spouse
 continues the Contract) or upon the first date both the GWB and
Contract Value equal zero - whichever occurs first.           

      CONTRACT VALUE IS ZERO. If your Contract Value is reduced to zero as
   the result of a partial withdrawal, contract charges or poor fund
       performance and the GWB is greater than zero, the GWB will be paid to
you on a periodic basis elected by you, which will be no less 
         frequently than annually. The total annual payment will equal the GAWA,
      but will not exceed the current GWB. The payments continue until the
GWB is reduced to zero.                                       

All other rights under your Contract cease and all optional   
   endorsements are terminated without value. Upon your death as the
       Owner, your Beneficiary will receive the scheduled payments. No other
death benefit will be paid.                                   

         ANNUITIZATION. If you decide to annuitize your Contract, you may choose
        the following income option instead of one of the other income options
listed in your Contract:                                      

        FIXED PAYMENT INCOME OPTION. This income option provides payments in a
       fixed dollar amount for a specific number of years. The actual number
      of years that payments will be made is determined on the calculation
       date by dividing the GWB by the GAWA. Upon each payment, the GWB will
        be reduced by the payment amount. The total annual amount payable will
       equal the GAWA but will never exceed the current GWB. This annualized
        amount will be paid over the specific number of years in the frequency
       (no less frequently than annually) that you select. If you should die
(assuming you are the Annuitant) before the payments have been
       completed, the remaining payments will be made to the Beneficiary, as
scheduled.                                                    

      This income option may not be available if the Contract is issued to
     qualify under Sections 401, 403, 408 or 457 of the Internal Revenue
        Code. For such Contracts, this income option will only be available if
         the guaranteed period is less than the life expectancy of the Annuitant
at the time the option becomes effective.                     

        SEE "GUARANTEED MINIMUM WITHDRAWAL BENEFIT GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS" AND
 "GUARANTEED    MINIMUM    WITHDRAWAL    BENEFIT    IMPORTANT   SPECIAL
 CONSIDERATIONS" BEGINNING ON PAGE 27 FOR ADDITIONAL THINGS TO CONSIDER
        BEFORE ELECTING A GMWB; WHEN ELECTING TO ANNUITIZE YOUR CONTRACT AFTER
        HAVING PURCHASED A GMWB; OR WHEN THE LATEST INCOME DATE IS APPROACHING
AND YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT ELECTING OR HAVE ELECTED A GMWB.   

         EFFECT OF GMWB ON TAX DEFERRAL. The purchase of the 5% GMWB With Annual
        Step-Up may not be appropriate for the Owners of Contracts who have as
       a primary objective taking maximum advantage of the tax deferral that
         is available to them under an annuity contract. Please consult your tax
        and financial advisors on this and other matters prior to electing the
5% GMWB With Annual Step-Up.                                  

 5% FOR LIFE GUARANTEED MINIMUM WITHDRAWAL BENEFIT WITH ANNUAL STEP-UP.
        The following description of this GMWB is supplemented by the examples
   in Appendix B, particularly examples 5 and 6 for the Step-Ups and
    examples 7 and 8 for the For Life guarantees. This GMWB guarantees
     partial withdrawals during the Contract's accumulation phase (i.e.,
before the Income Date) for the LONGER of:                    

               *    The Owner's life (the "For Life  Guarantee") if the For Life
Guarantee is in effect;                 

                        The For Life Guarantee is based on the life of the
                         first Owner to die with joint Owners. There is also
                   another GMWB option for joint owners that are
  spouses, as described below.

                        For the Owner that is a legal entity, the For Life
                        Guarantee is based on the Annuitant's life (or the
                         life of the first Annuitant to die if there is more
than one Annuitant).      

                     The For Life Guarantee becomes effective on the
                          Contract Anniversary on or immediately following the
                      Owner's 65th birthday (or with joint Owners, the
                     oldest Owner's 65th birthday). If the Owner (or
                   oldest Owner) is 65 years old or older on the
                     endorsement's effective date, then the For Life
                           Guarantee is effective when this GMWB is added to the
Contract.                 

                     So long as the For Life Guarantee is in effect,
                           withdrawals are guaranteed even in the event Contract
Value is reduced to zero. 

OR                                                

               *    Until  all   withdrawals   under  the  Contract   equal  the
                    Guaranteed  Withdrawal  Balance  (GWB),  without  regard  to
Contract Value.                         

                           The GWB is the guaranteed amount available for future
periodic withdrawals.     

            BECAUSE OF THE FOR LIFE GUARANTEE, YOUR WITHDRAWALS COULD AMOUNT
              TO MORE THAN THE GWB. BUT PLEASE NOTE: THE GUARANTEES OF THIS GMWB
   ARE SUBJECT TO THE ENDORSEMENT'S TERMS, CONDITIONS, AND
LIMITATIONS THAT ARE EXPLAINED BELOW.               

      Please consult the representative who is helping, or who helped, you
        purchase your Contract to be sure that this GMWB ultimately suits your
needs.                                                        

      This GMWB is available to Owners 45 to 80 years old (proof of age is
         required); may be added to a Contract on the Issue Date or any Contract
        Anniversary; and once added cannot be canceled except by a Beneficiary
      who is the Owner's spouse, who, upon the Owner's death, may elect to
    continue the Contract without the GMWB. At least 30 calendar days'
      prior notice and proof of age is required for Good Order to add this
GMWB to a Contract on a Contract Anniversary. THIS GMWB IS NOT
    AVAILABLE ON A CONTRACT THAT ALREADY HAS A GMWB (ONLY ONE GMWB PER
         CONTRACT). We allow ownership changes of a Contract with this GMWB when
         the Owner is a legal entity - to another legal entity or the Annuitant.
         Otherwise, ownership changes are not allowed. Also, when the Owner is a
  legal entity, charges will be determined based on the age of the
        Annuitant and changing Annuitants is not allowed. Availability of this
GMWB may be subject to further limitation.                    

There is a limit on withdrawals each Contract Year to keep the
        guarantees of this GMWB in full effect - the greater of the Guaranteed
Annual Withdrawal Amount (GAWA) and for certain tax-qualified 
       Contracts, the required minimum distribution (RMD) under the Internal
         Revenue Code. Withdrawals exceeding the limit do not invalidate the For
Life Guarantee, but cause the GWB and GAWA to be recalculated.

       ELECTION. The GWB depends on when this GMWB is added to the Contract,
and the GAWA derives from the GWB.                            

                                          --------------------------------------
          WHEN THIS GMWB IS ADDED TO THE The GWB equals initial premium net of
  CONTRACT ON THE ISSUE DATE -   any applicable premium taxes.

                                  The GAWA equals 5% of the GWB.
                                          --------------------------------------

                                          --------------------------------------

                                          --------------------------------------

         PLEASE NOTE:  AT THE TIME THE FOR LIFE GUARANTEE BECOMES EFFECTIVE, THE
GAWA IS RESET TO EQUAL 5% OF THE THEN CURRENT GWB.            

      Premium net of any applicable premium taxes is used to calculate the
       GWB when this GMWB is added to the Contract on the Issue Date. If you
  were to instead add this GMWB to your Contract post issue on any
        Contract Anniversary, the GWB is calculated based on Contract Value on
         the date the endorsement is added to the Contract. THE GWB CAN NEVER BE
       MORE THAN $5 MILLION (including upon Step-up), and the GWB is reduced
by each withdrawal.                                           

WITHDRAWALS. Withdrawals may cause both the GWB and GAWA to be
    recalculated, depending on whether or not the withdrawal, plus all
       prior withdrawals in the current Contract Year, is less than or equal
       to the GAWA, or for certain tax-qualified Contracts only, the RMD (if
      greater than the GAWA). The two tables below clarify what happens in
      either instance. RMD denotes the required minimum distribution under
     the Internal Revenue Code for certain tax-qualified Contracts only.
(There is no RMD for non-qualified Contracts.)                

       REQUIRED MINIMUM DISTRIBUTION CALCULATIONS. For certain tax-qualified
       Contracts, this GMWB allows withdrawals greater than GAWA to meet the
   Contract's RMD without compromising the endorsement's guarantees.
        Examples 3, 4 and 6 in Appendix B supplement this description. Because
    the intervals for the GAWA and RMDs are different, namely Contract
    Years versus calendar years, and because RMDs are subject to other
 conditions and limitations, if your Contract is a tax-qualified
   Contract, then please see "RMD NOTES" below for more information.

                                           -------------------------------------
         WHEN A WITHDRAWAL, PLUS ALL       The GWB is recalculated, equaling the
PRIOR WITHDRAWALS IN THE          greater of:

        THAN OR EQUAL TO THE GREATER OF       *  The GWB before the withdrawal

                      *  Zero.

               The GAWA:

                                           *  Is unchanged WHILE THE FOR
                                                LIFE GUARANTEE IS IN effect;
                             OTHERWISE
                                          *  Is recalculated, equaling
                                          the lesser of the GAWA
                                             before the withdrawal, or
                                     the GWB after the
                               withdrawal.
                                           -------------------------------------

         The GAWA is NOT reduced if all withdrawals during any one Contract Year
      do not exceed the greater of the GAWA or RMD, as applicable. You may
        withdraw the greater of the GAWA or RMD, as applicable, all at once or
        throughout the Contract Year. Withdrawing less than the greater of the
        GAWA or RMD, as applicable, in a Contract Year does not entitle you to
      withdraw more than the greater of the GAWA or RMD, as applicable, in
        the next Contract Year. The amount you may withdraw each Contract Year
        and not cause the GWB and GAWA to be recalculated does not accumulate.

         Withdrawing more than the greater of the GAWA or RMD, as applicable, in
         a Contract Year causes the GWB and GAWA to be recalculated (see below).
     In recalculating the GWB, the GWB could be reduced by more than the
       withdrawal amount - even set equal to the Contract Value. The GAWA is
also potentially impacted.                                    

                                           -------------------------------------
         WHEN A WITHDRAWAL, PLUS ALL       The GWB is recalculated, equaling the
PRIOR WITHDRAWALS IN THE          lesser of:                  
CURRENT CONTRACT YEAR, EXCEEDS

                                           the withdrawal less the
                                        withdrawal, or zero.

                                        The GAWA is recalculated, equaling
                    the lesser of:

                                               *  5% of the Contract Value after
                                      the withdrawal; OR
                                             *  The greater of 5% of the GWB
                                            after the withdrawal, or
                         zero.
                                           -------------------------------------

Withdrawals under this GMWB are assumed to be the total amount
     withdrawn, including any charges and/or adjustments. Withdrawals in
       excess of free withdrawals may be subject to a withdrawal charge. Any
         withdrawals from Contract Value allocated to a Fixed Account option may
    be subject to an Excess Interest Adjustment. For more information,
please see "THE FIXED ACCOUNT" beginning on page 10.          

  Withdrawals under this GMWB are considered the same as any other
      partial withdrawals for the purposes of calculating any other values
 under the Contract and any other endorsements (for example, the
   Contract's death benefit). All withdrawals count toward the total
        amount withdrawn in a Contract Year, including systematic withdrawals,
RMDs for certain tax-qualified Contracts, withdrawals of asset
        allocation and advisory fees, and free withdrawals under the Contract.
   They are subject to the same restrictions and processing rules as
       described in the Contract. They are also treated the same for federal
    income tax purposes. For more information about your non-qualified
        Contract, please see "Non-Qualified Contracts - Withdrawals and Income
Payments" beginning on page 50. For more information about your
tax-qualified Contract, please see "Tax-Qualified Contracts -
Withdrawals and Income Payments" beginning on page 51.        

              ------------------------------------------------------------------
       RMD NOTES: Notice of an RMD is required at the time of your
            withdrawal request, and there is an administrative form for such
             notice. The administrative form allows for one time or systematic
            withdrawals. Eligible withdrawals that are specified as RMDs may
         only be taken based on the value of the Contract to which the
            endorsement applies, even where the Internal Revenue Code allows
       for the taking of RMDs for multiple contracts from a single
           contract. Initiating and monitoring for compliance with the RMD
 requirements is the sole responsibility of the Owner.

             Under the Internal Revenue Code, RMDs are calculated and taken on
             a calendar year basis.  But with this GMWB,  the GAWA is based on
             Contract  Years.  Because the intervals for the GAWA and RMDs are
             different,  the For Life  Guarantee  may be more  susceptible  to
             being invalidated.  With tax-qualified  Contracts,  if the sum of
             your total  partial  withdrawals  in a Contract  Year  exceed the
             greatest of the RMD for each of the two calendar years  occurring
             in that Contract Year and the GAWA for that Contract  Year,  then
             the GWB and GAWA could be  adversely  recalculated,  as described
             above.  (If your Contract Year is the same as the calendar  year,
             then the sum of your total partial  withdrawals should not exceed
             the greater of the RMD and the GAWA.)  Below is an example of how
this modified limit would apply.                    

               Assume a tax-qualified Contract with a Contract Year that
        runs from July 1 to June 30, and that there are no
                withdrawals other than as described. The GAWA for the 2006
                 Contract Year (ending June 30) is 10. The RMDs for calendar
      years 2005 and 2006 are 14 and 16, respectively.

                If the Owner takes 7 in each of the two halves of calendar
                year 2005 and 8 in each of the two halves of calendar year
                2006, then at the time the withdrawal in the first half of
                calendar year 2006 is taken, the Owner will have withdrawn
                 15. Because the sum of the Owner's withdrawals for the 2006
                 Contract Year is less than the higher RMD for either of the
                 two calendar years occurring in that Contract Year, the GWB
   and GAWA would not be adversely recalculated.

            AN EXCEPTION TO THIS GENERAL RULE IS THAT WITH THE CALENDAR YEAR
             IN WHICH YOUR RMDS ARE TO BEGIN (GENERALLY, WHEN YOU REACH AGE 70
          1/2), HOWEVER, YOU MAY TAKE YOUR RMDS FOR THE CURRENT AND NEXT
           CALENDAR YEARS DURING THE SAME CONTRACT YEAR, AS NECESSARY (SEE
EXAMPLE BELOW).                                     

                  The following example illustrates this exception. It assumes
                   an individual Owner, born January 1, 1935, of a tax-qualified
                 Contract with a Contract Year that runs from July 1 to June
30.                                       

                   If the Owner delays taking his first RMD (the 2005 RMD) until
               March 30, 2006, he may still take the 2006 RMD before the
                   next Contract Year begins, June 30, 2006 without exposing the
               GWB and GAWA to the possibility of adverse recalculation.
                   However, if he takes his second RMD (the 2006 RMD) after June
30, 2006, he should wait until the next Contract Year begins
                   (that is after June 30, 2007) to take his third RMD (the 2007
               RMD). Because, except for the calendar year in which RMDs
                  begin, taking two RMDs in a single Contract Year could cause
               the GWB and GAWA to be adversely recalculated (if the two
                RMDs exceeded the applicable GAWA for that Contract Year).

              Examples that are relevant or specific to tax-qualified Contracts,
              illustrating this GMWB, in varying circumstances and with specific
             factual assumptions, are at the end of the prospectus in Appendix
    B, particularly examples 3, 4, and 6. PLEASE CONSULT THE
           REPRESENTATIVE WHO IS HELPING, OR WHO HELPED, YOU PURCHASE YOUR
              TAX-QUALIFIED CONTRACT, AND YOUR TAX ADVISER, TO BE SURE THAT THIS
  GMWB ULTIMATELY SUITS YOUR NEEDS RELATIVE TO YOUR RMD.

PREMIUMS.                                                     

                                           -------------------------------------
       PREMIUMS ARE ACCEPTED DURING      The GWB is recalculated, increasing
       THE FIRST SIX CONTRACT MONTHS     by the amount of the premium net of
 ONLY; HOWEVER, WITH EACH          any applicable premium taxes.
SUBSEQUENT PREMIUM PAYMENT ON                                 
  THE CONTRACT -                    The GAWA is also recalculated,
                    increasing by:

                                           *  5% of the premium net of any
                                              applicable premium taxes; OR
                                              *  5% of the increase in the GWB -
                                            IF THE MAXIMUM GWB IS hit.
                                           -------------------------------------

       We require prior approval for a subsequent premium payment that would
         result in your Contract having $1 million of premiums in the aggregate.
      We also reserve the right to refuse subsequent premium payments. THE
GWB CAN NEVER BE MORE THAN $5 MILLION.                        

STEP-UP. In the event Contract Value is greater than the GWB, this GMWB
      allows the GWB to be reset to the Contract Value (a "Step-Up"). UPON
         ELECTION OF A STEP-UP, THE GWMB CHARGE MAY BE INCREASED, SUBJECT TO THE
MAXIMUM CHARGES LISTED ABOVE.                                 

                                           -------------------------------------
  WITH A STEP-UP -                  The GWB equals Contract Value.

                                        The GAWA is recalculated, equaling
                     the greater of:

                                   * 5% of the new GWB; OR
                                          * The GAWA before the Step-Up.
                                           -------------------------------------

  Step-Ups occur automatically upon each of the first ten Contract
    Anniversaries from the endorsement's effective date. Thereafter, a
       Step-Up is allowed at any time upon your request, so long as there is
       at least one year between Step-Ups. THE GWB CAN NEVER BE MORE THAN $5
MILLION WITH A STEP-UP. A request for Step-Up is processed and
  effective on the date received in Good Order. Please consult the
      representative who helped you purchase your Contract to be sure if a
   Step-Up is right for you and about any increase in charges upon a
         Step-Up. Upon election of a Step-Up, the applicable GMWB charge will be
reflected in your confirmation.                               

     OWNER'S DEATH. The Contract's death benefit is not affected by this
         GMWB SO LONG AS CONTRACT VALUE IS GREATER THAN ZERO and the Contract is
        still in the accumulation phase. Upon your death (or the first Owner's
death with joint Owners), this GMWB terminates without value. 

        CONTRACT VALUE IS ZERO. With this GMWB, in the event Contract Value is
 zero, the GAWA is unchanged and payable SO LONG AS THE FOR LIFE
         GUARANTEE IS IN EFFECT. Otherwise, payments will be made while there is
      value to the GWB (until depleted). Payments are made on the periodic
basis you elect, but no less frequently than annually.        

                                           -------------------------------------
         AFTER EACH PAYMENT WHEN THE       The GWB is recalculated, equaling the
CONTRACT VALUE IS ZERO -          greater of:                 

                                              *  The GWB before the payment less
                                 the payment; OR
                    *  Zero.

               The GAWA:

                                          *  Is unchanged SO LONG AS THE
                                          FOR LIFE GUARANTEE IS IN
                                   EFFECT; OTHERWISE
                                            *  Is recalculated, equaling the
                                               lesser of the GAWA before, or
                                             the GWB after, the payment.
                                           -------------------------------------

If you die before all scheduled payments are made, then your  
     Beneficiary will receive the remainder. All other rights under your
   Contract cease, except for the right to change Beneficiaries. All
   optional endorsements terminate without value. And no other death
benefit is payable.                                           

       SPOUSAL CONTINUATION. In the event of the Owner's death (or the first
      Owner's death with joint Owners), the Beneficiary who is the Owner's
spouse may elect to:                                          

               *    Continue the  Contract  WITH this GMWB - so long as Contract
                    Value is greater than zero, and the Contract is still in the
                    accumulation  phase.  (The  date the  spousal  Beneficiary's
                    election to continue the Contract is in Good Order is called
the Continuation Date.)                 

                      *  Upon the Owner's death, the For Life Guarantee is void.

                      *  Only  the GWB is  payable  while  there  is value to it
(until depleted).             

                      *  Step-Ups will continue  automatically  or as permitted;
                otherwise, the above rules for Step-Ups apply.

                      *  Contract Anniversaries will continue to be based on the
Contract's Issue Date.        

               *    Continue   the   Contract   WITHOUT   this  GMWB   (GMWB  is
terminated).                            

               *    Add this GMWB to the  Contract on any  Contract  Anniversary
                    after the Continuation  Date,  subject to the  Beneficiary's
                    eligibility  -  WHETHER  OR  NOT  THE  SPOUSAL   BENEFICIARY
       TERMINATED THE GMWB IN CONTINUING THE CONTRACT.

       For more information about spousal continuation of a Contract, please
 see "Special Spousal Continuation Option" beginning on page 48.

TERMINATION. This GMWB terminates subject to a prorated GMWB Charge
       assessed for the period since the last quarterly or monthly statement
charge and all benefits cease on the earliest of:             

*    The Income Date;                             

               *    The date of  complete  withdrawal  of  Contract  Value (full
surrender of the Contract);             

               *    The date of the Owner's  death (or the first  Owner's  death
                    with  joint  Owners),  UNLESS  the  Beneficiary  who  is the
                    Owner's  spouse  elects to continue  the  Contract  with the
GMWB;                                   

               *    The Continuation Date if the spousal  Beneficiary  elects to
  continue the Contract without the GMWB; or

               *    The date all obligations under this GMWB are satisfied after
the Contract Value is zero.             

    ANNUITIZATION.  SEE "GUARANTEED MINIMUM WITHDRAWAL BENEFIT GENERAL
 CONSIDERATIONS" AND "GUARANTEED MINIMUM WITHDRAWAL BENEFIT IMPORTANT
 SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS" BEGINNING ON PAGE 27 FOR ADDITIONAL THINGS TO
  CONSIDER BEFORE ELECTING A GMWB; WHEN ELECTING TO ANNUITIZE YOUR
        CONTRACT AFTER HAVING PURCHASED A GMWB; OR WHEN THE LATEST INCOME DATE
      IS APPROACHING AND YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT ELECTING OR HAVE ELECTED A
GMWB.                                                         

      EFFECT OF GMWB ON TAX DEFERRAL. This GMWB may not be appropriate for
        Owners who have as a primary objective taking maximum advantage of the
   tax deferral that is available to them under an annuity contract.
        Please consult your tax and financial advisors before adding this GMWB
to a Contract.                                                

 JOINT 5% FOR LIFE GUARANTEED MINIMUM WITHDRAWAL BENEFIT WITH ANNUAL
       STEP-UP. The description of this GMWB is supplemented by the examples
   in Appendix B, particularly examples 5 and 6 for the Step-Ups and
example 8 for the For Life Guarantee.                         

 This GMWB is available for both non-qualified and tax-qualified
        Contracts. For non-qualified Contracts, there must be joint Owners and
   the joint Owners are required to be spouses (as defined under the
         Internal Revenue Code). Each joint Owner is considered to be a "Covered
Life."                                                        

    The Owners cannot be subsequently changed and new Owners cannot be
         added. Upon death of either joint Owner, the surviving joint Owner will
        be treated as the primary Beneficiary and all other Beneficiaries will
         be treated as contingent Beneficiaries. The For Life Guarantee will not
         apply to these contingent Beneficiaries, as they are not Covered Lives.

         This GMWB is available on a limited basis under non-qualified Contracts
     for certain kinds of legal entities, such as (i) custodial accounts
      where the spouses are the joint annuitants and (ii) trusts where the
       spouses are the sole beneficial owners, and the For Life Guarantee is
based on the Annuitant's life who dies last.                  

      Tax-qualified Contracts cannot be issued to joint Owners and require
      the Owner and Annuitant to be the same person. Under a tax-qualified
    Contract, the election of this GMWB requires the Owner and primary
      Beneficiary to be spouses (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code).
 The Owner and only the primary spousal Beneficiary named at the
        election of this GMWB under a tax-qualified Contract will also each be
considered a Covered Life, and these Covered Lives cannot be  
subsequently changed.                                         

        For tax-qualified Contracts, the Owner and primary spousal Beneficiary
       cannot be changed while both are living. If the Owner dies first, the
primary spousal Beneficiary will become the Owner upon Spousal
  Continuation and he or she may name a Beneficiary; however, that
        Beneficiary is not considered a Covered Life. Likewise, if the primary
       spousal Beneficiary dies first, the Owner may name a new Beneficiary;
     however, that Beneficiary is also not considered a Covered Life and
consequently the For Life Guarantee will not apply to the new 
Beneficiary.                                                  

For both non-qualified and tax-qualified Contracts, this GMWB 
         guarantees partial withdrawals during the Contract's accumulation phase
(i.e., before the Income Date) for the LONGER of:             

               *    The lifetime of the last  surviving  Covered Life if the For
Life Guarantee is in effect;            

                     The For Life Guarantee becomes effective on the
                          Contract Anniversary on or immediately following the
                   youngest Covered Life's 65th birthday. If the
                           youngest Covered Life is 65 years old or older on the
                     endorsement's effective date, then the For Life
                           Guarantee is effective when this GMWB is added to the
Contract.                 

                     So long as the For Life Guarantee is in effect,
                           withdrawals are guaranteed even in the event Contract
Value is reduced to zero. 

OR                                                

               *    Until  all   withdrawals   under  the  Contract   equal  the
                    Guaranteed  Withdrawal  Balance  (GWB),  without  regard  to
Contract Value.                         

                           The GWB is the guaranteed amount available for future
periodic withdrawals.     

     BECAUSE OF THE FOR LIFE GUARANTEE, YOUR WITHDRAWALS COULD AMOUNT TO
     MORE THAN THE GWB. BUT PLEASE NOTE: THE GUARANTEES OF THIS GMWB ARE
      SUBJECT TO THE ENDORSEMENT'S TERMS, CONDITIONS, AND LIMITATIONS THAT
ARE EXPLAINED IN THIS PROSPECTUS AND THE ENDORSEMENT.         

      Please consult the representative who is helping, or who helped, you
        purchase your Contract to be sure that this GMWB ultimately suits your
needs.                                                        

      This GMWB is available to Covered Lives 45 to 80 years old (proof of
        age is required and both Covered Lives must be within the eligible age
     range). If the age of any Covered Life is incorrectly stated at the
time of election of the GMWB, on the date the misstatement is 
   discovered, the Contract Value will be adjusted by the difference
        between the charges actually paid and the charges that would have been
         paid assuming the correct age. Future GMWB charges will be based on the
  correct age. If the age at election of either Covered Life falls
         outside the allowable age range, the GMWB will be null and void and all
GMWB charges will be refunded.                                

  This GMWB may be added to a Contract on the Issue Date or on any
    Contract Anniversary and it cannot be canceled except by a spousal
         Beneficiary who is not a Covered Life, who, upon the Owner's death, may
         elect to continue the Contract without the GMWB. To continue joint GMWB
    coverage upon the death of the Owner (or the death of either joint
     Owner of a non-qualified Contract), provided that the other Covered
     Life is still living, the Contract must be continued by election of
       Spousal Continuation. Upon continuation, the spouse becomes the Owner
and obtains all rights as the Owner.                          

      At least 30 calendar days' prior notice and proof of age is required
for Good Order to add this GMWB to a Contract on a Contract   
        Anniversary. THIS GMWB IS NOT AVAILABLE ON A CONTRACT THAT ALREADY HAS
       A GMWB (ONLY ONE GMWB PER CONTRACT). Availability of this GMWB may be
subject to further limitation.                                

There is a limit on withdrawals each Contract Year to keep the
     guarantees of this GMWB in full effect, which is the maximum of the
    Guaranteed Annual Withdrawal Amount (GAWA) or the required minimum
         distribution. Withdrawals exceeding the limit do not invalidate the For
Life Guarantee, but cause the GWB and GAWA to be recalculated.

       ELECTION. The GWB depends on when this GMWB is added to the Contract,
and the GAWA derives from the GWB.                            

                                          --------------------------------------
        WHEN THIS GMWB IS ADDED TO THE   The GWB equals initial premium net of
CONTRACT ON THE ISSUE DATE -     any applicable premium taxes.

                                  The GAWA equals 5% of the GWB.
                                          --------------------------------------

                                          --------------------------------------
 WHEN THIS GMWB IS ADDED TO THE   The GWB equals Contract Value.
CONTRACT ON ANY CONTRACT                                      
 ANNIVERSARY -                    The GAWA equals 5% of the GWB.
                                          --------------------------------------

         PLEASE NOTE:  AT THE TIME THE FOR LIFE GUARANTEE BECOMES EFFECTIVE, THE
GAWA IS RESET TO EQUAL 5% OF THE THEN CURRENT GWB.            

      Premium net of any applicable premium taxes is used to calculate the
       GWB when this GMWB is added to the Contract on the Issue Date. If you
  were to instead add this GMWB to your Contract post issue on any
        Contract Anniversary, the GWB is calculated based on Contract Value on
         the date the endorsement is added to the Contract. THE GWB CAN NEVER BE
       MORE THAN $5 MILLION (including upon Step-up), and the GWB is reduced
by each withdrawal.                                           

WITHDRAWALS. Withdrawals may cause both the GWB and GAWA to be
    recalculated, depending on whether or not the withdrawal, plus all
       prior withdrawals in the current Contract Year, is less than or equal
       to the GAWA, or for certain tax-qualified Contracts only, the RMD (if
      greater than the GAWA). The two tables below clarify what happens in
      either instance. RMD denotes the required minimum distribution under
     the Internal Revenue Code for certain tax-qualified Contracts only.
(There is no RMD for non-qualified Contracts.)                

       REQUIRED MINIMUM DISTRIBUTION CALCULATIONS. For certain tax-qualified
       Contracts, this GMWB allows withdrawals greater than GAWA to meet the
   Contract's RMD without compromising the endorsement's guarantees.
        Examples 3, 4 and 6 in Appendix B supplement this description. Because
    the intervals for the GAWA and RMDs are different, namely Contract
    Years versus calendar years, and because RMDs are subject to other
 conditions and limitations, if your Contract is a tax-qualified
   Contract, then please see "RMD NOTES" below for more information.

PRIOR WITHDRAWALS IN THE          greater of:                 
CURRENT CONTRACT YEAR, IS LESS                                
      THAN OR EQUAL TO THE GREATER OF      * The GWB before the withdrawal
THE GAWA OR RMD, AS APPLICABLE -       less the withdrawal; OR
                   * Zero.

               The GAWA:

                                        * Is unchanged WHILE THE FOR
                                            LIFE GUARANTEE IS IN EFFECT;
                         OTHERWISE
                                       * Is recalculated, equaling
                                      the lesser of the GAWA
                                         before the withdrawal, or
                                 the GWB after the
                           withdrawal.
                                           -------------------------------------

         The GAWA is NOT reduced if all withdrawals during any one Contract Year
      do not exceed the greater of the GAWA or RMD, as applicable. You may
        withdraw the greater of the GAWA or RMD, as applicable, all at once or
        throughout the Contract Year. Withdrawing less than the greater of the
        GAWA or RMD, as applicable, in a Contract Year does not entitle you to
      withdraw more than the greater of the GAWA or RMD, as applicable, in
        the next Contract Year. The amount you may withdraw each Contract Year
        and not cause the GWB and GAWA to be recalculated does not accumulate.

         Withdrawing more than the greater of the GAWA or RMD, as applicable, in
         a Contract Year causes the GWB and GAWA to be recalculated (see below).
     In recalculating the GWB, the GWB could be reduced by more than the
       withdrawal amount - even set equal to the Contract Value. The GAWA is
also potentially impacted.                                    

                                           -------------------------------------
         WHEN A WITHDRAWAL, PLUS ALL       The GWB is recalculated, equaling the
PRIOR WITHDRAWALS IN THE          lesser of:                  
CURRENT CONTRACT YEAR, EXCEEDS

                                    withdrawal, or zero.

                                        The GAWA is recalculated, equaling
                    the lesser of:

                                            * 5% of the Contract Value after
                                  the withdrawal; OR
                                          * The greater of 5% of the GWB
                                              after the withdrawal, or zero.
                                           -------------------------------------

Withdrawals under this GMWB are assumed to be the total amount
     withdrawn, including any charges and/or adjustments. Withdrawals in
       excess of free withdrawals may be subject to a withdrawal charge. Any
         withdrawals from Contract Value allocated to a Fixed Account option may
    be subject to an Excess Interest Adjustment. For more information,
please see "THE FIXED ACCOUNT" beginning on page 10.          

  Withdrawals under this GMWB are considered the same as any other
      partial withdrawals for the purposes of calculating any other values
 under the Contract and any other endorsements (for example, the
   Contract's death benefit). All withdrawals count toward the total
        amount withdrawn in a Contract Year, including systematic withdrawals,
RMDs for certain tax-qualified Contracts, withdrawals of asset
        allocation and advisory fees, and free withdrawals under the Contract.
   They are subject to the same restrictions and processing rules as
       described in the Contract. They are also treated the same for federal
    income tax purposes. For more information about your non-qualified
        Contract, please see "Non-Qualified Contracts - Withdrawals and Income
Payments" beginning on page 50. For more information about your
tax-qualified Contract, please see "Tax-Qualified Contracts -
Withdrawals and Income Payments" beginning on page 51.        

              ------------------------------------------------------------------
       RMD NOTES: Notice of an RMD is required at the time of your
            withdrawal request, and there is an administrative form for such
             notice. The administrative form allows for one time or systematic
            withdrawals. Eligible withdrawals that are specified as RMDs may
         only be taken based on the value of the Contract to which the
            endorsement applies, even where the Internal Revenue Code allows
       for the taking of RMDs for multiple contracts from a single
           contract. Initiating and monitoring for compliance with the RMD
 requirements is the sole responsibility of the Owner.

             Under the Internal Revenue Code, RMDs are calculated and taken on
             a calendar year basis.  But with this GMWB,  the GAWA is based on
             Contract  Years.  Because the intervals for the GAWA and RMDs are
             different,  the For Life  Guarantee  may be more  susceptible  to
             being invalidated.  With tax-qualified  Contracts,  if the sum of
             your total  partial  withdrawals  in a Contract  Year  exceed the
             greatest of the RMD for each of the two calendar years  occurring
             in that Contract Year and the GAWA for that Contract  Year,  then
             the GWB and GAWA could be  adversely  recalculated,  as described
             above.  (If your Contract Year is the same as the calendar  year,
             then the sum of your total partial  withdrawals should not exceed
             the greater of the RMD and the GAWA.)  Below is an example of how
this modified limit would apply.                    

               Assume a tax-qualified Contract with a Contract Year that
        runs from July 1 to June 30, and that there are no
                withdrawals other than as described. The GAWA for the 2006
                 Contract Year (ending June 30) is 10. The RMDs for calendar
      years 2005 and 2006 are 14 and 16, respectively.

                If the Owner takes 7 in each of the two halves of calendar
                year 2005 and 8 in each of the two halves of calendar year
                2006, then at the time the withdrawal in the first half of
                calendar year 2006 is taken, the Owner will have withdrawn
                 15. Because the sum of the Owner's withdrawals for the 2006
                 Contract Year is less than the higher RMD for either of the
                 two calendar years occurring in that Contract Year, the GWB
   and GAWA would not be adversely recalculated.

            AN EXCEPTION TO THIS GENERAL RULE IS THAT WITH THE CALENDAR YEAR
             IN WHICH YOUR RMDS ARE TO BEGIN (GENERALLY, WHEN YOU REACH AGE 70
          1/2), HOWEVER, YOU MAY TAKE YOUR RMDS FOR THE CURRENT AND NEXT
           CALENDAR YEARS DURING THE SAME CONTRACT YEAR, AS NECESSARY (SEE
EXAMPLE BELOW).                                     

                  The following example illustrates this exception. It assumes
                   an individual Owner, born January 1, 1935, of a tax-qualified
                 Contract with a Contract Year that runs from July 1 to June
30.                                       

                   If the Owner delays taking his first RMD (the 2005 RMD) until
               March 30, 2006, he may still take the 2006 RMD before the
                   next Contract Year begins, June 30, 2006 without exposing the
               GWB and GAWA to the possibility of adverse recalculation.
                   However, if he takes his second RMD (the 2006 RMD) after June
30, 2006, he should wait until the next Contract Year begins
                   (that is after June 30, 2007) to take his third RMD (the 2007
               RMD). Because, except for the calendar year in which RMDs
                  begin, taking two RMDs in a single Contract Year could cause
               the GWB and GAWA to be adversely recalculated (if the two
                RMDs exceeded the applicable GAWA for that Contract Year).

              Examples that are relevant or specific to tax-qualified Contracts,
              illustrating this GMWB, in varying circumstances and with specific
             factual assumptions, are at the end of the prospectus in Appendix
    B, particularly examples 3, 4, and 6. PLEASE CONSULT THE
           REPRESENTATIVE WHO IS HELPING, OR WHO HELPED, YOU PURCHASE YOUR
              TAX-QUALIFIED CONTRACT, AND YOUR TAX ADVISER, TO BE SURE THAT THIS
  GMWB ULTIMATELY SUITS YOUR NEEDS RELATIVE TO YOUR RMD.

PREMIUMS.                                                     

                                         ---------------------------------------
        PREMIUMS ARE ACCEPTED DURING    The GWB is recalculated, increasing by
      THE FIRST SIX CONTRACT MONTHS   the amount of the premium net of any
ONLY; HOWEVER, WITH EACH        applicable premium taxes.     
SUBSEQUENT PREMIUM PAYMENT ON                                 
 THE CONTRACT -                  The  GAWA is also recalculated,
                increasing by:

                                          * 5% of the premium net of any
                                            applicable premium taxes; OR
                                       * 5% of the increase in the
                                           GWB - IF THE MAXIMUM GWB IS
                    HIT.
                                         ---------------------------------------

       We require prior approval for a subsequent premium payment that would
         result in your Contract having $1 million of premiums in the aggregate.
      We also reserve the right to refuse subsequent premium payments. THE
GWB CAN NEVER BE MORE THAN $5 MILLION.                        

STEP-UP. In the event Contract Value is greater than the GWB, this GMWB
      allows the GWB to be reset to the Contract Value (a "Step-Up"). UPON
         ELECTION OF A STEP-UP, THE GWMB CHARGE MAY BE INCREASED, SUBJECT TO THE
MAXIMUM CHARGES LISTED ABOVE.                                 

                                          --------------------------------------
  WITH A STEP-UP -                The GWB equals Contract Value.

                                          The GAWA is recalculated, equaling the
               greater of:

                                   * 5% of the new GWB; OR
                                          * The GAWA before the Step-Up.
                                          --------------------------------------

  Step-Ups occur automatically upon each of the first ten Contract
    Anniversaries from the endorsement's effective date. Thereafter, a
       Step-Up is allowed at any time upon your request, so long as there is
       at least one year between Step-Ups. THE GWB CAN NEVER BE MORE THAN $5
MILLION WITH A STEP-UP. A request for Step-Up is processed and
  effective on the date received in Good Order. Please consult the
      representative who helped you purchase your Contract to be sure if a
   Step-Up is right for you and about any increase in charges upon a
         Step-Up. Upon election of a Step-Up, the applicable GMWB charge will be
reflected in your confirmation.                               

     OWNER'S DEATH. The Contract's death benefit is not affected by this
         GMWB SO LONG AS CONTRACT VALUE IS GREATER THAN ZERO and the Contract is
      still in the accumulation phase. Upon the death of the Owner (or the
    death of either joint Owner of a non-qualified Contract) while the
  Contract is still in force and before the Income Date, this GMWB
terminates without value unless continued by the spouse.      

        CONTRACT VALUE IS ZERO. With this GMWB, in the event Contract Value is
 zero, the GAWA is unchanged and payable SO LONG AS THE FOR LIFE
         GUARANTEE IS IN EFFECT. Otherwise, payments will be made while there is
      value to the GWB (until depleted). Payments are made on the periodic
basis you elect, but no less frequently than annually.        

                                           -------------------------------------
         AFTER EACH PAYMENT WHEN THE       The GWB is recalculated, equaling the
CONTRACT VALUE IS ZERO -          greater of:                 

                                             * The GWB before the payment less
                               the payment; OR
                   * Zero.

               The GAWA:

                                             * Is unchanged SO LONG AS THE FOR
                                            LIFE GUARANTEE IS IN EFFECT;
                         OTHERWISE
                                           * Is recalculated, equaling the
                                             lesser of the GAWA before, or
                                           the GWB after, the payment.
                                           -------------------------------------

If you die before all scheduled payments are made, then your  
     Beneficiary will receive the remainder. All other rights under your
   Contract cease, except for the right to change Beneficiaries. All
   optional endorsements terminate without value. And no other death
benefit is payable.                                           

    SPOUSAL CONTINUATION. In the event of the Owner's (or either joint
 Owner's) death, the surviving spousal beneficiary may elect to:

               *    Continue  the  Contract  WITH  this  GMWB - so  long  as the
                    Contract  Value is greater  than zero,  and the  Contract is
                    still in the  accumulation  phase.  (The  date  the  spousal
                    Beneficiary's  election to continue  the Contract is in Good
Order is called the Continuation Date.) 

                    *    If the  surviving  spouse is a Covered Life and the For
                         Life Guarantee is already in effect,  then the For Life
                         Guarantee   remains   effective   on  and   after   the
                         Continuation  Date.  If the For Life  Guarantee  is not
                         already in effect and the surviving spouse is a Covered
                         Life, the For Life Guarantee  becomes  effective on the
                         Contract  Anniversary on or  immediately  following the
                         youngest original Covered Life's 65th birthday, and the
                         above  rules  for the For  Life  Guarantee  apply.  The
                         effective date of the For Life Guarantee will be set on
        the effective date of the endorsement.

                    If the surviving spouse is not a Covered Life, the
                   For Life Guarantee is null and void. However, the
                       surviving spouse will be entitled to make withdrawals
until the GWB is exhausted.   

                    *    For  a  surviving   spouse  who  is  a  Covered   Life,
                         continuing  the Contract with this GMWB is necessary to
                         be able to fully  realize  the  benefit of the For Life
                         Guarantee.  The For Life  Guarantee  is not a  separate
                         guarantee  and only applies if the related GMWB has not
terminated.                   

                    *    Step-Ups will continue automatically or as permitted in
               accordance with the above rules for Step-Ups.

                    *    Contract Anniversaries will continue to be based on the
 original Contract's Issue Date.

                    *    A new joint  Owner may not be added in a  non-qualified
                        Contract if a surviving spouse continues the Contract.

               *    Continue the Contract WITHOUT this GMWB (GMWB is terminated)
                    if the surviving  spouse is not a Covered Life.  Thereafter,
                    no GMWB charge will be assessed.  If the surviving spouse is
                    a Covered  Life,  the Contract  cannot be continued  without
this GMWB.                              

               *    Add another GMWB to the Contract on any Contract Anniversary
                    after  the  Continuation   Date,   subject  to  the  spousal
                    Beneficiary's  eligibility,  and provided that this GMWB was
terminated on the Continuation Date.    

       For more information about spousal continuation of a Contract, please
 see "Special Spousal Continuation Option" beginning on page 48.

TERMINATION. This GMWB terminates subject to a prorated GMWB Charge
       assessed for the period since the last quarterly or monthly statement
charge and all benefits cease on the earliest of:             

*    The Income Date;                             

               *    The date of  complete  withdrawal  of  Contract  Value (full
surrender of the Contract);             

               *    The date of death of the  Owner  (or  either  joint  Owner),
                    UNLESS the  Beneficiary  who is the Owner's spouse elects to
                    continue the Contract with the GMWB (continuing the Contract
                    with this GMWB is necessary to be able to fully  realize the
                    benefit of the For Life Guarantee if the surviving spouse is
a Covered Life);                        

               *    The Continuation Date if the spousal Beneficiary, who is not
                    a Covered Life,  elects to continue the Contract without the
GMWB; or                                

               *    The date all obligations under this GMWB are satisfied after
the Contract Value is zero.

GMWB.                                                         

      EFFECT OF GMWB ON TAX DEFERRAL. This GMWB may not be appropriate for
        Owners who have as a primary objective taking maximum advantage of the
   tax deferral that is available to them under an annuity contract.
        Please consult your tax and financial advisors before adding this GMWB
to a Contract.                                                

SYSTEMATIC WITHDRAWAL PROGRAM. You can arrange to have money  
        automatically sent to you periodically while your Contract is still in
        the accumulation phase. You may withdraw a specified dollar amount (of
        at least $50 per withdrawal), a specified percentage or earnings. Your
   withdrawals may be on a monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual
      basis. If you have arranged for systematic withdrawals, schedule any
        planned Step-Up under a GMWB to occur prior to the withdrawal. Example
        6 in Appendix B illustrates the consequences of a withdrawal preceding
      a Step-Up. There is no charge for the Systematic Withdrawal Program;
       however, you will have to pay taxes on the money you receive. You may
also be subject to a withdrawal charge and an Excess Interest 
Adjustment.                                                   

       SUSPENSION OF WITHDRAWALS OR TRANSFERS. We may be required to suspend
     or delay withdrawals or transfers to or from an Investment Division
when:                                                         

               *    the New York Stock  Exchange is closed (other than customary
weekend and holiday closings);          

               *    under  applicable  SEC rules,  trading on the New York Stock
Exchange is restricted;                 

               *    under  applicable SEC rules, an emergency  exists so that it
                    is not reasonably practicable to dispose of securities in an
                    Investment Division or determine the value of its assets; or

               *    the SEC, by order, may permit for the protection of Contract
Owners.                                 

 We have reserved the right to defer payment for a withdrawal or
    transfer from the Fixed Account for up to six months or the period
permitted by law.                                             

INCOME PAYMENTS (THE INCOME PHASE)

   The income phase of your Contract occurs when you begin receiving
   regular income payments from us. The Income Date is the day those
    payments begin. Once income payments begin, the Contract cannot be
        returned to the accumulation phase. You can choose the Income Date and
     an income option. All of the Contract Value must be annuitized. The
income options are described below.                           

         If you do not choose an income option, we will assume that you selected
       option 3, which provides a life annuity with 120 months of guaranteed
payments.                                                     

        You can change the Income Date or income option at least 7 days before
        the Income Date, but changes to the Income Date may only be to a later
      date. You must give us written notice at least seven days before the
         scheduled Income Date. Income payments must begin by your 90th birthday
        under a non-qualified Contract, or by such earlier date as required by
    the applicable qualified plan, law or regulation, unless otherwise
    approved by the Company. Under a traditional Individual Retirement
         Annuity, required minimum distributions must begin in the calendar year
        in which you attain age 70 1/2 (or such other age as required by law).
      Distributions under qualified plans and Tax-Sheltered Annuities must
        begin by the later of the calendar year in which you attain age 70 1/2
       or the calendar year in which you retire. You do not necessarily have
to annuitize your Contract to meet the minimum distribution   
        requirements for Individual Retirement Annuities, qualified plans, and
        Tax-Sheltered Annuities. Distributions from Roth IRAs are not required
prior to your death.                                          

 At the Income Date, you can choose to receive fixed payments or
         variable payments based on the Investment Divisions. Unless you tell us
         otherwise, your income payments will be based on the fixed and variable
options that were in place on the Income Date.                

 You can choose to have income payments made monthly, quarterly,
         semi-annually or annually. Or you can choose a single lump sum payment.
         If you have less than $5,000 to apply toward an income option and state
        law permits, we may provide your payment in a single lump sum, part of
        which may be taxable as Federal Income. Likewise, if your first income
      payment would be less than $50 and state law permits, we may set the
        frequency of payments so that the first payment would be at least $50.

     VARIABLE INCOME PAYMENTS. If you choose to have any portion of your
         income payments based upon one or more Investment Divisions, the dollar
       amount of your initial annuity payment will depend primarily upon the
following:                                                    

               *    the  amount  of your  Contract  Value  you  allocate  to the
  Investment Division(s) on the Income Date;

               *    the amount of any  applicable  premium  taxes or  withdrawal
                    charges and any Excess  Interest  Adjustment  deducted  from
your Contract Value on the Income Date; 

*    which income option you select; and          

               *    the   investment   factors  listed  in  your  Contract  that
                    translate the amount of your Contract Value (as adjusted for
                    applicable  charges,  frequency of payment and  commencement
                    date) into initial  payment amounts that are measured by the
                    number of Annuity Units of the  Investment  Division(s)  you
select credited to your Contract.       

     The investment factors in your Contract are calculated based upon a
       variety of factors, including an assumed investment rate of 3%. State
variations may apply.                                         

         If the actual net investment rate experienced by an Investment Division
         exceeds the assumed net investment rate, variable annuity payments will
      increase over time. Conversely, if the actual net investment rate is
      less than the assumed net investment rate, variable annuity payments
       will decrease over time. If the actual net investment rate equals the
        assumed net investment rate, the variable annuity payments will remain
constant.                                                     

       If assumed net investment rate is a lower percentage, for example, 3%
         versus 4.5% under a particular Annuity Option, the initial payment will
         be smaller if the 3% assumed net investment rate applies instead of the
      4.5% assumed net investment rate, but, all other things being equal,
 the subsequent 3% assumed net investment rate payments have the
   potential for increasing in amount by a larger percentage and for
decreasing in amount by a smaller percentage.                 

       We calculate the dollar amount of subsequent income payments that you
    receive based upon the performance of the Investment Divisions you
  select. If that performance (measured by changes in the value of
      Annuity Units) exceeds the assumed investment rate, then your income
      payments will increase; if that performance is less than the assumed
   investment rate, then your income payments will decrease. Neither
         expenses actually incurred (other than taxes on investment return), nor
         mortality actually experienced, will adversely affect the dollar amount
of subsequent income payments.                                

        INCOME OPTIONS. The Annuitant is the person whose life we look to when
    we make income payments (each description assumes that you are the
         Owner and Annuitant). The following income options may not be available
in all states.                                                

      OPTION 1 - Life Income. This income option provides monthly payments
for your life.                                                

    OPTION 2 - Joint and Survivor. This income option provides monthly
         payments for your life and for the life of another person (usually your
spouse) selected by you.                                      

         OPTION 3 - Life Annuity With at Least 120 or 240 Monthly Payments. This
       income option provides monthly payments for the Annuitant's life, but
        with payments continuing to the Beneficiary for the remainder of 10 or
      20 years (as you select) if the Annuitant dies before the end of the
  selected period. If the Beneficiary does not want to receive the
         remaining scheduled payments, a single lump sum may be requested, which
         will be equal to the present value of the remaining payments (as of the
     date of calculation) discounted at an interest rate that will be no
 more than 1% higher than the rate used to calculate the initial
payment.                                                      

       OPTION 4 - Income for a Specified Period. This income option provides
monthly payments for any number of years from 5 to 30. If the 
        Beneficiary does not want to receive the remaining scheduled payments,
        a single lump sum may be requested, which will be equal to the present
 value of the remaining payments (as of the date of calculation)
         discounted at an interest rate that will be no more than 1% higher than
the rate used to calculate the initial payment.               

  ADDITIONAL OPTIONS - We may make other income options available.

      No withdrawals are permitted during the income phase under an income
option that is life contingent.                               

 DEATH BENEFIT

         The Contract has a death benefit, namely the basic death benefit, which
     is payable during the accumulation phase. Instead you may choose an
        optional death benefit for an additional charge, availability of which
      may vary by state. For more information about the availability of an
         optional death benefit in your state, please see the application, check
         with the registered representative helping you to purchase the Contract
         or contact us at our Annuity Service Center. Our contact information is
       on the first page of this prospectus. The optional death benefits are
       only available upon application, and once chosen, cannot be canceled.
     The effects of any GMWB on the amount payable to your beneficiaries
         upon your death should be considered in selecting the death benefits in
combination with a GMWB.                                      

The death benefit paid to your Beneficiary upon your death is 
         calculated as of the date we receive all required documentation in Good
       Order which includes, but is not limited to, due proof of death and a
   completed claim form from the Beneficiary of record (if there are
     multiple beneficiaries, we will calculate the death benefit when we
      receive this documentation from the first Beneficiary). Payment will
         include any required interest from the date of death. The death benefit
      paid will be the basic death benefit unless you have selected one of
        the other death benefit endorsements. If you have a guaranteed minimum
         death benefit, the amount by which the guaranteed minimum death benefit
        exceeds the account value will be put into your account as of the date
      we receive all required documentation from the Beneficiary of record
        and will be allocated among the Investment Divisions and Fixed Account
   according to the current allocation instructions on file for your
         account as of that date. Each Beneficiary will receive their portion of
        the remaining value, subject to market fluctuations, when their option
    election form is received at our Home Office in Lansing, Michigan.

        BASIC DEATH BENEFIT. If you die before moving to the income phase, the
 person you have chosen as your Beneficiary will receive a death
         benefit. If you have a joint Owner, the death benefit will be paid when
       the first joint Owner dies. The surviving joint Owner will be treated
         as the Beneficiary. Any other Beneficiary designated will be treated as
       a contingent Beneficiary. Only a spousal Beneficiary has the right to
continue the Contract in force upon your death.               

         The death benefit equals the greater of your Contract Value on the date
we receive all required documentation from your Beneficiary.  

         OPTIONAL DEATH BENEFITS. Optional death benefits are available that are
designed to protect your Contract Value from potentially poor 
        investment performance and the impact that poor investment performance
       could have on the amount of the basic death benefit. Because there is
        an additional annual charge for each of these optional death benefits,
       and because you cannot change your selection, please be sure that you
   have read about and understand the Contract's basic death benefit
         before selecting an optional death benefit. Optional death benefits are
         available if you are 79 years of age or younger on the Contract's Issue
         Date. However, the older you are when your Contract is issued, the less
       advantageous it would be for you to select an optional death benefit.
       These optional death benefits are subject to our administrative rules
       to assure appropriate use, which administrative rules may be changed,
as necessary.                                                 

     DEPENDING ON WHEN AND IN WHAT STATE YOU APPLY FOR THE CONTRACT: THE
       AVAILABILITY OF AN OPTIONAL DEATH BENEFIT MAY BE DIFFERENT AND HOW AN
   OPTIONAL DEATH BENEFIT IS CALCULATED VARIES - ALL AS NOTED BELOW.

   For purposes of these optional death benefits, "Net Premiums" are
       defined as your premium payments net of premium taxes, reduced by any
       withdrawals (including applicable charges and deductions) at the time
      of the withdrawal in the same proportion that the Contract Value was
     reduced on the date of the withdrawal. Accordingly, if a withdrawal
     were to reduce the Contract Value by 50%, for example, Net Premiums
        would also be reduced by 50%. Similarly, with the "Highest Anniversary
        Value" component, the adjustment to your Contract Value for applicable
         charges will have occurred proportionally at the time of the deductions

         FOLLOWING ARE THE CALCULATIONS FOR THE OPTIONAL DEATH
                 BENEFITS: RETURN OF PREMIUM DEATH BENEFIT, changes your basic
death benefit to the greatest of:           

                    (a)  your Contract Value on the date we receive all required
         documentation from your Beneficiary; or

                    (b)  total Net Premiums since your Contract was issued.  All
                         withdrawals will reduce this portion of the calculation
                         in the same  proportion  that the  Contract  Value  was
        reduced on the date of the withdrawal.

               HIGHEST ANNIVERSARY VALUE DEATH BENEFIT, changes your basic
death benefit to the greatest of:           

                    (a)  your  Contract  Value as of the end of the business day
                         on which we receive  all  required  documentation  from
your Beneficiary; or          

                  (b)  total Net Premiums since your Contract was issued; or

                    (c)  your   greatest   Contract   Value   on  any   Contract
                         Anniversary  prior to your  81st  birthday,  MINUS  any
                         withdrawals   (including  any   applicable   withdrawal
                         charges and  adjustments),  PLUS any premiums paid (net
                         of any  applicable  premium  taxes)  subsequent to that
Contract Anniversary.         

 PAYOUT OPTIONS.  The basic death benefit and the optional death
 benefits can be paid under one of the following payout options:

*    single lump sum payment; or                  

               *    payment of entire death  benefit  within 5 years of the date
of death; or                            

               *    payment of the entire death  benefit  under an income option
                    over  the  Beneficiary's   lifetime  or  for  a  period  not
                    extending  beyond  the  Beneficiary's  life  expectancy;  or
                    payment  of a portion of the death  benefit  under an income
                    option over the  Beneficiary's  lifetime or for a period not
                    extending beyond the Beneficiary's life expectancy, with the
                    balance of the death benefit payable to the Beneficiary. Any
                    portion of the death  benefit  not  applied  under an income
                    option within one year of the Owner's death,  however,  must
                   be paid within five years of the date of the Owner's death.

       Under these payout options, the Beneficiary may also elect to receive
      additional lump sums at any time. The receipt of any additional lump
 sums will reduce the future income payments to the Beneficiary.

         Unless the Beneficiary chooses to receive the entire death benefit in a
   single sum, the Beneficiary must elect a payout option within the
     60-day period beginning with the date we receive proof of death and
  payments must begin within one year of the date of death. If the
      Beneficiary chooses to receive some or all of the death benefit in a
        single sum and all the necessary requirements are met, we will pay the
      death benefit within seven days. If your Beneficiary is your spouse,
    he/she may elect to continue the Contract, at the current Contract
       Value, in his/her own name. For more information, please see "Special
Spousal Continuation Option" beginning on page 48.            

PRE-SELECTED PAYOUT OPTIONS. As Owner, you may also make a    
    predetermined selection of the death benefit payout option if your
   death occurs before the Income Date. However, at the time of your
        death, we may modify the death benefit option if the death benefit you
  selected exceeds the life expectancy of the Beneficiary. If this
       Pre-selected Death Benefit Option Election is in force at the time of
        your death, the payment of the death benefit may not be postponed, nor
  can the Contract be continued under any other provisions of this
    Contract. This restriction applies even if the Beneficiary is your
       spouse, unless such restriction is prohibited by the Internal Revenue
         Code. If the Beneficiary does not submit the required documentation for
     the death benefit to us within one year of your death, however, the
        death benefit must be paid, in a single lump sum, within five years of
        your death. The Pre-selected Death Benefit Option may not be available
in your state.                                                

SPECIAL SPOUSAL CONTINUATION OPTION. If your spouse is the Beneficiary
       and elects to continue the Contract in his or her own name after your
      death, pursuant to the Special Spousal Continuation Option, no death
  benefit will be paid at that time. Moreover, if the Contract has
         another optional death benefit (instead of the basic death benefit), we
         will contribute to the Contract a Continuation Adjustment, which is the
        amount by which the death benefit that would have been payable exceeds
       the Contract Value. We calculate this amount using the Contract Value
     and death benefit as of the date we receive completed forms and due
proof of death from the Beneficiary of record and the spousal 
Beneficiary's written request to continue the Contract (the   
        "Continuation Date"). We will add this amount to the Contract based on
        the current allocation instructions at the time of your death, subject
 to any minimum allocation restrictions, unless we receive other
allocation instructions from your spouse. The Special Spousal 
  Continuation Option may not be available in your state. See your
     financial advisor for information regarding the availability of the
Special Spousal Continuation Option.                          

     If your spouse continues the Contract in his/her own name under the
     Special Spousal Continuation Option, the new Contract Value will be
       considered the initial premium for purposes of determining any future
      death benefit under the Contract. The age of the surviving spouse at
        the time of the continuation of the Contract will be used to determine
         all benefits under the Contract prospectively, so the death benefit may
be at a different level.                                      

     If your spouse elects to continue the Contract, your spouse, as new
    Owner, cannot terminate most of the optional benefits you elected.
     However, a GMWB will terminate upon your death (and no further GMWB
   charges will be deducted), unless your spouse is eligible for the
        benefit and elects to continue it with the Contract. The Contract, and
     its optional benefits, remains the same, except as described above.
       There is no charge for the Spousal Continuation Option; however, your
    spouse will also be subject to the same fees, charges and expenses
under the Contract as you were.                               

        The Special Spousal Continuation Option is available to elect one time
      on the Contract. However, if you have elected the Pre-Selected Death
   Benefit Option the Contract cannot be continued under the Special
      Spousal Continuation Option, unless preventing continuation would be
         prohibited by the Internal Revenue Code. The Pre-Selected Death Benefit
Option may not be available in your state.                    

     DEATH OF OWNER ON OR AFTER THE INCOME DATE. If you or a joint Owner
  dies, and is not the Annuitant, on or after the Income Date, any
     remaining payments under the income option elected will continue at
       least as rapidly as under the method of distribution in effect at the
      date of death. If you die, the Beneficiary becomes the Owner. If the
  joint Owner dies, the surviving joint Owner, if any, will be the
        designated Beneficiary. Any other Beneficiary designation on record at
  the time of death will be treated as a contingent Beneficiary. A
      contingent Beneficiary is entitled to receive payment only after the
Beneficiary dies.                                             

         DEATH OF ANNUITANT. If the Annuitant is not an Owner or joint Owner and
       dies before the Income Date, you can name a new Annuitant, subject to
      our underwriting rules. If you do not name a new Annuitant within 30
    days of the death of the Annuitant, you will become the Annuitant.
However, if the Owner is a non-natural person (for example, a 
      corporation), then the death of the Annuitant will be treated as the
death of the Owner, and a new Annuitant may not be named.     

  If the Annuitant dies on or after the Income Date, any remaining
       guaranteed payment will be paid to the Beneficiary as provided for in
      the income option selected. Any remaining guaranteed payment will be
        paid at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution in effect
at the Annuitant's death.

         THE INITIAL OFFERING OF THIS CONTRACT WILL BE LIMITED TO THE INDIVIDUAL
       RETIREMENT ANNUITY (IRA) AND TAX-QUALIFIED PLAN MARKET. ALTHOUGH THIS
         PROSPECTUS CONTAINS REFERENCES TO NON-QUALIFIED CONTRACTS, APPLICATIONS
  FOR NON-QUALIFIED CONTRACTS ARE NOT CURRENTLY BEING SOLICITED OR
        ACCEPTED. THIS PROSPECTUS WILL BE REVISED SHOULD JACKSON NATIONAL LIFE
  INSURANCE COMPANY LATER OFFER THIS CONTRACT IN THE NON-QUALIFIED
MARKET.

      THE FOLLOWING IS ONLY GENERAL INFORMATION AND IS NOT INTENDED AS TAX
         ADVICE TO ANY INDIVIDUAL. ADDITIONAL TAX INFORMATION IS INCLUDED IN THE
      SAI. YOU SHOULD CONSULT YOUR OWN TAX ADVISER AS TO HOW THESE GENERAL
RULES WILL APPLY TO YOU IF YOU PURCHASE A CONTRACT.           
CONTRACT OWNER TAXATION                                       

 TAX-QUALIFIED AND NON-QUALIFIED CONTRACTS. If you purchase your
  Contract as a part of a tax-qualified plan such as an Individual
        Retirement Annuity (IRA), Tax-Sheltered Annuity (sometimes referred to
       as a 403(b) Contract), or pension or profit-sharing plan (including a
        401(k) Plan or H.R. 10 Plan) your Contract will be what is referred to
 as a tax-qualified contract. Tax deferral under a tax-qualified
       contract arises under the specific provisions of the Internal Revenue
  Code (Code) governing the tax-qualified plan, so a tax-qualified
       contract should be purchased only for the features and benefits other
      than tax deferral that are available under a tax-qualified contract,
       and not for the purpose of obtaining tax deferral. You should consult
        your own adviser regarding these features and benefits of the Contract
prior to purchasing a tax-qualified contract.                 

     If you do not purchase your Contract as a part of any tax-qualified
       pension plan, specially sponsored program or an individual retirement
       annuity, your Contract will be what is referred to as a non-qualified
contract.                                                     

        The amount of your tax liability on the earnings under and the amounts
       received from either a tax-qualified or a non-qualified Contract will
      vary depending on the specific tax rules applicable to your Contract
and your particular circumstances.                            

         NON-QUALIFIED CONTRACTS - GENERAL TAXATION. Increases in the value of a
   non-qualified Contract attributable to undistributed earnings are
      generally not taxable to the Contract Owner or the Annuitant until a
      distribution (either a withdrawal or an income payment) is made from
    the Contract. This tax deferral is generally not available under a
non-qualified Contract owned by a non-natural person (e.g., a 
      corporation or certain other entities other than a trust holding the
Contract as an agent for a natural person). Loans based on a  
non-qualified Contract are treated as distributions.          

     NON-QUALIFIED CONTRACTS - AGGREGATION OF CONTRACTS. For purposes of
      determining the taxability of a distribution, the Code provides that
   all non-qualified contracts issued by us (or an affiliate) to you
   during any calendar year must be treated as one annuity contract.
  Additional rules may be promulgated under this Code provision to
 prevent avoidance of its effect through the ownership of serial
contracts or otherwise.                                       

NON-QUALIFIED CONTRACTS - WITHDRAWALS AND INCOME PAYMENTS. Any
        withdrawal from a non-qualified Contract is taxable as ordinary income
     to the extent it does not exceed the accumulated earnings under the
        Contract. A part of each income payment under a non-qualified Contract
         is generally treated as a non-taxable return of premium. The balance of
       each income payment is taxable as ordinary income. The amounts of the
        taxable and non-taxable portions of each income payment are determined
         based on the amount of the investment in the Contract and the length of
       the period over which income payments are to be made. Income payments
        received after all of your investment in the Contract is recovered are
         fully taxable as ordinary income. Additional information is provided in
the SAI.                                                      

         The Code also imposes a 10% penalty on certain taxable amounts received
        under a non-qualified Contract. This penalty tax will not apply to any
amounts:                                                      

  *    paid on or after the date you reach age 59 1/2;

*    paid to your Beneficiary after you die;      

               *    paid if you become totally disabled (as that term is defined
in the Code);                           

               *    paid in a series of  substantially  equal periodic  payments
                    made  annually (or more  frequently)  for your life (or life
                    expectancy)  or for a period not  exceeding  the joint lives
                 (or joint life expectancies) of you and your Beneficiary;

*    paid under an immediate annuity; or          

          *    which come from premiums made prior to August 14, 1982.

  NON-QUALIFIED CONTRACTS - REQUIRED DISTRIBUTIONS. In order to be
     treated as an annuity contract for federal income tax purposes, the
        Code requires any non-qualified Contract issued after January 18, 1985
       to provide that (a) if an owner dies on or after the annuity starting
         date but prior to the time the entire interest in the contract has been
         distributed, the remaining portion of such interest will be distributed
       at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution being used as
      of the date of that owner's death; and (b) if an owner dies prior to
        the annuity starting date, the entire interest in the contract must be
    distributed within five years after the date of the owner's death.

  The requirements of (b) above can be considered satisfied if any
        portion of the Owner's interest which is payable to or for the benefit
    of a "designated beneficiary" is distributed over the life of such
       beneficiary or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy
     of that beneficiary and such distributions begin within one year of
         that Owner's death. The Owner's "designated beneficiary," who must be a
         natural person, is the person designated by such Owner as a Beneficiary
  and to whom ownership of the Contract passes by reason of death.
   However, if the Owner's "designated beneficiary" is the surviving
       spouse of the Owner, the contract may be continued with the surviving
spouse as the new Owner.                                      

TAX-QUALIFIED CONTRACTS - WITHDRAWALS AND INCOME PAYMENTS. The Code
 imposes limits on loans, withdrawals, and income payments under
 tax-qualified Contracts. The Code also imposes required minimum
        distributions for tax-qualified Contracts and a 10% penalty on certain
      taxable amounts received prematurely under a tax-qualified Contract.
         These limits, required minimum distributions, tax penalties and the tax
      computation rules are summarized in the SAI. Any withdrawals under a
      tax-qualified Contract will be taxable except to the extent they are
allocable to an investment in the Contract (any after-tax     
         contributions). In most cases, there will be little or no investment in
      the Contract for a tax-qualified Contract because contributions will
have been made on a pre-tax or tax-deductible basis.          

       WITHDRAWALS - TAX-SHELTERED ANNUITIES. The Code limits the withdrawal
  of amounts attributable to purchase payments made under a salary
        reduction agreement from Tax-Sheltered Annuities. Withdrawals can only
be made when an Owner:                                        

*    reaches age 59 1/2;                          

*    leaves his/her job;                          

*    dies;                                        

             *    becomes disabled (as that term is defined in the Code); or

               *    experiences hardship.  However, in the case of hardship, the
                 Owner can only withdraw the premium and not any earnings.

      WITHDRAWALS - ROTH IRAS. Subject to certain limitations, individuals
        may also purchase a type of non-deductible IRA annuity known as a Roth
  IRA annuity. Qualified distributions from Roth IRA annuities are
     entirely federal income tax free. A qualified distribution requires
     that the individual has held the Roth IRA annuity for at least five
        years and, in addition, that the distribution is made either after the
        individual reaches age 59 1/2, on account of the individual's death or
    disability, or as a qualified first-time home purchase, subject to
       $10,000 lifetime maximum, for the individual, or for a spouse, child,
grandchild or ancestor.                                       

      CONSTRUCTIVE WITHDRAWALS - INVESTMENT ADVISER FEES. Withdrawals from
         non-qualified Contracts for the payment of investment adviser fees will
       be considered taxable distributions from the Contract. In a series of
        Private Letter Rulings, however, the Internal Revenue Service has held
  that the payment of investment adviser fees from a tax-qualified
         Contract need not be considered a distribution for income tax purposes.
Under the facts in these Rulings:                             

               *    there was a written agreement  providing for payments of the
fees solely from the annuity Contract,  

        *    the Contract Owner had no liability for the fees, and

               *    the fees were paid solely  from the annuity  Contract to the
adviser.                                

EXTENSION OF LATEST INCOME DATE. If you do not annuitize your 
   non-qualified Contract on or before the latest Income Date, it is
         possible that the IRS could challenge the status of your Contract as an
         annuity Contract for tax purposes. The result of such a challenge could
    be that you would be viewed as either constructively receiving the
    increase in the Contract Value each year from the inception of the
        Contract or the entire increase in the Contract Value would be taxable
       in the year you attain age 90. In either situation, you could realize
         taxable income even if the Contract proceeds are not distributed to you
     at that time. Accordingly, before purchasing a Contract, you should
consult your tax advisor with respect to these issues.        

DEATH BENEFITS. None of the death benefits paid under the Contract to
       the Beneficiary will be tax-exempt life insurance benefits. The rules
 governing the taxation of payments from an annuity Contract, as
       discussed above, generally apply to the payment of death benefits and
   depend on whether the death benefits are paid as a lump sum or as
annuity payments. Estate or gift taxes may also apply.        

        ASSIGNMENT. An assignment of your Contract will generally be a taxable
       event. Assignments of a tax-qualified Contract may also be limited by
      the Code and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
     amended. These limits are summarized in the SAI. You should consult
   your tax adviser prior to making any assignment of your Contract.

        DIVERSIFICATION. The Code provides that the underlying investments for
       a non-qualified variable annuity must satisfy certain diversification
        requirements in order to be treated as an annuity Contract. We believe
        that the underlying investments are being managed so as to comply with
these requirements.                                           

         OWNER CONTROL. In a Revenue Ruling issued in 2003, the Internal Revenue
     Service (IRS) considered certain variable annuity and variable life
     insurance contracts and held that the types of actual and potential
     control that the contract owners could exercise over the investment
         assets held by the insurance company under these variable contracts was
         not sufficient to cause the contract owners to be treated as the owners
     of those assets and thus to be subject to current income tax on the
         income and gains produced by those assets. Under the Contract, like the
contracts described in the Revenue Ruling, there will be no   
         arrangement, plan, contract or agreement between the contract owner and
        Jackson National regarding the availability of a particular investment
       option and other than the contract owner's right to allocate premiums
     and transfer funds among the available sub-accounts, all investment
     decisions concerning the sub-accounts will be made by the insurance
company or an advisor in its sole and absolute discretion.    

      The Contract will differ from the contracts described in the Revenue
       Ruling, in two respects. The first difference is that the contract in
 the Revenue Ruling provided only 12 investment options with the
     insurance company having the ability to add an additional 8 options
    whereas a Contract offers __ Investment Divisions and at least one
         Fixed Account option, although a Contract owner can select no more than
         18 fixed and variable options at any one time. The second difference is
        that the owner of a contract in the Revenue Ruling could only make one
transfer per 30-day period without a fee whereas during the   
         accumulation phase, a Contract owner will be permitted to make up to 15
transfers in any one year without a charge.                   

         The Revenue Ruling states that whether the owner of a variable contract
   is to be treated as the owner of the assets held by the insurance
company under the contract will depend on all of the facts and
       circumstances. Jackson National does not believe that the differences
        between the Contract and the contracts described in the Revenue Ruling
    with respect to the number of investment choices and the number of
     investment transfers that can be made under the contract without an
         additional charge should prevent the holding in the Revenue Ruling from
       applying to the Owner of a Contract. At this time, however, it cannot
       be determined whether additional guidance will be provided by the IRS
        on this issue and what standards may be contained in such guidance. We
    reserve the right to modify the Contract to the extent required to
maintain favorable tax treatment.                             

       WITHHOLDING. In general, distributions from a Contract are subject to
     10% federal income tax withholding unless you elect not to have tax
       withheld. Some states have enacted similar rules. Different rules may
apply to payments delivered outside the United States.        

      Any distribution from a tax-qualified contract eligible for rollover
    will be subject to federal tax withholding at a mandatory 20% rate
         unless the distribution is made as a direct rollover to a tax-qualified
plan or to an individual retirement account or annuity.       

     The Code generally allows the rollover of most distributions to and
from tax-qualified plans, tax-sheltered annuities, Individual 
        Retirement Annuities and eligible deferred compensation plans of state
      or local governments. Distributions which may not be rolled over are
those which are:                                              

               (a)  one of a  series  of  substantially  equal  annual  (or more
                    frequent) payments made (a) over the life or life expectancy
                    of  the  employee,   (b)  the  joint  lives  or  joint  life
                    expectancies of the employee and the employee's beneficiary,
           or (c) for a specified period of ten years or more;

(b)  a required minimum distribution;             

(c)  a hardship withdrawal; or                    

(d)  the non-taxable portion of a distribution.   

JNL TAXATION                                                  

    We will pay company income taxes on the taxable corporate earnings
created by this separate account product adjusted for various 
        permissible deductions and certain tax benefits discussed below. While
      we may consider company income tax liabilities and tax benefits when
  pricing our products, we do not currently include our income tax
liabilities in the charges you pay under the contract. We will
   periodically review the issue of charging for these taxes and may
         impose a charge in the future. (We do impose a so-called "Federal (DAC)
      Tax Charge" under variable life insurance policies, but the "Federal
      (DAC) Tax Charge" merely compensates us for the required deferral of
 acquisition cost and does not constitute company income taxes.)

      In calculating our corporate income tax liability, we derive certain
         corporate income tax benefits associated with the investment of company
       assets, including separate account assets that are treated as company
   assets under applicable income tax law. These benefits reduce our
 overall corporate income tax liability. Under current law, such
    benefits may include dividends received deductions and foreign tax
         credits which can be material. We do not pass these benefits through to
       the separate accounts, principally because: (i) the great bulk of the
        benefits results from the dividends received deduction, which involves
  no reduction in the dollar amount of dividends that the separate
        account receives; (ii) product owners are not the owners of the assets
    generating the benefits under applicable income tax law; and (iii)
       while we impose a so-called "Federal (DAC) tax charge" under variable
     life insurance policies, we do not currently include company income
taxes in the charges owners pay under the products.           

 OTHER INFORMATION

  DOLLAR COST AVERAGING. If the amount allocated to the Investment
     Divisions plus the amount allocated to a Fixed Account option is at
         least $15,000, you can arrange to have a dollar amount or percentage of
  money periodically transferred automatically into the Investment
   Divisions and other Fixed Account options from the one-year Fixed
  Account or any of the Investment Divisions. If the Fixed Account
options are not available or otherwise restricted, dollar cost
     averaging will be exclusively from the Investment Divisions. In the
 case of transfers from the one-year Fixed Account or Investment
      Divisions with a stable unit value to the Investment Divisions, this
        can let you pay a lower average cost per unit over time than you would
  receive if you made a one-time purchase. Transfers from the more
         volatile Investment Divisions may not result in lower average costs and
      such Investment Divisions may not be an appropriate source of dollar
      cost averaging transfers in volatile markets. There is no charge for
Dollar Cost Averaging. Certain restrictions may apply.        

        DOLLAR COST AVERAGING PLUS (DCA+). The DCA+ Fixed Account is a "source
     account" designed for dollar cost averaging transfers to Investment
     Divisions or systematic transfers to other Fixed Accounts. The DCA+
     Fixed Account is credited with an enhanced interest rate. If a DCA+
     Fixed Account is selected, monies in the DCA+ Fixed Account will be
       systematically transferred to the Investment Divisions or other Fixed
     Accounts chosen over the DCA+ term selected. There is no charge for
  DCA+. The DCA+ Fixed Account is only available for new premiums.
      Premiums are accepted during the first six Contract Months only. You
    should consult your JNL representative with respect to the current
         availability of the Fixed Account options and the availability of DCA+.

      EARNINGS SWEEP. You can choose to move your earnings from the source
      accounts (only applicable from the one year Fixed Account Option, if
       currently available, and the Money Market Investment Division). There
is no charge for Earnings Sweep.                              

       REBALANCING. You can arrange to have us automatically reallocate your
  Contract Value among Investment Divisions and the one-year Fixed
         Account (if currently available) periodically to maintain your selected
         allocation percentages. Rebalancing is consistent with maintaining your
 allocation of investments among market segments, although it is
      accomplished by reducing your Contract Value allocated to the better
      performing Investment Divisions. There is no charge for Rebalancing.

       You may cancel a Dollar Cost Averaging, Earnings Sweep or Rebalancing
  program using whatever methods you use to change your allocation
instructions.                                                 

FREE LOOK. You may return your Contract to the selling agent or us
       within ten days (or longer if required by your state) after receiving
it. We will return                                            

*    the Contract Value, PLUS                     

               *    any fees (other than asset-based fees) and expenses deducted
from the premiums.                      

        We will determine the Contract Value in the Investment Divisions as of
   the date we receive the Contract or the date you return it to the
       selling agent. We will return premium payments where required by law.
  In some states, we are required to hold the premiums of a senior
         citizen in the Fixed Account during the free look period, unless we are
  specifically directed to allocate the premiums to the Investment
      Divisions. State laws vary; your free look rights will depend on the
laws of the state in which you purchased the Contract.        

   ADVERTISING. From time to time, we may advertise several types of
performance of the Investment Divisions.                      

               *    TOTAL  RETURN  is the  overall  change  in the  value  of an
                    investment in an Investment  Division over a given period of
time.                                   

               *    STANDARDIZED  AVERAGE  ANNUAL TOTAL RETURN is  calculated in
accordance with SEC guidelines.         

               *    NON-STANDARDIZED  TOTAL RETURN may be for periods other than
                    those   required   by,  or  may   otherwise   differ   from,
                    standardized  average annual total return. For example, if a
                    Fund  has  been in  existence  longer  than  the  Investment
                    Division,  we  may  show  non-standardized  performance  for
                    periods that begin on the inception date of the Fund, rather
           than the inception date of the Investment Division.

               *    YIELD refers to the income generated by an investment over a
given period of time.                   

        Performance will be calculated by determining the percentage change in
       the value of an Accumulation Unit by dividing the increase (decrease)
         for that unit by the value of the Accumulation Unit at the beginning of
         the period. Performance will reflect the deduction of the mortality and
       expense risk and administration charges and may reflect the deduction
         of the annual contract maintenance and withdrawal charges, but will not
       reflect charges for optional features except in performance data used
        in sales materials that promote those optional features. The deduction
      of withdrawal charges and/or the charges for optional features would
         reduce the percentage increase or make greater any percentage decrease.

 RESTRICTIONS UNDER THE TEXAS OPTIONAL RETIREMENT PROGRAM (ORP).
       Contracts issued to participants in ORP contain restrictions required
under the Texas Administrative Code. In accordance with those 
  restrictions, a participant in ORP will not be permitted to make
       withdrawals prior to such participant's retirement, death, attainment
of age 70 1/2 or termination of employment in a Texas public  
        institution of higher education. The restrictions on withdrawal do not
         apply in the event a participant in ORP transfers the Contract Value to
another approved contract or vendor during the period of ORP  
        participation. These requirements will apply to any other jurisdiction
with comparable requirements.                                 

    MODIFICATION OF YOUR CONTRACT. Only our President, Vice President,
     Secretary or Assistant Secretary may approve a change to or waive a
         provision of your Contract. Any change or waiver must be in writing. We
        may change the terms of your Contract without your consent in order to
comply with changes in applicable law, or otherwise as we deem
necessary.                                                    

         LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. Jackson National is a defendant in a number of civil
       proceedings substantially similar to other litigation brought against
         many life insurers alleging misconduct in the sale or administration of
       insurance products. These matters are sometimes referred to as market
     conduct litigation. The market conduct litigation currently pending
      against JNL asserts various theories of liability and purports to be
    filed on behalf of individuals or differing classes persons in the
       United States who purchased either life insurance or annuity products
        from JNL during periods ranging from 1981 to present. JNL has retained
national and local counsel experienced in the handling of such
  litigation. To date, such litigation has either been resolved by
  Jackson National on a non-material basis, or is being vigorously
 defended. At this time, it is not feasible to make a meaningful
   estimate of the amount or range of loss that could result from an
unfavorable outcome in such actions.

APPENDIX B
GMWB PROSPECTUS EXAMPLES

Unless otherwise specified, the following examples assume you elected a 5% GMWB 
when you purchased your Contract, no other optional benefits were elected, your 
initial premium payment was $100,000, your GAWA is greater than your RMD at the 
time a withdrawal is requested, and all partial withdrawals requested include   
any applicable charges. The examples also assume that the GMWB and any For Life 
guarantee have not been terminated as described in the Access to Your Money     
section of this prospectus.                                                     

EXAMPLE 1: AT ELECTION, YOUR GWB AND GAWA ARE DETERMINED.                       

*    Example 1a: If the GMWB is elected at issue:                     

          -    Your  initial  GWB is  $100,000,  which is your  initial  Premium
payment.                                          

          -    Your  GAWA  is  $5,000,   which  is  5%  of  your   initial   GWB
($100,000*0.05 = $5,000).                         

     *    Example 1b: If the GMWB is elected after issue when the Contract Value
is  $105,000:                                               

          -    Your initial GWB is $105,000, which is your Contract Value on the
effective date of the endorsement.                

          -    Your  GAWA  is  $5,250,   which  is  5%  of  your   initial   GWB
($105,000*0.05 = $5,250).                         

EXAMPLE 2: UPON PAYMENT OF A SUBSEQUENT PREMIUM, YOUR GWB AND GAWA ARE          
RE-DETERMINED. YOUR GWB IS SUBJECT TO A MAXIMUM OF $5,000,000.                  

     *    Example 2a: If you make an additional  Premium  payment of $50,000 and
your GWB is $100,000 at the time of payment:                

          -    Your  new  GWB is  $150,000,  which  is  your  GWB  prior  to the
               additional   Premium  payment  ($100,000)  plus  your  additional
Premium payment ($50,000).                        

          -    Your GAWA is $7,500,  which is your GAWA prior to the  additional
               Premium  payment  ($5,000)  plus  5% of your  additional  Premium
payment ($50,000*0.05 = $2,500).                  

     *    Example 2b: If you make an additional  Premium payment of $100,000 and
          your  GWB is  $4,950,000  and  your  GAWA is  $247,500  at the time of
payment:                                                    

          -    Your new GWB is $5,000,000,  which is the maximum, since your GWB
               prior to the additional  Premium payment  ($4,950,000)  plus your
               additional  Premium  payment  ($100,000)  exceeds  the maximum of
$5,000,000.                                       

          -    Your GAWA is $250,000, which is your GAWA prior to the additional
               Premium  payment  ($247,500)  plus  5% of the  allowable  $50,000
             increase in your GWB (($5,000,000 - $4,950,000)*0.05 = $2,500).

EXAMPLE 3: UPON  WITHDRAWAL  OF THE  GUARANTEED  AMOUNT  (WHICH IS YOUR GAWA FOR
ENDORSEMENTS FOR NON-QUALIFIED CONTRACTS OR WHICH IS THE GREATER OF YOUR GAWA OR
YOUR RMD FOR THOSE GMWBS RELATED TO QUALIFIED CONTRACTS),  YOUR GWB AND GAWA ARE
RE-DETERMINED.                                                                  

     *    Example 3a: If you withdraw an amount equal to your GAWA ($5,000) when
your GWB is $100,000:                                       

          -    Your  new  GWB  is  $95,000,  which  is  your  GWB  prior  to the
               withdrawal ($100,000) less the amount of the withdrawal ($5,000).

          -    Your GAWA for the next  year  remains  $5,000,  since you did not
withdraw an amount that exceeds your GAWA.        

          -    If you continued to take annual  withdrawals  equal to your GAWA,
               it would take an additional 19 years to deplete your GWB ($95,000
               / $5,000 per year = 19 years), provided that there are no further
               adjustments  made to your GWB or your GAWA  (besides  the  annual
               reduction of your GWB by the amount of the withdrawal).  However,
               if you have elected a For Life GMWB and the For Life Guarantee is
               in effect,  withdrawals equal to your GAWA could continue for the
               rest of your  life  (or in the case of Joint  Owners,  until  the
               first  death of the  Joint  Owners or until the death of the last
               surviving  Covered  Life if your  endorsement  is a For Life GMWB
               with Joint  Option),  even  beyond 19 years,  prior to the Latest
Income Date.                                      

     *    Example  3b: If you  withdraw  an amount  equal to your RMD  ($7,500),
          which is greater than your GAWA ($5,000) when your GWB is $100,000 and
your RMD provision is in effect for your endorsement:       

          -    Your  new  GWB  is  $92,500,  which  is  your  GWB  prior  to the
               withdrawal ($100,000) less the amount of the withdrawal ($7,500).

          -    Your GAWA for the next year remains $5,000, since your withdrawal
               did not exceed  the  greater  of your GAWA  ($5,000)  or your RMD
($7,500).                                         

          -    If you continued to take annual  withdrawals  equal to your GAWA,
               it would take an additional 19 years to deplete your GWB ($92,500
               / $5,000 per year = 19 years), provided that there are no further
               adjustments  made to your GWB or your GAWA  (besides  the  annual
               reduction  of your GWB by the amount of the  withdrawal)  and the
               amount of the final  withdrawal would be less than your GAWA (and
               equal to your  remaining  GWB) if your  endorsement  is not a For
               Life GMWB or if your  endorsement  is a For Life GMWB and the For
               Life Guarantee is not in effect.  However,  if you have elected a
               For  Life  GMWB  and  the  For  Life   Guarantee  is  in  effect,
               withdrawals  equal to your GAWA  could  continue  for the rest of
               your life (or until the death of the last surviving  Covered Life
               if your  endorsement is a For Life GMWB with Joint Option),  even
beyond 19 years, prior to the Latest Income Date. 

*    Notes:                                                           

          -    If your  endorsement  does not include a For Life Guarantee or if
               the For Life  Guarantee is not in effect,  your GAWA would not be
permitted to exceed your new GWB.                 

          -    Withdrawals  taken in connection  with a GMWB are  considered the
               same as any other  withdrawal for the purpose of determining  all
               other values under the  Contract.  In the case where your minimum
               death benefit is reduced  proportionately  for withdrawals,  your
               death  benefit  may be  reduced  by more  than the  amount of the
withdrawal.                                       

EXAMPLE 4: UPON WITHDRAWAL OF AN AMOUNT THAT EXCEEDS YOUR GUARANTEED AMOUNT (AS 
DEFINED IN EXAMPLE 3), YOUR GWB AND GAWA ARE RE-DETERMINED.                     

     *    Example 4a: If you withdraw an amount ($10,000) that exceeds your GAWA
          ($5,000)  when  your  Contract  Value  is  $120,000  and  your  GWB is
$100,000:                                                   

          -    Your new GWB is $90,000, which is the lesser of 1) your GWB prior
               to the withdrawal  less the amount of the withdrawal  ($100,000 -
               $10,000  =  $90,000)  or 2)  your  Contract  Value  prior  to the
               withdrawal less the amount of the withdrawal  ($120,000 - $10,000
= $110,000).                                      

          -    Your GAWA is  recalculated  based on the type of endorsement  you
have elected.                                     

               -    If your  endorsement  is not a For Life GMWB,  your GAWA for
                    the next year remains  $5,000,  since it is  recalculated to
                    equal the  lesser of 1) your  GAWA  prior to the  withdrawal
                    ($5,000)  or  2)  5%  of  your  Contract   Value  after  the
                    withdrawal  ($110,000*0.05  = $5,500).  If you  continued to
                    take annual withdrawals equal to your GAWA, it would take an
                    additional  18 years to deplete  your GWB  ($90,000 / $5,000
                    per year = 18  years),  provided  that  there are no further
                    adjustments  made to  your  GWB or your  GAWA  (besides  the
                    annual   reduction   of  your  GWB  by  the  amount  of  the
withdrawal).                            

               -    If  your  endorsement  is a For  Life  GMWB,  your  GAWA  is
                    recalculated  to equal  $4,500,  which is 5% of your new GWB
                    ($90,000*0.05  = $4,500),  and if the For Life Guarantee was
                    effective prior to the withdrawal,  it remains in effect. If
                    you continued to take annual withdrawals equal to your GAWA,
                    it would take an  additional  20 years,  prior to the Latest
                    Income Date,  to deplete your GWB ($90,000 / $4,500 per year
                    = 20 years),  provided that there are no further adjustments
                    made to your GWB or your GAWA (besides the annual  reduction
                    of your GWB by the amount of the  withdrawal).  However,  if
                    your For Life Guarantee is in effect,  withdrawals  equal to
                    your GAWA  could  continue  for the rest of your life (or in
                    the case of Joint Owners, until the first death of the Joint
                    Owners or until the death of the last surviving Covered Life

          ($5,000)  when  your  Contract  Value  is  $105,000  and  your  GWB is
$100,000:

                    the next year is recalculated to equal $4,750,  which is the
                    lesser of 1) your GAWA prior to the  withdrawal  ($5,000) or

                    years),  provided that there are no further adjustments made

                    your GWB by the amount of the  withdrawal) and the amount of
                    your  final  withdrawal  would be less  than  your GAWA (and
equal to your remaining GWB).           

               -    If  your  endorsement  is a For  Life  GMWB,  your  GAWA  is

permitted to exceed your remaining GWB.           

          -    Withdrawals  taken in connection  with a GMWB are  considered the
               same as any other  withdrawal for the purpose of determining  all
               other values under the  Contract.  In the case where your minimum
               death benefit is reduced  proportionately  for withdrawals,  your
               death  benefit  may be  reduced  by more  than the  amount of the
withdrawal.                                       

EXAMPLE 5: UPON STEP-UP, YOUR GWB AND GAWA ARE RE-DETERMINED.                   

     *    Example 5a: If at the time of step-up your Contract Value is $200,000,
your GWB is $100,000 and your GAWA is $5,000:               

          -    Your new GWB is recalculated to equal $200,000, which is equal to
your Contract Value.                              

          -    Your GAWA for the next  year is  recalculated  to equal  $10,000,
               which  is the  greater  of 1)  your  GAWA  prior  to the  step-up
          ($5,000) or 2) 5% of your new GWB ($200,000*0.05 = $10,000).

          -    After step-up,  if you continued to take annual withdrawals equal
               to your  GAWA,  it would take an  additional  20 years to deplete
               your GWB ($200,000 / $10,000 per year = 20 years),  provided that
               there are no  further  adjustments  made to your GWB or your GAWA

     *    Example 5b: If at the time of step-up your Contract  Value is $90,000,
your GWB is $80,000 and your GAWA is $5,000:                

          -    Your new GWB is recalculated to equal $90,000,  which is equal to
your Contract Value.                              

          -    Your GAWA for the next year remains $5,000,  which is the greater

new GWB ($90,000*0.05 = $4,500).                  

          -    After step-up,  if you continued to take annual withdrawals equal
               to your  GAWA,  it would take an  additional  18 years to deplete
               your GWB  ($90,000 / $5,000 per year = 18 years),  provided  that
               there are no  further  adjustments  made to your GWB or your GAWA
               (besides  the annual  reduction  of your GWB by the amount of the

               For Life Guarantee is in effect,  withdrawals  equal to your GAWA
               could continue for the rest of your life (or in the case of Joint
               Owners,  until the first  death of the Joint  Owners or until the

          -    The  election  of an  Owner-initiated  step-up  may  result in an
               increase  in the GMWB  charge.  If the charge  does  increase,  a
               separate  calculation  would be  recommended  to establish if the
step-up is a beneficial election.                 

          -    Your GWB will only automatically step up to the Contract Value if
               the  Contract  Value is greater  than your GWB at the time of the
automatic step-up.                                

EXAMPLE 6: IMPACT OF THE ORDER OF TRANSACTIONS.                                 

     *    If prior to any transactions your Contract Value is $200,000, your GWB
          is  $100,000  and you  wish to step up your GWB (or your GWB is due to
          step up  automatically)  and you also wish to take a withdrawal  of an
amount equal to your GAWA ($5,000):                         

          -    If you request the  withdrawal  after the step-up,  upon step-up,
               your GWB is set equal to $200,000,  which is your Contract Value.
               At that time, your GAWA is recalculated  and is equal to $10,000,
               which  is the  greater  of 1)  your  GAWA  prior  to the  step-up
               ($5,000)  or 2) 5% of your  new GWB  ($200,000*0.05  =  $10,000).
               Following the step-up and after the  withdrawal  of $5,000,  your
               new GWB is  $195,000,  which is your GWB less the  amount  of the
               withdrawal  ($200,000  - $5,000 =  $195,000)  and your  GAWA will
               remain at  $10,000  since the amount of the  withdrawal  does not
               exceed your GAWA.  If you  continued  to take annual  withdrawals
               equal to your  GAWA,  it  would  take an  additional  20 years to
               deplete  your GWB  ($195,000  /  $10,000  per  year = 20  years),
               provided that there are no further  adjustments  made to your GWB
               or your GAWA  (besides  the annual  reduction  of your GWB by the
               amount of the withdrawal) and the amount of the final  withdrawal
               would be less than your GAWA (and equal to your  remaining  GWB).
               However,  if you have  elected  a For Life  GMWB and the For Life
               Guarantee  is in  effect,  withdrawals  equal to your GAWA  could
               continue  for the  rest of your  life  (or in the  case of  Joint
               Owners,  until the first  death of the Joint  Owners or until the
               death of the last surviving Covered Life if your endorsement is a
               For Life GMWB with Joint Option),  even beyond 20 years, prior to
the Latest Income Date.                           

          -    If you requested the withdrawal prior to the step-up, immediately
               following the  withdrawal  transaction,  your new GWB is $95,000,
               which is your GWB less the amount of the  withdrawal  ($100,000 -
               $5,000 = $95,000) and your Contract Value becomes $195,000, which
               is your Contract Value prior to the withdrawal less the amount of
               the  withdrawal  ($200,000  - $5,000 =  $195,000).  Upon  step-up
               following  the  withdrawal,  your GWB is set  equal to  $195,000,
               which  is  your  Contract  Value.  At  that  time,  your  GAWA is
               recalculated  and is equal to $9,750,  which is the greater of 1)
               your GAWA prior to the step-up  ($5,000) or 2) 5% of your new GWB
               ($195,000*0.05  =  $9,750).  If  you  continued  to  take  annual
               withdrawals  equal to your GAWA,  it would take an  additional 20
               years to  deplete  your  GWB  ($195,000  /  $9,750  per year = 20
               years),  provided that there are no further  adjustments  made to
               your GWB or your GAWA  (besides the annual  reduction of your GWB
               by the amount of the withdrawal).  However, if you have elected a
               For  Life  GMWB  and  the  For  Life   Guarantee  is  in  effect,
               withdrawals  equal to your GAWA  could  continue  for the rest of
               your life (or in the case of Joint Owners,  until the first death
               of the Joint  Owners  or until  the  death of the last  surviving
               Covered  Life if your  endorsement  is a For Life GMWB with Joint
             Option), even beyond 20 years, prior to the Latest Income Date.

*    Notes:                                                           

          -    As the  example  illustrates,  when  considering  a request for a
               withdrawal  at or near the same time as the election or automatic
               application  of a  step-up,  the  order of the  transactions  may
               impact your GAWA.  If the step-up  would result in an increase in
               your GAWA and the  requested  withdrawal is less than or equal to
               your new GAWA,  your GAWA  resulting  after the two  transactions
               would be greater if the withdrawal is requested after the step-up
               is applied.  If the step-up  does not  increase  your GAWA or the
               withdrawal  requested  is greater  than your new GAWA,  your GAWA
               resulting  from the  transactions  is the same  regardless of the
order of the transactions.                        

          -    This example would also apply in situations  when the  withdrawal
exceeded your GAWA but not your permissible RMD.  

          -    The  election  of an  Owner-initiated  step-up  may  result in an
increase in the GMWB charge.                      

          -    Your GWB will only automatically step up to the Contract Value if
               the  Contract  Value is greater  than your GWB at the time of the
automatic step-up.                                

          -    If your  endorsement  does not include a For Life Guarantee or if
               the For Life  Guarantee is not in effect,  your GAWA would not be
permitted to exceed your remaining GWB.           

          -    Withdrawals  taken in connection  with a GMWB are  considered the
               same as any other  withdrawal for the purpose of determining  all
               other values under the  Contract.  In the case where your minimum
               death benefit is reduced  proportionately  for withdrawals,  your
               death  benefit  may be  reduced  by more  than the  amount of the
withdrawal.                                       

EXAMPLE 7: FOR LIFE GUARANTEE BECOMES EFFECTIVE AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE 
ENDORSEMENT. AT THE TIME THE FOR LIFE GUARANTEE BECOMES EFFECTIVE, YOUR GAWA IS 
RE-DETERMINED. (THIS EXAMPLE ONLY APPLIES IF YOUR ENDORSEMENT IS A FOR LIFE     
GMWB.)                                                                          

     *    Example 7a: If on the Contract Anniversary on or immediately following
          your  65th  birthday  your  Contract  Value  is  $30,000,  your GWB is
$50,000, and your GAWA is $5,000:                           

          -    Your  GAWA for the next  year is  recalculated  to equal  $2,500,
              which is equal to 5% of the current GWB ($50,000*0.05 = $2,500).

          -    The For Life Guarantee  becomes  effective,  thus allowing you to
               make annual  withdrawals  equal to your GAWA for the rest of your
               life (or in the case of Joint  Owners,  until the first  death of
               the Joint Owners or until the death of the last surviving Covered
               Life if your  endorsement  is a For Life GMWB with Joint Option).
               Once the For Life  Guarantee  becomes  effective,  it  remains in
               effect until the  endorsement is terminated,  as described in the
               Access  to  Your  Money  section  of  this  prospectus,  or  upon
               continuation   of  the  Contract  by  the  spouse   (unless  your
               endorsement  is a For Life GMWB with Joint  Option and the spouse
               continuing  the  Contract is a Covered Life in which case the For
               Life  Guarantee  remains  in  effect  upon  continuation  of  the
Contract by the spouse).                          

     *    Example  7b:  If your  Contract  Value  has  fallen to $0 prior to the
          Contract  Anniversary on or immediately  following your 65th birthday,
your GWB is $50,000 and your GAWA is $5,000:                

          -    You will continue to receive automatic payments of a total annual
               amount that equals your GAWA until your GWB is depleted. However,
               your GAWA would not be  permitted to exceed your  remaining  GWB.
           Your GAWA is not recalculated since the Contract Value is $0.

          -    The For Life  Guarantee  does  not  become  effective  due to the
               depletion of the Contract  Value prior to the  effective  date of
the For Life Guarantee.                           

     *    Example 7c: If on the Contract Anniversary on or immediately following
          your 65th birthday,  your Contract  Value is $50,000,  your GWB is $0,
and your GAWA is $5,000:                                    

          -    Your GAWA for the next year is recalculated to equal $0, which is
equal to 5% of the current GWB ($0*0.05 = $0).    

          -    The For Life Guarantee  becomes  effective,  thus allowing you to
               make annual  withdrawals  equal to your GAWA for the rest of your
               life (or in the case of Joint  Owners,  until the first  death of
               the Joint Owners or until the death of the last surviving Covered
               Life if your  endorsement  is a For Life GMWB with Joint Option).
               Once the For Life  Guarantee  becomes  effective,  it  remains in
               effect until the  endorsement is terminated,  as described in the
               Access  to  Your  Money  section  of  this  prospectus,  or  upon
               continuation   of  the  Contract  by  the  spouse   (unless  your
               endorsement  is a For Life GMWB with Joint  Option and the spouse
               continuing  the  Contract is a Covered Life in which case the For
               Life  Guarantee  remains  in  effect  upon  continuation  of  the
Contract by the spouse).                          

          -    Although  your GAWA is $0,  upon  step-up  your GWB and your GAWA
               would  increase to values  greater than $0 and since the For Life
               Guarantee  has become  effective,  you could  withdraw  an annual
               amount  equal to your  GAWA for the rest of your  life (or in the
               case of Joint  Owners,  until the first death of the Joint Owners
               or until the  death of the last  surviving  Covered  Life if your
endorsement is a For Life GMWB with Joint Option).

*    Notes:                                                           

          -    For endorsements  with a Joint Option,  your GAWA is recalculated
               and the For Life  Guarantee  becomes  effective  on the  Contract
               Anniversary  on or  immediately  following  the youngest  Covered
Life's 65th birthday.                             

EXAMPLE 8: FOR LIFE GUARANTEE ON A FOR LIFE GMWB WITH JOINT OPTION. (THIS       
EXAMPLE ONLY APPLIES IF YOUR ENDORSEMENT IS A FOR LIFE GMWB WITH JOINT OPTION.) 

     *    If at the time of the first  death of the Covered  Lives the  Contract
     Value is $105,000, your GWB is $100,000, and your GAWA is $5,000:

          -    The spouse may continue  the Contract and the For Life  Guarantee
               will  remain  in  effect  or  become  effective  on the  Contract
               Anniversary  on  or  immediately  following  the  date  that  the
               youngest  Covered Life attains (or would have  attained)  age 65.
               Once the For Life  Guarantee  becomes  effective,  the  surviving
               Covered Life will be able to take annual withdrawals equal to the
GAWA for the rest of his or her life.             

-    Your GWB remains $100,000 and your GAWA remains $5,000.

The financial statements of Jackson National Separate Account - I and Jackson   
National Life Insurance Company for the periods indicated have been included    
herein in reliance upon the reports of ___________, an independent registered   
public accounting firm, appearing elsewhere herein, and upon the authority of   
said firm as experts in accounting and auditing. Jackson National Life Insurance
Company's audit report refers to the adoption effective January 1, 2004 of the  
Accounting Standards Executive Committee of the American Institute of Certified 
Public Accountant's Statement of Position 03-1, "Accounting and Reporting by    
Insurance Enterprises for Certain Nontraditional Long-Duration Contracts and for
Separate Accounts." ___________ is located at _____________.                    

PURCHASE OF SECURITIES BEING OFFERED                                            

The Contracts will be sold by licensed insurance agents in states where the     
Contracts may be lawfully sold. The agents will be registered representatives of
broker-dealers that are registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and
members of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD).         

UNDERWRITERS                                                                    

The Contracts are offered continuously and are distributed by Jackson National  
Life Distributors LLC (JNLD), 7601 Technology Way, Denver, Colorado 80237. JNLD 
is a subsidiary of Jackson National.                                            

We expect to compensate broker/dealers selling the Contracts.                   

CALCULATION OF PERFORMANCE                                                      

When Jackson National advertises performance for an Investment Division (except 
the JNL/Select Money Market Division), we will include quotations of            
standardized average annual total return to facilitate comparison with          
standardized average annual total return advertised by other variable annuity   
separate accounts. Standardized average annual total return for an Investment   
Division will be shown for periods beginning on the date the Investment Division
first invested in the corresponding Funds. We will calculate standardized       
average annual total return according to the standard methods prescribed by     
rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission.                                

Standardized average annual total return for a specific period is calculated by 
taking a hypothetical $1,000 investment in an Investment Division at the        
offering on the first day of the period ("initial investment") and computing the
average annual compounded rate of return for the period that would equate the   
initial investment with the ending redeemable value ("redeemable value") of that
investment at the end of the period, carried to at least the nearest hundredth  
of a percent. Standardized average annual total return reflects the deduction of
all recurring charges that are charged to all Contracts. The redeemable value   
also reflects the effect of any applicable withdrawal charge or other charge    
that may be imposed at the end of the period. No deduction is made for premium  
taxes that may be assessed by certain states.                                   

Jackson National may also advertise non-standardized total return on an         
annualized and cumulative basis. Non-standardized total return may be for       
periods other than those required to be presented or may otherwise differ from  
standardized average annual total return. The Contract is designed for long-term
investment; therefore, Jackson National believes that non-standardized total    
return that does not reflect the deduction of any applicable withdrawal charge  
may be useful to investors. Reflecting the deduction of the withdrawal charge   
decreases the level of performance advertised. Non-standardized total return may
also assume a larger initial investment that more closely approximates the size 
of a typical Contract.                                                          

Standardized average annual total return quotations will be current to the last 
day of the calendar quarter preceding the date on which an advertisement is     
submitted for publication. Both standardized average annual total return        
quotations and non-standardized total return quotations will be based on rolling
calendar quarters and will cover at least periods of one, five, and ten years,  
or a period covering the time the Investment Division has been in existence, if 
it has not been in existence for one of the prescribed periods.                 

Quotations of standardized average annual total return and non-standardized     
total return are based upon historical earnings and will fluctuate. Any         
quotation of performance should not be considered a guarantee of future         
performance. Factors affecting the performance of an Investment Division and its
corresponding Fund include general market conditions, operating expenses and    
investment management. An owner's withdrawal value upon surrender of a Contract 
may be more or less than its original cost.                                     

Jackson National may advertise the current annualized yield for a 30-day period 
for an Investment Division. The annualized yield of an Investment Division      
refers to the income generated by the Investment Division over a specified      
30-day period. Because this yield is annualized, the yield generated by an      
Investment Division during the 30-day period is assumed to be generated each    
30-day period. The yield is computed by dividing the net investment income per  
accumulation unit earned during the period by the price per unit on the last day
of the period, according to the following formula:                              

6                                 
(  a-b    )                                             
YIELD = 2  [(  --- + 1) -1]                                                     
(  cd     )                                             

Where:                                                                          

                                                                [Download Table]

                                                                             

a  =  net investment income earned during the period by the Fund attributable
      to shares owned by the Investment Division.                            
b  =  expenses for the Investment Division accrued for the period (net of    
      reimbursements).                                                       
c  =  the average daily number of accumulation units outstanding during the  
      period.                                                                
d  =  the maximum offering price per accumulation unit on the last day of the
      period.                                                                

The maximum withdrawal charge is 5%.                                            

Net investment income will be determined in accordance with rules established by
the Securities and Exchange Commission. Accrued expenses will include all       
recurring fees that are charged to all Contracts.                               

Because of the charges and deductions imposed by the Separate Account, the yield
for an Investment Division will be lower than the yield for the corresponding   
Funds. The yield on amounts held in the Investment Division normally will       
fluctuate over time. Therefore, the disclosed yield for any given period is not 
an indication or representation of future yields or rates of return. An         
Investment Division's actual yield will be affected by the types and quality of 
portfolio securities held by the Fund and the Fund operating expenses.          

Any current yield quotations of the JNL/Select Money Market Division will       
consist of a seven calendar day historical yield, carried at least to the       
nearest hundredth of a percent. We may advertise yield for the Division based on
different time periods, but we will accompany it with a yield quotation based on
a seven calendar day period. The JNL/Select Money Market Division's yield will  
be calculated by determining the net change, exclusive of capital changes, in   
the value of a hypothetical pre-existing account having a balance of one        
accumulation unit at the beginning of the base period, subtracting a            
hypothetical charge reflecting deductions from Contracts, and dividing the net  
change in account value by the value of the account at the beginning of the     
period to obtain a base period return and multiplying the base period return by 
(365/7). The JNL/Select Money Market Division's effective yield is computed     
similarly but includes the effect of assumed compounding on an annualized basis 
of the current yield quotations of the Division.                                

The JNL/Select Money Market Division's and effective yield will fluctuate daily.
Actual yields will depend on factors such as the type of instruments in the     
Fund's portfolio, portfolio quality and average maturity, changes in interest   
rates, and the Fund's expenses. Although the Investment Division determines its 
yield on the basis of a seven calendar day period, it may use a different time  
period on occasion. The yield quotes may reflect the expense limitations        
described in the Fund's Prospectus or Statement of Additional Information. There
is no assurance that the yields quoted on any given occasion will be maintained 
for any period of time and there is no guarantee that the net asset values will 
remain constant. It should be noted that neither a Contract owner's investment  
in the JNL/Select Money Market Division nor that Division's investment in the   
JNL/Select Money Market Division is guaranteed or insured. Yields of other money
market Funds may not be comparable if a different base or another method of     
calculation is used.                                                            

ADDITIONAL TAX INFORMATION                                                      
NOTE: INFORMATION CONTAINED HEREIN SHOULD NOT BE SUBSTITUTED FOR THE ADVICE OF A
PERSONAL TAX ADVISER. JACKSON NATIONAL DOES NOT MAKE ANY GUARANTEE REGARDING THE
TAX STATUS OF ANY CONTRACT OR ANY TRANSACTION INVOLVING THE CONTRACTS.          
PURCHASERS BEAR THE COMPLETE RISK THAT THE CONTRACTS MAY NOT BE TREATED AS      
"ANNUITY CONTRACTS" UNDER FEDERAL INCOME TAX LAWS. IT SHOULD BE FURTHER         
UNDERSTOOD THAT THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION IS NOT EXHAUSTIVE AND THAT OTHER       
SPECIAL RULES MAY BE APPLICABLE IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS. MOREOVER, NO ATTEMPT HAS 
BEEN MADE TO CONSIDER ANY APPLICABLE STATE OR OTHER TAX LAWS OR TO COMPARE THE  
TAX TREATMENT OF THE CONTRACTS TO THE TAX TREATMENT OF ANY OTHER INVESTMENT.    
JACKSON NATIONAL'S TAX STATUS                                                   

Jackson National is taxed as a life insurance company under the Code. For       
federal income tax purposes, the Separate Account is not a separate entity from 
Jackson National and its operations form a part of Jackson National.            

TAXATION OF ANNUITY CONTRACTS IN GENERAL                                        

Section 72 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"),       
governs taxation of annuities in general. An individual owner is not taxed on   
increases in the value of a Contract until distribution occurs, either in the   
form of a withdrawal or as annuity payments under the annuity option elected.   
For a withdrawal received as a total surrender (total redemption or a death     
benefit), the recipient is taxed on the portion of the payment that exceeds the 
cost basis of the Contract. For a payment received as a partial withdrawal from 
a non-qualified Contract, federal tax liability is generally determined on a    
last-in, first-out basis, meaning taxable income is withdrawn before the cost   
basis of the Contract is withdrawn. In the case of a partial withdrawal under a 
tax-qualified Contract, a ratable portion of the amount received is taxable. For
Contracts issued in connection with non-qualified plans, the cost basis is      
generally the premiums, while for Contracts issued in connection with           
tax-qualified plans there may be no cost basis. The taxable portion of a        
withdrawal is taxed at ordinary income tax rates. Tax penalties may also apply. 

For annuity payments, a portion of each payment in excess of an exclusion amount
is includable in taxable income. All annuity payments in excess of the exclusion
amount are fully taxable at ordinary income rates.                              

The exclusion amount for payments based on a fixed annuity option is determined 
by multiplying the payment by the ratio that the cost basis of the Contract     
(adjusted for any period certain or refund feature) bears to the expected return
under the Contract. The exclusion amount for payments based on a variable       
annuity option is determined by dividing the cost basis of the Contract         
(adjusted for any period certain or refund guarantee) by the fixed or estimated 
number of years for which annuity payments are to be made. No exclusion is      
allowed with respect to any payments received after the investment in the       
Contract has been recovered (i.e., when the total of the excludable amounts     
equals the investment in the Contract). For certain types of tax-qualified plans
there may be no cost basis in the Contract within the meaning of Section 72 of  
the Code. Owners, annuitants and beneficiaries under the Contracts should seek  
competent financial advice about the tax consequences of distributions.         

WITHHOLDING TAX ON DISTRIBUTIONS 

The Code generally requires Jackson National (or, in some cases, a plan         
administrator) to withhold tax on the taxable portion of any distribution or    
withdrawal from a Contract. For "eligible rollover distributions" from Contracts
issued under certain types of tax-qualified plans, 20% of the distribution must 
be withheld, unless the payee elects to have the distribution "rolled over" to  
another eligible plan in a direct transfer. This requirement is mandatory and   
cannot be waived by the owner.                                                  

An "eligible rollover distribution" is the taxable portion of any amount        
received by a covered employee from a plan qualified under Section 401(a) or    
403(a) of the Code, from a tax sheltered annuity qualified under Section 403(b) 
of the Code or an eligible deferred compensation plan of a state or local       
government under Section 457(b) of the Code (other than (1) a series of         
substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) for   
the life (or life expectancy) of the employee, or joint lives (or joint life    
expectancies) of the employee, and his or her designated beneficiary, or for a  
specified period of ten years or more; (2) minimum distributions required to be 
made under the Code; and (3) hardship withdrawals). Failure to "roll over" the  
entire amount of an eligible rollover distribution (including the amount equal  
to the 20% portion of the distribution that was withheld) could have adverse tax
consequences, including the imposition of a penalty tax on premature            
withdrawals, described later in this section.                                   

Withdrawals or distributions from a Contract other than eligible rollover       
distributions are also subject to withholding on the taxable portion of the     
distribution, but the owner may elect in such cases to waive the withholding    
requirement. If not waived, withholding is imposed (1) for periodic payments, at
the rate that would be imposed if the payments were wages, or (2) for other     
distributions, at the rate of 10%. If no withholding exemption certificate is in
effect for the payee, the rate under (1) above is computed by treating the payee
as a married individual claiming three withholding exemptions.                  

Generally, the amount of any payment of interest to a non-resident alien of the 
United States shall be subject to withholding of a tax equal to 30% of such     
amount or, if applicable, a lower treaty rate. A payment may not be subject to  
withholding where the recipient sufficiently establishes that such payment is   
effectively connected to the recipient's conduct of a trade or business in the  
United States and such payment is included in the recipient's gross income.     

DIVERSIFICATION -- SEPARATE ACCOUNT INVESTMENTS                                 

Section 817(h) of the Code imposes certain asset diversification standards on   
variable annuity Contracts. The Code provides that a variable annuity Contract  
will not be treated as an annuity Contract for any period (and any subsequent   
period) for which the investments held in any segregated asset account          
underlying the Contract are not adequately diversified, in accordance with      
regulations prescribed by the United States Treasury Department ("Treasury      
Department"). Disqualification of the Contract as an annuity Contract would     
result in imposition of federal income tax to the owner with respect to earnings
allocable to the Contract prior to the receipt of payments under the Contract.  
The Code contains a safe harbor provision which provides that annuity Contracts,
such as the Contracts, meet the diversification requirements if, as of the last 
day of each calendar quarter, or within 30 days after such last day, the        
underlying assets meet the diversification standards for a regulated investment 
company and no more than 55% of the total assets consist of cash, cash items,   
U.S. government securities and securities of other regulated investment         
companies.                                                                      

The Treasury Department has issued Regulations establishing diversification     
requirements for the mutual Funds underlying variable Contracts. These          
Regulations amplify the diversification requirements for variable Contracts set 
forth in the Code and provide an alternative to the safe harbor provision       
described above. Under these Regulations, a mutual Fund will be deemed          
adequately diversified if (1) no more than 55% of the value of the total assets 
of the mutual Fund is represented by any one investment; (2) no more than 70% of
the value of the total assets of the mutual Fund is represented by any two      
investments; (3) no more than 80% of the value of the total assets of the mutual
Fund is represented by any three investments; and (4) no more than 90% of the   
value of the total assets of the mutual Fund is represented by any four         
investments.                                                                    

Jackson National intends that each Fund of the JNL Series Trust will be managed 
by its respective investment adviser in such a manner as to comply with these   
diversification requirements.                                                   

At the time the Treasury Department issued the diversification Regulations, it  
did not provide guidance regarding the circumstances under which Contract owner 
control of the investments of a segregated asset account would cause the        
Contract owner to be treated as the owner of the assets of the segregated asset 
account. Revenue Ruling 2003-91 provides such guidance by describing the        
circumstances under which the owner of a variable contract will not possess     
sufficient control over the assets underlying the contract to be treated as the 
owner of those assets for federal income tax purposes.                          

Rev. Rul. 2003-91 considered certain variable annuity and variable life         
insurance contracts and held that the types of actual and potential control that
the contract owners could exercise over the investment assets held by the       
insurance company under these variable contracts was not sufficient to cause the
contract owners to be treated as the owners of those assets and thus to be      
subject to current income tax on the income and gains produced by those assets. 
Under the contracts in Rev. Rul. 2003-91 there was no arrangement, plan,        
contract or agreement between the contract owner and the insurance company      
regarding the availability of a particular investment option and other than the 
contract owner's right to allocate premiums and transfer funds among the        
available sub-accounts, all investment decisions concerning the sub-accounts    
were made by the insurance company or an advisor in its sole and absolute       
discretion. Twelve investment options were available under the contracts in Rev.
Rul. 2003-91 although the insurance company had the right to increase (but to no
more than 20) or decrease the number of sub-accounts at any time. The contract  
owner was permitted to transfer amounts among the various investment options    
without limitation, subject to incurring fees for more than one transfer per    
30-day period.                                                                  

Like the contracts described in Rev. Rul. 2003-91, under the Contract there will
be no arrangement, plan, contract or agreement between a Contract owner and     
Jackson National regarding the availability of a particular Allocation Option   
and other than the Contract owner's right to allocate premiums and transfer     
funds among the available Allocation Options, all investment decisions          
concerning the Allocation Options will be made by Jackson National or an advisor
in its sole and absolute discretion. The Contract will differ from the contracts
described in Rev. Rul. 2003-91 in two respects. The first difference is that the
contracts described in Rev. Rul. 2003-91 provided only 12 investment options    
with the insurance company having the ability to add an additional 8 options    
whereas the Contract offers __ Investment Divisions and 4 Fixed Account options 
although a Contract owner can select no more than 18 Allocation Options at any  
one time. The second difference is that the owner of a contract in Rev. Rul.    
2003-91 could only make one transfer per 30-day period without a fee whereas    
during the accumulation phase, a Contract owner can make 15 transfers in any one
year without a charge.                                                          

Rev. Rul. 2003-91 states that whether the owner of a variable contract is to be 
treated as the owner of the assets held by the insurance company under the      
contract will depend on all of the facts and circumstances. Jackson National    
does not believe that the differences between the Contract and the contracts    
described in Rev. Rul. 2003-91 with respect to the number of investment choices 
and the number of investment transfers that can be made under the Contract      
without an additional charge should prevent the holding in Rev. Rul. 2003-91    
from applying to the owner of a Contract. At this time, however, it cannot be   
determined whether additional guidance will be provided by the IRS on this issue
and what standards may be contained in such guidance. Jackson National reserves 
the right to modify the Contract to the extent required to maintain favorable   
tax treatment.                                                                  

MULTIPLE CONTRACTS                                                              

The Code provides that multiple non-qualified annuity Contracts that are issued 
within a calendar year to the same Contract owner by one company or its         
affiliates are treated as one annuity Contract for purposes of determining the  
tax consequences of any distribution. Such treatment may result in adverse tax  
consequences including more rapid taxation of the distributed amounts from such 
multiple Contracts. For purposes of this rule, Contracts received in a Section  
1035 exchange will be considered issued in the year of the exchange. Owners     
should consult a tax adviser prior to purchasing more than one annuity Contract 
in any calendar year.                                                           

PARTIAL 1035 EXCHANGES                                                          

Section 1035 of the Code provides that an annuity Contract may be exchanged in a
tax-free transaction for another annuity Contract. Historically, it was presumed
that only the exchange of an entire Contract, as opposed to a partial exchange, 
would be accorded tax-free status. In 1998, in CONWAY VS. COMMISSIONER, the Tax 
Court held that the direct transfer of a portion of an annuity Contract into    
another annuity Contract qualified as a non-taxable exchange. In response to the
CONWAY decision, the IRS issued Notice 2003-51 announcing that pending the      
publication of final regulations, the IRS will consider all the facts and       
circumstances, using general principles of tax law, to determine whether a      
partial exchange and a subsequent withdrawal from, or surrender of, either the  
surviving annuity contract or the new annuity contract within 24 months of the  
date on which the partial exchange was completed should be treated as an        
integrated transaction. In the absence of further guidance from the Internal    
Revenue Service it is unclear what specific types of partial exchange designs   
and transactions will be challenged by the Internal Revenue Service. Due to the 
uncertainty in this area owners should consult their own tax advisers prior to  
entering into a partial exchange of an annuity Contract.                        

CONTRACTS OWNED BY OTHER THAN NATURAL PERSONS                                   

Under Section 72(u) of the Code, the investment earnings on premiums for        
Contracts will be taxed currently to the owner if the owner is a non-natural    
person, e.g., a corporation or certain other entities. Such Contracts generally 
will not be treated as annuities for federal income tax purposes (except for the
taxation of life insurance companies). However, this treatment is not applied to
Contracts held by a trust or other entity as an agent for a natural person nor  
to Contracts held by certain tax-qualified plans. Purchasers should consult     
their own tax counsel or other tax adviser before purchasing a Contract to be   
owned by a non-natural person.                                                  

TAX TREATMENT OF ASSIGNMENTS                                                    

An assignment or pledge of a Contract may have tax consequences. Any assignment 
or pledge of a tax-qualified Contract may also be prohibited by ERISA in some   
circumstances. Owners should, therefore, consult competent legal advisers should
they wish to assign or pledge their Contracts.                                  

An assignment or pledge of all or any portion of the value of a Non-Qualified   
Contract is treated under Section 72 of the Code as an amount not received as an
annuity. The value of the Contract assigned or pledged that exceeds the         
aggregate premiums paid will be included in the individual's gross income. In   
addition, the amount included in the individual's gross income could also be    
subject to the 10% penalty tax discussed below under Non-Qualified Contracts.   

An assignment or pledge of all or any portion of the value of a Qualified       
Contract will disqualify the Qualified Contract. If the Qualified Contract is   
part of a qualified pension or profit-sharing plan, the Code prohibits the      
assignment or alienation of benefits provided under the plan. If the Qualified  
Contract is an IRA annuity or a 403(b) annuity, the Code requires the Qualified 
Contract to be nontransferable. If the Qualified Contract is part of an eligible
deferred compensation plan, amounts cannot be made available to plan            
participants or beneficiaries: (1) until the calendar year in which the         
participant attains age 70 1/2; (2) when the participant has a severance from   
employment; or (3) when the participant is faced with an unforeseeable          
emergency.                                                                      

DEATH BENEFITS 

Any death benefits paid under the Contract are taxable to the beneficiary. The  
rules governing the taxation of payments from an annuity Contract, as discussed 
above, generally apply to the payment of death benefits and depend on whether   
the death benefits are paid as a lump sum or as annuity payments. Estate or gift
taxes may also apply.                                                           

TAX-QUALIFIED PLANS                                                             

The Contracts offered by the Prospectus are designed to be suitable for use     
under various types of tax-qualified plans. Taxation of owners of a             
tax-qualified Contract will vary based on the type of plan and the terms and    
conditions of each specific plan. Owners, annuitants and beneficiaries are      
cautioned that benefits under a tax-qualified Contract may be subject to the    
terms and conditions of the plan, regardless of the terms and conditions of the 
Contracts issued to fund the plan. Owners, annuitant and beneficiaries are also 
reminded that a tax-qualified Contract will not provide any necessary or        
additional tax deferral if it is used to fund a tax-qualified plan that is      
already tax-deferred.                                                           

TAX TREATMENT OF WITHDRAWALS 

NON-QUALIFIED CONTRACTS 

Section 72 of the Code governs treatment of distributions from annuity          
Contracts. It provides that if the Contract value exceeds the aggregate premiums
made, any amount withdrawn not in the form of an annuity payment will be treated
as coming first from the earnings and then, only after the income portion is    
exhausted, as coming from the principal. Withdrawn earnings are included in a   
taxpayer's gross income. Section 72 further provides that a 10% penalty will    
apply to the income portion of any distribution. The penalty is not imposed on  
amounts received: (1) after the taxpayer reaches 59 1/2; (2) upon the death of  
the owner; (3) if the taxpayer is totally disabled as defined in Section        
72(m)(7) of the Code; (4) in a series of substantially equal periodic payments  
made at least annually for the life (or life expectancy) of the taxpayer or for 
the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the taxpayer and his            
beneficiary; (5) under an immediate annuity; or (6) which are allocable to      
premium payments made prior to August 14, 1982.                                 

With respect to (4) above, if the series of substantially equal periodic        
payments is modified before the later of your attaining age 59 1/2 or five years
from the date of the first periodic payment, then the tax for the year of the   
modification is increased by an amount equal to the tax which would have been   
imposed (the 10% penalty tax) but for the exception, plus interest for the tax  
years in which the exception was used.                                          

TAX-QUALIFIED CONTRACTS 

In the case of a withdrawal under a tax-qualified Contract, a ratable portion of
the amount received is taxable, generally based on the ratio of the individual's
cost basis to the individual's total accrued benefit under the retirement plan. 
Special tax rules may be available for certain distributions from a             
tax-qualified Contract. Section 72(t) of the Code imposes a 10% penalty tax on  
the taxable portion of any distribution from qualified retirement plans,        
including Contracts issued and qualified under Code Sections 401 (pension and   
profit sharing plans), 403(b) (tax-sheltered annuities), individual retirement  
accounts and annuities under 408(a) and (b) (IRAs) and Roth IRAs under 408A. To 
the extent amounts are not included in gross income because they have been      
rolled over to an IRA or to another eligible qualified plan, no tax penalty will
be imposed.                                                                     

The tax penalty will not apply to the following distributions: (1) distributions
made on or after the date on which the owner or annuitant (as applicable)       
reaches age 59 1/2; (2) distributions following the death or disability of the  
owner or annuitant (as applicable) (for this purpose "disability" is defined in 
Section 72(m)(7) of the Code); (3) upon separation from service after attainment
of age 55, distributions that are part of a series of substantially equal       
periodic payments made not less frequently than annually for the life (or life  
expectancy) of the owner or annuitant (as applicable) or the joint lives (or    
joint life expectancies) of such owner or annuitant (as applicable) and his or  
her designated beneficiary; (4) distributions to an owner or annuitant (as      
applicable) who has separated from service after he has attained age 55; (5)    
distributions made to the owner or annuitant (as applicable) to the extent such 
distributions do not exceed the amount allowable as a deduction under Code      
Section 213 to the owner or annuitant (as applicable) for amounts paid during   
the taxable year for medical care; (6) distributions made to an alternate payee 
pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order; (7) distributions made on     
account of an IRS levy upon the qualified Contracts; (8) distributions from an  
IRA after separation from employment for the purchase of medical insurance (as  
described in Section 213(d)(1)(D) of the Code) for the Contract owner or        
annuitant (as applicable) and his or her spouse and dependents if the Contract  
owner or annuitant (as applicable) has received unemployment compensation for at
least 12 weeks (this exception will no longer apply after the Contract owner or 
annuitant (as applicable) has been re-employed for at least 60 days); (9)       
distributions from an IRA made to the owner or annuitant (as applicable) to the 
extent such distributions do not exceed the qualified higher education expenses 
(as defined in Section 72(t)(7) of the Code) (as applicable) for the taxable    
year; and (10) distributions from an IRA made to the owner or annuitant (as     
applicable) which are qualified first time home buyer distributions (as defined 
in Section 72(t)(8) of the Code). The exceptions stated in items (4) and (6)    
above do not apply in the case of an IRA. The exception stated in (3) above     
applies to an IRA without the requirement that there be a separation from       
service.                                                                        

With respect to (3) above, if the series of substantially equal periodic        
payments is modified before the later of your attaining age 59 1/2 or five years
from the date of the first periodic payment, then the tax for the year of the   
modification is increased by an amount equal to the tax which would have been   
imposed (the 10% penalty tax) but for the exception, plus interest for the tax  
years in which the exception was used.                                          

Withdrawals of amounts attributable to contributions made pursuant to a salary  
reduction agreement (in accordance with Section 403(b)(11) of the Code) are     
limited to the following: when the owner attains age 59 1/2, severs employment, 
dies, becomes disabled (within the meaning of Section 72(m)(7) of the Code), or 
in the case of hardship. Hardship withdrawals do not include any earnings on    
salary reduction contributions. These limitations on withdrawals apply to: (1)  
salary reduction contributions made after December 31, 1988; (2) income         
attributable to such contributions; and (3) income attributable to amounts held 
as of December 31, 1988. The limitations on withdrawals do not affect rollovers 
or exchanges between certain tax-qualified plans. Tax penalties may also apply. 
While the foregoing limitations only apply to certain Contracts issued in       
connection with Section 403(b) plans, all owners should seek competent tax      
advice regarding any withdrawals or distributions.                              

The taxable portion of a withdrawal or distribution from tax-qualified Contracts
may, under some circumstances, be "rolled over" into another eligible plan so as
to continue to defer income tax on the taxable portion. Such treatment is       
available for an "eligible rollover distribution" made by certain types of plans
(as described above under "Taxes - Withholding Tax on Distributions") that is   
transferred within 60 days of receipt into another eligible plan or an IRA.     
Plans making such eligible rollover distributions are also required, with some  
exceptions specified in the Code, to provide for a direct transfer of the       
distribution to the transferee plan designated by the recipient.                

Amounts received from IRAs may also be rolled over into other IRAs or certain   
other plans, subject to limitations set forth in the Code.                      

Prior to the date that annuity payments begin under an annuity Contract, the    
required minimum distribution rules applicable to defined contribution plans and
IRAs will be used. Generally, distributions from a tax-qualified plan must      
commence no later than April 1 of the calendar year following the year in which 
the employee attains the later of age 70 1/2 or the date of retirement. In the  
case of an IRA, distributions must commence no later than April 1 of the        
calendar year following the year in which the owner attains age 70 1/2. Required
distributions from defined contribution plans and IRAs are determined by        
dividing the account balance by the appropriate distribution period found in a  
uniform lifetime distribution table set forth in IRS regulations. For this      
purpose, the entire interest under an annuity Contract is the account value     
under the Contract plus the actuarial value of any other benefits such as       
guaranteed death benefits that will be provided under the Contract.             

If the sole beneficiary is the Contract holder's or employee's spouse and the   
spouse is more than 10 years younger than the employee, a longer distribution   
period measured by the joint life and last survivor expectancy of the Contract  
holder employee and spouse is permitted to be used. Distributions under a       
defined benefit plan or an annuity Contract must be paid in the form of periodic
annuity payments for the employee's life (or the joint lives of the employee and
beneficiary) or over a period certain that does not exceed the period under the 
uniform lifetime table for the employee's age in the year in which the annuity  
starting date occurs. If the required minimum distributions are not made, a 50% 
penalty tax on the amount not distributed is imposed on the individual.         

TYPES OF TAX-QUALIFIED PLANS                                                    

The Contracts offered herein are designed to be suitable for use under various  
types of tax-qualified plans. Taxation of participants in each tax-qualified    
plan varies with the type of plan and terms and conditions of each specific     
plan. Owners, annuitants and beneficiaries are cautioned that benefits under a  
tax-qualified plan may be subject to the terms and conditions of the plan       
regardless of the terms and conditions of the Contracts issued pursuant to the  
plan. Some retirement plans are subject to distribution and other requirements  
that are not incorporated into Jackson National's administrative procedures.    
Jackson National is not bound by the terms and conditions of such plans to the  
extent such terms conflict with the terms of a Contract, unless Jackson National
specifically consents to be bound. Owners, annuitants and beneficiaries are     
responsible for determining that contributions, distributions and other         
transactions with respect to the Contracts comply with applicable law.          

A tax-qualified Contract will not provide any necessary or additional tax       
deferral if it is used to fund a tax-qualified plan that is tax deferred.       
However, the Contract has features and benefits other than tax deferral that may
make it an appropriate investment for a tax-qualified plan. Following are       
general descriptions of the types of tax-qualified plans with which the         
Contracts may be used. Such descriptions are not exhaustive and are for general 
informational purposes only. The tax rules regarding tax-qualified plans are    
very complex and will have differing applications depending on individual facts 
and circumstances. Each purchaser should obtain competent tax advice prior to   
purchasing a Contract issued under a tax-qualified plan.                        

Contracts issued pursuant to tax-qualified plans include special provisions     
restricting Contract provisions that may otherwise be available as described    
herein. Generally, Contracts issued pursuant to tax-qualified plans are not     
transferable except upon surrender or annuitization. Various penalty and excise 
taxes may apply to contributions or distributions made in violation of          
applicable limitations. Furthermore, certain withdrawal penalties and           
restrictions may apply to surrenders from Tax-Qualified Contracts. (See "Tax
Treatment of Withdrawals - Tax-Qualified Contracts" above.)                     

On July 6, 1983, the Supreme Court decided in ARIZONA GOVERNING COMMITTEE V.    
NORRIS that benefits provided under an employer's deferred compensation plan    
could not, under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, vary between men and
women. The Contracts sold by Jackson National in connection with certain        
Tax-Qualified Plans will utilize tables that do not differentiate on the basis  
of sex. Such annuity tables will also be available for use in connection with   
certain non-qualified deferred compensation plans.                              

(a) Tax-Sheltered Annuities                                   

   Section 403(b) of the Code permits the purchase of "tax-sheltered
      annuities" by public schools and certain charitable, educational and
      scientific organizations described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Code.
        These qualifying employers may make contributions to the Contracts for
        the benefit of their employees. Such contributions are not included in
the gross income of the employee until the employee receives  
     distributions from the Contract. The amount of contributions to the
     tax-sheltered annuity is limited to certain maximums imposed by the
Code. Furthermore, the Code sets forth additional restrictions
governing such items as transferability, distributions,       
    non-discrimination and withdrawals. Employee loans are not allowed
        under these Contracts. Any employee should obtain competent tax advice
as to the tax treatment and suitability of such an investment.

(b) Individual Retirement Annuities                           

       Section 408(b) of the Code permits eligible individuals to contribute
        to an individual retirement program known as an "individual retirement
         annuity" ("IRA annuity"). Under applicable limitations, certain amounts
       may be contributed to an IRA annuity that will be deductible from the
        individual's gross income. IRA annuities are subject to limitations on
         eligibility, contributions, transferability and distributions. Sales of
        IRA annuities are subject to special requirements imposed by the Code,
    including the requirement that certain informational disclosure be
        given to persons desiring to establish an IRA. Purchasers of Contracts
        to be qualified as IRA annuities should obtain competent tax advice as
to the tax treatment and suitability of such an investment.   

(c) Roth IRA Annuities                                        

   Section 408A of the Code provides that individuals may purchase a
   non-deductible IRA annuity, known as a Roth IRA annuity. Purchase
        payments for Roth IRA annuities are limited to a maximum of $2,000 per
        year and are not deductible from taxable income. The Economic Growth &
         Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (the "Act") increases the maximum
      annual dollar limitation limit for IRA contributions (including Roth
  IRA contributions) from $2,000 to $3,000 for calendar years 2002
       through 2004; $4,000 for calendar years 2005 through 2007; and $5,000
         for 2008. After 2008, the limit will be adjusted annually for inflation
        in $500 increments. In addition, the Act allows individuals age 50 and
    older to make additional catch-up IRA contributions. The otherwise
         maximum contribution limit (before application of adjusted gross income
        phase-out limits) for an individual who had celebrated his or her 50th
       birthday before the end of the tax year is increased by $500 for 2002
through 2005 and $1,000 for 2006 and later.                   

    Lower maximum limitations apply to individuals with adjusted gross
       incomes between $95,000 and $110,000 in the case of single taxpayers,
       between $150,000 and $160,000 in the case of married taxpayers filing
  joint returns, and between $0 and $10,000 in the case of married
taxpayers filing separately.                                  

    An overall $2,000 annual limitation (increased as discussed above)
      continues to apply to all of a taxpayer's IRA annuity contributions,
including Roth IRA annuities and non-Roth IRA annuities.      

       Qualified distributions from Roth IRA annuities are free from federal
       income tax. A qualified distribution requires that the individual has
     held the Roth IRA annuity for at least five years and, in addition,
       that the distribution is made either after the individual reaches age
    59 1/2, on the individual's death or disability, or as a qualified
      first-time home purchase, subject to a $10,000 lifetime maximum, for
the individual, a spouse, child, grandchild, or ancestor. Any 
     distribution that is not a qualified distribution is taxable to the
      extent of earnings in the distribution. Distributions are treated as
  made from contributions first and therefore no distributions are
       taxable until distributions exceed the amount of contributions to the
   Roth IRA annuity. The 10% penalty tax and the regular IRA annuity
       exceptions to the 10% penalty tax apply to taxable distributions from
Roth IRA annuities.                                           

      Amounts may be rolled over from one Roth IRA annuity to another Roth
IRA annuity. Furthermore, an individual may make a rollover   
        contribution from a non-Roth IRA annuity to a Roth IRA annuity, unless
the individual has adjusted gross income over $100,000 or the 
individual is a married taxpayer filing a separate return. The
        individual must pay tax on any portion of the IRA annuity being rolled
     over that would be included in income if the distributions were not
     rolled over. There are no similar limitations on rollovers from one
Roth IRA annuity to another Roth IRA annuity.                 

(d) Pension and Profit-Sharing Plans                          

      The Internal Revenue Code permits employers, including self-employed
       individuals, to establish various types of qualified retirement plans
      for employees. These retirement plans may permit the purchase of the
         Contracts to provide benefits under the plan. Contributions to the plan
       for the benefit of employees will not be included in the gross income
       of the employee until distributed from the plan. The tax consequences
        to owners may vary depending upon the particular plan design. However,
     the Code places limitations on all plans on such items as amount of
    allowable contributions; form, manner and timing of distributions;
   vesting and non-forfeitability of interests; nondiscrimination in
        eligibility and participation; and the tax treatment of distributions,
        transferability of benefits, withdrawals and surrenders. Purchasers of
      Contracts for use with pension or profit sharing plans should obtain
         competent tax advice as to the tax treatment and suitability of such an
investment.                                                   

(e) Eligible Deferred Compensation Plans - Section 457        

         Under Code provisions, employees and independent Contractors performing
services for state and local governments and other tax-exempt 
       organizations may participate in eligible deferred compensation plans
       under Section 457 of the Code. The amounts deferred under a Plan that
      meets the requirements of Section 457 of the Code are not taxable as
         income to the participant until paid or otherwise made available to the
        participant or beneficiary. As a general rule, the maximum amount that
can be deferred in any one year is the lesser of 100% of the  
participant's includible compensation or the elective deferral
        limitation. The Act increases the dollar limit on deferrals to conform
 to the elective deferral limitation. The Act also increases the
       elective deferral limitation to $11,000 for 2002 and in $1,000 annual
      increments thereafter until it reaches $15,000 in 2006. The limit is
       indexed for inflation after that in $500 increments. In addition, the
         Act allows individuals in eligible deferred compensation plans of state
   or local governments age 50 and older to make additional catch-up
contributions. The otherwise maximum contribution limit for an
       individual who had celebrated his or her 50th birthday before the end
   of the tax year is increased by $1,000 for 2002 and by additional
        $1,000 increments through 2006, when the catch-up contribution will be
$5,000.                                                       

         The same contribution and catch-up contributions are also available for
participants in qualified pension and profit-sharing plans and
tax-sheltered annuities under Section 403(b) of the Code.     

        In limited circumstances, the plan may provide for additional catch-up
        contributions in each of the last three years before normal retirement
 age. Furthermore, the Code provides additional requirements and
restrictions regarding eligibility and distributions.         

        All of the assets and income of an eligible deferred compensation plan
      established by a governmental employer must be held in trust for the
     exclusive benefit of participants and their beneficiaries. For this
       purpose, custodial accounts and certain annuity Contracts are treated
         as trusts. The requirement of a trust does not apply to amounts under a
    Plan of a tax-exempt (non-governmental) employer. In addition, the
    requirement of a trust does not apply to amounts under a Plan of a
      governmental employer if the Plan is not an eligible plan within the
        meaning of Section 457(b) of the Code. In the absence of such a trust,
        amounts under the plan will be subject to the claims of the employer's
general creditors.                                            

        In general, distributions from a Plan are prohibited under Section 457
of the Code unless made after the participant:                

*     attains age 70 1/2,                                     

*     severs employment,                                      

*     dies, or                                                

      *     suffers an unforeseeable financial emergency as defined in the
regulations.                                      

Under present federal tax law, amounts accumulated in a Plan of a tax-exempt    
(non-governmental) employer under Section 457 of the Code cannot be transferred 
or rolled over on a tax-deferred basis except for certain transfers to other    
Plans under Section 457. Amounts accumulated in a Plan of a state or local      
government employer may be transferred or rolled over to another eligible       
deferred compensation plan of a state or local government, an IRA, a qualified  
pension or profit-sharing plan or a tax-sheltered annuity under Section 403(b)  
of the Code.                                                                    

ANNUITY PROVISIONS                                                              
VARIABLE ANNUITY PAYMENT                                                        

The initial annuity payment is determined by taking the Contract value allocated
to that Investment Division, less any premium tax and any applicable Contract   
charges, and then applying it to the income option table specified in the       
Contract. The appropriate rate must be determined by the sex (except where, as  
in the case of certain Qualified Plans and other employer-sponsored retirement  
plans, such classification is not permitted) and age of the annuitant and       
designated second person, if any.                                               

The dollars applied are divided by 1,000 and the result multiplied by the       
appropriate annuity factor appearing in the table to compute the amount of the  
first monthly payment. That amount is divided by the value of an annuity unit as
of the Income Date to establish the number of annuity units representing each   
variable payment. The number of annuity units determined for the first variable 
payment remains constant for the second and subsequent monthly variable         
payments, assuming that no reallocation of Contract values is made.             

The amount of the second and each subsequent monthly variable payment is        
determined by multiplying the number of annuity units by the annuity unit value 
as of the business day next preceding the date on which each payment is due.    

The mortality and expense experience will not adversely affect the dollar amount
of the variable annuity payments once payments have commenced.                  

ANNUITY UNIT VALUE                                                              

The initial value of an annuity unit of each Investment Division was set when   
the Investment Divisions were established. The value may increase or decrease   
from one business day to the next. The income option tables contained in the    
Contract are based on an assumed investment rate of 3% for option 4 or 4.5% for 
option 1-3.                                                                     

The value of a fixed number of annuity units will reflect the investment        
performance of the Investment Divisions elected, and the amount of each payment 
will vary accordingly.                                                          

For each Investment Division, the value of an annuity unit for any business day 
is determined by multiplying the annuity unit value for the immediately         
preceding business day by the percentage change in the value of an accumulation 
unit from the immediately preceding business day to the business day of         
valuation, calculated by use of the Net Investment Factor, described below. The 
result is then multiplied by a second factor which offsets the effect of the    
assumed net investment rate of 3% for option 4 or 4.5% for option 1-3.          

NET INVESTMENT FACTOR                                                           

The net investment factor is an index applied to measure the net investment     
performance of an Investment Division from one valuation date to the next. The  
net investment factor for any Investment Division for any valuation period      
during the accumulation and annuity phases is determined by dividing (a) by (b) 
and then subtracting (c) from the result where:                                 

(a)  is the net result of:                                            

          (1)  the net  asset  value of a Fund's  share  held in the  Investment
               Division  determined as of the  valuation  date at the end of the
valuation period, plus                            

          (2)  the per  share  amount  of any  dividend  or  other  distribution
               declared by the Fund if the "ex-dividend"  date occurs during the
valuation period, plus or minus                   

          (3)  a per share  credit or charge  with  respect to any taxes paid or
               reserved  for by Jackson  National  during the  valuation  period
               which are determined by Jackson  National to be  attributable  to
               the operation of the Investment Division (no federal income taxes
are applicable under present law);                

     (b)  is the net  asset  value  of the  Fund  share  held in the  Investment
          Division  determined  as of  the  valuation  date  at  the  end of the
preceding valuation period; and                             

     (c)  is the asset  charge  factor  determined  by Jackson  National for the
          valuation period to reflect the asset-based charges (the mortality and
          expense  risk  charge),  administration  charge,  and  any  applicable
charges for optional benefits.

Item 27.         Not applicable.

Item 28.         Indemnification                                                

Provision is made in the Company's Amended By-Laws for indemnification by the   
Company of any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party 
to a civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action by reason of the   
fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of the Company, 
against expenses, including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines and amounts paid  
in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with
such action, suit or proceedings, to the extent and under the circumstances     
permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Michigan.              

Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of  
1933 ("Act") may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of 
the Company pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the Company has 
been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such 
indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is,        
therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against 
liabilities (other than the payment by the Company of expenses incurred or paid 
by a director, officer or controlling person of the Company in the successful   
defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer
or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the   
Company will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled  
by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the     
question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as         
expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such     
issue.

THIS SUPPLEMENT  UPDATES THE  PROSPECTUS.  PLEASE READ AND KEEP IT TOGETHER WITH
YOUR COPY OF THE PROSPECTUS FOR FUTURE REFERENCE.





> Under  ACCESS  TO YOUR  MONEY,  with  the  subsection  entitled  "5% FOR  LIFE
GUARANTEED MINIMUM WITHDRAWAL BENEFIT WITH BONUS AND ANNUAL STEP-UP  ("LIFEGUARD
ADVANTAGE"),"  please replace the text box within the BONUS  subsection with the
following.




The  bonus  equals 6% (5% if this  GMWB is added to the  Contract  PRIOR TO
APRIL  30,  2007)  and is based on a sum that may vary  after  this GMWB is
added to the Contract (the "Bonus Base"), as described immediately below.


>    WHEN THIS GMWB IS ADDED TO THE  CONTRACT,  the Bonus  Base  equals the


GWB.



>    WITH A WITHDRAWAL,  if that withdrawal,  and all prior  withdrawals in
the  current  Contract  Year,  exceeds the greater of the GAWA and the
RMD,  as  applicable,  then the Bonus Base is set to the lesser of the
GWB after, and the Bonus Base before, the withdrawal. Otherwise, there
is no adjustment to the Bonus Base with withdrawals.


>    All withdrawals count, including:  systematic  withdrawals;  RMDs
for  certain  tax-qualified   Contracts;   withdrawals  of  asset








     allocation  and advisory  fees;  and free  withdrawals  under the
     Contract.

>    A withdrawal in a Contract Year during the Bonus Period  (defined
     below) precludes a bonus for that Contract Year.








>    WITH A PREMIUM PAYMENT, the Bonus Base increases by the amount of
the premium net of any applicable premium taxes.



>    WITH ANY STEP-UP (IF THE GWB INCREASES UPON  STEP-UP),  the Bonus




Base is set to the  greater of the GWB after,  and the Bonus Base
before, the Step-Up.



THE BONUS BASE CAN NEVER BE MORE THAN $5 MILLION.



The Bonus is available for a limited time (the "Bonus  Period").  The Bonus
Period  runs from the date this GMWB is added to the  Contract  through the
earliest of:


>    The tenth  Contract  Anniversary  after the effective date of the
endorsement;


>    The Contract Anniversary on or immediately  following the Owner's
(if joint Owners, the oldest Owner's) 81st birthday; or


>    The date Contract Value is zero.


Spousal continuation of a Contract with this GMWB does not affect the Bonus
Period; Contract Anniversaries are based on the Contract's Issue Date.


The bonus is  applied  at the end of each  Contract  Year  during the Bonus
Period,  if there have been no withdrawals  during that Contract Year. When
the bonus is applied:


>    The GWB is  recalculated,  increasing  by 6% (5% if this  GMWB is
added to the Contract PRIOR TO APRIL 30, 2007) of the Bonus Base.


>    The GAWA is then recalculated,  equaling the greater of 5% of the
new GWB and the GAWA before the bonus.


Applying the bonus to the GWB does not affect the Bonus Base.




> Under APPENDIX C, please replace Example 8 with the following.


EXAMPLE 8: UPON  APPLICATION  OF THE GUARANTEED  WITHDRAWAL  BALANCE BONUS,
YOUR GWB AND GAWA ARE  RE-DETERMINED.  (THIS  EXAMPLE  ONLY APPLIES IF YOUR
ENDORSEMENT CONTAINS A GUARANTEED WITHDRAWAL BALANCE BONUS PROVISION.)


>    Example  8a: If at the end of a  Contract  Year in which you have
taken no  withdrawals,  your GWB is  $100,000,  your bonus is 6%,
your bonus base is $100,000, and your GAWA is $5,000:

>    Your new GWB is  recalculated  to equal  $106,000,  which is
equal to your GWB plus 6% of your  bonus  base  ($100,000  +
$100,000*0.06 = $106,000).

>    Your GAWA for the next year is recalculated to equal $5,300,
which  is  the   greater  of  1)  your  GAWA  prior  to  the
application  of the bonus  ($5,000) or 2) 5% of your new GWB
($106,000*0.05 = $5,300).

>    After the application of the bonus, if you continued to take
annual  withdrawals  equal to your  GAWA,  it would  take an








additional  20 years to deplete your GWB  ($106,000 / $5,300
per year = 20  years),  provided  that  there are no further
adjustments  made to  your  GWB or your  GAWA  (besides  the








annual   reduction   of  your  GWB  by  the  amount  of  the
withdrawal)  and that the withdrawals are taken prior to the
Latest Income Date.  However, if you have elected a For Life
GMWB and the For Life  Guarantee  is in effect,  withdrawals
equal to your GAWA could  continue for the rest of your life








(or in the case of Joint  Owners,  until the first  death of
the Joint  Owners  or until the death of the last  surviving
Covered  Life if your  endorsement  is a For Life  GMWB with
Joint  Option),  even  beyond  20 years,  provided  that the








withdrawals are taken prior to the Latest Income Date.
>    Example  8b: If at the end of a  Contract  Year in which you have
taken no withdrawals, your GWB is $90,000, your bonus is 6%, your
bonus base is $100,000, and your GAWA is $5,000:

>    Your  new GWB is  recalculated  to equal  $96,000,  which is
equal to your  GWB plus 6% of your  bonus  base  ($90,000  +
$100,000*0.06 = $96,000).

>    Your GAWA for the next  year  remains  $5,000,  which is the
greater  of 1) your  GAWA  prior to the  application  of the
bonus  ($5,000)  or 2) 5% of your  new GWB  ($96,000*0.05  =
$4,800).

>    After the application of the bonus, if you continued to take
annual  withdrawals  equal to your  GAWA,  it would  take an
additional  20 years to deplete  your GWB  ($96,000 / $5,000
per year = 20  years),  provided  that  there are no further
adjustments  made to  your  GWB or your  GAWA  (besides  the
annual   reduction   of  your  GWB  by  the  amount  of  the
withdrawal)  and that the withdrawals are taken prior to the
Latest Income Date.  However, if you have elected a For Life
GMWB and the For Life  Guarantee  is in effect,  withdrawals
equal to your GAWA could  continue for the rest of your life








(or in the case of Joint  Owners,  until the first  death of
the Joint  Owners  or until the death of the last  surviving
Covered  Life if your  endorsement  is a For Life  GMWB with
Joint  Option),  even  beyond  20 years,  provided  that the








withdrawals are taken prior to the Latest Income Date.
>    Notes:

>    Your bonus base is not recalculated  upon the application of
the bonus to your GWB.

Item 28. Indemnification



Provision is made in the Company's Amended By-Laws for indemnification by the
Company of any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party
to a civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action by reason of the
fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of the Company,
against expenses, including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines and amounts paid
in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with
such action, suit or proceedings, to the extent and under the circumstances
permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Michigan.


Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of
1933 ("Act") may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of
the Company pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the Company has
been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such
indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is,
therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against
liabilities (other than the payment by the Company of expenses incurred or paid
by a director, officer or controlling person of the Company in the successful
defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer
or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the
Company will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled
by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the
question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as
expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such
issue.

Registration Statement on Form N-4 for the Individual Fixed and Variable Annuity
Contracts (the "Contracts") to be issued by Jackson National Life Insurance
Company and its separate account, Jackson National Separate Account - I.


We have made such examination of the law and have examined such records and
documents as in our judgment are necessary or appropriate to enable us to render
the opinions expressed below.


We are of the following opinions:


1.        Jackson National Separate Account - I is a Unit Investment Trust as
that term is defined in Section 4(2) of the Investment Company Act of
1940 (the "Act"), and is currently registered with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, pursuant to Section 8(a) of the Act.


2.        Upon the acceptance of premiums made by an Owner pursuant to a
Contract issued in accordance with the Prospectus contained in the
Registration Statement and upon compliance with applicable law, such
an Owner will have a legally issued, fully paid, non-assessable
contractual interest under such Contract.


You may use this opinion letter, or a copy thereof, as an exhibit to the
Post-Effective Amendment No. 31 to the Registration Statement.


Sincerely,



ANTHONY L. DOWLING
