(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  This information should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report (the "Report"). The discussion and analysis which follows may contain trend analysis and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 which reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial results. Words such as "anticipate," "expect," "intend," "plan," "believe," "seek," "outlook" and "estimate," as well as similar words and phrases, signify forward-looking statements. Teucrium Commodity Trust's (the "Trust's") forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future results and conditions, and important factors, risks and uncertainties may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in our forward-looking statements.  You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. Except as expressly required by the Federal securities laws, Teucrium Trading, LLC (the "Sponsor") undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements or the risks, uncertainties or other factors described in this Report, as a result of new information, future events or changed circumstances or for any other reason after the date of this Report.  Overview/Introduction  Teucrium Commodity Trust ("Trust"), a Delaware statutory trust organized on September 11, 2009, is a series trust consisting of five series: Teucrium Corn Fund ("CORN"), Teucrium Sugar Fund ("CANE"), Teucrium Soybean Fund ("SOYB"), Teucrium Wheat Fund ("WEAT"), and Teucrium Agricultural Fund ("TAGS"). All of the series of the Trust are collectively referred to as the "Funds" and singularly as the "Fund." Each Fund is a commodity pool that is a series of the Trust. The Funds issue common units, called the "Shares," representing fractional undivided beneficial interests in a Fund. The Trust and the Funds operate pursuant to the Trust's Second Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust and Trust Agreement (the "Trust Agreement").  On June 5, 2010, the initial Form S-1 for CORN was declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). On June 8, 2010, four Creation Baskets for CORN were issued representing 200,000 shares and $5,000,000. CORN began trading on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") Arca on June 9, 2010. The current registration statement for CORN was declared effective by the SEC on April 29, 2016.  On June 17, 2011, the initial Forms S-1 for CANE, SOYB, and WEAT were declared effective by the SEC. On September 16, 2011, two Creation Baskets were issued for each Fund, representing 100,000 shares and $2,500,000, for CANE, SOYB, and WEAT. On September 19, 2011, CANE, SOYB, and WEAT started trading on the NYSE Arca. The current registration statements for CANE and SOYB were declared effective by the SEC on May 1, 2017. The current registration statement for WEAT was declared effective on July 15, 2016. This registration statement for WEAT registered an additional 24,050,000 shares.  On February 10, 2012, the Form S-1 for TAGS was declared effective by the SEC. On March 27, 2012, six Creation Baskets for TAGS were issued representing 300,000 shares and $15,000,000. TAGS began trading on the NYSE Arca on March 28, 2012. The current registration statement for TAGS was declared effective by the SEC on April 30, 2015.  The Funds are designed and managed so that the daily changes in percentage terms of the Shares' Net Asset Value ("NAV") reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of a weighted average of the closing settlement prices for specific futures contracts on designated commodities (each, a "Designated Commodity") or the closing Net Asset Value per share of the Underlying Funds (as defined below) in the case of TAGS. Each Fund pursues its investment objective by investing in a portfolio of exchange-traded futures contracts (each, a "Futures Contract") that expire in a specific month and trade on a specific exchange in the Specified Commodity comprising the Benchmark, as defined below or shares of the Underlying Funds in the case of TAGS. Each Fund also holds United States Treasury Obligations and/or other high credit quality short-term fixed income securities for deposit with the commodity broker of the Funds as margin.  The Investment Objective of the Funds  The investment objective of CORN is to have the daily changes in percentage terms of the Shares' NAV reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of a weighted average of the closing settlement prices for three futures contracts for corn ("Corn Futures Contracts") that are traded on the Chicago Board of Trade ("CBOT"), specifically (1) the second-to-expire CBOT Corn Futures Contract, weighted 35%, (2) the third-to-expire CBOT Corn Futures Contract, weighted 30%, and (3) the CBOT Corn Futures Contract expiring in the December following the expiration month of the third-to-expire contract, weighted 35%.  The investment objective of SOYB is to have the daily changes in percentage terms of the Shares' NAV reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of a weighted average of the closing settlement prices for three futures contracts for soybeans ("Soybean Futures Contracts") that are traded on the CBOT. The three Soybean Futures Contracts will be: (1) second-to-expire CBOT Soybean Futures Contract, weighted 35%, (2) the third-to-expire CBOT Soybean Futures Contract, weighted 30%, and (3) the CBOT Soybean Futures Contract expiring in the November following the expiration month of the third-to-expire contract, weighted 35%.  The investment objective of CANE is to have the daily changes in percentage terms of the Shares' NAV reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of a weighted average of the closing settlement prices for three futures contracts for sugar ("Sugar Futures Contracts") that are traded on ICE Futures US ("ICE Futures"), specifically: (1) the second-to-expire Sugar No. 11 Futures Contract (a "Sugar No. 11 Futures Contract"), weighted 35%, (2) the third-to-expire Sugar No. 11 Futures Contract, weighted 30%, and (3) the Sugar No. 11 Futures Contract expiring in the March following the expiration month of the third-to-expire contract, weighted 35%.  The investment objective of WEAT is to have the daily changes in percentage terms of the Shares' NAV reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of a weighted average of the closing settlement prices for three futures contracts for wheat ("Wheat Futures Contracts") that are traded on the CBOT, specifically:  The investment objective of the TAGS is to have the daily changes in percentage terms of the NAV of its Shares reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of a weighted average (the "Underlying Fund Average") of the NAVs per share of four other commodity pools that are series of the Trust and are sponsored by the Sponsor: the Teucrium Corn Fund, the Teucrium Wheat Fund, the Teucrium Soybean Fund and the Teucrium Sugar Fund (collectively, the "Underlying Funds"). The Underlying Fund Average will have a weighting of 25% to each Underlying Fund, and the Fund's assets will be rebalanced, generally on a daily basis, to maintain the approximate 25% allocation to each Underlying Fund.  This weighted average of the referenced specific Futures Contracts for each Fund is referred to herein as the "Benchmark," and the specific Futures Contracts that at any given time make up the Benchmark for that Fund and are referred to herein as the "Benchmark Component Futures Contracts."  The notional amount of each Benchmark Component Futures Contract included in each Benchmark is intended to reflect the changes in market value of each such Benchmark Component Futures Contract within the Benchmark. The closing level of each Benchmark is calculated on each business day by U.S. Bancorp Fund Services, LLC (the "Administrator") based on the closing price of the futures contracts for each of the underlying Benchmark Component Futures Contracts and the notional amounts of such Benchmark Component Futures Contracts.  Each Benchmark is rebalanced periodically to ensure that each of the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts is weighted in the same proportion as in the investment objective for each Fund. The following tables reflect the March 31, 2017, Benchmark Component Futures Contracts weights for each of the Funds, the contract held is identified by the generally accepted nomenclature of contract month and year, which may differ from the month in which the contract expires:  CORN Benchmark Component Futures Contracts Notional Value Weight (%) CBOT Corn Futures (1,297 contracts, JUL17) $ 24,107,988 35 % CBOT Corn Futures (1,091 contracts, SEP17) 20,688,087 30 CBOT Corn Futures (1,246 contracts, DEC17) 24,187,975 35 Total at March 31, 2017 $ 68,984,050 100 % SOYB Benchmark Component Futures Contracts Notional Value Weight (%) CBOT Soybean Futures (79 contracts, JUL17) $ 3,780,150 35 % CBOT Soybean Futures (68 contracts, NOV17) 3,243,600 30 CBOT Soybean Futures (81 contracts, NOV18) 3,832,313 35 Total at March 31, 2017 $ 10,856,063 100 % CANE Benchmark Component Futures Contracts Notional Value Weight (%) ICE Sugar Futures (81 contracts, JUL17) $ 1,531,354 35 % ICE Sugar Futures (69 contracts, OCT17) 1,322,261 30 ICE Sugar Futures (79 contracts, MAR18) 1,559,902 35 Total at March 31, 2017 $ 4,413,517 100 % WEAT Benchmark Component Futures Contracts Notional Value Weight (%) CBOT Wheat Futures (980 contracts, JUL17) $ 21,511,000 35 % CBOT Wheat Futures (813 contracts, SEP17) 18,434,775 30 CBOT Wheat Futures (911 contracts, DEC17) 21,579,313 35 Total at March 31, 2017 $ 61,525,088 100 % TAGS Benchmark Component Futures Contracts Fair Value Weight (%) Shares of Teucrium Corn Fund (17,308 shares) $ 329,072 26 % Shares of Teucrium Soybean Fund (17,531 shares) 317,574 25 Shares of Teucrium Wheat Fund (45,787 shares) 317,199 25 Shares of Teucrium Sugar Fund (26,274 shares) 309,875 24 Total at March 31, 2017 $ 1,273,720 100 %  The price relationship between the near month Futures Contract to expire and the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts will vary and may impact both the total return of each Fund over time and the degree to which such total return tracks the total return of the price indices related to the commodity of each Fund. In cases in which the near month contract's price is lower than later-expiring contracts' prices (a situation known as "contango" in the futures markets), then absent the impact of the overall movement in commodity prices the value of the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts would tend to decline as they approach expiration. In cases in which the near month contract's price is higher than later-expiring contracts' prices (a situation known as "backwardation" in the futures markets), then absent the impact of the overall movement in a Fund's prices the value of the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts would tend to rise as they approach expiration, all other things being equal.  The total portfolio composition for each Fund is disclosed each business day that the NYSE Arca is open for trading on the Fund's website. The website for CORN is www.teucriumcornfund.com; for CANE is www.teucriumcanefund.com; for SOYB is www.teucriumsoybfund.com; for WEAT is www.teucriumweatfund.com; for TAGS is www.teucriumtagsfund.com. These sites are accessible at no charge. The website disclosure of portfolio holdings is made daily and includes, as applicable, the name and value of each Futures Contract, Other Commodity Interest and the amount of cash and cash equivalents held in the Fund's portfolio. The specific types of Other Commodity Interests (in addition to futures contracts, options on futures contracts and derivative contracts) that are tied to various commodities are entered into outside of public exchanges. These "over-the-counter" contracts are entered into between two parties in private contracts, or on a recently formed swap execution facility ("SEF") for standardized swaps. For example, unlike Futures Contracts, which are guaranteed by a clearing organization, each party to an over-the-counter derivative contract bears the credit risk of the other party (unless such over-the-counter swap is cleared through a derivatives clearing organization ("DCO")), i.e., the risk that the other party will not be able to perform its obligations under its contract, and characteristics of such Other Commodity Interests.  Consistent with achieving a Fund's investment objective of closely tracking the Benchmark, the Sponsor may for certain reasons cause the Fund to enter into or hold Futures Contracts other than the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts and/or Other Commodity Interests. Other Commodity Interests that do not have standardized terms and are not exchange-traded, referred to as "over-the-counter" Corn Interests, can generally be structured as the parties to the Corn Interest contract desire. Therefore, each Fund might enter into multiple and/or over-the-counter Interests intended to replicate the performance of each of the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts for the Fund, or a single over-the-counter Interest designed to replicate the performance of the Benchmark as a whole. Assuming that there is no default by a counterparty to an over-the-counter Interest, the performance of the Interest will necessarily correlate with the performance of the Benchmark or the applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contract. Each Fund might also enter into or hold Interests other than Benchmark Component Futures Contracts to facilitate effective trading, consistent with the discussion of the Fund's "roll" strategy. In addition, each Fund might enter into or hold Interests that would be expected to alleviate overall deviation between the Fund's performance and that of the Benchmark that may result from certain market and trading inefficiencies or other reasons. By utilizing certain or all of the investments described above, the Sponsor will endeavor to cause the Fund's performance to closely track that of the Benchmark of the Fund.  An "exchange for related position" ("EFRP") can be used by the Fund as a technique to facilitate the exchanging of a futures hedge position against a creation or redemption order, and thus the Fund may use an EFRP transaction in connection with the creation and redemption of shares. The market specialist/market maker that is the ultimate purchaser or seller of shares in connection with the creation or redemption basket, respectively, agrees to sell or purchase a corresponding offsetting futures position which is then settled on the same business day as a cleared futures transaction by the FCMs. The Fund will become subject to the credit risk of the market specialist/market maker until the EFRP is settled within the business day, which is typically 7 hours or less. The Fund reports all activity related to EFRP transactions under the procedures and guidelines of the CFTC and the exchanges on which the futures are traded.  The Funds earn interest income from the Treasury securities and/or cash equivalents that it purchases and on the cash it holds through the Custodian or other financial institution. The Sponsor anticipates that the earned interest income will increase the NAV of each Fund. The Funds apply the earned interest income to the acquisition of additional investments or uses it to pay its expenses. If the Fund reinvests the earned interest income, it makes investments that are consistent with its investment objectives. Any Treasury security and cash equivalent invested by a Fund will have original maturity dates of three months or less at inception. Any cash equivalents invested by a Fund will be rated in the highest short-term rating category by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization or will be deemed by the Sponsor to be of comparable quality. At the end of the quarter, available cash balances in each of the Funds were invested in either the Fidelity Institutional Money Market Funds - Government Portfolio or in demand deposits at Rabobank, N.A.  In managing the assets of the Funds, the Sponsor does not use a technical trading system that automatically issues buy and sell orders. Instead, the Sponsor will purchase or sell the specific underlying Commodity Interests with an aggregate market value that approximates the amount of cash received or paid upon the purchase or redemption of Shares.  The Sponsor does not anticipate letting the commodity Futures Contracts of any Fund expire, thus taking delivery of the underlying commodity. Instead, the Sponsor will close out existing positions, for instance, in response to ongoing changes in the Benchmark or if it otherwise determines it would be appropriate to do so and reinvest the proceeds in new Commodity Interests. Positions may also be closed out to meet redemption orders, in which case the proceeds from closing the positions will not be reinvested.  The Sponsor employs a "neutral" investment strategy intended to track the changes in the Benchmark of each Fund regardless of whether the Benchmark goes up or goes down. The Fund's "neutral" investment strategy is designed to permit investors generally to purchase and sell the Fund's Shares for the purpose of investing indirectly in the commodity-specific market in a cost-effective manner. Such investors may include participants in the specific industry and other industries seeking to hedge the risk of losses in their commodity-specific-related transactions, as well as investors seeking exposure to that commodity market. Accordingly, depending on the investment objective of an individual investor, the risks generally associated with investing in the commodity-specific market and/or the risks involved in hedging may exist. In addition, an investment in a Fund involves the risks that the changes in the price of the Fund's Shares will not accurately track the changes in the Benchmark, and that changes in the Benchmark will not closely correlate with changes in the price of the commodity on the spot market. The Sponsor does not intend to operate each Fund in a fashion such that its per share NAV equals, in dollar terms, the spot price of the commodity or the price of any particular commodity-specific Futures Contract.  The Sponsor  Teucrium Trading, LLC is the sponsor of the Trust and each of the series of the Trust. The Sponsor is a Delaware limited liability company, formed on July 28, 2009. The principal office is located at 232 Hidden Lake Road, Brattleboro, Vermont 05301. The Sponsor is registered as a commodity pool operator ("CPO") with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC") and became a member of the National Futures Association ("NFA") on November 10, 2009. The Trust and the Funds operate pursuant to the Trust Agreement.  Under the Trust Agreement, the Sponsor is solely responsible for the management, and conducts or directs the conduct of the business of the Trust, the Funds, and any other Fund that may from time to time be established and designated by the Sponsor. The Sponsor is required to oversee the purchase and sale of Shares by firms designated as "Authorized Purchasers" and to manage the Funds' investments, including to evaluate the credit risk of futures commission merchants and swap counterparties and to review daily positions and margin/collateral requirements. The Sponsor has the power to enter into agreements as may be necessary or appropriate for the offer and sale of the Funds' Shares and the conduct of the Trust's activities. Accordingly, the Sponsor is responsible for selecting the Trustee, Administrator, Distributor, the independent registered public accounting firm of the Trust, and any legal counsel employed by the Trust. The Sponsor is also responsible for preparing and filing periodic reports on behalf of the Trust with the SEC and providing any required certification for such reports. No person other than the Sponsor and its principals was involved in the organization of the Trust or the Funds.  Teucrium Trading, LLC designs the Funds to offer liquidity, transparency, and capacity in single-commodity investing for a variety of investors, including institutions and individuals, in an exchange-traded product format. The Funds have also been designed to mitigate the impacts of contango and backwardation, situations that can occur in the course of commodity trading which can affect the potential returns to investors. Backwardation is defined as a market condition in which a futures price of a commodity is lower in the distant delivery months than in the near delivery months, while contango, the opposite of backwardation, is defined as a condition in which distant delivery prices for futures exceed spot prices, often due to the costs of storing and insuring the underlying commodity.  The Sponsor has a patent on certain business methods and procedures used with respect to the Funds.  Performance Summary  This report covers the periods from January 1 to March 31, 2017 for each Fund. Total expenses are presented both gross and net of any expenses waived or paid by the Sponsor that would have been incurred by the Funds ("expenses waived by the Sponsor").

Results of Operations  The following includes a section for each Fund of the Trust.  The discussion below addresses the material changes in the results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016. The following includes a section for each Fund of the Trust for the periods in which each Fund was in operation. CORN, SOYB, WEAT, CANE and TAGS each operated for the entirety of all periods.  Total expenses for the current and comparative periods are presented both gross and net of any expenses waived or paid by the Sponsor that would have been incurred by the Funds ("expenses waived by the Sponsor"). For all expenses waived in 2016 and 2017, the Sponsor has determined that no reimbursement will be sought in future periods. "Total expenses, net" is after the impact of any expenses waived by the Sponsor, are presented in the same manner as previously reported. There is, therefore, no impact to or change in the Net gain or Net loss in any period for the Trust and each Fund as a result of this change in presentation.  The Sponsor is responsible for investing the assets of the Fund in accordance with the objectives and policies of the Fund. In addition, the Sponsor arranges for one or more third parties to provide administrative, custodial, accounting, transfer agency and other necessary services to the Fund, including services directly attributable to the Fund such as accounting, financial reporting, regulatory compliance and trading activities, which the Sponsor elected not to outsource. In addition, the Funds, except for TAGS which has no such fee, are contractually obligated to pay a monthly management fee to the Sponsor, based on average daily net assets, at a rate equal to 1.00% per annum.  . . .

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto of the Teucrium Commodity Trust and all of the Funds which are series of the Trust included elsewhere in the annual report on Form 10-K.  This annual report on Form 10-K, including this "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," contains forward-looking statements by terminology such as "may," "will," "should," "expect," "plan," "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "predict," "potential" or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. All statements (other than statements of historical fact) included in this filing that address activities, events or developments that will or may occur in the future, including such matters as movements in the commodities markets and indexes that track such movements, operations of the Funds, the Sponsor's plans and references to the future  success of a Fund or the Funds and other similar matters, are forward-looking statements. These statements are only predictions. Actual events or results may differ materially.  These statements are based upon certain assumptions and analyses the Sponsor has made based on its perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors appropriate in the circumstances. Whether or not actual results and developments will conform to the Sponsor's expectations and predictions, however, is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including the special considerations discussed in this prospectus, general economic, market and business conditions, changes in laws or regulations, including those concerning taxes, made by governmental authorities or regulatory bodies, and other world economic and political developments. Consequently, all the forward-looking statements made in this filing are qualified by these cautionary statements, and there can be no assurance that actual results or developments the Sponsor anticipates will be realized or, even if substantially realized, that they will result in the expected consequences to, or have the expected effects on, the operations of the Funds or the value of the Shares of the Funds.  Trust Overview  The business and operations of the Trust and each Fund are described above under Part I, Item I entitled "Business."  Critical Accounting Policies  The Trust's critical accounting policies for all the Funds are as follows:  1. Preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally-accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") requires the application of appropriate accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates, and requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expense and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities during the reporting period of the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The Trust's application of these policies involves judgments and actual results may differ from the estimates used.  2. The Sponsor has determined that the valuation of Commodity Interests that are not traded on a U.S. or internationally recognized futures exchange (such as swaps and other over-the-counter contracts) involves a critical accounting policy. The values which are used by the Funds for futures contracts will be provided by the commodity broker who will use market prices when available, while over-the-counter contracts will be valued based on the present value of estimated future cash flows that would be received from or paid to a third party in settlement of these derivative contracts prior to their delivery date. Values will be determined on a daily basis.  3. Commodity futures contracts held by the Funds are recorded on the trade date. All such transactions are recorded on the identified cost basis and marked to market daily. Unrealized appreciation or depreciation on commodity futures contracts are reflected in the statement of operations as the difference between the original contract amount and the fair market value as of the last business day of the year or as of the last date of the financial statements. Changes in the appreciation or depreciation between periods are reflected in the statement of operations. Interest on cash equivalents and deposits with the Futures Commission Merchant are recognized on the accrual basis. The Funds earn interest on its assets denominated in U.S. dollars on deposit with the Futures Commission Merchant at a rate equal to 85% of the overnight of Federal Funds Rate. In addition, the Funds earn interest on funds held at the custodian or other financial institution at prevailing market rates for such investments.  4. Cash equivalents are highly-liquid investments with original maturity dates of three months or less at inception. The Funds reported cash equivalents in the statements of assets and liabilities at market value, or at carrying amounts that approximate fair value, because of their highly-liquid nature and short-term maturities. The Funds have a substantial portion of its assets on deposit with banks. Assets deposited with the bank may, at times, exceed federally insured limits.  5. The use of fair value to measure financial instruments, with related unrealized gains or losses recognized in earnings in each period is fundamental to the Trust's financial statements. In accordance with GAAP, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the "exit price") in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  In determining fair value, the Trust uses various valuation approaches. In accordance with GAAP, a fair value hierarchy for inputs is used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Trust. Unobservable inputs reflect the Trust's assumptions about the inputs market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. The fair value hierarchy is categorized into three levels: a) Level 1 - Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Trust has the ability to access. Valuation adjustments and block discounts are not applied to Level 1 securities. Since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market, valuation of these securities does not entail a significant degree of judgment, b) Level 2 - Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly, and c) Level 3 - Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. See the notes within the financial statements for further information.  The Funds and the Trust record their derivative activities at fair value. Gains and losses from derivative contracts are included in the statement of operations. Derivative contracts include futures contracts related to commodity prices. Futures, which are listed on a national securities exchange, such as the CBOT or the New York Mercantile Exchange ("NYMEX"), or reported on another national market, are generally categorized in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. OTC derivatives contracts (such as forward and swap contracts) which may be valued using models, depending on whether significant inputs are observable or unobservable, are categorized in Levels 2 or 3 of the fair value hierarchy.  6. Brokerage commissions on all open commodity futures contracts are accrued on a full-turn basis.  7. Margin is the minimum amount of funds that must be deposited by a commodity interest trader with the trader's broker to initiate and maintain an open position in futures contracts. A margin deposit acts to assure the trader's performance of the futures contracts purchased or sold. Futures contracts are customarily bought and sold on initial margin that represents a very small percentage of the aggregate purchase or sales price of the contract. Because of such low margin requirements, price fluctuations occurring in the futures markets may create profits and losses that, in relation to the amount invested, are greater than are customary in other forms of investment or speculation. As discussed below, adverse price changes in the futures contract may result in margin requirements that greatly exceed the initial margin. In addition, the amount of margin required in connection with a particular futures contract is set from time to time by the exchange on which the contract is traded and may be modified from time to time by the exchange during the term of the contract. Brokerage firms, such as the Funds' clearing brokers, carrying accounts for traders in commodity interest contracts generally require higher amounts of margin as a matter of policy to further protect themselves. Over-the-counter trading generally involves the extension of credit between counterparties, so the counterparties may agree to require the posting of collateral by one or both parties to address credit exposure.  When a trader purchases an option, there is no margin requirement; however, the option premium must be paid in full. When a trader sells an option, on the other hand, he or she is required to deposit margin in an amount determined by the margin requirements established for the underlying interest and, in addition, an amount substantially equal to the current premium for the option. The margin requirements imposed on the selling of options, although adjusted to reflect the probability that out-of-the-money options will not be exercised, can in fact be higher than those imposed in dealing in the futures markets directly. Complicated margin requirements apply to spreads and conversions, which are complex trading strategies in which a trader acquires a mixture of options positions and positions in the underlying interest.  Ongoing or "maintenance" margin requirements are computed each day by a trader's clearing broker. When the market value of a particular open futures contract changes to a point where the margin on deposit does not satisfy maintenance margin requirements, a margin call is made by the broker. If the margin call is not met within a reasonable time, the broker may close out the trader's position. With respect to the Funds' trading, the Funds (and not its shareholders personally) are subject to margin calls.  Finally, many major U.S. exchanges have passed certain cross margining arrangements involving procedures pursuant to which the futures and options positions held in an account would, in the case of some accounts, be aggregated, and margin requirements would be assessed on a portfolio basis, measuring the total risk of the combined positions.  8. Due from/to broker for investments in securities are securities transactions pending settlement. The Trust and TAGS are subject to credit risk to the extent any broker with whom it conducts business is unable to fulfill contractual obligations on its behalf. The management of the Trust and the Funds monitors the financial condition of such brokers and does not anticipate any losses from these counterparties. Since the inception of the Fund, the principal broker through which the Trust and TAGS clear securities transactions for TAGS is the Bank of New York Mellon Capital Markets.  9. The investment objective of TAGS is to have the daily changes in percentage terms of the Net Asset Value ("NAV") of its common units ("Shares") reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of a weighted average (the "Underlying Fund Average") of the NAVs per share of four other commodity pools that are series of the Trust and are sponsored by the Sponsor: the Teucrium Corn Fund, the Teucrium Wheat Fund, the Teucrium Soybean Fund and the Teucrium Sugar Fund (collectively, the "Underlying Funds"). The Underlying Fund Average will have a weighting of 25% to each Underlying Fund, and the Fund's assets will be rebalanced, generally on a daily basis, to maintain the approximate 25% allocation to each Underlying Fund. As such, TAGS will buy, sell and hold as part of its normal operations shares of the four Underlying Funds. The Trust excludes the shares of the other series of the Trust owned by the Teucrium Agricultural Fund from its statements of assets and liabilities. The Trust excludes the net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on securities owned by the Teucrium Agricultural Fund from its statements of operations. Upon the sale of the Underlying Funds by the Teucrium Agricultural Fund, the Trust includes any realized gain or loss in its statements of changes in net assets.  10. For tax purposes, the Funds will be treated as partnerships. Therefore, the Funds do not record a provision for income taxes because the partners report their share of a Fund's income or loss on their income tax returns. The financial statements reflect the Funds' transactions without adjustment, if any, required for income tax purposes.  Results of Operations  The following includes a section for each Fund of the Trust for the periods in which each Fund was in operation.  The discussion below addresses the material changes in the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011. In addition, the discussion addresses the three months ended December 31, 2013 compared to the three month periods for 2012 and 2011 as appropriate. CORN, NAGS, CRUD, SOYB, WEAT and CANE operated for the entirety of 2013 and 2012. CORN operated for all of 2011. NAGS and CRUD operated for eleven months of 2011. SOYB, CANE and WEAT did not commence operations until mid-September 2011 and TAGS did not commence operations until March 28, 2012.  For the period January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2013, the Funds, in total, recorded a decrease in expenses over what had been recorded in 2012. There was a decrease in expenses of approximately $843,000 or 17.6% in 2013 compared to 2012. Because of this, with the exception of CORN, all Funds experienced lower total expense ratios than they had incurred in 2012. These lower total expense ratios were the result of the several factors, including: 1) Sponsor efforts to reduce the overall costs of operating the funds, 2) a voluntary capping of expenses and management fees at 1.5% of total net assets for CRUD and CANE and 0.5% for TAGS, and 3) higher average total net assets for SOYB and WEAT as compared to the previous year. The total expense ratio for NAGS was 1.5% in 2013, as it had been in 2012, consistent with the 8-K that was filed on July 29, 2011 which voluntarily capped the total expenses at 1.5% of total net assets. The increase in the total expense ratio for CORN over that in 2012 was a result of lower average net assets for the Fund, partially offset by overall lower expenses.  For the period January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2012, the Funds, in total recorded a higher level of expenses that had been recorded in 2011 and, with the exception of NAGS and CRUD, all Funds experienced higher total expense ratios than they had incurred in 2011. This was the result of several factors, including but not limited to several of the Funds, namely SOYB, CANE and WEAT, being in operation for a truncated period of 2011.  For the year ended December 31, 2012, there was approximately $560,000 of expenses recorded on the financial statements of the Sponsor which was subject to reimbursement by the Funds in 2013. The Sponsor had not yet determined if it would seek such reimbursement and, as such, due to the uncertainty of this reimbursement, the financial statements of the Trust and the Funds did not reflect an adjustment for this amount. The Sponsor determined, however, that it would not seek reimbursement for any portion of the amount from NAGS, CRUD, CANE and TAGS. In 2013, the Sponsor did, in fact, receive reimbursement from CORN, SOYB and WEAT for approximately $510,000 of these expenses while approximately $50,000 remained with the Sponsor.  For the year ended December 31, 2013, there is approximately $590,000 of expenses recorded on the financial statements of the Sponsor which is subject to reimbursement by the Funds in 2014. The Sponsor has not yet determined if it will seek such reimbursement and, as such, due to the uncertainty of this reimbursement, the financial statements of the Trust and the Funds do not reflect an adjustment for this amount.  Teucrium Corn Fund  The Teucrium Corn Fund commenced investment operations on June 9, 2010. The investment objective of the Corn Fund is to have the daily changes in percentage terms of the Shares' NAV reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of a weighted average of the closing settlement prices for three futures contracts for corn ("Corn Futures Contracts") that are traded on the Chicago Board of Trade ("CBOT"), specifically (1) the second-to-expire CBOT Corn Futures Contract, weighted 35%, (2) the third-to-expire CBOT Corn Futures Contract, weighted 30%, and (3) the CBOT Corn Futures Contract expiring in the December following the expiration month of the third-to-expire contract, weighted 35%. On December 31, 2013, the Corn Fund held a total of 2,163 CBOT Corn Futures contracts with a notional value of $47,490,588. Of these contracts, all had a liability fair value equaling $4,884,788. The weighting of the notional value of the contracts was weighted as follows: (1) 35% to the May 2014 contracts, the second-to-expire CBOT Corn Futures Contract, (2) 30% to July 2014 contracts, the third-to-expire CBOT Corn Futures Contract, and (3) 35% to December 2014 contracts, the CBOT Corn Futures Contract expiring in the December following the expiration month of the third-to-expire contract.  The benchmark for the Fund is the Teucrium Corn Index (TCORN) which is defined as: A weighted average of daily changes in the closing settlement prices of (1) the second-to-expire Corn Futures Contract traded on the CBOT, weighted 35%, (2) the third-to-expire CBOT Corn Futures Contract, weighted 30%, and (3) the CBOT Corn Futures Contract expiring in the December following the expiration month of third-to-expire contract, weighted 35%. To convert to an index, 100 is set to $25, the opening day price of CORN. The chart below shows the percent change in the NAV per share for the Fund, the market price of the Fund shares, represented by the closing price of the Fund on the NYSE Arca or the mid-point of the 4 pm bid and ask if no closing price is available, and TCORN for two periods. One period is December 31, 2013 compared to December 31, 2012. The second period is from the commencement of operations to December 31, 2013. The Benchmark does not reflect any impact of expenses, which would generally reduce the Fund's NAV, or interest income, which would generally increase the NAV. The actual results for the NAV do include the impacts of both expenses and interest income.   Change in Change in Change in the Period CORN NAV per share Market Price Benchmark (TCORN) December 31, 2012 to December 31, 2013 -30.88% -31.00% -25.79% June 9, 2010 to December 31, 2013 18.55% 18.57% 42.10%  For the Year Ended December 31, 2013 Compared to the Years Ended December 31, 2012 and 2011  On December 31, 2013, the Fund had 1,550,004 shares outstanding and net assets of $47,499,620. This is in comparison to 1,700,004 shares outstanding and net assets of $71,268,521 on December 31, 2011 and 850,004 shares outstanding with net assets of $37,686,512 on December 31, 2012. Shares outstanding increased by 700,000 and 82.4% for the period of 2013 when compared to 2012. This increase was, in the opinion of  management, due to increased interest and investment activity as the price of the underlying commodity fell from near-record highs in the summer of 2012 to much lower levels due to a significantly higher corn harvest in the U.S in the fall of 2013 when compared to 2012. In total, the Fund issued 1,550,000 shares in 2013 and purchased 850,000 as part of creation and redemption baskets.  For the period 2012 compared to 2011, there was a decrease in shares outstanding of 850,000 and 50%. In 2012, as the nature of the drought conditions in the Midwest became known, shares outstanding of the Fund increased from 1,325,004 in June 2012 to 2,157,004 in July 2012. Once the harvest was complete, however, the Fund experienced a large number of redemption baskets, a trend that continued until the end of 2012. In total, the Fund issued 1,125,000 shares in 2012 and purchased 1,975,000 as part of creation and redemption baskets.  Total net assets for the Fund were $47,499,620 on December 31, 2013, $37,686,512 on December 31, 2012, and $71,268,521 on December 31, 2011. The Net Asset Values ("NAV") per share related to these balances were $30.64, $44.34, and $41.92 respectively. This represents a decrease in total net assets for the year ending December 31, 2013 versus 2011 of 33.4% which was driven by a combination of a decrease in the number of shares outstanding as well as a change in the NAV per share which decreased by $11.28 or 26.9%. When comparing December 31, 2013 with 2012, there was an increase in total net assets of 26.0%, driven by an increase in total shares outstanding of 82.4 % which was partially offset by a decrease in the NAV per share of $13.70 or 30.9%. The closing prices per share for 2013, 2012 and 2011, as reported by the NYSE Arca, were $30.58, $44.32 and $41.98, respectively. The change from December 31, 2013 over prior years was a 27.2% decrease from 2011 and a 31.0% decrease from 2012.  The total loss for the year ended December 31, 2013 was ($13,232,041) resulting primarily from the net change in realized depreciation on commodity futures contracts totaling ($10,581,838) and a net change in unrealized depreciation of commodity futures contracts of ($2,671,013). Total income was $10,063,171 in 2012 and $2,036,025 in 2011. Realized gain or loss on trading of commodity futures contracts is a function of: 1) the change in the price of the particular contracts sold as part of a "roll" in contracts as the nearest to expire contracts are exchanged for the appropriate contact given the investment objective of the fund, 2) the change in the price of particular contracts sold in relation to redemption of shares, 3) the gain or loss associated with rebalancing trades which are made to ensure conformance to the benchmark and 4) the number of contracts held and then sold for either circumstance aforementioned. Unrealized gain or loss on trading of commodity futures contracts is a function of the change in the price of contracts held on the final date of the period versus the purchase price for each contract and the number of contracts held in each contract month. The Sponsor has a static benchmark as described above and trades futures contracts to adhere to that benchmark and to adjust for the creation or redemption of shares.  Total expenses for the year ended December 31, 2013 were $3,037,091, with $432,770 attributable to payment of the management fee to the Sponsor, or 14.2% of expenses. The management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1% of the Fund's daily average net assets. In 2012, total expenses were $3,495,445 with the management fee to the Sponsor of $659,294 representing 18.9% of total expense. For 2011, total expenses were $2,508,118 with the management fee to the Sponsor of $983,260 representing 39.2% of total expense. The amounts attributable to distribution and marketing fees were $1,259,490 in 2013, $1,918,679 in 2012, and $846,475 in 2011. The expenses in this category represent 41.0% of total expenses in 2013, 55.0% in 2012 and 33.7% in 2011. The amounts attributable to professional fees were $820,800 in 2013, $353,887 in 2012, and $413,452 in 2011. This represents 27.0% of total expenses in 2013, 10.1% in 2012, and 16.5% in 2011. The professional fees were primarily paid to the independent auditor of the Fund and for the preparation and distribution of shareholder tax statements. Fees paid to the custodian and administrator were $129,196 in 2013, $129,549 in 2012, and $129,195 in 2011. This represented 4.3% of total Fund expenses for 2013, 3.7% for 2012, and 5.2% in 2011. General and administrative expenses were $214,425 in 2013, $259,060 in 2012, and $38,458 in 2011. This represented 7.1% of total Fund expenses for 2013, 7.4% in 2012, and 1.5% in 2011. The increase in expense for this category in 2013 and 2012 over 2011 was the result of an increase in payments for data, software, insurance and printing-related items. Brokerage fees and commissions for the trading of Futures Contracts totaled $40,715 in 2013, $56,148 for 2012, and $71,679 for 2011. This represented 1.3% of total expenses in 2013, 1.6% in 2012, and 2.9% in 2011. The decrease in 2012 over 2011 expenses resulted from fewer contracts held due to lower assets under management. Other than the management fee payable to the Sponsor and the brokerage commissions, most of the expenses incurred by the Fund are associated with the day-to-day operation of the Fund and the necessary functions related to regulatory compliance. These are generally based on contracts, which extend for some period of time and have commitments regardless of the level of assets under management.  The Sponsor has the ability to elect to pay certain expenses on behalf of the Fund or waive the management fee. This election is subject to change by the Sponsor, at its discretion. For the years-ended December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, there were approximately $0, $124,000 and $0 respectively of expenses which generally would have been paid by the Fund but were waived by the Sponsor. For the year ended December 31, 2012, there was also approximately $560,000 of expenses recorded on the financial statements of the Sponsor which were subject to reimbursement by the Fund in 2013. The Sponsor had not determined, as of December 31, 2012, if it would seek such reimbursement and, as such, due to the uncertainty of this reimbursement, the financial statements of the Fund did not reflect an adjustment for this amount. As of December 31, 2013, the Sponsor had been reimbursed by CORN, a total of $410,000 of the $560,000; the Sponsor will not seek reimbursement in 2014 for any residual balance which is deemed attributable to the operation of the Fund. For the year ended December 31, 2013, there is approximately $590,000 of expenses recorded on the financial statements of the Sponsor which is subject to reimbursement by the Funds in 2014. The Sponsor has not yet determined if it will seek such reimbursement and, as such, due to the uncertainty of this reimbursement, the financial statements of the Trust and the Funds do not reflect an adjustment for this amount.  The structure of the Fund and the nature of the expenses are such that as total net assets grow, there is a scalability of expenses that may allow the total expense ratio to be reduced. However, if total net assets for the Fund fall, the total expense ratio of the Fund will increase unless additional reductions are made by the Sponsor to the daily expense accrual. The Sponsor can elect to adjust the daily expense accruals at its discretion.  Net cash provided by or used in the Fund's operating activities during the year was ($18,309,002) in 2013, $9,906,392 in 2012, and ($3,211,888) in 2011. For 2013, proceeds from the sale of shares were $59,350,451, representing 1,550,000 shares while payments for redemptions were $33,268,211, representing 850,000 shares. In 2012, proceeds from the sale of shares were $51,752,168, representing 1,125,000 shares while payments for redemptions were $91,901,903, representing 1,975,000 shares. For 2011, proceeds from the sale of shares were $92,546,004, representing 2,100,000 shares, which were offset by $63,769,329 in payments for the redemption of Shares of the Fund, representing 1,500,000 shares.  For the Three Months Ended December 31, 2013 Compared to the Three Months Ended December 31, 2012 and 2011  . . .  Mar 17, 2014  (c) 1995-2014 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

Overview

















Teucrium Trading, LLC (Teucrium)
 
Teucrium Trading, LLC (Teucrium) is an issuer of single-commodity-focused next generation exchange-traded products ("ETP"). Teucrium designs investment vehicles that offer both liquidity¹ and transparency² in single-commodity investing to investors and hedgers in the popular and highly liquid ETP format. With today’s ever-evolving landscape in commodity markets, the Teucrium team, with its substantial experience in commodity futures trading, has the ability to deliver ETPs in the equity format for investing and hedging without the use of leverage.
 
Teucrium Trading’s President and Chief Investment Officer brings over two decades of commodities industry trading experience. Prior to Teucrium, he ran the commodities desk at a major global brokerage firm, where he was an active futures and swap derivatives trader/market maker in numerous commodities, specializing in energy and grains. Additionally, the management team brings a wide variety of management experience from startups, including Initial Public Offering ("IPO") experience, to senior financial and operational management positions to Wall Street investment banks.
 
Each Teucrium Fund is a commodity pool that issues Shares that may be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca. The Funds are series of the Teucrium Commodity Trust, a Delaware statutory trust organized on September 11, 2009. The Funds are managed and controlled by the Sponsor, Teucrium Trading, LLC. The Sponsor, a limited liability company formed in Delaware on July 28, 2009, is registered as a commodity pool operator (“CPO”) with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC") and is a member of the National Futures Association ("NFA").
 
¹ Liquidity - the ability of an asset to be converted into cash quickly and without any price discount.
² Transparency - transparent because holdings are disclosed daily on the website.

Investing in a Fund subjects an investor to the risks of the applicable commodity market, which investment could result in substantial fluctuations in the price of Fund Shares. Unlike mutual funds, the Funds generally will not distribute dividends to Shareholders.
 
 Investors may choose to use a Fund as a vehicle to hedge against the risk of loss, and there are risks involved in such investments and activities. The Sponsor has limited experience in operating a commodity pool, which is defined as an enterprise in which several individuals contribute funds in order to trade futures or futures options collectively.
 
Commodities and futures generally are volatile and are not suitable for all investors.
 
The Funds are not mutual funds or any other type of Investment Company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and are not subject to regulation thereunder.
 
For a complete description of the risks associated with each of the Funds, please refer to the applicable prospectus.
 
Shares of the Funds are not FDIC insured, may lose value, and have no bank guarantee.
 
All supporting documentation will be provided upon request.

	Report of Independent
	Registered Public Accounting Firm



	 


	 


	To the Members of


	 


	Teucrium Trading, LLC


	 


	We have audited the accompanying consolidated
	statements of financial condition of Teucrium Trading, LLC and Subsidiary (collectively, the “Company”) as of December
	31, 2012 and 2011, and the related statements of operations, changes in members’ equity and cash flows for each of the years
	in the three-year period ended December 31, 2012. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s
	management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.


	 


	We conducted our audits in accordance with
	the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and
	perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. 
	The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.
	An audit includes consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are
	appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
	internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.  An audit also includes examining, on
	a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
	used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We
	believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.


	 


	In our opinion, the consolidated
	financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Teucrium Trading,
	LLC and Subsidiary as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the results of their operations, changes in their members’
	equity and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2012 in conformity with
	accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

	NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	 




	Note 1 — Organization and Operation



	 


	Teucrium Trading, LLC, (the “Company”),
	a Delaware limited liability company, formed on July 28, 2009 and began operations on September 1, 2009.  The principal
	office is located at 232 Hidden Lake Road, Brattleboro, Vermont 05301.  The Company is registered as a commodity pool
	operator (“CPO”) with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) and became a member of the National
	Futures Association (“NFA”) on November 10, 2009.


	 


	The Company is solely responsible for the management
	and conducts or directs the conduct of the business of the Teucrium Commodity Trust (the “Trust”), a Delaware statutory
	trust, and any other series of the Trust that may from time to time be established and designated by the Company. The Trust issues
	common units representing fractional undivided beneficial interests in separate series of the Trust, called “Shares.”
	Each such series (each such series is referred to herein as a “fund” and collectively as the “Funds”) constitutes
	a separate commodity pool. As of December 31, 2012, the following constitute the series of the Trust: the Teucrium Corn Fund (“CORN”),
	the Teucrium WTI Crude Oil Fund (“CRUD”), the Teucrium Natural Gas Fund (“NAGS”), the Teucrium Sugar Fund
	(“CANE”), the Teucrium Soybean Fund (“SOYB”), the Teucrium Wheat Fund (“WEAT”), and the Teucrium
	Agricultural Fund (“TAGS”).  The Trust and the Funds operate pursuant to the Trust’s Second Amended and
	Restated Declaration of Trust and Trust Agreement (the “Trust Agreement”). 


	 


	On June 5, 2010, the Form S-1 for CORN
	was declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). On June 8, 2010, Creation Baskets
	for CORN were issued representing 200,000 shares and $5,000,000. CORN began trading on the New York Stock Exchange
	(“NYSE”) Arca on June 9, 2010. On October 22, 2010, the Forms S-1 for NAGS and CRUD were declared effective by
	the SEC. On January 31, 2011, Creation Baskets for NAGS were issued representing 200,000 shares and $5,000,000. NAGS began
	trading on the NYSE Arca on February 1, 2011. On February 22, 2011, Creation Baskets for CRUD were issued representing
	100,000 shares and $5,000,000.  CRUD began trading on the NYSE Arca on February 23, 2011. On June 17, 2011, the
	Forms S-1 for CANE, SOYB, and WEAT were declared effective by the SEC. On September 16, 2011, Creation Baskets were issued
	for each Fund, representing 100,000 shares and $2,500,000, for CANE, SOYB, and WEAT.  On September 19, 2011, CANE,
	SOYB, and WEAT started trading on the NYSE Arca.On February 10, 2012, the Form S-1 for TAGS was declared effective by the
	SEC. On March 27, 2012, Creation Baskets for TAGS were issued representing 300,000 shares and $15,000,000. TAGS began trading
	on the NYSE Arca on March 28, 2012.


	 


	The Company is required to oversee the purchase
	and sale of Shares by Authorized Purchasers

	(

	one that purchases or redeems Creation Baskets or Redemption Baskets, respectively,
	from or to the Funds), and to manage the Funds’ investments, including to evaluate the credit risk of futures commission
	merchants and swap counterparties and to review daily positions and margin/collateral requirements.


	 


	The Company has the power to enter into agreements as may be necessary
	or appropriate for the offer and sale of the Funds’ units and the conduct of the Trust’s activities.


	 



	Note 2 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies



	 




	Basis of Presentation





	 



	The consolidated financial statements have
	been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) as detailed
	in the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Accounting Standards Codification.


	 


	For the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company
	was considered a development stage entity for financial statement reporting purposes. Effective with the year ended December 31,
	2011, the Company is no longer considered a development stage entity as planned principal operations related to the Funds have
	commenced.


	 




	Principles of Consolidation




	 


	The consolidated financial statements include
	the Company and the Trust. All material inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated in the consolidation.  The
	consolidated financial statements of the Company also include the noncontrolling interests of the unit holders in the Funds.


	 




	Noncontrolling Interests




	 


	The consolidated financial
	statements of the Company include the noncontrolling interests of the unit holders in the Funds.  Net income and loss
	is allocated between the Company and the noncontrolling interests based on their respective relative ownership interest in the
	Funds.


	 











	7










	 








	Reclassifications




	 


	Certain amounts in prior periods have been
	reclassified to conform to current period presentation.


	 




	Revenue Recognition





	 



	Commodity futures contracts are recorded on
	the trade date. All such transactions are recorded on the identified cost basis and marked to market daily. Unrealized appreciation
	or depreciation on commodity futures contracts are reflected in the statements of operations as the difference between the original
	contract amount and the fair market value as of the last business day of the year or as of the last date of the financial statements.
	Changes in the appreciation or depreciation between periods are reflected in the statements of operations. Interest on cash equivalents
	and deposits with the Futures Commission Merchant are recognized on the accrual basis. The Funds earn interest on its
	assets denominated in U.S. dollars on deposit with the Futures Commission. In addition, the Funds earn interest on funds held at
	the custodian at prevailing market rates for such investments.


	 




	Brokerage Commissions




	 


	Brokerage commissions on all open commodity futures contracts are
	accrued on a full-turn basis.


	 




	Creations and Redemptions




	 


	Authorized Purchasers may purchase Creation
	Baskets from each Fund. The amount of the proceeds required to purchase a Creation Basket will be equal to the NAV of the shares
	in the Creation Basket determined as of 4:00 p.m. New York time on the day the order to create the basket is properly received.


	 


	Authorized Purchasers may redeem shares from
	each Fund only in blocks of shares called “Redemption Baskets.” The amount of the redemption proceeds for a Redemption
	Basket will be equal to the NAV of the shares in the Redemption Basket determined as of 4:00 p.m. New York time on the day the
	order to redeem the basket is properly received.


	 


	Each Fund receives or pays the proceeds
	from shares sold or redeemed within three business days after the trade date of the purchase or redemption. The amounts due from
	Authorized Purchasers are reflected in the statements of assets and liabilities as receivable for shares sold.  Amounts
	payable to Authorized Purchasers upon redemption are reflected in the statements of assets and liabilities as payable for shares
	redeemed.


	 


	There are a minimum number of baskets
	and associated shares specified for each Fund in the respective most recent Form S-1 amendments or supplements. Once the minimum
	number of baskets is reached, there can be no more redemptions until there has been a creation basket. These minimum levels are
	as follows:


	 


	CORN: 50,000 shares representing
	2 baskets


	NAGS: 100,000 shares representing
	2 baskets


	CRUD: 50,000 shares representing
	2 baskets (at minimum level as of December 31, 2012)


	SOYB: 50,000 shares representing
	2 baskets


	CANE: 50,000 shares representing
	2 baskets


	WEAT: 50,000 shares representing
	2 baskets


	TAGS: 50,000 shares representing
	2 baskets (at minimum level as of December 31, 2012).


	 




	Use of Estimates




	 


	The preparation of financial statements in
	conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
	and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
	at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
	could differ from those estimates.


	 




	Income Taxes




	 


	In accordance with Financial Accounting
	Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 740-10, “Accounting
	for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,” the Company is required to determine whether a tax position is more likely than not
	to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority, including resolution of any related appeals or
	litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position.  The Company files income tax returns in the
	U.S. federal jurisdiction, and may file income tax returns in various U.S. states and foreign jurisdictions.  The
	Company is subject to income tax examinations by major taxing authorities for all tax years since inception. The tax benefit
	recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized
	upon ultimate settlement.  De-recognition of a tax benefit previously recognized









	8










	 






	results in the Funds recording a
	tax liability that reduces net assets.   Based on their analysis, the Company has determined that they have not
	incurred any liability for unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011.  However, the
	Company’s conclusions regarding this policy may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based on factors
	including, but not limited to, on-going analysis of and changes to tax laws, regulations, and interpretations
	thereof.  


	 


	The Company recognizes interest accrued related
	to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax fees payable, if assessed.  No
	interest expense or penalties have been recognized as of and for the years ended December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011.


	 


	The Company may be subject to potential examination
	by U.S. federal, U.S. state, or foreign jurisdictional authorities in the area of income taxes. These potential examinations may
	include questioning the timing and amount of deductions, the nexus of income among various tax jurisdictions, and compliance with
	U.S. federal, U.S. state and foreign tax laws.  The Company’s management does not expect that the total amount
	of unrecognized tax benefits will materially change over the next twelve months.


	 




	Offering Costs




	 


	The Company expenses all initial offering costs
	associated with the registration of the Funds. Costs include, but are not limited to, legal fees pertaining to the Funds’
	units offered for sale, SEC and state registration fees, initial fees paid to be listed on an exchange, underwriting and other
	similar costs. The initial offering and organization costs incurred to start the Funds will be borne by the Company and not be
	charged to the Funds.  Approximately $880,000 of accrued legal expenses related to the Funds’ initial offerings
	costs were included in the accrued expenses on the consolidated statements of financial condition as of December 31, 2011. There
	were no accrued legal expenses related to the initial offering costs on the consolidated statements of financial condition as of
	December 31, 2012.


	 




	Cash Equivalents




	 


	Cash equivalents are highly-liquid investments
	with original maturity dates of three months or less at inception.  The Company reports its cash equivalents in the statements
	of assets and liabilities at market value, or at carrying amounts that approximate fair value, because of their highly-liquid nature
	and short-term maturities. The Company has a substantial portion of its assets on deposit with banks. Assets deposited with the
	bank may, at times, exceed federally insured limits.  The Company had a balance of $32,947,999 and $61,244,613 in money market
	funds at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively; these balances are included in cash and cash equivalents on the
	statements of assets and liabilities.  The Company also had investments in United States Treasury Bills with a maturity
	of three months or less with a fair value of $19,999,600 and $19,999,830, respectively; on both December 31, 2012 and December
	31, 2011.


	 




	Collateral, Due from/to Broker




	 


	Margin is the minimum amount of funds that
	must be deposited by a commodity interest trader with the trader’s broker to initiate and maintain an open position in futures
	contracts. A margin deposit acts to assure the trader’s performance of the futures contracts purchased or sold. Futures contracts
	are customarily bought and sold on initial margin that represents a very small percentage of the aggregate purchase or sales price
	of the contract. Because of such low margin requirements, price fluctuations occurring in the futures markets may create profits
	and losses that, in relation to the amount invested, are greater than are customary in other forms of investment or speculation.
	As discussed below, adverse price changes in the futures contract may result in margin requirements that greatly exceed the initial
	margin. In addition, the amount of margin required in connection with a particular futures contract is set from time to time by
	the exchange on which the contract is traded and may be modified from time to time by the exchange during the term of the contract.
	Brokerage firms, such as the Funds’ clearing brokers, carrying accounts for traders in commodity interest contracts generally
	require higher amounts of margin as a matter of policy to further protect themselves. Over-the-counter trading generally involves
	the extension of credit between counterparties, so the counterparties may agree to require the posting of collateral by one or
	both parties to address credit exposure.


	 


	When a trader purchases an option, there is
	no margin requirement; however, the option premium must be paid in full. When a trader sells an option, on the other hand, he or
	she is required to deposit margin in an amount determined by the margin requirements established for the underlying interest and,
	in addition, an amount substantially equal to the current premium for the option. The margin requirements imposed on the selling
	of options, although adjusted to reflect the probability that out-of-the-money options will not be exercised, can in fact be higher
	than those imposed in dealing in the futures markets directly. Complicated margin requirements apply to spreads and conversions,
	which are complex trading strategies in which a trader acquires a mixture of options positions and positions in the underlying
	interest.


	 


	Ongoing or “maintenance”
	margin requirements are computed each day by a trader’s clearing broker. When the market value of a particular open futures
	contract changes to a point where the margin on deposit does not satisfy maintenance margin requirements, a margin call is made
	by the broker. If the margin call is not met within a reasonable time, the broker may close out the trader’s position. With
	respect to the Funds’ trading, the Funds (and not its shareholders personally) are subject to margin calls.

	Finally, many major U.S. exchanges have passed
	certain cross margining arrangements involving procedures pursuant to which the futures and options positions held in an account
	would, in the case of some accounts, be aggregated, and margin requirements would be assessed on a portfolio basis, measuring the
	total risk of the combined positions.


	 




	Due from/to Broker for Securities Transactions






	 




	Due from/to broker for investments in securities
	are securities transactions pending settlement. The Company, the Trust and TAGS are subject to credit risk to the extent any broker
	with whom it conducts business is unable to fulfill contractual obligations on its behalf. The management of the Company, the Trust
	and the Funds monitors the financial condition of such brokers and does not anticipate any losses from these counterparties. Since
	the inception of TAGS, the principal broker through which the Company, the Trust and TAGS clear securities transactions for TAGS
	is the Bank of New York Mellon Capital Markets.


	 




	Shares of the Underlying Funds Held by
	the Teucrium Agricultural Fund (TAGS)




	 


	The investment objective of TAGS is to have
	the daily changes in percentage terms of the Net Asset Value (“NAV”) of its common units (“Shares”) reflect
	the daily changes in percentage terms of a weighted average (the “Underlying Fund Average”) of the NAVs per share of
	four other commodity pools that are series of the Trust and are sponsored by the Sponsor: the Teucrium Corn Fund, the Teucrium
	Wheat Fund, the Teucrium Soybean Fund and the Teucrium Sugar Fund (collectively, the “Underlying Funds”). The
	Underlying Fund Average will have a weighting of 25% to each Underlying Fund, and the Fund’s assets will be rebalanced, generally
	on a daily basis, to maintain the approximate 25% allocation to each Underlying Fund.


	 


	As such, TAGS will buy, sell and hold as part
	of its normal operations shares of the four Underlying Funds. The Company and the Trust exclude the shares of the other series
	of the Trust owned by the Teucrium Agricultural Fund from its statements of assets and liabilities. The Company and the Trust exclude
	the net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on securities owned by the Teucrium Agricultural Fund from its statements
	of operations. Upon the sale of the Underlying Funds by the Teucrium Agricultural Fund, the Company and the Trust include any realized
	gain or loss in its statements of changes in net assets.


	 



	 





	Fair Value - Definition and Hierarchy





	 



	In accordance with U.S. GAAP, fair value is
	defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the “exit price”)
	in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.


	 


	In determining fair value, the Company uses
	various valuation approaches.  In accordance with U.S. GAAP, a fair value hierarchy for inputs is used in measuring fair value
	that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable
	inputs be used when available.  Observable inputs are those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability
	based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company.  Unobservable inputs reflect the Company’s assumptions
	about the inputs market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available
	in the circumstances.  The fair value hierarchy is categorized into three levels based on the inputs as follows:


	 



	Level 1

	- Valuations based on unadjusted
	quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access.  Valuation
	adjustments and block discounts are not applied to Level 1 securities.  Since valuations are based on quoted prices that are
	readily and regularly available in an active market, valuation of these securities does not entail a significant degree of judgment.


	 



	Level 2

	- Valuations based on quoted
	prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.


	 



	Level 3 -

	Valuations based on inputs
	that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.


	 


	The availability of valuation techniques
	and observable inputs can vary from security to security and is affected by a wide variety of factors including, the type of
	security, whether the security is new and not yet established in the marketplace, and other characteristics particular to the
	transaction.  To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the
	market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Those estimated values do not necessarily represent the
	amounts that may be ultimately realized due to the occurrence of future circumstances that cannot be reasonably
	determined.  Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, those estimated values may be materially higher or lower
	than the values that would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed. Accordingly, the degree of
	judgment exercised by the Fund in determining fair value is greatest for securities categorized in Level 3. In certain
	cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In
	such cases, for disclosure purposes, the level in the fair value hierarchy, within which the fair value measurement in
	its entirety falls, is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.


	 


	Fair value is a market-based measure considered
	from the perspective of a market participant rather than an entity-specific measure.  Therefore, even when market assumptions
	are not readily available, the Company’s own assumptions are set to reflect those that









	10










	 






	market participants would use in pricing
	the asset or liability at the measurement date.  The Company uses prices and inputs that are current as of the measurement
	date, including periods of market dislocation.  In periods of market dislocation, the observability of prices and inputs may
	be reduced for many securities.  This condition could cause a security to be reclassified to a lower level within the fair
	value hierarchy. For instance, when Corn Futures Contracts on the Chicago Board of Trade (“CBOT”) are not actively
	trading due to a “limit-up” or ‘limit-down” condition, meaning that the change in the Corn Futures Contracts
	has exceeded the limits established, the Company and the Fund will revert to alternative verifiable sources of valuation of its
	assets.  When such a situation exists on a quarter close, the Sponsor will calculate the NAV on a particular day using
	the Level 1 valuation, but will later recalculate the NAV for the impacted Fund based upon the valuation inputs from these alternative
	verifiable sources (Level 2 or Level 3) and will report such NAV in its applicable financial statements and reports.


	 


	On December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011,
	in the opinion of the Company, the reported value at the close of the market for each commodity contract fairly reflected the value
	of the futures and no alternative valuations were required.


	 


	The Funds, the Trust and the Company record
	their derivative activities at fair value. Gains and losses from derivative contracts are included in the statements of operations.  Derivative
	contracts include futures contracts related to commodity prices. Futures, which are listed on a national securities exchange, such
	as the CBOT or the New York Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”), or reported on another national market, are generally categorized
	in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.  OTC derivatives contracts (such as forward and swap contracts), which may be
	valued using models, depending on whether significant inputs are observable or unobservable, are categorized in Levels 2 or 3 of
	the fair value hierarchy.


	 


	Investments in the securities of the Underlying
	Funds are freely tradable and listed on the NYSE Arca. These investments are valued at the NAV of the Underlying Fund as of the
	valuation date as calculated by the administrator based on the exchange-quoted prices of the commodity futures contracts held by
	the Underlying Fund.


	 




	New Accounting Pronouncements




	 


	In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-11,
	“Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Amendments of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification and Disclosures about Offsetting Assets
	and Liabilities in U.S. GAAP and IFRS.” ASU No. 2011-11 clarifies existing requirements for balance sheet offsetting
	and for disclosures about the offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the
	effect of those arrangements on its financial position in converged guidance of the FASB and the International Accounting Standards
	Board. The amendments are to be applied retrospectively for all comparative periods presented. For public entities, the amendments
	are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013. We anticipate that the adoption will not
	have a significant impact on the financial statement disclosures for the Company, the Trust or the Funds.


	 




	Liquidity




	 


	At December 31, 2012, the Company has
	cash and cash equivalents of $372,308, exclusive of those of the Trust, and a receivable for the December 2012 management fee
	from the Trust which was received in January 2013. The Company also has $400,000 of short term debt which matures on August
	14, 2013. Management of the Company believes that its cash resources at December 31, 2012, in addition to the anticipated
	cash to be provided by the current operations and management of the Trust, will be sufficient to meet its current obligations
	and fund its operations to at least January 1, 2014. The Company is in full compliance with the terms of its short term
	debt agreement up to and including the year ended December 31, 2012 (see Note 5).

	Note 4 -Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities




	 



	In the normal course of business, the Funds
	utilize derivative contracts in connection with its proprietary trading activities.  Investments in derivative contracts are
	subject to additional risks that can result in a loss of all or part of an investment.  The Funds’ derivative activities
	and exposure to derivative contracts are classified by the following primary underlying risks: interest rate, credit, commodity
	price, and equity price risks.  In addition to its primary underlying risks, the Funds are also subject to additional counterparty
	risk due to inability of  its counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts.  For the years ended December 31,
	2012 and 2011, and from the commencement of operations (June 6, 2010) through December 31, 2010, the Funds invested in commodity
	futures contracts and Cleared Swaps. Cleared Swaps have standardized terms similar to, and are priced by reference to, a corresponding
	Benchmark Component Futures Contract.  Additionally, Other Commodity Interests that do not have standardized terms and are
	not exchange-traded, referred to as “over-the-counter” Interests, can generally be structured as the parties to the
	Commodity Interest contract desire.  Therefore, each Fund might enter into multiple Cleared Swaps and/or over-the-counter
	Interests intended to exactly replicate the performance of each of the Benchmark Component Futures Contracts for the Fund, or a
	single over-the-counter Interest designed to replicate the performance of the Benchmark as a whole. Assuming that there is
	no default by a counterparty to an over-the-counter Interest, the performance of the Interest will necessarily correlate exactly
	with the performance of the Benchmark or the applicable Benchmark Component Futures Contract.  


	 




	Futures Contracts


	  


	          


	The Funds are subject to commodity price risk
	in the normal course of pursuing their investment objectives. A futures contract represents a commitment for the future purchase
	or sale of an asset at a specified price on a specified date.


	 


	The purchase and sale of futures contracts
	requires margin deposits with a Futures Commission Merchant (“FCM”).  Subsequent payments (variation margin) are
	made or received by each Fund each day, depending on the daily fluctuations in the value of the contract, and are recorded as unrealized
	gains or losses by each Fund.  Futures contracts may reduce the Funds’ exposure to counterparty risk since futures contracts
	are exchange-traded; and the exchange’s clearinghouse, as the counterparty to all exchange-traded futures, guarantees the
	futures against default.


	 


	The Commodity Exchange Act requires an FCM
	to segregate all customer transactions and assets from the FCM’s proprietary activities.  A customer’s cash and
	other equity deposited with an FCM are considered commingled with all other customer funds subject to the FCM’s segregation
	requirements.  In the event of an FCM’s insolvency, recovery may be limited to each Fund’s pro rata share of segregated
	customer funds available.  It is possible that the recovery amount could be less than the total of cash and other equity deposited.


	 


	The following tables identify the fair value
	amounts of derivative instruments included in the statements of assets and liabilities as derivative contracts, categorized by
	primary underlying risk, at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011.  Balances are presented on a gross basis, prior to the
	application of the impact of counterparty and collateral netting.  Total derivative assets and liabilities are adjusted on
	an aggregate basis to take into consideration the effects of master netting arrangements and have been reduced by the application
	of cash collateral receivables and payables with its counterparties. The following tables also identify the net gain and loss amounts
	included in the statements of operations as realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading of commodity futures contracts,
	categorized by primary underlying risk, for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, and from the commencement of operations
	(June 9, 2010) through December 31, 2010.

	Note 5 – Capitalization (including debt)



	 


	The Company is authorized to issue equity interests
	in the Company designated as "membership units" which shall constitute "membership interests" and shall initially
	include Class A units, Class B-1 units and Class B-2 units. Class A Units are granted the right to vote on all matters regarding
	management and members. The voting rights granted to Class B units are limited to matters requiring a majority vote of Class A
	units, including but not limited to, dissolution.


	 


	Ownership or “membership” interests
	in the Company are owned by persons referred to as “members.”  The Company currently has three voting or
	“Class A” members – Mr. Sal Gilbertie, Mr. Dale Riker and Mr. Carl N. Miller III – and a small number of
	non-voting or “Class B” members who have provided working capital to the Company.  Messrs. Gilbertie and
	Riker each currently own 45% of the Company’s Class A membership interests.


	 


	The members (acting by a majority vote of the
	Class A members) are authorized, by resolution or resolutions, to create and to issue, on behalf of the Company, different classes,
	groups or series of membership units and to fix for each such class, group or series such voting powers (full or limited or no
	voting powers), and such distinctive designations, preferences and relative participating, optional or other special rights and
	qualifications, limitations or restrictions as determined by the members (acting by a majority vote of the Class A members) in
	exchange for contributions of cash or property, the provision of services or such other consideration, as may be determined by
	the members (acting by a majority vote of the Class A members). Each membership unit of a class of membership units shall be identical
	in all respects to each other membership unit of such class. All membership units may be issued as fractional units.


	 


	The Company entered into convertible notes
	on September 28, 2009 for $225,000, and the note holders had rights to convert for 3% interest in the Company. On October 28, 2009,
	the note holders converted $225,000, including $50,000 which had not been received by the Company. Due primarily to the short-term
	nature of the convertible notes, the Company has determined that the bifurcation of the convertible debt would not have had a material
	impact on the consolidated financial statements.  In August 2010, the Company received the $50,000 that was previously
	included in subscription receivable.


	 


	During the period from inception (September
	1, 2009) through December 31, 2009, GFI Group LLC (“GFI”) contributed $1,500,000 in cash in connection with its
	interest in the Company through Class B-1 units and an option agreement. The Company granted GFI the right and option to purchase
	that number of Class B-1 units of the Company representing the Percentage Interest in the Company at the exercise price shown
	below (the “Option”):



	 



	-Percentage Interest subject
	to Option: Up to 5%. 


	-Exercise Price: $2,500,000 per each
	two and one-half percent (2.5%) (the “Incremental Exercise Percentage”)  Percentage Interest, for an aggregate
	exercise price of $5,000,000.


	-The Option shall become
	vested and exercisable in full as of the date of grant.


	-The Option shall expire and cease
	to be exercisable upon the five-year anniversary of the date the option was granted, October 28, 2009.


	 


	On June 7, 2010, the Company entered into a
	debt agreement (the “Loan Agreement”) with GFI. Under the terms of the Loan Agreement, the Company borrowed $800,000
	for a one-year term at an annual interest rate of 8.25%. The payment of principal and interest was due at maturity and was subject
	to optional prepayment by the Company at any time without premium or penalty.  The Loan Agreement was collateralized
	by substantially all of the current and future assets of the Company.


	 


	In connection with the execution of the Loan
	Agreement, the terms of the Option Agreement were modified to allow GFI to purchase that number of Class B-1 units of the Company
	representing the Percentage Interest in the Company at the exercise price shown below (the “Modified Option”):


	 


	-Percentage Interest subject
	to the Modified Option:  Up to 5%.


	   


	-Exercise Price:  $2,100,000
	per each two and one-half percent (2.5%) Incremental Exercise Percentage Interest for an aggregate exercise price of $4,200,000.


	 


	The Company determined that modification of
	the Option Agreement did not change the de minimis value of the Option.


	 









	15










	 






	On February 4, 2011, the Company entered into
	a subsequent agreement with GFI, in which GFI purchased an additional interest in the Company through Class B-1 units. GFI provided
	cash of $1,156,422 and converted the principal balance of the Company’s $800,000 borrowing and accrued interest through the
	date of signing of $43,578 as payment for 217.220 Class B-1 units.  GFI received the right to convert $400,000 of their
	additional investment into a loan, should specific agreement objectives not be achieved by February 4, 2012.  The issuance
	of the $400,000 loan upon conversion would not result in a decrease in GFI’s ownership interest and would mature eight months
	following the election to exercise this right. As a result of this conversion right, the Company has classified $400,000 of this
	equity contribution outside permanent members’ equity on the December 31, 2011 consolidated statement of financial condition.
	The Company also received an additional equity contribution of $70,000 in exchange for 5.860 Class B-1 units on the same date
	as the GFI agreement.


	 


	On June 21, 2011, the Company entered into
	an agreement with NMSIC Classic, LLC (“NMSIC”), a Delaware limited liability company, in which NMSIC contributed $1,000,000
	in cash in exchange for 91.491 units of Class B-1 shares.


	 


	In connection with the contribution by NMSIC,
	the Company entered into side-letter agreements with both GFI and NMSIC.  Under the terms of the side-letter agreements,
	the Company granted both GFI and NMSIC the right for the next ten calendar years to redeem their Class B-1 units at a pre-determined
	value which is based on the assets under management of the Trust.  The redemption amount shall be paid in cash and cash
	equivalents to the extent is the Company has Excess Cash, as defined.  In addition, the Company has a call option to
	acquire the Class B-1 units of GFI and NMSIC based on a pre-determined calculation for the next ten calendar years.  As
	a result of the redemption rights granted, the Company has classified the interests of GFI and NMSIC totaling $3,000,000, including
	GFI’s right to convert $400,000 of their additional investment into a loan, outside of permanent members’ equity on
	the December 31, 2011 consolidated statement of financial condition.


	 


	On February 15, 2012, GFI elected to
	convert to a loan payable the $400,000 portion of its equity contributed on February 4, 2011 that was subject to the
	conversion right. This short term debt matures on August 14, 2013 and carries an interest rate of 8.25% per annum. The
	remaining interest of GFI and NMSIC totaling $2,600,000 remains classified outside of permanent members’ equity on the
	December 31, 2012 consolidated statements of financial condition.


	 



	Note 6 — Unit-Based Compensation



	 


	In February 2010, the Company issued 100 units
	of Class B-2 shares to a small number of non-employee individuals representing 7% of the total collective Company membership interests.  The
	Class B-2 shares were awarded based on services. The Class B-2 shares generally have the same rights as Class B-1 shares; however,
	in the event of termination, the Class B-2 shares are subordinate to Class B-1 shares regarding any distributions. The Class
	B-2 shares are redeemable at the sole option of the Company at a predetermined price of $1,000,000 per 1% of collective
	membership interests represented by the Class B-2 shares.


	 


	For the year ended December 31, 2010, $86,000
	of unit-based compensation expense representing the estimated fair value of the Class B-2 shares issued is included on the statement
	of operations. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 505, “Equity,” the Company determined the fair value of the Class
	B-2 shares issued based on recent similar transactions, the financial condition and book value of the Company at the time
	of issuance, and the respective rights of the Class B-2 shares versus the other classes of membership interests.


	 



	Note 7 — Related Party Transactions



	 


	The Riker Group has invoiced the Company for
	professional services rendered by Dale Riker $30,000 for the year ended December 31, 2011 and $240,000 for the year ended December
	31, 2010. There were no amounts which were payable and included in the accrued expenses balance on the accompanying consolidated
	statements of financial condition at December 31, 2011 or December 31, 2012. 


	 


	The Gilbertie Herb Farm was paid by the Company
	for rent in the amount of $6,000 each for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012. No amounts were payable as of December
	31, 2011 or December 31, 2012.


	 


	Our Hidden Lake, LLC has invoiced the Company
	for office rent, employee accommodations and document storage in the amount of $35,000 for the year ended December 31, 2012. There
	were no amounts which were payable and included in the accrued expenses balance on the accompanying consolidated statements of
	financial condition at December 31, 2012. 


	 



	Note 8 - Subsequent Events



	 


	The Company evaluates subsequent events through
	the date when financial statements are filed with the SEC.


	 


	For the period January 1, 2013 through April
	2, 2013, there was nothing to report.

Teucrium CORN Fund




The Teucrium Corn Fund
 
The Teucrium Corn Fund (NYSE: CORN) provides investors unleveraged direct exposure to corn without the need for a futures account. CORN provides transparency to investors by investing in a known benchmark (described below), listing all holdings nightly, and providing future roll dates. CORN was designed to reduce the effects of rolling contracts (and contango and backwardation) by not investing in front-month (spot) futures contracts and thus limiting the number of contract rolls each year.
 
The investment objective of CORN is to have the daily changes in percentage terms of the Shares’ Net Asset Value (“NAV”) reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of a weighted average of the closing settlement prices for three futures contracts for corn (“Corn Futures Contracts”) that are traded on the Chicago Board of Trade (“CBOT”):
 
CORN Benchmark




CBOT Corn Futures Contract


Weighting

35%




Third to expire

December following the third to expire

CORN is a commodity pool that may be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca. The Fund is a series of the Teucrium Commodity Trust (“Trust”), a Delaware statutory trust organized on September 11, 2009. The Fund is one of five series of the Trust; each series operates as a separate commodity pool. The Fund is managed and controlled by the Sponsor, Teucrium Trading, LLC. The Sponsor is registered as a commodity pool operator (“CPO”) with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC") and is a member of the National Futures Association ("NFA").
 
Investing in Corn Interests subjects CORN to the risks of the corn market, and this could result in substantial fluctuations in the price of CORN’s Shares.  Unlike mutual funds, CORN generally will not distribute dividends to Shareholders.
 
Investors may choose to use CORN as a means of investing indirectly in corn as a vehicle to hedge against the risk of loss, and there are risks involved in such investments and activities. The Sponsor has limited experience in operating a commodity pool, which is defined as an enterprise in which several individuals contribute funds in order to trade futures or futures options collectively.
 
Commodities and futures generally are volatile and are not suitable for all investors. 
 
The Teucrium Corn Fund is not a mutual fund or any other type of Investment Company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and is not subject to regulation thereunder. 
 
Shares of the Teucrium Corn Fund are not FDIC insured, may lose value, and have no bank guarantee.
