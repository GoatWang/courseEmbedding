Meltdown reveals how the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was able to curb important unsafe and unfair practices that led to the recent financial crisis. In interviews with key government, industry, and advocacy groups along with deep archival research, Kirsch and Squires show where the CFPB was able to overcome many abusive practices, where it was less able to do so, and why.
Open for business in 2011, the CFPB was Congress's response to the financial catastrophe that shattered millions of middle-class and lower-income households and threatened the stability of the global economy. But only a few years later, with U.S. economic conditions on a path to recovery, there are already disturbing signs of the (re)emergence of the high-risk, high-reward credit practices that the CFPB was designed to curb. This book profiles how the Bureau has attempted to stop abusive and discriminatory lending practices in the mortgage and automobile lending sectors and documents the multilayered challenges faced by an untested new regulatory agency in its efforts to transform the broken—but lucrative—business practices of the financial services industry.Authors Kirsch and Squires raise the question of whether the consumer protection approach to financial services reform will succeed over the long term in light of political and business efforts to scuttle it. Case studies of mortgage and automobile lending reforms highlight the key contextual and structural conditions that explain the CFPB's ability to transform financial service industry business models and practices. Meltdown: The Financial Crisis, Consumer Protection, and the Road Forward is essential reading for a wide audience, including anyone involved in the provision of financial services, staff of financial services and consumer protection regulatory agencies, and fair lending and consumer protection advocates. Its accessible presentation of financial information will also serve students and general readers.
Features
Presents the first comprehensive examination of the CFPB that identifies its successes during its first five years of operation and addresses the challenges the bureau now facesExposes the alarming possibility that as the economy recovers, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's efforts to protect consumers could be derailed by political and industry pressureOffers provisional assessment of the effectiveness of the CFPB and consumer protection regulationGives readers unique access to insightful perspectives via on-the-record interviews with a cross-section of stakeholders, ranging from Richard Cordray (director of the CFPB) to public policy leaders, congressional staffers, advocates, scholars, and members of the pressDocuments the historical and analytic narrative with more than 40 pages of end notes that will assist scholars, students, and practitioners

Reviews/Endorsements
Endorsements"Kirsch and Squires have penned the definitive chronicle of the first years of a transformative federal agency—the CFPB. They have combined rigorous archival research with in-depth interviews of key insiders to help readers understand the enormous challenges that faced the Bureau as it took on what many consider to be the most powerful lobbying force in the nation—the financial services industry. There are lessons here for the general public but also for policymakers, students of policy making, and advocates looking to build a more equitable economic playing field."—Dan Immergluck, Professor, School of City and Regional Planning, Georgia Institute of Technology"This book provides an interesting, readable account of how Director Richard Cordray and others shaped the approach of the newly formed CFPB to its role as the preeminent consumer financial services regulatory agency and the challenges and opposition (some of which came from me and my law firm) faced by the bureau as it embarked on its initial initiatives. Even the bureau’s closest observers are likely to learn something new from the book’s account of the bureau’s early efforts directed at mortgage origination and auto lending. The book combines considerable research with in-depth interviews to offer an appraisal that will interest scholars, practitioners, and readers of current politics and policy."—Alan S. Kaplinsky, Chair, Consumer Financial Services Group and Editor-in-Chief of CFPB Monitor blog at Ballard Spahr LLP"After the 2008 economic collapse, consumer, civil rights, and labor groups went 'all in' for then-professor Elizabeth Warren’s idea of a consumer agency to protect pocketbooks and wallets. Now, just after the CFPB’s fifth birthday, Kirsch and Squires go behind the scenes to explore why some of the young agency’s leaders moved in the directions that they did to fight the endemic problems that CFPB director Richard Cordray calls the 'four Ds: deception, debt traps, dead ends, and discrimination.' The book is an important addition to the public record about an agency that is controversial only to the powerful special interests that oppose it but necessary to the consumers who have a safer financial marketplace because of it."—Edmund Mierzwinski, U.S. PIRG Consumer Program Director and Senior Fellow"An indispensable account of the birth of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and its tumultuous early years, with a richly documented analysis of the Bureau’s pivotal battles to tame the nation’s mortgage market and police discrimination in auto lending. Drawing on extensive interviews with enthusiasts as well as critics, this volume offers an invaluable resource for those seeking to evaluate continuing debates over the future of the CFPB."—Howell E. Jackson, James S. Reid Jr., Professor of Law, Harvard Law School"Meltdown examines the clash of incentives of the key political and industry players in a thoroughly-researched account of the complex, tragic, and sometimes scandalous machinations of the financial services system, as well as the regulatory solutions designed to correct them. Kirsch and Squires are the first to put forth a rigorous analysis of the evolution and impact of Senator Elizabeth Warren’s original vision for consumer financial protection."—Vanessa Gail Perry, PhD, Professor of Marketing, Strategic Management and Public Policy, The George Washington University School of Business"Kirsch and Squires are consumer law shamans who have a deep contextual understanding of the consumer market and the competing interests of all its market participants. They are clearly adept at much more than reading tea leaves and their extensive experience and engaging manner of addressing the topic at hand makes Meltdown a gripping read and a thought-provoking biography of the CFPB and the importance of context for purposes of charting the regulatory maze. This book is a must–read for consumer agencies and anyone with a keen interest in consumer law. It is clearly most timely in view of the political interest in the CFPB in the US Congress and Administration. I will definitely be passing it on to my colleagues at the soon-to-be established Financial Sector Conduct Authority that forms part of South Africa’s imminent move towards a Twin Peaks System of regulation and am confident that studying the observations by Kirsch and Squires will avoid many 'lift-off' headaches and a sharper focus for future intervention."—Corlia Van Heerden, Professor and Barclays Africa Chair in Banking Law in Africa, University of Pretoria, Faculty of Law, South Africa

Education[edit]
Squire received a B.A. from Oberlin College, where he studied with Celeste McCollough and a Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he studied under the mentorship of Peter Schiller and Hans-Lukas Teuber.[1] He subsequently completed a postdoctoral fellowship at Albert Einstein College of Medicine.[2]
Career[edit]
Next Squire accepted a position as a faculty member at the University of California, San Diego, where he has remained since. His publications include more than 480 research articles and two books: Memory and Brain (Oxford Press, 1987) and Memory: From Mind to Molecules with Eric Kandel (Roberts & Co., 2nd Ed, 2009). He is also Senior Editor of the textbook, Fundamental Neuroscience, now in its 4th Edition and Editor-in-Chief of The History of Neuroscience in Autobiography (now in eight volumes).[1]
Larry Squire illuminated the anatomy and phenotype of human memory impairment, identified the anatomical components of the medial temporal lobe memory system (with Stuart Zola), pioneered the biological distinction between declarative and nondeclarative memory, explored the conscious and unconscious memory systems of the mammalian brain, and helped establish the standard account of memory consolidation.[1]
Honors and awards[edit]
In 1993-1994, Squire served as President of the Society for Neuroscience.[3] He is an elected member of the National Academy of Sciences as of 1993,[4] and served on the governing Council from 2009 to 2012. He has also been elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences,[1] American Philosophical Society as of 1996,[5] and National Academy of Medicine (formerly The Institute of Medicine) as of 2000.[6]
He received the Charles A. Dana Award for Pioneering Achievements in Health in 1993,[7] the Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award from the American Psychological Association in 1993,[8] the William James Fellow of the Association for Psychological Science in 1994,[9] the William Middleton Award from the United States Department of Veterans Affairs in 1994,[10] the Metropolitan Life Award for Medical Research in 1999,[11] the Karl Spencer Lashley Award from the American Philosophical Society in 1995, "for his seminal contribution to the delineation of implicit and explicit memory systems in the brain",[12] the McGovern Award from the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2004,[13] the Herbert Crosby Warren Medal from the Society of Experimental Psychologists in 2007,[14] the Award for Scientific Reviewing from the National Academy of Sciences in 2012,[15] and the Goldman-Rakic Prize from the Brain & Behavior Research Foundation in 2012.[16]

Education[edit]
Squire received a B.A. from Oberlin College, where he studied with Celeste McCollough and a Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he studied under the mentorship of Peter Schiller and Hans-Lukas Teuber.[1] He subsequently completed a postdoctoral fellowship at Albert Einstein College of Medicine.[2]
Career[edit]
Next Squire accepted a position as a faculty member at the University of California, San Diego, where he has remained since. His publications include more than 480 research articles and two books: Memory and Brain (Oxford Press, 1987) and Memory: From Mind to Molecules with Eric Kandel (Roberts & Co., 2nd Ed, 2009). He is also Senior Editor of the textbook, Fundamental Neuroscience, now in its 4th Edition and Editor-in-Chief of The History of Neuroscience in Autobiography (now in eight volumes).[1]
Larry Squire illuminated the anatomy and phenotype of human memory impairment, identified the anatomical components of the medial temporal lobe memory system (with Stuart Zola), pioneered the biological distinction between declarative and nondeclarative memory, explored the conscious and unconscious memory systems of the mammalian brain, and helped establish the standard account of memory consolidation.[1]
Honors and awards[edit]
In 1993-1994, Squire served as President of the Society for Neuroscience.[3] He is an elected member of the National Academy of Sciences as of 1993,[4] and served on the governing Council from 2009 to 2012. He has also been elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences,[1] American Philosophical Society as of 1996,[5] and National Academy of Medicine (formerly The Institute of Medicine) as of 2000.[6]
He received the Charles A. Dana Award for Pioneering Achievements in Health in 1993,[7] the Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award from the American Psychological Association in 1993,[8] the William James Fellow of the Association for Psychological Science in 1994,[9] the William Middleton Award from the United States Department of Veterans Affairs in 1994,[10] the Metropolitan Life Award for Medical Research in 1999,[11] the Karl Spencer Lashley Award from the American Philosophical Society in 1995, "for his seminal contribution to the delineation of implicit and explicit memory systems in the brain",[12] the McGovern Award from the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2004,[13] the Herbert Crosby Warren Medal from the Society of Experimental Psychologists in 2007,[14] the Award for Scientific Reviewing from the National Academy of Sciences in 2012,[15] and the Goldman-Rakic Prize from the Brain & Behavior Research Foundation in 2012.[16]

Larry Ryan Squire (most often Larry R. Squire; born May 4, 1941) is a professor of psychiatry, neurosciences, and psychology at the University of California, San Diego, and a Senior Research Career Scientist at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center, San Diego. He is a leading investigator of the neurological bases of memory, which he studies using animal models and human patients with memory impairment.

Education[edit]
Squire received a B.A. from Oberlin College, where he studied with Celeste McCollough and a Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he studied under the mentorship of Peter Schiller and Hans-Lukas Teuber.[1] He subsequently completed a postdoctoral fellowship at Albert Einstein College of Medicine.[2]
Career[edit]
Next Squire accepted a position as a faculty member at the University of California, San Diego, where he has remained since. His publications include more than 480 research articles and two books: Memory and Brain (Oxford Press, 1987) and Memory: From Mind to Molecules with Eric Kandel (Roberts & Co., 2nd Ed, 2009). He is also Senior Editor of the textbook, Fundamental Neuroscience, now in its 4th Edition and Editor-in-Chief of The History of Neuroscience in Autobiography (now in eight volumes).[1]
Larry Squire illuminated the anatomy and phenotype of human memory impairment, identified the anatomical components of the medial temporal lobe memory system (with Stuart Zola), pioneered the biological distinction between declarative and nondeclarative memory, explored the conscious and unconscious memory systems of the mammalian brain, and helped establish the standard account of memory consolidation.[1]
Honors and awards[edit]
In 1993-1994, Squire served as President of the Society for Neuroscience.[3] He is an elected member of the National Academy of Sciences as of 1993,[4] and served on the governing Council from 2009 to 2012. He has also been elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences,[1] American Philosophical Society as of 1996,[5] and National Academy of Medicine (formerly The Institute of Medicine) as of 2000.[6]
He received the Charles A. Dana Award for Pioneering Achievements in Health in 1993,[7] the Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award from the American Psychological Association in 1993,[8] the William James Fellow of the Association for Psychological Science in 1994,[9] the William Middleton Award from the United States Department of Veterans Affairs in 1994,[10] the Metropolitan Life Award for Medical Research in 1999,[11] the Karl Spencer Lashley Award from the American Philosophical Society in 1995, "for his seminal contribution to the delineation of implicit and explicit memory systems in the brain",[12] the McGovern Award from the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2004,[13] the Herbert Crosby Warren Medal from the Society of Experimental Psychologists in 2007,[14] the Award for Scientific Reviewing from the National Academy of Sciences in 2012,[15] and the Goldman-Rakic Prize from the Brain & Behavior Research Foundation in 2012.[16]
