Dr. Ananth Naman VP R&D, Cabot Microelectronics
He held positions in research and development at Seagate.

        This is a Press Release edited by StorageNewsletter.com on 2011.01.17





 



Cabot Microelectronics Corporation announced the appointment of Ananth Naman to the position of Vice President, Research and Development. 
Dr. Naman succeeds Dr. Clifford L. Spiro, who has decided to leave the
company to pursue other opportunities; Dr. Spiro has served in the role
since 2003. Dr. Naman reports directly to William P. Noglows, Cabot Microelectronics' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
Dr. Naman brings to his new role extensive technical and leadership
experience in a range of semiconductor materials and electronics related
businesses. He originally joined Cabot Microelectronics in 2006 as
Manager of Research and Development for the company's pad products. From
2006 through 2009 he provided key leadership to the successful
development and commercialization of the company's Epic D100 pad. His
most recent role has been as Director of Product Development for the
company's slurry products for polishing copper, barrier and tungsten, as
well as for pads. Prior to joining Cabot Microelectronics, Dr. Naman
managed research and development efforts for Honeywell's Electronic Materials Division,
focusing on wafer fab materials and semiconductor device packaging.
Before that he held positions in research and development at Seagate
Technology, a global leader in hard disk drives. 
Dr. Naman earned his BS, MS and PhD degrees in Material Science and Engineering from the University of Florida.
With Dr. Naman's appointment, Dr. Spiro now assumes the non-executive
role of Chief Technology Officer on a transitional basis, providing
support to the company and Dr. Naman through his planned mid calendar
year 2011 departure.
"Ananth Naman brings to his new role a very successful track record
in leading product development efforts in our rapidly growing pad
business, as well as broad and deep experience in semiconductor
materials and electronics. He has a very clear understanding of the
particular technical needs of our semiconductor customers, and I am
confident that under his leadership of our research and development
efforts we will continue to provide optimized technical solutions based
on broad and deep collaboration with our customers," stated Mr. Noglows. "At
this time, I also want to offer my sincere thanks to Cliff Spiro for
his dedicated leadership and many contributions to our company over his
seven years of service. During Cliff's tenure, he replenished our new
product pipeline by leading the development of a robust portfolio of new
products that I believe position us well for continued success. He also
stewarded a six sigma culture within our research and development area
which has fostered a more disciplined, systematic and productive
approach to innovation. Additionally, our company has been the
beneficiary of Cliff's extensive network of contacts within industry and
academia, at the very highest levels. We look forward to his continued
support through the transitional period, and offer our best wishes for
his future endeavors."
