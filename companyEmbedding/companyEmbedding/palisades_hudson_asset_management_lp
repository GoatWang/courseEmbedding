				About Us			










The Palisades Hudson Story: Then and Now
Larry Elkin, 2001  Photo Credit: Jessica Elkin
At the end of 1992, Larry Elkin decided to take his professional life into his own hands. He left his position as a senior manager at mega-accounting firm Arthur Andersen and opened his own office. After others joined him it was known as Larry M. Elkin & Co., the enterprise that would eventually become Palisades Hudson Financial Group.
For the first year, Larry worked alone in a small office in a converted movie house in Hastings on Hudson, New York. Having very few clients at first left him with a lot of time, so he started a newsletter and wrote a book: Financial Self-Defense for Unmarried Couples, the first book to specifically address that topic. An executive at Bankers Trust noticed the newsletter, and hired Larry for a series of consulting projects. That kept him busy until a large paper company retained him to help its senior executives manage their personal financial matters. Those early projects led to more business, and Palisades Hudson was on its way.

It was right around that time that Larry hired his first employees. From the beginning, most of Palisades Hudson’s staff have joined us early in their careers, often straight out of school. Our goal, for those staff members who prove to be a good fit, is to keep them as long as possible. In those early years, everyone worked within arm’s reach; today, our staff is still close-knit, but we work out of offices in five states and travel to see clients across the country and abroad, wherever they choose to live and work.
Palisades Hudson is now truly a national firm. Even so, our staff maintains an integrated approach to our work and an authentic interest in one another’s accomplishments, both professional and personal. Similarly, we take a genuine interest in the lives of our clients, well beyond their personal finances. Our clients, in turn, regularly refer their friends and relatives to us, which is the highest compliment anyone can pay a professional adviser. Today, those clients include children and grandchildren of people whom Larry first counseled 20 or even 25 years ago, prior to setting out on his own.
Larry Elkin, 2001  Photo Credit: Jessica Elkin
There are some great-grandchildren on our client list, too. They are still young enough that the majority of our service consists of buying an occasional toy or book to amuse them when we pay their parents a visit. But children grow. And Palisades Hudson has every intention of growing right along with them.

Lessons From The Nashville Flood Of 2010



June 6, 2017  
By Thomas Walsh, CFP®

Comments Off on Lessons From The Nashville Flood Of 2010






Singer David Allan Coe famously said that the perfect country song had to contain “Mama, or trains, or trucks, or prison, or gettin’ drunk.” Songwriter Steve Goodman obligingly added a verse containing all five to “You Never Even Called Me By My Name.” The song’s popularity demonstrates that country fans have a sense of humor about the disasters that fill the lyrics of some of the genre’s most famous songs. 
But the misery of the home of country music, Nashville, Tennessee, in 2010 was all too real.Read More

Can Passive Investing Succeed Too Well?



June 6, 2017  
By Paul Jacobs, CFP®, EA

Comments Off on Can Passive Investing Succeed Too Well?






In August 2016, the investment firm Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. released the provocatively titled report: “The Silent Road to Serfdom: Why Passive Investing Is Worse Than Marxism.” The report’s prediction was that, unless regulators and politicians took precautions, index fund growth could distort the financial markets and lead to massive mispricing of securities. Indexing is becoming more and more popular, the theory went, and if everyone chooses indexing, the system will break down because no one will pay attention to stock prices anymore.Read More

Reporting Requirements For Foreign Assets



April 4, 2017  
By Melinda Kibler, CFP®, EA

Comments Off on Reporting Requirements For Foreign Assets






The term “offshore accounts” is often used as shorthand to suggest that such account holders are trying to dodge tax responsibilities. Especially after the Panama Papers, many observers are quick to assume the worst when someone holds assets outside of the United States. In reality, many, if not most, taxpayers who hold foreign assets do so in good faith for a variety of legitimate reasons. However, depending on the type of property in question and the taxpayer’s overall situation, keeping the Internal Revenue Service adequately informed can prove challenging.Read More

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Graco (NYSE:GGG) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Sell Rating, 3 Hold RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 1.75)Consensus Price Target: $101.00 (12.47% downside)

The company’s second-quarter 2017 earnings easily outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate, mainly driven by improvement in revenues. The company's efforts to expand its footprint in newer markets, an improving rate scenario and expectation of lesser regulations are expected to boost revenues further. While rising expenses and a significant exposure to real estate loans remain near-term concerns, strong loan and deposit balance should support its profitability. Given a solid liquidity position, the company should be able to continue with its capital deployment activities, thus enhancing shareholder value." (7/17/2017)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Commerce Bancshares (NASDAQ:CBSH) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 2 Sell Ratings, 5 Hold RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 1.71)Consensus Price Target: $53.57 (7.36% downside)

Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time. I've been really satisfied for the most part. They report quickly and accurately, remind me when my bill is due, and the customer service has been kind and thorough....show more

Academy Bank


                                            They cancelled my secured credit card without informing me.  Did not refund the money from secured card without me calling,. Guess they thought I might forget.  Will be closing all accounts with them today.  Worst customer service of any bank I've dealt with

Alfa Insurance


                                            I have (had) been with Alfa for 23 years. Over the course of the last few years, my premiums kept going up. $20 here, $30 there - well, this last time it went up over $200 with the new renewal. I have a perfect driving record- no tickets, no wrecks- and yet my insurance jumps up...show more

                                            I've had a NetSpend prepaid debit card for approximately 3 years. Up until recently I've had no problem.

PenFed Credit Union


                                            HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! They do not work with you at all to satisfy the customer. Other credit unions help you ESPECIALLY if you have great credit. This CU doesn't tell you everything so verify everything with two other reps. Total Nightmare!
