LETTER FROM THE PRESIDENT                                                       

[PHOTO] ANDREW M. McCULLAGH, JR.                                                
PRESIDENT                                                       

Dear Shareholder:                                                               

Since our last report, the headline story in the municipal bond market has been 
the demise of a radical tax reform. One of the best ways to illustrate this     
demise is to look at how municipal bonds have traded in relation to Treasury    
securities. At the height of the tax reform scare -- when Steve Forbes was      
campaigning on his Flat Tax platform in January 1996 -- long municipal          
securities were trading at a very cheap 90% of Treasuries. At the time of this  
report, market fears have abated and municipal bonds are trading at a more      
traditional 81%.                                                                

We believe the issue of reforming the tax code is far from thoroughly closed.   
And it is likely -- in this a U.S. presidential election year -- that we may see
renewed discussions about less radical tax reforms. However, as is often the    
case in the financial markets, we believe these times of short-term volatility  
and uncertainty represent good opportunities for long-term investors.           

At Voyageur, we continue to stress the importance of maintaining a long-term    
view -- in both the investment horizons of our shareholders and in our approach 
to purchasing securities for the Voyageur Tax Free Funds. In order to select the
best long-term securities for the funds, we favor purchasing negotiated new     
municipal issues over those in the secondary or competitive market.             

Unlike the taxable bond market where the structure of new bond issues are       
frequently predetermined and fixed, we have more flexibility and negotiating    
power in determining how a municipal bond issue will be structured. In many     
cases, our credit research analysts -- who are experienced experts in the area  
of municipal bond transactions -- work closely with municipal bond issuers to   
determine the appropriate structure for new bond issues. Our analysts' intimate 
knowledge of what's in the market and their ability to actually dissect         
individual municipal securities helps us to determine appropriate prices that   
accurately reflect an issuer's strength and value while assisting us in         
protecting our shareholders' interests. They also help us pinpoint rising and   
falling stars -- bonds whose credits may be upgraded or downgraded -- in the    
municipal market.                                                               

We remain committed to providing our clients with the best investment products  
and services available in today's financial markets. The Voyageur Tax Free Funds
allow you access to a wide variety of national and state-specific municipal     
bonds funds, all of which are actively managed to meet their individual fund    
objectives.                                                                     

As part of our commitment to you, we have also redesigned our shareholder       
reports to provide you with more in-depth information about your Voyageur fund  
investments in an easier-to-read format. We welcome any comments you may have   
about these changes and encourage you to call our Voyageur Shareholder Services 
at 800.543.3863.                                                                

If at any time you have questions about your Voyageur fund investments, please  
contact your personal financial advisor or Voyageur Shareholder Services. Our   
Voyageur Shareholder Services 800 number -- known as Voyageur On Call(TM) --    
allows you 24-hour access, seven days a week to an automated voice response     
service with shareholder services representatives available from 8 a.m. to 5    
p.m. Central Standard Time.                                                     

We appreciate your continued patronage of Voyageur Funds and look forward to    
working with you and your financial advisors in creating products and services  
designed to bring you closer to your investment goals.                          

Sincerely,

COLORADO TAX FREE FUND.                                         
MR. McCULLAGH HAS MORE                                          
THAN 23 YEARS OF INVESTMENT                                     
INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE.                                            

For the six months ended June 30, 1996, the total return at net asset value     
(NAV) for the Voyageur Colorado Tax Free Fund's Class A shares was -1.01%.*     

Within the Fund, we maintained our long-term outlook for lower interest rates by
keeping our Fund's durations long as compared to the industry average. Although 
this caused the Fund's performance to lag slightly when interest rates rose, we 
believe the worst is over and are expecting to see a turnaround in interest     
rates later this year or early 1997.                                            

AREAS OF OPPORTUNITY                                                            
In the Fund's holdings, we remained committed to purchasing municipal bonds with
high credit ratings, emphasizing securities in the general obligation and health
care sectors.                                                                   

During the past six months, we continued to search for areas or sectors where we
could add value to the portfolios of the Voyageur Colorado Tax Free Fund. One   
such area has been to include investments that have added income to the fund.   
Although we still maintain our commitment to total return, we believe this      
addition of income will allow us to dampen the effects of market volatility     
while allowing our shareholders to benefit from higher income streams.          

We believe another area of opportunity is our investment in the Lowry           
Redevelopment Agency, which represents 3.6% of the Fund's total assets. The     
Lowry Redevelopment Agency is redeveloping the property that was once Lowry Air 
Force Base before the government shut it down. We believe this property -- which
is 15 minutes from downtown Denver -- should prove to be an attractive          
investment for the fund.                                                        

In order to attempt to protect our shareholders' current income level for a     
longer period of time, we have continued to take advantage of opportunities to  
to extend the Fund's call protection. Due to this focus, the Fund now has an    
average call protection of approximately eight years.                           

OUTLOOK FOR THE MUNICIPAL MARKET                                                
Unlike the Colorado of the 1980s, today the state is booming from a             
broader-based economy and population growth. Industries in Colorado include     
telecommunications, financial services, computers -- all in addition to the old 
mainstays of oil and tourism.                                                   

In the U.S. economy, we are still seeing signs of moderate growth with moderate 
inflation -- a trend we expect to see continue for the remainder of the year.   
Our outlook for the municipal market continues to be favorable, and we expect   
interest rates to decline over the long term. This has caused us to maintain a  
longer duration in the Fund in order to take advantage of this trend.           

*Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

contingent deferred sales charge and such shares automatically convert to Class 
A after eight years. Class C Shares may be subject to a contingent deferred     
sales charge and have no conversion feature. All classes of shares have         
identical voting, dividend, liquidation and other rights and the same terms and 
conditions, except that the level of distribution fees charged differs between  
classes. Income, expenses (other than expenses incurred under each class'       
Distribution Agreement) and realized and unrealized gains or losses on          
investments are allocated to each class of shares based upon its relative net   
assets.                                                                         

    Pursuant to its amended articles of incorporation, Voyageur Mutual Funds
II, Inc. has 10 trillion shares of authorized capital stock that may be issued  
in one or more series.                                                          

      The significant accounting policies followed by the Fund are summarized as
follows:                                                                        

USE OF ESTIMATES                                                                

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and        
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and      
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial    
statements and the reported amounts of net increase (decrease) in net assets    
from operations during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from   
those estimates.                                                                

INVESTMENTS IN SECURITIES                                                       

Securities are valued at fair value as determined by the Board of   
Directors. Determination of fair value involves, among other things, using      
pricing services or prices quoted by independent brokers. Short-term securities 
are valued at amortized cost which approximates market value.                   

 Security transactions are accounted for on the trade date. Securities
gains and losses are calculated on the identified-cost basis. Interest income,  
including level-yield amortization of premium and original issue discount, is   
accrued daily.                                                                  

      The Fund concentrates its investments in a single state, and therefore may
have more credit risk related to the economic conditions of the state of        
Colorado than a portfolio with broader geographical diversification.            

SECURITIES PURCHASED ON A WHEN-ISSUED BASIS                                     

     Delivery and payment for securities which have been purchased by the Fund
on a forward commitment or when-issued basis can take place up to a month or    
more after the transaction date. During this period, such securities are subject
to market fluctuations and the portfolio maintains, in a segregated account with
its custodian, assets with a market value equal to or greater than the amount of
its purchase commitments.                                                       

FEDERAL TAXES                                                                   

The Fund's policy is to comply with the requirements of the Internal
Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to distribute all 
of its taxable income to shareholders in amounts that will avoid or minimize    
federal income or excise taxes for the Fund. Net investment income and net      
realized gains (losses) for the Fund may differ for financial statement and tax 
purposes primarily because of losses deferred for tax purposes due to "wash     
sale" transactions. The character of distributions made during the year from net
investment income or net realized gains may differ from their ultimate          
characterization for federal income tax purposes. The effect on dividend        
distributions on certain book-to-tax differences is reflected as excess         
distributions of net realized gains in the statement of changes in net assets.  
Also, due to the timing of dividend distributions, the fiscal year in which     
amounts are distributed may differ from the year that the income or realized    
gains (losses) were recorded by the Fund. For federal income tax purposes,      
Colorado Tax Free Fund had a capital loss carryover at December 31, 1995, of    
$8,359,188 that will expire in 2003 if not offset by subsequent capital gains.  
It is unlikely the Board of Directors will authorize a distribution of any net  
realized capital gains until the available capital loss carryover has been      
offset or expires.                                                              

DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS                                                   

      Dividends declared daily from net investment income are payable monthly in
cash or reinvested in additional shares of the Fund. Net short-term realized    
capital gains, if any, may be distributed throughout the year and net long-term 
realized capital gains, when available, are distributed annually.               

(2) SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS                                                     

     Purchase cost and proceeds from sales of securities other than short-term
securities aggregated $102,589,357 and $115,203,471, respectively, for the six  
months ended June 30, 1996.                                                     

(3) EXPENSES                                                                    

      The Fund has an investment advisory and management agreement with Voyageur
Fund Managers, Inc. (Voyageur) under which Voyageur manages the Fund's assets   
and provides other specified services. The fee for investment management and    
advisory services is paid monthly and is based on the average daily net assets  
of the Fund at the annual rate of .50%. In addition, the Fund will pay most     
other operating expenses including directors' fees, registration fees, printing 
of shareholder reports, legal and auditing services and other miscellaneous     
expenses. Voyageur is obligated to pay all expenses of the Fund (excluding      
distribution fees, insurance premiums on portfolio securities, taxes, interest  
and brokerage commissions) which exceed 1% of average daily net assets, on an   
annual basis.                                                                   

      The Fund will also pay a fee to Voyageur for acting as the Fund's dividend
disbursing, administrative and accounting services agent. The fee is paid       
monthly and is equal to the sum of $1.33 per shareholder account per month, a   
fixed monthly fee ranging from $1,000 to $1,500 based on the level of the Fund's
average daily net assets and an annualized percentage of average daily net      
assets at reducing rates from .11% to .02%. The Fund is also responsible for    
reimbursing Voyageur's out-of-pocket expense in connection with the performance 
of dividend-disbursing, administrative and accounting services.                 

     Each class of shares has a Distribution Agreement under Rule 12b-1 of the
Investment Company Act of 1940 with Voyageur Fund Distributors, Inc. (Fund      
Distributors). Under these plans the Fund is obligated to pay Fund Distributors 
a monthly distribution fee at an annual rate of .25% of average daily net assets
of the Class A Shares and 1.00% of average daily net assets of the Class B and  
Class C Shares. Fund Distributors may waive all or part of its distribution fees
at its sole discretion. During the six months ended June 30, 1996, Fund         
Distributors voluntarily waived Class A distribution fees of $262,824 and Class 
B distribution fees of $1,297.                                                  

     Sales charges paid by Class A shareholders were $309,042. Of this amount,
Fund Distributors received $53,394. Contingent deferred sales charges for the   
six months ended June 30, 1996 were $6,283 for Class B shareholders.            

(4) SHARE TRANSACTIONS

and December 31, 1995 were as follows:

(a)    For federal income tax purposes, all of the net investment income        
distributions were derived from interest on securities exempt from
     federal income tax. For Class A Shares for the years ended December 31,
1993, 1992, 1991 and 1990, $.01 per share of the distributions from net
investment income were subject to state income tax.               
(b)    Total investment return is based on the change in net asset value of a   
      share during the period and assumes reinvestment of distributions at net
asset value and does not reflect the impact of a sales charge.    
(c)    For the periods ended June 30, 1996, December 31, 1995 and 1994, Fund    
       Distributors voluntarily waived a portion of their distribution fees. The
   annual contractual expense limit for the Fund (excluding distribution
   fees, insurance premiums on portfolio securities, taxes, interest and
   brokerage commissions) is 1% of average daily net assets. The maximum
       distribution fee is .25% of the Fund's average daily net assets for Class
       A Shares and 1.00% of the Fund's average daily net assets for Class B and
Class C Shares.                                                   
(d)    Commencement of operations.                                              
(e)    Annualized.                                                              
(f)    Beginning in the year ended December 31, 1995, the expense ratio reflects
the effect of gross expenses attributable to earnings credits on  
 uninvested cash balances received by the Fund. Prior period expense
ratios have not been adjusted.
