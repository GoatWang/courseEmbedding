      Fitch Rates Ford Credit Auto Lease Trust 2016-A
    





March 22, 2016 11:44 AM Eastern Daylight Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has assigned the following ratings and Outlooks to the 
      Ford Credit Auto Lease Trust 2016-A (FCALT 2016-A) notes:
    

      --$167,000,000 class A-1 notes 'F1+sf';
    

      --$213,000,000 class A-2a notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$200,000,000 class A-2b notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$228,000,000 class A-3 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$94,000,000 class A-4 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$50,700,000 class B notes 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$47,300,000 class C notes 'NR'.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Strong Credit Quality: Credit quality for the pool is consistent with 
      that of recent pools. The weighted average (WA) Fair Isaac Corp. (FICO) 
      score is 742, and WA original term is 35.2 months, with 88.4% of the 
      leases with terms of 36 months or more. The pool is geographically 
      diverse with approximately 11.5 months of seasoning and comprises 100% 
      new vehicles.
    

      Diversified Lease Maturities: 2016-A consists of 73.4% undiscounted base 
      residual value (RV), in line with prior pools. The lease maturities are 
      well distributed. The single highest month of residual maturities 
      represents 5.7% (compared to 6.3% in 2015-B) occurring in May 2018. The 
      maximum three-month, six-month, and 12-month residual value maturity 
      concentrations are 16.4%, 27.9% and 54.2%, respectively, down from prior 
      transactions.
    

      Adequate Credit Enhancement Structure: 2016-A is a sequential-pay 
      structure. Initial hard credit enhancement (CE) for the class A notes 
      totals 20.40% (8.70% subordinated class B and C notes, 11.20% initial 
      overcollateralization [OC], and 0.50% reserve). Initial excess spread is 
      4.11% per annum.
    

      Evolving Wholesale Market: The U.S. wholesale vehicle market has been 
      normalizing following strong performance in recent years. Fitch expects 
      that increasing off-lease vehicle supply and pressure from increased 
      production levels will lead to decreased residual realizations during 
      the life of the transaction.
    

      Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: Ford Credit demonstrates 
      good capabilities as originator, underwriter and servicer, as evidenced 
      by historical delinquency, credit, and residual value loss performance 
      of its managed portfolio and securitizations.
    

      Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should 
      provide that a bankruptcy of Ford Credit would not impair the timeliness 
      of payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated decreases in the value of returned vehicles and/or 
      increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted 
      receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case and 
      would likely result in declines of CE and loss coverage levels available 
      to the notes. Hence, Fitch conducts sensitivity analyses by increasing 
      the transaction's initial base case RV and credit loss assumptions and 
      examining the rating implications on all classes of issued notes. The 
      increases to the base case losses are applied such that they represent 
      moderate (1.5x) and severe (2.5x) stresses, and are intended to provide 
      an indication of the rating sensitivity of notes to unexpected 
      deterioration of a trust's performance.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from 
      PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. The third-party due diligence focused on a 
      comparison and re-computation of certain characteristics with respect to 
      125 sample leases. Fitch considered this information in its analysis and 
      the findings did not have an impact on our analysis/conclusions. A copy 
      of the ABS Due Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch in connection with 
      this transaction may be obtained through the link at the bottom of the 
      rating action commentary.
    

      Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the 
      presale report dated March 10, 2016. Fitch's analysis of the 
      Representations and Warranties (R&W) of this transaction can be found in 
      'Ford Credit Auto Lease Trust 2016-A - Appendix'. These R&Ws are 
      compared to those of typical R&W for the asset class as detailed in the 
      special report 'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms 
      in Global Structured Finance Transactions' dated March 2016.
