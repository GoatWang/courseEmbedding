Ruggles takes 'green' approach to new Fort Bend eatery

A number of new restaurants are opening in Fort Bend County, including one that could become known as the most environmentally friendly restaurant in the United States.
Ruggles Green already operates the "greenest" restaurant in Texas, said Federico Marques, vice president of marketing and co-founder of Ruggles Green.
However, the Houston-based restaurant chain's investors are pushing for its third and newest location in Sugar Land to become the highest-rated green restaurant in the country.



Set to open in September at 15903 City Walk in Sugar Land Town Square, Ruggles Green will offer organic food that is free of hormones and preservatives. The restaurant's investors, Green Café Management and GJR Partners, also have pledged to follow guidelines of the nonprofit Green Restaurant Association to reduce use of water and energy while cutting waste and pollution.
The GRA provides environmental assessments, consulting and a certification program to help restaurants become more environmentally sustainable. The highest certification rating a restaurant can earn is four stars.
"We want our Sugar Land restaurant to become the first five-star green restaurant, which could make it the greenest in the world, actually," said Marques.
The restaurant will have energy-efficient LED lighting, sustainable building materials such as bamboo, reclaimed woods and repurposed items. Herb gardens and hydroponic plant systems are to be featured inside the restaurant and outside in the eatery's patio area.
Menu selections include standard fare such as salads, sandwiches, burgers, tacos, pastas and wood-fired pizza.
"I would say our menu is moderately priced in the $10 to $20 range for our specials," Marques said. "Our standard menu for entrees is probably in the $12 to $14 range."
Ruggles Green also offers organic, gluten-free and vegetarian menu items. Marques said the fast-casual, made-to-order food from the restaurant is friendly to those who may suffer from food allergies. More than 80 percent of the eatery's menu can be ordered gluten-free.
"We felt residents would be very receptive of our concept," Marques said. "There are a lot of people who have gluten issues and food allergies we felt we could address."
Ruggles Green's investors looked at different areas before deciding to build in Fort Bend County. The Sugar Land area, Marques said, fit the restaurant chain's model of healthy eating.
"The main thing we liked about Fort Bend County is it is a pretty tightknit community," he said. "Also, the demographics are good in Fort Bend County. The population continues to increase pretty dramatically."
Marques said the Sugar Land area has a more international residential makeup of young professionals with a higher discretionary income base. Also, the restaurant's visibility off of Texas 6 became a strong deciding factor in selecting the site.
"And, Whole Foods Market is nearby, which also helps," he said. The restaurant is about a quarter mile from Whole Foods.
Ruggles Green is planning a grand opening for its Sugar Land location in late September. The restaurant is planning to conduct a fundraiser to benefit Keep Sugar Land Beautiful, a nonprofit community beautification program.
Marques said the restaurant industry overall is strong and continues to increase in sales since the financial decline in 2008. Fort Bend County residents, he said, have a variety of restaurants to choose from and no longer have to drive to Houston to find a good meal.
Sugar Land Town Square, a Planned Community Developers Ltd. retail center, has been a popular destination for food and drink establishments. The retail center has more than 20 with lease agreements, said Charlie Adams, PCD vice president of retail.
In addition to Ruggles Green, a couple more restaurants are planning to open in the development, including another healthy eating establishment called Salata. The "create-your-own" salad bar will offer diners the opportunity to customize salads and wraps with a variety of fresh ingredients. Salata will also offer a Greek yogurt bar and accompaniments for breakfast and afternoon snacks.
Salata is planned to open at 2170 Town Square Place in November.
PCD also recently announced that Aura Brasserie Moderne, an American-French cuisine restaurant, would relocate to Town Square in September. Fort Bend residents, husband and wife team Frederic and Michelle Perrier are moving the restaurant from Missouri City where it was located for five years. Aura will relocate to 15997 City Walk.
"We've really enjoyed creating dishes not only for those who appreciate a great steak or fish, but also for those willing to think outside the box," said Frederic Perrier, who is also the restaurant's chef. "With our casually elegant atmosphere, superior service and menu variety, we believe Aura will appeal to Sugar Land Town Square diners. So many of our current customers have expressed their wishes for a Sugar Land location, and we are very excited to bring them one."
Rosenberg growth
Sugar Land isn't the only Fort Bend community to see new restaurants. A few high-profile restaurants are under construction or currently in the planning stages in Rosenberg, said Matt Fielder, city of Rosenberg Economic Development Corp. director.
Among them is fast food chain Carl's Jr., scheduled to open Sept. 27. Franchisee Amin Dhanani, of Zubha Foods LLC., said Rosenberg was selected for the restaurant because of the area's fast-growing market.
"The site is located in the Brazos Town Center, where major retail is," Dhanani said.
Featuring a line of charbroiled burgers, Carl's Jr. also offers hand-breaded chicken tenders and its popular Made From Scratch Biscuits and low-carb food selections.
The restaurant's drive-through window will be open 24 hours and the dining room will close at midnight.
Bull Creek Café & Grill is also set to open in Rosenberg. The restaurant, located at 918 San Jacinto St., will feature home-style meals, according to its website.
Although there is not a lot of restaurant activity under way in the county's east side, Missouri City Economic Development Corp. director Bob Graf said the community will see a couple of new fast-food restaurants from the chains Taco Bell and Raising Cane's Chicken Fingers.
"The newest restaurant that opened about 30 days ago is Louisiana Home Style Kitchen," Graf said. "We've been waiting on it for a long time. It offers Cajun-styled seafood. Another new restaurant is Don Julio's, which offers Tex-Mex."
Graf is sure more restaurants will be coming to Missouri City when a new Wal-Mart opens off of Texas 6.

Fintech Focus for : The Revival of Local Distilleries



Fintech Focus












August 2013


































 




Craft Beer Hits Hotel Taps
The most commonly asked question at bars today is “what  kind of local beer do you have?” �To  expand their answer, hotels nationwide are embracing the rapid growth of the  craft beer industry, which has more than doubled in sales over the last six  years. 
In addition to smaller boutique hotels, several  large hotel chains like the Four Seasons Hotel, Fairmont Hotels, and Sheraton are now offering an extensive craft beer selection to guests and  providing a taste of the local community.
With the success of the product,  hotels are also expanding partnerships with local breweries to produce their  own in house brews and tailor promotions around featured beers for not only  hotel guests, but area locals.






New York Distilleries Make a Comeback
A little more than a century ago, New York consisted of  thousands of distilleries that produced whiskey, gin, and a variety of other spirits to  customers throughout the country. However, once Prohibition hit in 1920, all  taps went dry and production either went extinct or underground.
With the repeal of Prohibition in 1933, liquor production  was only feasible for a few large distilleries. It wasn’t until the 21st  century, that small boutique distilleries in New York began their revival, motivating  distillers to utilize the state’s locally grown organic farm products to start  up once again.
Today, New York is home to 30 craft distilleries and alcohol  production is one of the state’s fastest growing industries. The rebirth of New  York’s distilling industry has led to diversified product placement in  restaurants, liquor stores, and farmers markets - making a great economic impact  on the area.









Kelly Fuels Inc.Kelly  Fuels, Inc. is a nine store chain located in the heart of Central Michigan.  Their mission is to provide the highest quality products, with friendly  service, in a clean and safe environment.
Recently,  Kelly Fuels rolled out a new train depot logo in a majority of its stores. The new  design includes oversized train wheels located over the ‘Express Checkout’ and  features bold, bright and contrasting colors.
Kelly  Fuels was featured in Convenience Store Decisions magazine and was awarded  ‘Best Original Store Design, Honorable Mention’ by Convenience Store  News.
“We have been partners with Fintech for  over 10 years.  The ability to centralize our payments for beer and wine  purchases allows us to eliminate a task from our store managers, freeing them  up for the many other responsibilities that they have, and gives us confidence that  these transactions are handled effectively and efficiently.” – John L. Olds,  CFO of Kelly Fuels Inc.
3 Stacks Smoke & Tap House    3 Stacks Smoke & Tap House opened in February 2013  and is located in Frisco, Texas. The restaurant is named for the three large smokers that welcome diners upon entrance, each dedicated to  a different selection of meat.
3 Stacks aims to have customers taste the difference, by  serving a menu filled with quality slow smoked meats, homemade rubs &  sauces, seasonal side vegetables and daily baked breads.
Partners Trace Arnold and Jason Hall are committed to  serving quality, seasonal and fresh ingredients daily. Balancing the  extensive food menu is an all-American Tap House offering an extensive list  of local craft and regional beers.
"Fintech makes it simple to pay for our  liquor, beer and wine. We have an account with them and they pay the vendors  for us. Great deal, makes our life easier," - Jason Hall, Owner of 3  Stacks Smoke & Tap House

Ruggles Green acquisition opens door to expansion

Ruggles Green, which made its mark on the Houston restaurant scene offering locally sourced organic foods and vegan and gluten-free dishes in environmentally responsible settings, plans a major expansion after selling a majority stake to a private investment firm.
The fast-casual chain opened the first certified-green restaurant in Houston eight years ago and has since added four more in the area. It hopes to open 30 more, in both small towns and large metropolitan areas, over the next four years. The first two new locations are planned for Houston with a foray into Dallas in 2018.





On Tuesday, Ruggles Green announced it had sold to Hargett Hunter Capital Partners and will be under new management. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
"When we began seeking potential investors, it was only natural to seek an investment from Hargett Hunter," co-founder Federico Marques said in a statement, citing the firm's "operational expertise to execute at the level of excellence that we envision for Ruggles Green's future."

Marques and co-founder Robert Guillerman will remain involved through a consulting arrangement. Jason Morgan, former chief financial officer of Zoës Kitchen and a current Hargett Hunter managing partner, will serve as CEO of Ruggles Green and oversee day-to-day operations.
Bruce Molzan, another original founder, who currently runs Ruggles Black, will not be involved, Hargett Hunter managing partner Jeff Brock said.

The investment firm was founded last year in North Carolina and invests in restaurant companies generating annual revenue of $5 million to $100 million.
Morgan said Ruggles Green's food quality has stood out amount fast-casual competitors.
"You have to go to a fine dining restaurant to find something similar," he said.
Specialties include wood-fired quinoa macaroni and cheese, organic pizzas and a buffalo and a veggie-nut hemp burger.
Morgan, who spent about eight years at Zoës Kitchen, said Hargett Hunter is working on a prototype for all the new Ruggles locations to make the brand more recognizable.
He also said taking the company public is a possibility in the next six to eight years.
The Ruggles Green transaction marks Hargett Hunter's second investment this year. In July, it took a majority stake in Original ChopShop Co., based in Phoenix.
Brock said investors are looking to the fast-casual segment because millennials and younger generations are shifting that direction.
He said he also sees growth potential because Ruggles Green does equally well at lunch and dinner.

HOUSTON, Jan. 25, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- Green Cafe Management and GJR Partners are pleased to announce plans to open a third and fourth Ruggles Green restaurant during the next six months in Greater Houston.
The first location will be in the Heights and is scheduled to open in early May. A substantial renovation of the old 11th Street Cafe location will begin January. The focus is to maintain the charm of the historical old building, modernize the interior, while bringing it up to Ruggles Green standards for Green Certification. In addition, emphasis will be placed on delivering high quality local and organic food as well as excellent service, which Ruggles Green customers have grown to expect. 
The second location is being constructed in Sugar Land and is scheduled to open in early July. The Sugar Land location, in Town Square, will have an expansive patio designed to be family-friendly. Amenities include a private room for customer special events and accessible parking for customers and for take out needs.  
"We are extremely pleased by the progress we have made since opening our first location in River Oaks", said Federico Marques, VP/Marketing and Co-Founder.  "Our CityCentre location is the only 4-Star Certified Green Restaurant® in Texas and one of the greenest restaurants in the world.  Our Sugar Land location will be 4-Star certified and will maintain the quality of food and customer experience we are known for.  Our goal is to expand our children's healthy, organic, and gluten-free menu options and to continuously improve our sustainability model.  It is very gratifying to see the positive response to our Ruggles Green vision, which has allowed us to push forward with two new locations."
Robert Guillerman, VP/Operations and co-founder, states, "Our customers have expectations of high quality food, at an affordable price, with excellent service".  Our confidence lies in our employees and in the experience we have gained over the last three years.  We look forward to servicing more neighborhoods in the Greater Houston area and also in becoming a valued part of those communities.  We realize that every customer has unique needs and we work hard to ensure we live up and hopefully exceed their expectations".  
Jennifer McGehee, VP GJR Partnership, commented, "Our affiliation with Green Cafe Management was formed to provide the financial support they needed to expand the Ruggles Green franchise.  We are pleased to be associated with our Ruggles Green partners and to support their vision and leadership in the Green Restaurant movement. Moreover, we look forward to providing the capital and support for the new Heights and Sugar Land locations."

They set a wonderful example for the industry, and we look forward to going even further with them in the future."

Hargett Hunter Capital Partners has acquired a majority stake in Texas-based restaurant chain Ruggles Green. No financial terms were disclosed.
PRESS RELEASE
RALEIGH, N.C.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Hargett Hunter Capital Partners (“Hargett Hunter”), a North Carolina-based private investment firm focused exclusively on the hospitality industry, is pleased to announce that that it has acquired a majority stake in Ruggles Green (“Ruggles Green”) of Houston, Texas. Financial terms of the investment were not disclosed.
Founded in 2008, Ruggles Green is a premium fast-casual restaurant concept offering chef-inspired entrees, sandwiches, salads, burgers, pizza and pasta that incorporate local, often times organic, and seasonal items. With five current locations in the greater Houston, Texas area, Ruggles Green is a leader in providing extensive and high-quality vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free alternatives. As the first Certified Green Restaurant in Houston, Ruggles Green maintains an eco-friendly focus and a commitment to sustainability and the environment as evidenced by the certification of its CITYCENTRE restaurant as “The Greenest Restaurant in Texas.”
Hargett Hunter’s founder Jeff Brock shared, “Ruggles Green is one of the most balanced and high performing ‘small-box casual’ concepts that we have encountered across the United States. The concept is exceptionally differentiated not only through the quality and breadth of its menu, but also through its resonance with guests with different dietary needs and sensitivities, and its unique position as environmentally friendly and sustainable.” 





Hargett Hunter’s Jason Morgan added, “We couldn’t be more proud of the team that we are inheriting and the first class experiences they provide to all of our loyal guests. We are excited to expand that team and grow with them as we introduce Ruggles Green to even more guests in the Houston area and beyond.”
“Our relationship with Jeff Brock goes back almost four years. When we began seeking potential investors, it was only natural to seek an investment from Hargett Hunter,” said co-founder Federico Marques. “Once we met Jason [Morgan], we knew that the Hargett Hunter team also possessed the operational expertise to execute at the level of excellence that we envision for Ruggles Green’s future.”
Morgan was the Chief Financial Officer of Zoe’s Kitchen from 2008 to 2015 and will step into the role of Chief Executive Officer for Ruggles Green.
This transaction marks the second investment by Hargett Hunter, after the July acquisition of a majority stake in the Original ChopShop Co., a Phoenix-based fast casual concept. Morgan added, “As another strong brand whose exceptional food and guest experience have already inspired a passionate following, Ruggles Green provides a perfect complement to our investment at Original ChopShop Co. We are thrilled to be involved with these two fundamental building blocks for our portfolio, and we look forward to the growth of these concepts and the future expansion of our portfolio with other best-in-class concepts.” 





Co-founder Robert Guillerman added, “The Ruggles Green team could not be more excited about the new energy and enthusiasm that the Hargett Hunter team brings to the organization.”
Wyrick Robbins Yates & Ponton LLP and Martin Frost & Hill provided legal counsel to Hargett Hunter. Dixon Hughes Goodman LLP provided financial and accounting services to Hargett Hunter. Additional diligence services were provided by Bergemont Location Science & Strategy in Boston, Massachusetts and by LJR Hospitality Ventures in Dallas, Texas.
