Job Details
               Houston Center for Literacy is a nonprofit organization whose mission is to lead and mobilize a coalition of literacy providers and resources to improve the literacy landscape of Houston. Established in 1988 by the Mayor and City Council, Houston Center for Literacy oversees the Mayor's Coalition for Literacy, an association of more than one hundred and fifty literacy sites in Houston. These member organizations, known as literacy providers, strive to eliminate illiteracy by offering educational services geared toward the specific needs of their communities. Houston Center for Literacy's goal is to support and ensure providers' effectiveness. WHY WE EXIST:Low-literacy underpins almost all social ills, including crime rates, dropout rates, joblessness, homelessness, social injustice and health issue inequities. 1 out of 3 adult Houstonians is functionally illiterate (National Adult Literacy Survey, 2003). Houston was recently ranked #60 out of the 75 least literate cities in the United States, #75 being the least literate. This marks a major drop from our position in 2005 at #53 (Central Connecticut State University, 2010). Texas ranks 47th out of 50 states in terms of English literacy levels (US Department of Education).
