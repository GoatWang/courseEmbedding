      continued excellence on behalf of Oaktree’s clients, employees, 
      creditors and unitholders.”

Daniel Levin to Succeed David Kirchheimer as Oaktree Chief Financial 
      Officer




David Kirchheimer to Retire March 31, 2017






October 28, 2016 08:05 AM Eastern Daylight Time



LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oaktree Capital Group, LLC (NYSE: OAK) today announced that David 
      Kirchheimer has decided to retire as Oaktree’s Chief Financial Officer 
      and member of its Board of Directors, effective March 31, 2017. At that 
      time, he will transition to serving as an Advisory Partner for the firm. 
      Effective April 1, 2017, Daniel Levin, Managing Director, Head of 
      Corporate Finance and Chief Product Officer, will assume the role of 
      Chief Financial Officer.
    


      “When David was hired as Oaktree’s first employee, we gave him a single 
      charge: make our back-office areas equal in quality to our investment 
      ones,” commented Howard Marks, Oaktree’s Co-Chairman. “Over the past 21 
      years, David has been an invaluable contributor to the firm’s global 
      infrastructure, growth, and corporate culture, and we look forward to 
      the continued benefit of his tremendous experience and knowledge in his 
      new role as an Advisory Partner.”
    

      “Among other things, David has excelled in developing many of our firm’s 
      next-generation leaders, including Dan Levin,” said Jay Wintrob, 
      Oaktree’s Chief Executive Officer. “In his time at Oaktree, Dan has 
      contributed significantly in the areas of corporate development, 
      financial planning and analysis, and product governance. He has served 
      as an integral member of our Capital and Risk Management Committee, 
      Product Governance Board and Senior Leadership Council, and has had 
      significant interaction with all of our major stakeholders. We have 
      every confidence in Dan and the entire finance organization to ensure 
      continued excellence on behalf of Oaktree’s clients, employees, 
      creditors and unitholders.”
    

      “I am honored to serve as Oaktree’s Chief Financial Officer,” said Mr. 
      Levin. “I look forward to working with our talented finance team and 
      Oaktree’s senior leaders to help guide Oaktree’s future growth and 
      success.”
    

      Prior to joining Oaktree in 2011, Mr. Levin was a Vice President in the 
      Investment Banking Division at Goldman, Sachs & Co., focusing on asset 
      management firms and other financial institutions. His previous 
      experience includes capital raising and mergers and acquisitions roles 
      at Technoserve and Robertson Stephens, Inc. Mr. Levin received an M.B.A. 
      with Honors in Finance from the Wharton School of the University of 
      Pennsylvania and a B.A. degree with Honors in Economics and Mathematics 
      from Columbia University.
