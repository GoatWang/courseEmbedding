Description
The global climate changes that led to the expansion and contraction of high latitude ice sheets during the Quaternary period were associated with equally dramatic changes in tropical environments. These included shifts in vegetation zones, changes in the hydrology and ecology of lakes and rivers, and fluctuations in the size of mountain glaciers and sandy deserts. Until recently it was thought that such changes were triggered by fluctuations in the distribution of polar ice cover. Now there is increasing recognition that the tropics themselves have acted as drivers of global climate change over a range of timescales.


The aim of Quaternary Environmental Change in the Tropics is to provide a synthesis of the changes that occurred in tropical terrestrial and marine systems during the Pleistocene and Holocene, complementing data-derived reconstructions with output from state-of-the-art climate models. It is targeted at final-year undergraduate students and research specialists, but will provide an introduction to tropical Quaternary research for a variety of other readers.

Author Information
Sarah Metcalfe is Professor of Earth and Environmental
Dynamics at the University of Nottingham, UK.  She has
published extensively on environmental change in Latin America,
with a particular focus on Mexico.  Although primarily a
palaeolimnologist, her approach is very much multi-proxy, including
the use of historical and instrumental records to help to improve
our understanding of recent change. 
David Nash is Professor of Physical Geography at the
University of Brighton, UK. He is widely known for his publications
on the reconstruction of historical climate changes in southern
Africa, as well as his broader research into the contemporary and
Quaternary geomorphology of dryland regions including the Kalahari,
Atacama and southern Europe. His research uses methods ranging from
scanning electron microscopy and thin-section analysis to the
interpretation of historical documents.

Reviews
“All in all, Quaternary Environmental Change in the Tropics provides a concise overview of the current knowledge of tropical quaternary climate. As such, it will be a very useful textbook for scholars focussing on this topic, but at the same time, it brings to light the poor record of Early and Middle Pleistocene tropical climate.”  (Geological Journal, 1 March 2016)
