Title: Teacher
               Company: Ursuline High School
Job Details
               Ursuline High School serves students and their families in grades 9 through 12 in Santa Rosa, California. Ursuline is a private, independent, Catholic, college-preparatory high school for girls which is owned and operated by the Ursuline Sisters of the Roman Union. Ursuline's heritage is rooted in the founding of the Ursuline Order by Angela Merici in Brescia, Italy, in 1535. The vision of Angela spread throughout Europe and beyond - the Ursuline's were the first religious order to reach the New World. Eight pioneering Ursuline Sisters from Brown County Ohio established Ursuline, Santa Rosa, at its original 10th and B Street site. Ursuline has been educating young women in Sonoma County since 1880, guided by the Ursuline mission of academic excellence, leadership and service. Ursuline moved to its current campus on the old Howarth Estate in 1957. Students at Ursuline High School find a supportive and challenging learning environment which encourages not only strong academic growth, but also spiritual and personal growth fostered by the school-wide learning expectations, the mission and philosophy of the school, and the Ursuline tradition of "Serviam". Community based service learning which culminates in the Senior Project is one of the key ways in which this tradition is supported. Current enrollment at Ursuline is 345 students. Ursuline has three Counselors and a Director of College Counseling to provide academic, spiritual, social/emotional support to all students. LINK Crew students serve as mentors, helping new students adjust to high school both socially and academically. Ursuline is a safe and secure campus located at the end of a long driveway and secluded in the hills of northwest Santa Rosa. The campus is sufficiently secure that student backpacks line the hallways and locker areas. The school has a clearly articulated, written conduct policy which is outlined in the Student/Parent Handbook. The policies are frequently reviewed with a goal of making consequences for policy violation relevant and appropriate learning experiences resulting in a cessation of unwanted behaviors. The school has well-planned emergency guidelines which are known and frequently practiced by all faculty, staff and students. 68% of Ursuline students are Catholic. The remaining 32% are of a variety of church and spiritual backgrounds. Attendance at monthly liturgical services is required as is four years of Religious Study courses. While the teachings of the Catholic Church are taught in each of the Religious Studies courses and students are expected to know the teachings, in the Ursuline tradition, and in the tradition of educational excellence, this teaching is done in an atmosphere of openness and respect for all beliefs and traditions. 30% of the students at Ursuline receive some level of financial assistance.

BOARDMAN – A Mass of Christian Burial will be celebrated Friday morning at 10 a.m. at St. Matthias Church for David W. Petty, 44, who died suddenly Monday morning of an apparent heart attack at St Elizabeth Boardman Health Center, after being stricken at his home. David was born April 27, 1966, in Youngstown, the son of William and Rita (Novotny) Petty. He was a 1984 graduate of Cardinal Mooney High School, where he excelled in basketball, earning all-star recognition for the Steel Valley Conference. After his graduation, he enrolled in Mount Union College, earning four varsity letters as a member of its basketball team. He graduated from Mount Union in 1988 with his Bachelors Degree in Education. He began his teaching and coaching career in 1989 at Byzantine Central Catholic and in 1994, accepted a position at Ursuline High School, where he taught and coached until 1999. While at Ursuline, he was an assistant coach for Ursuline's State Championship boys basketball team and later served two years as their head basketball coach. In 1999, he returned to his alma mater Cardinal Mooney where he has served passionately as a history and phys ed teacher, basketball coach, mentor and friend to so many. Besides his many Scholastic and Collegiate honors, Dave's lifetime love for basketball led him as a member of four National Championship Catholic Sokols teams. A devoted husband and father Dave loved spending time with his family and was currently coaching his daughter's youth basketball team at the YMCA. Dave will also be remembered as a great friend. He particularly had a great gift of organizing gatherings to generate comradery. In fact, he was the founder and perpetual president of the Billy Paultz fan club which recently celebrated its 24th annual golf outing for its members and supporters. Even in the tragedy of his sudden death, Dave's generous legacy continues as an organ donor. He is survived by his wife, the former Raynae Patterson, whom he married, July 21, 2001, a daughter, Magen R. Petty and a son, William M. Petty, all at home; his mother, Rita LoGiudice (Bob) of Boardman; a sister, Sue (Ron) Yarab of Poland; his in-laws, Susan (Dwight) Hicks of Austintown and William (Pam) Patterson of Mineral Ridge; and two brothers-in-law, William Patterson of Canada and Mark Patterson of St. Augustine, Fla. David was preceded in death by his father, William James Petty. Friends may call from 4 to 8 p.m. Thursday at the Higgins-Reardon Funeral Home, Boardman-Canfield Chapel. The family has requested that material tributes take the form of donations to the Dave Petty Scholarship Fund. Donations can be made at any Huntington Bank branch or mailed to 1359 E. Calla Road, Poland, OH 44514.

I may have known David's Father.  Did his dad once live on Sayers Ave, Niles and have a sister Margie?  My grandfather lived next door and Bill and I were friends.  (if that's him)

My family and I send our sympathies and prayers to all of Dave's family and loved ones.  I worked with Dave at B.C.C. School, and have a lot of fond memories of his enthusiasm for teaching PE, his involvement with fantasy sports leagues, and how he always kept us updated on the latest episode of "Seinfeld."  He was a warm and caring person, and will be forever missed by many former colleagues and students.    May God bless you and comfort you in your loss.

Raynae, Magen,William, Rita, Sue, and family: I am deeply saddened at the passing of Dave. He was a warm, caring, and friendly man who recognized and shared with me personally many times. I worked with Dave at Ursuline as a fellow teacher and saw him publicly many times. I have the upmost respect and admiration for Dave. He will be greatly missed and I'm sure has joined such greats as Ron Stoops Sr,Ted Lolakis, Roy Nard Sr., just to name
