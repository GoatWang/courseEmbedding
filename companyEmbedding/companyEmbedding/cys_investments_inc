CYS Investments: It's Mixed - CYS Investments, Inc. (NYSE:CYS) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»CYS Investments: It's MixedJul.27.17 | About: CYS Investments, (CYS) Quad 7 Capital Research analyst, REITs, biotech, small-capQuad 7 Capital ResearchSummaryStock is trading with volatility following Q2 earnings.A discussion of the key metrics.A quiet strength to the quarter.CYS Investments (NYSE:CYS) has just reported earnings and the stock is experiencing some volatility following what I believed to be a decent but not great quarter from this mREIT that I have been covering for years. Since the results were a bit mixed, the reaction is mixed. Given this reaction I feel it is prudent examine the results to understand what is going on here. Let's dive right into the earnings and key metrics we look for in mREITs. Let me first say that the company surpassed earnings expectations that I had for the quarter. I was looking for $0.26 per share in core plus drop income and net interest income of $50 to $50.5 million. We saw net interest income come in at $50.9 million which was actually down $1.2 million versus the $52.1 million in net interest income in Q1 2017. While the beat versus expectations on this number is decent, the drop was expected given the Fed rate hike two months ago, causing costs of funds to rise. What we care about, of course, is not net income per se, but core income. This is because it's a better measure of the ability to cover the dividend. Remember the dividend has been cut several times and failure to cover the dividend was one of the reasons I turned sour on the name. As you know the best-of-breed names have been outearning their dividends, in many cases consistently. Core earnings plus drop income came in at $40.6 million, or $0.27 per share, which was down a penny per share from last quarter, but beat my expectations of $0.26. It is however important to note that we see that this was made up of core earnings of $31.9 million, or $0.21 per share. Thus, drop income was $8.7 million, or $0.06 per share. The key point is that the dividend was covered here. Several key metrics played a big role in these earnings figures. First, total interest income increased to $77.1 million. Total interest income has been on the decline for two years plus, but this was the second quarter in a row of improvement here on this metric. Prepayments were a strong reason for this decline, so it is a positive to see the trend reverse. The reason for this is because prepayments are out of control for so many mREITs, even if the situation has improved. Just look at 2016 for CYS. Back in Q4, the constant prepayment rate jumped to 14.2%, up from 14% in Q3, 12.9% in Q2 and up significantly from the 7.6% in Q1. For Q1 2017, we saw the prepayment rate drop dramatically to 8.1%, and here in Q2 prepayments dropped to 7.5%, helping deliver a winning quarter.
 The average cost of funds has been on the rise in the sector and here in Q2 it rose rather dramatically by 21 basis points for CYS. It came in at 1.13% versus 0.92% in Q1, a result due in large part to the Fed rate hike. Average yields were up helping offset this rising cost of funds, coming in at 2.86%. Doing the math, you can see that this higher yield on investments was not enough to outpace the increase in cost of funds, which means the spread was pressured. The spread, net of hedge including drop income, was 1.49% for Q2 2017, down 8 basis points compared to 1.57% in Q1 2017. With the motion in rates at the end of the quarter there were certainly adjustments made that will impact Q3 as well. I will also say plainly that this was overall a positive quarter for CYS, but it was not fantastic. This explains the mixed buying and selling on the Street and the volatility the stock is experiencing. With this rise in share prices, the stock has moved up significantly. Still, the Street has assigned a premium valuation to the name as it is still trading at a premium-to-book value. Net of the $0.25 dividend, book value came in at $8.31. This was a quiet strength in the quarter, as book value rose from $8.26 last quarter. Of course, book value is still down incredibly over the last few years. All that said, the name has seen improvement but with a premium-to-book and prior quarters with failed dividend coverage, I would not be a buyer here.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.

Buy/Sell Signals for CYS Investments, Inc. (CYS) and The Southern Company (SO)

By Luis Castro -   July 24, 2017

Shares of CYS Investments, Inc. (NYSE:CYS) observed rebound of 13.88% since bottoming out at $7.42 on Dec. 15, 2016. Meanwhile, due to an ongoing pressure which caused a decline of almost -0.12% in the past five days, the stock price is now up 9.31% so far on the year — still in strong territory. In this case, shares are down -8.25% from $9.21 , the 52-week high touched on Aug. 05, 2016, but are collecting gains at -3.21% for the past 12 months.
CYS Target Price Reaches $7.95
 Brokerage houses, on average, are recommending investors to sell CYS Investments, Inc. (CYS)’s shares projecting a $7.95 target price. Analysts‟ target price forecasts are a prediction of a stock‟s future price, generally over the 12 months following the release date (Asquith et al., 2005). This forecast is a point estimate that provides investors with a benchmark against which to directly compare stock price in the short run.Target prices made by analysts employed by large brokers, who have access to a greater resource pool, are more likely to be met over the 12-month forecast period.
 How Quickly CYS Investments, Inc. (CYS)’s Sales Grew?
 CYS’s revenue has grown at an average annualized rate of about 4.8% during the past five years. However, the company’s most recent quarter decrease of -10.1% looks unattractive. The sales growth rate for a stock is a measure of how the stock’s sales per share (SPS) has grown over a specific period of time. It tells an investor how quickly a company is increasing its revenues. The sales growth rate helps investors determine how strong the overall growth-orientation is for a stock or portfolio.
The Southern Company Achieves Below-Average Profit Margin 





  The best measure of a company is its profitability, for without it, it cannot grow, and if it doesn’t grow, then its stock will trend downward. Increasing profits are the best indication that a company can pay dividends and that the share price will trend upward. Creditors will loan money at a cheaper rate to a profitable company than to an unprofitable one; consequently, profitable companies can use leverage to increase stockholders’ equity even more. Profitability ratios compare different accounts to see how efficiently a business is generating profits. These ratios show how well income is generated through operations, and are important to both creditors and investors. They help determine the company’s ability to continue operating. Currently, CYS Investments, Inc. net profit margin for the 12 months is at -3.81%. Comparatively, the peers have a net margin 45.44%, and the sector’s average is 27.93%. In that light, it seems in weak position compared to its peers and sector. The profit margin measures the amount of net income earned with each dollar’s worth of revenue. It shows the percentage of sales that remain after all of the company’s expenses have been paid. The higher the ratio, the better.
 The Southern Company (NYSE:SO) is another stock that is grabbing investors attention these days. Its shares have trimmed -12.37% since hitting a peak level of $54.64 on Jul. 22, 2016. Meanwhile, due to a recent pullback which led to a fall of almost -6.48% in the past one month, the stock price is now with underperforming -2.66% so far on the year — still in weak zone. In this case, shares are 3.64% higher from $46.2, the worst price in 52 weeks suffered on Dec. 01, 2016, but are collecting gains at -2.41% for the past six months.
Analysts See The Southern Company 2.96% Above Current Levels 
 The good news is there’s still room for The Southern Company (SO) to grow. At recent closing price of $47.88, SO has a chance to add $2.96 or 6.18% in 52 weeks, based on mean target price ($50.84) placed by analysts.The analyst consensus opinion of 3.1 looks like a sell. It has a 36-month beta of 0.13 , so you might not be in for a bumpy ride.
 Are The Southern Company (NYSE:SO) Earnings Growing Rapidly?
 For the past 5 years, The Southern Company’s EPS growth has been nearly 0%. Sure, the percentage is discouraging but better times are ahead as looking out over a next 5-year period, analysts expect the company to see its earnings go up by 3.34%, annually.
Is SO Turning Profits into Returns?
 The Southern Company (SO)’s ROE is 11.43%, while industry’s is 14.07%. The average ROE for the sector stands at 10.89%. The return on equity (ROE), also known as return on investment (ROI), is the best measure of the return, since it is the product of the operating performance, asset turnover, and debt-equity management of the firm. If a firm can borrow money and use it to achieve a higher return than the cost of the debt, then the leveraging creates additional revenue that accrues to stockholders as increased equity.
 The Southern Company’s ROA is 2.86%, while industry’s average is 7.37%. As with any return, the higher this number the better. However, it, too, needs to be taken into the context of a company’s peer group as well as its sector. The average return on assets for companies in the same sector is 5.2. The return on assets (ROA) (aka return on total assets, return on average assets), is one of the most widely used profitability ratios because it is related to both profit margin and asset turnover, and shows the rate of return for both creditors and investors of the company. ROA shows how well a company controls its costs and utilizes its resources.

CYS - Stock Valuation Report
 Trade 

CYS Investments Inc. (CYS) traded on unusually high volume on Jun. 28, as the stock 
lost 1.39% to close at $8.53. On the day, CYS Investments Inc. saw 1.95 million shares trade hands on 7,117 trades. 
Considering that the stock averages only a daily volume of 1.27 million shares a day over the last month, this represents a pretty significant bump in volume over the norm.

Generally speaking, when a stock experiences a sudden spike in trading volume, it may be seen as a bullish signal for investors. An increase in volume means more market awareness for the 
company, potentially setting up a more meaningful move in stock price. The added volume also provides a level of support and stability for price advances.

The stock has traded between $9.21 and $7.42 over the last 52-weeks, its 50-day SMA is now $8.25, and its 200-day SMA $7.70. CYS Investments Inc. 
has a P/B ratio of 1.03.   


CYS Investments Inc is a specialty finance company. The company primarily invests in residential mortgage pass-through securities, collateralised mortgage obligations; U.S. Treasuries; and debt securities issued by a government agency.

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
