What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices
              
              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?

How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

A quarter of S&P 500’s 2017 climb due to five stocks (yes, those five)
              
              Throughout 2017, there’s one acronym that investors have in particular been sinking their teeth into: FAANG.              
              
            

5:22 p.m. July 27, 2017






Amazon earnings fall 77%, shares drop
              
              Amazon.com Inc.  reported much lower earnings than expected Thursday, and shares declined more than 2% in late trading. The e-commerce giant reported net income of $197 million, or 40 cents a share, on sales of $38 billion, a profit decline of 77% from the same quarter a year ago. Analysts on average expected Amazon to report earnings of $1.41 a share on sales of $37.2 billion. The company's spending cut into profit, as fulfillment costs -- the amount Amazon spends to fulfill customers' orders on its e-commerce platform -- rose about 33% from a year ago and spending on technology and content increased by about 43%. Amazon stock traded at all-time highs this week, making Amazon the fourth U.S. company with a market capitalization of $500 billion and briefly giving Chief Executive Jeff Bezos the title of richest man in the world, but shares declined about 2% in immediate after-hours action.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Dollar rises from 13-month low

Exchange-Traded Funds










Exchange-Traded Funds

























The MLP ETP (Master Limited Partnership Exchange Traded Product) space has gotten very crowded very quickly, with 16 MLP ETPs launching in the past three years. The products have been a success, too: Thanks to a wholesale compression of yields across every asset class, investors have flooded the segment with more than $17 billion in assets. Although more than half of that tally is invested in just two products—the Alerian MLP ETF (AMLP) and the JPMorgan Alerian MLP ETN (AMJ)—there are nine different products in all that have cumulative assets of more than $100 million each.
Despite the popularity of MLP ETPs, they remain some of the industry's most misunderstood products. MLP ETPs are not like other ETPs. Since MLPs inhabit a very specific pocket of the tax code, their incorporation into ETPs is not seamless. In fact, there's a specific rule: traditional mutual funds (the structure of most ETFs) can hold no more than 25 percent of fund assets in limited partnership (LP) interests.
That makes squeezing 100 percent MLP exposure into an ETP difficult, so ETF issuers have tried various creative ways to get around this problem.
The first products to market, which also happen to be the two largest products in the space, circumvented this restriction in different ways. AMLP was structured as a C Corporation as opposed to an open-end mutual fund, while AMJ was structured as an exchange-traded note. In choosing these two paths, the two products drew a massive line in the sand and forced investors to make a number of trade-offs.
A third version appeared in 2012 with the launch of the First Trust North American Energy Infrastructure ETF (EMLP), which uses a traditional mutual funds structure and bears the dilutive consequences. Understanding the pros and cons of each structural choice is the key to evaluating the ETP options in the MLP space, perhaps even more than understanding things like the exposures of the tracked indexes or the efficiency of each product.
This truly makes MLP ETPs unique. It's the one asset class in which the way the ETPs are structured matters as much—or more than—what they actually hold.

            The C Corporation
        
An individual master limited partnership passes through income and any other distribution to shareholders untaxed, which makes them great yield vehicles. But because of the restrictions on holding MLPs in a mutual fund, it's difficult to create a great high-yield MLP mutual fund product.
One way to get around this is to structure your ETP as a C Corporation. There are currently seven MLP ETPs on the market that are structured as C Corps.

As the name suggests, these funds are actually just companies—like Apple or Exxon. As plain-old corporations, they can hold any asset any company can, including stakes in any limited partnerships they like.
The trade-off for this is that they must pay corporate income taxes, typically 35 percent. What's worse, even after paying those taxes, any income distributions made to shareholders are just like any distributions paid by Apple—they're dividends, and will be subject to taxes on their shareholders' returns. The accounting for that taxation is why the expense ratios in the table above look so high – those tax liabilities are an expense of the fund.
If this double taxation sounds terrible, it is, and detractors love to point to this double taxation as a way of saying MLP C-Corp ETPs are a bad idea.
It's important to remember, however, that underlying MLPs make two kinds of distributions: income and return of capital. Anything classified as return of capital is not taxed; rather, it simply lowers an investor's cost basis in the MLP. That return-of-capital status is passed through the C-Corp structure to the investor.
So far, the majority of dividends paid by the industry's leading C-Corp ETF, AMLP, have been eligible to be treated as return-of-capital distributions, much like the distributions of the underlying MLPs themselves (85 percent in 2011, 99.7 percent in 2012). That's tax-free yield, but it may come at a price: Because return of capital lowers your cost basis, investors will realize higher tax liabilities when they sell.
Further, these tax-deferral benefits are completely lost when you hold a C-Corp ETF in a deferred account such as an IRA. The distributions from a C-Corp ETF made within an IRA will be treated as any other distribution, and won't lower the cost basis of the shares held within said portfolios.
Another key consideration for those considering a C-Corp MLP ETF is their investment horizon and its implications for estate planning. Although the tax-deferred nature of distributions means the cost basis in the ETF will be lowered each time a return of capital is made, the tax code allows for a "step up" in cost basis when shares are inherited, resetting the basis to fair market value and effectively avoiding all capital gains on the estate transfer.
As such, investors seeking to invest in MLPs via the ETP wrapper indefinitely—with an estate plan in place—may favor the C-Corp structure due to this step up in basis. On the other hand, investors with shorter investment horizons will neither realize this inheritance tax break nor will they derive much benefit from the more straightforward deferral of taxation.
One last wrinkle—cost basis can never go below zero. So if you hold a high-yielding C-Corp MLP ETP long enough, distributions may wipe out your cost basis, and all future payments will be taxed in the worst possible way—as ordinary income.

            The ETN structure
        
There are currently 13 different MLP ETNs to choose from.

*”As of” 3/25/2015
Unlike C-Corporation ETFs, MLP ETNs are exceedingly simple. Like all ETNs, they are simply a debt instrument issued by a bank. The notes do not represent any beneficial ownership in actual MLPs—they don't "own" anything anymore than your T-bills "own" anything. They are merely a promise to pay the return of an index of MLPs. To satiate those who come to the MLP space for income, MLP ETN issuers have built their products to make coupon payments that mimic the distributions of the MLPs in the index.
The problem, of course, is that these payments are just bond coupons: Distributions from MLP ETNs are taxed as ordinary income, while changes in price are treated as capital gains, just like any other bond. This has the advantage of simplicity: Unlike direct ownership of the MLPs, investors are not partners in the ETN, and don't have to file a K-1 statement with their income taxes. Unlike the C-Corp-based ETPs, distributions are never double taxed, whether they're income or return of capital. As a result, ETNs tend to outperform when a greater share of distributions are income.
The downside for ETNs is counterparty risk: Because ETNs are just unsecured debt, in the event of bankruptcy, ETN holders could theoretically lose all of their money, just like any bondholder.
Since an ETN only provides replicative returns rather than representing fractional ownership in any actual MLPs, total return is of paramount importance for ETN holders. Whether those returns are driven by distributions or index appreciation means significantly less to ETN investors, since there is no tax deferral available. As such, investors who expect distribution growth to be a relatively lesser component of their total returns would favor the ETN wrapper.

            Traditional mutual fund structures
        
Whereas the C-Corporation and ETN structure each ask you to make significant tax trade-offs to get diversified MLP exposure, EMLP and two other recently launched 1940 Act ETFs ask you to accept a different trade-off.

*”As of” 3/25/2015
Since the tax code prevents these funds from holding more than 25 percent in MLPs, these products offer diluted exposure to actual LP interests in MLPs. They either own institutional MLP shares, which pay stock dividends, or own general partnership interests, which both increase concentration and carry lower yields. The remainder of the portfolio is made up of everything from utilities firms to Canadian energy firms that the index providers have deemed to have similar characteristics to MLPs.
Unfortunately, this means none of these funds provides a perfect proxy for a diversified basket of MLPs, but rather an energy infrastructure portfolio with a smattering of LP interests in MLPs. The good news is these funds don't have to deal with double taxation or counterparty risk.

            Conclusion
        
Ultimately, investing in MLPs is a challenge no matter how you approach it. ETP packages achieve many laudable goals, including offering diversified and liquid exposure in a single wrapper. But it's important to understand the trade-offs you're making when acquiring each product. If you’re comfortable with the significant research burden and complex taxation issues, there’s much to be said for direct ownership of MLPs.

ETFs are subject to market fluctuation and the risks of their underlying investments. ETFs are subject to management fees and other expenses. Unlike mutual funds, ETF shares are bought and sold at market price, which may be higher or lower than their NAV, and are not individually redeemed from the fund.



Investments in publicly traded MLPs involve risks and considerations that may differ from investments in common stock. Tax complexity risk: Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs) are generally considered pass-through entities for tax purposes and have special tax considerations. Pass-through entities may generate unrelated business taxable income (UBTI) that may have undesirable tax consequences for retirement accounts and other tax-exempt investors. If you hold MLP units, you are generally treated as a partner for tax purposes and will be issued a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for use in filling out your tax return. A K-1 lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, and other tax items. If the MLP has operations in multiple states, you may need to file a separate tax return in each state. An MLP that is treated as a corporation in the United States rather than a pass-through entity for federal income tax purposes would be obligated to pay federal income tax on its income at the corporate tax rate. In this case, the amount of cash available for distribution by the MLP would be reduced and part or all of the distributions made could be taxed entirely as dividend income. In this case a Form 1099 would be furnished rather than a Schedule K-1. Please see the MLP’s website, SEC filings, or most recent shareholder report for further details about tax treatment of your investments. Legislative risk: The tax treatment of publicly traded MLPs could be subject to potential legislative, judicial, or administrative changes, possibly on a retroactive basis. Any such changes in tax treatment could negatively impact the value of an investment in an MLP. Concentration risk: Many MLPs are concentrated in the energy infrastructure sector. This narrow focus of MLPs may present considerably more risk than a diversified investment across numerous sectors of the economy. Market risk: MLPs may exhibit high volatility particularly during periods of economic stress or due to other events impacting the particular sector or industry in which an MLP operates. Interest rate risk: The market prices of MLPs are sensitive to changes in interest rates. As interest rates rise, the prices of MLP units may decline (and vice versa). Rising interest rates could also increase the MLP’s cost of capital which may limit potential growth through acquisition or expansion and reduce distribution growth rates. Distribution policy risk: All or a portion of an MLP’s distribution may consist of a return of capital from your original investment. MLP unit holders should not assume that the source of a distribution is net profit from the MLP’s operations. Liquidity risk: Despite the fact that MLPs are publicly traded, investments in MLPs may be relatively illiquid due to their unique investment strategy, asset concentration or other factors. Lack of liquidity can negatively impact your ability to sell MLP units. Additionally, should a secondary market exist, investors who need to sell MLP units may be subject to a significant loss. Commodity price risk: The price of MLP units may be negatively impacted by fluctuations in commodity prices. A significant decrease in the production or supply or sustained reduced demand for natural gas, oil, or other energy commodities would limit revenue and cash flows of MLPs and, therefore, the ability of MLPs to make distributions to unit holders. Regulatory risk: The assets of MLPs tend to be heavily regulated by federal and state governments. Changes in regulation can adversely impact an MLP’s profitability and therefore the value of MLP units. Conflicts of Interest: The general partners of an MLP typically have limited fiduciary duties to the MLP and may have conflicts of interest which could result in the general partners favoring its own interests over the MLP’s interests.


Before investing, consider the funds' investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information.  Read it carefully.

Exchange Traded Notes






 
















Exchange-traded products (ETPs) are subject to market volatility and the risks of their underlying securities, which may include the risks associated with investing in smaller companies, foreign securities, commodities, and fixed income investments. Foreign securities are subject to interest rate, currency exchange rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets. ETPs that target a small universe of securities, such as a specific region or market sector, are generally subject to greater market volatility, as well as to the specific risks associated with that sector, region, or other focus. ETPs that use derivatives, leverage, or complex investment strategies are subject to additional risks. The return of an index ETP is usually different from that of the index it tracks because of fees, expenses, and tracking error. An ETP may trade at a premium or discount to its net asset value (NAV) (or indicative value in the case of exchange-traded notes). The degree of liquidity can vary significantly from one ETP to another and losses may be magnified if no liquid market exists for the ETP's shares when attempting to sell them. Each ETP has a unique risk profile, detailed in its prospectus, offering circular, or similar material, which should be considered carefully when making investment decisions.



ETFs are subject to market fluctuation and the risks of their underlying investments. ETFs are subject to management fees and other expenses. Unlike mutual funds, ETF shares are bought and sold at market price, which may be higher or lower than their NAV, and are not individually redeemed from the fund.

Fund Objective: Seeks current income and capital appreciation. In seeking current income, the Fund intends to pay current cash distributions to shareholders, regardless of the character of such distributions for tax or accounting purposes.


Distribution Yield: The distribution yield measures the percentage return in the form of dividends. It is calculated daily by annualizing the most recent dividend distribution and dividing by the daily share price (NAV or POP). If the Fund did not make a distribution as of the latest scheduled distribution date, "N/A" will be displayed.
12-month Yield: The 12-month yield measures the percentage return in the form of dividends. It is calculated monthly by taking the sum of the trailing 12-month dividend payments divided by the last month's ending share price (NAV or POP) plus any capital gains distributed over previous 12 months. If the Fund did not make any distributions over the previous 12 months, "N/A" will be displayed.
The SEC 30-day Yield is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share for the first 30 days of the month by the offering price per share at the end of that period. The yield reflects the dividends and interest earned during the period, after the deduction of the Fund's expenses. Yield reflects a fee waiver and/or expense limitation agreement without which the 30-day SEC Yield would have been lower.
Dividend distributions are the distribution of a dividend to mutual fund shareholders as of a certain date. The following Funds declare daily dividends: MainStay California Tax Free Opportunities, MainStay Floating Rate, MainStay High Yield Municipal Bond, MainStay Money Market, MainStay New York Tax Free Opportunities, MainStay Tax Advantaged Short Term Bond, and MainStay Tax Free Bond.

Expenses for MainStay Cushing MLP Premier Fund are as of March 31, 2017.

1. Deferred income tax expense/(benefit) represents an estimate of the Fund’s potential tax expense/(benefit) if it were to recognize the unrealized gains/(losses) in the portfolio. This amount may vary greatly over time depending upon the performance of the Fund’s investments.
2. New York Life Investment Management LLC has contractually agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses so that the Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses (excluding taxes, deferred income tax expenses, interest, litigation, extraordinary expenses, brokerage and other transaction expenses relating to the purchase or sale of portfolio investments, and acquired (underlying) fund fees and expenses) do not exceed the following percentages of average daily net assets: Class A, 1.60%; Class C, 2.35% and Class I, 1.35%. This agreement will remain in effect for a two-year period unless extended by New York Life Investment Management LLC and approved by the Board of Trustees of the Fund.Total and Net Expense Ratio shown are from the most recent Fund prospectus fee table. Net annual operating expenses reflect contractual waivers and/or expense limitations. Total annual operating expenses are absent the waivers and/or limitations.




Before You Invest
All mutual funds are subject to market risk, including possible loss of principal.
Before considering an investment in the Fund, you should understand that you could lose money.
Securities purchased by the Fund that are liquid at the time of purchase may subsequently become illiquid due to, among other things, events relating to the issuer of the securities, market events, economic conditions, investor perceptions, or lack of market participants. The lack of an active trading market may make it difficult to obtain an accurate price for a security. As a result, an investor could pay more than the market value when buying Fund shares or receive less than the market value when selling Fund shares.
The Fund is a non-diversified, open-end management investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”). Accordingly, the Fund may invest a greater portion of its assets in a more limited number of issuers than a diversified fund. There are currently approximately 120 publicly traded MLPs. The Fund will select its investments in MLPs from this small pool of issuers together with securities issued by any newly public MLPs, and may invest in securities of private MLPs, affiliates of MLPs, and non-MLP issuers, consistent with its investment objective and policies. An investment in the Fund may present greater risk to an investor than an investment in a diversified portfolio because changes in the financial condition or market assessment of a single issuer may cause greater fluctuations in the value of the Fund’s shares.
The Fund concentrates its investments in the natural resources sector, with an emphasis on securities issued by MLPs. MLPs and other natural resources sector companies are subject to certain risks, including, but not limited to fluctuations in the prices of commodities; the highly cyclical nature of the natural resources sector may adversely affect the earnings or operating cash flows of the issuers in which the Fund will invest; a significant decrease in the production of energy commodities would reduce the revenue, operating income, and operating cash flows of MLPs and other natural resources sector companies and, therefore, their ability to make distributions or pay dividends.
The investment strategies, practices, and risk analysis used by the subadvisor may not produce the desired results.
Distributions made by the Fund to shareholders may be considered ordinary income or non-taxable return of capital. The Fund is organized as a regular or “C” corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and is subject to U.S. federal income tax on taxable income at the corporate tax rate (currently as high as 35%) as well as state, foreign, and local taxes.
Midstream MLPs gather, process, and transport natural resources.
Disclosure1. POP (Public Offering Price) is the NAV (Net Asset Value) plus a sales charge. All POPs are subject to revision and include the maximum sales charge.2. Average annual total returns include the change in share price and reinvestment of dividends and capital gain distributions. Effective after the close of business 7/11/14, Cushing® MLP Premier Fund was renamed MainStay Cushing MLP Premier Fund. Performance for Class A, C, and I shares reflect the performance of the then-existing Class A, C, and I shares of Cushing MLP Premier Fund (which was subject to a different fee structure) for periods prior to 7/11/14, restated to reflect current sales charges. Performance for Investor Class shares reflects the historical performance of Class A shares adjusted to reflect differences in fees and expenses. Unadjusted, the performance of the new class would likely have been different. Class I shares are generally available only to corporate and institutional investors.4. No sales charge applies to Class A and Investor Class share investments of $1,000,000 or more ($250,000 or more with respect to MainStay California Tax Free Opportunities Fund, MainStay High Yield Municipal Bond Fund, MainStay New York Tax Free Opportunities Fund, MainStay Tax Advantaged Short Term Bond Fund, and MainStay Tax Free Bond Fund; or $500,000 or more with respect to MainStay Floating Rate Fund and MainStay Short Duration High Yield Fund). Effective January 1, 2017, a CDSC of 1% may be imposed on certain redemptions of such shares within 24 months of the date of purchase.Investment Definitions
The S&P 500® Index is an unmanaged index and is widely regarded as the standard for measuring large-cap U.S. stock-market performance. Index results assume the reinvestment of all capital gain and dividend distributions. The securities holdings and volatility of the Fund differ significantly from the stocks that make up the S&P 500 Index. An investment cannot be made directly into an index.The P/E Ratio (price-to-earnings) denotes the weighted average of all the P/Es of the securities in the Fund's portfolio. The P/B Ratio (price-to-book) is the weighted average of all the P/Bs of the securities in the Fund's portfolio. Return on Equity (ROE) is the weighted average of all the ROEs of the securities in the Fund's portfolio. ROE is calculated by dividing net income by book value. Standard deviation measures how widely dispersed a fund's returns have been over a specified period of time. A high standard deviation indicates that the range is wide, implying greater potential for volatility. Beta is a measure of historical volatility relative to an appropriate index (benchmark) based on its investment objective. A beta greater than 1.00 indicates volatility greater than the benchmark's. Alpha measures a fund's risk-adjusted performance and is expressed as an annualized percentage. R-Squared measures the percentage of a fund's movements that result from movements in the index. The Sharpe Ratio shown is calculated for the past 36-month period by dividing annualized excess returns by annualized standard deviation. The Annual Turnover Rate is as of the most recent annual shareholder report. Upside/Downside Market Capture measures a manager's performance in up/down markets relative to the Fund's benchmark.
