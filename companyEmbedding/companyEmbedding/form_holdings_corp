How a Holding Company Works
A holding company is a special type of business that doesn’t do anything itself.  Instead, it owns investments, such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, gold, silver, real estate, art, patents, copyrights, licenses, private businesses, or virtually anything of value.  The term holding company comes from the fact that the business has one job: to “hold” their investments.
History is filled with examples of amazing holding companies, such as Allegheny, Loews, Berkshire Hathaway, The Marcus Corporation, Cascade Investment, and Walton Enterprises.  Many modern day corporations such as General Electric or Bank of America are really holding companies because they own a bevy of smaller businesses; e.g., Bank of America is actually a bank holding company, owning control of the stock of other private companies including the eponymous bank, insurance businesses, asset management companies, securities underwriters, and more.  That is, when you buy shares of Bank of America on the New York Stock Exchange, the company you are buying doesn’t do anything itself.  It is merely a conduit through which it controls and owns the stock of underlying businesses.
 
Personally, I like to think of holding companies as coming in two forms:

Holding companies that serve as investment vehicles for investors
Holding companies that serve as risk management tools for large corporations

Although they have some similarities, they are different.  It is important you understand which you are thinking about and why both types are used.
How a Hypothetical Holding Company Could Be Formed
For investors, a holding company provides the ability to make investments in a wide range of assets, including taking minority stakes in businesses. It would be easier to just provide a fictional example to illustrate how this would work.
Imagine you were part of a rich family that decides to invest together.  You think a holding company is your best vehicle so you decide to form one.  You incorporate a new business called Arlington Investment Group LLC by filing the documents with the Secretary of State and paying a lawyer to draw up the operating agreement, all of which costs less than a few thousand dollars (and it can even be done or less than $200 if necessary).
There are 10 family members, each of whom writes a check for $1 million to the new holding company’s bank account in exchange for 10% ownership.  Once everyone’s contribution is received, the holding company has the simplest balance sheet in the world:
Assets: $10,000,000
Liabilities: None
Member Equity (Book Value): $10,000,000
I’m going to show you how the holding company could use that $10 million to control $500 million or more without a lot of risk.  This is an extreme over-simplification but the idea is to teach you how holding companies work so we can ignore the details for now.
Holding Companies Allow for Structural Leverage Opportunities
First, say the family decides they want to build a $6 million apartment building in town, but they only want to invest $1 million of their own plus receive a management fee.  The new holding company is the perfect way to achieve this.  They create a new company, Oak Lane Apartments LLC, and contribute $1 million in cash and write the operating agreement so that other investors can buy $2 million in ownership (2/3), and the bank can provide $3 million in debt financing through a secured non-recourse mortgage.  The operating agreement requires that 5% of rents be paid to a business called Arlington Property Management LLC, which is another new subsidiary the holding company formed.
[mainbodyad]
In effect, the family is using only 10% of its assets, or $1 million, to control a $6 million apartment building.  They are receiving 33.33% ownership in the building, plus 5% of rents, giving them a form of “synthetic equity”.  But if they wrote it correctly, they would only have $1 million at risk.  They have achieved 6-1 leverage with a relatively small amount of debt; it is the structure that did it for them.
Then, they could start making investments in other companies, taking minority stakes in businesses, buying stocks, launching new companies, etc.  They could even create a mutual fund adviser and manage hundreds of millions of dollars on a tiny investment, earning fees on that giant pool of capital.
The result is, the family is now controlling more than half a billion in assets, with very little risk to itself, on only $10 million.
Assets In a Holding Company Can Be Put in “Silos.”
Just as important, if one of the investment fails, the others are isolated. Say the Arlington Property Management LLC business had an employee embezzle all the money and it went bankrupt.  The parent holding company could put it into receivership, create a new property management group the next day, and the only loss would be the $100,000 they put into the business to get it off the ground.  Their investment in the chocolate candies company, the mutual fund adviser, and the apartment building itself were beyond reach.
Money managers often refer to this as putting assets in self-contained “silos” because if one is destroyed, it burns to the ground in the middle of a field without taking down anything else of value.
Consider Dunkin Donuts.  It is actually a holding company.  All of the intellectual property, such as the Dunkin Donuts name, logos, etc., are owned by a subsidiary known as DD IP Holder LLC.  Take a look at the side of one of the cups …

Get it?  It stands for Dunkin Donuts Intellectual Property Limited Liability Company.
This subsidiary will license the brand name assets to the franchisees or company owned locations.  They may hold the real estate in another subsidiary, which rents the storefronts to the business.  They may have the equipment owned by another company that leases it to the business.  Then, they may have the actual operating company that sells the donuts called “101 Main Street Donuts LLC”, but it is paying fees to the other subsidiaries to rent the Dunkin’ Donuts name, rent the real estate, rent the equipment … you get the idea.
[mainbodyad]
The result is, if someone walks in, falls, sues the company and bankrupts it, only that location that operated is going down.  Within 30 seconds, a Dunkin Donuts could open a new restaurant at that same location called “101 Main Street Donuts Version II LLC”, with the sister subsidiaries leasing all of the assets right back to it.  The person who sued may walk away with little or nothing.
To put it another way, if you were going to own a manufacturing business, you might consider creating a parent holding company structure like this:

Acme Factory Holding Company LLC

Acme IP Holder LLC (brand names, trademarks, etc.)
Acme Real Estate LLC (the building and real estate)
Acme Equipment LLC (the equipment)
Acme Human Services LLC (the employees)
Acme Manufacturing LLC (the operating company)



All of the subsidiaries would be owned by the holding company, but Acme Manufacturing LLC would be the business in the traditional sense.  It just that it would pay a fee to lease employees from the human service subsidiary, equipment from the equipment subsidiary, the building from the real estate subsidiary, and the brand name from the IP Holder subsidiary.  If an employee sued the company, only the human services business would be at risk.
A lot of multi-national mega corporations use this structure and then have the IP holders located in very low tax rate countries because the income paid to it by the operating companies, which may be in high tax rate areas, will be charged a lower rate.  Bloomberg ran a story today about how Google had gotten its tax rate down to 2% or 3% in some jurisdictions by using companies in the Cayman Islands and Ireland.  Imagine that Dunkin Donuts charged each location $100,000 per year to use the name, shoving all of that income in the DD IP Holder LLC subsidiary, which may be in the Isle of Man.  This is why the big accounting firms can be so lucrative.  People who do this stuff and know the tax code spend their whole lives studying.
Likewise, British American Tobacco has an entire page of its massive major subsidiaries.  It would be almost impossible for someone to bankrupt it unless they went after the parent holding company.  You couldn’t just sue the local cigarette factory.  It’s like a lawyer’s dream.  Keep in mind, each of these main subsidiaries may have dozens of subsidiaries of their own.

Now, to be perfectly clear: The rules are so incredibly complex that this is just a theoretical, incredibly simplified broad overview example of how something like this would work.  It probably wouldn’t be worth the effort to setup a structure that complicated unless your business were generating massive annual profits.  In most cases, a guy running a little bakery in a small town is going to be covered by his insurance policy.  To him, the odds are good that a holding company would be an expensive, mind numbingly painful paperwork nightmare.
Transferring and Pooling Assets Through a Holding Company
Another big advantage of a holding company is that it allows families to pool their assets or transfer wealth in a far more efficient way.  Imagine trying to give shares of each of the above businesses to dozens of grandchildren.  It would be a logistical nightmare.  With a conglomerate structure, you could just issue shares of the holding company to your grand kids and they would indirectly own part of everything.  They would only have to deal with one tax filing, one stock, and one shareholder meeting.  Plus, you could write the holding company operating agreement so that you retained 100% voting control.
Holding Company Taxation
It is extremely important that you use the best, most respected and most qualified accountants, attorneys, and advisers because the rules surrounding investments can be complex when using a holding company.  In the case of taxes, there is a special holding company tax that is only applied to regular c-corporations in the United States that have 50% or more of the stock held by five or fewer investors!  It is a double-digit surcharge tax that could be devastating to your profits.
A holding company is a type of investment company that owns other assets and investments.  A holding company itself doesn’t do anything.  It owns things.  Image © Comstock/Thinkstock
That is the reason so many families seem to be opting for holding companies structured as limited liability companies, also known as an LLC, or limited partnerships, also known as an LP.  By employing these legal entities, you can elect pass-through taxation, just like an old-fashion partnership, so that no holding company tax should apply.  Each partner reports his or her share of the pro-rata gains and losses after receiving a Schedule K-1and pays tax on his or her personal filing with the IRS.
For regular c-corporation holding companies, it becomes highly advantageous to acquire at least 80% of the stock of another c-corporation because the double taxation of dividends doesn’t apply on distributions made from the subsidiary to the parent company.  That is, That is, if your holding company owns 65% of the stock in another business, and that other business pays dividends at Christmas, your holding company would owe regular corporate tax on those dividends.  However, if your holding company owned 80% of the other business, it should not have to pay corporate tax on the dividends it received from that other business it was already taxed once at the subsidiary level.
The Reason Tycoons and Investors Prefer Holding Companies
In addition to all of the above reasons, a holding company is often the preferred vehicle of a true investor because it allows you to open an office and have that office devoted to nothing but finding places to put your money to work.
Once you have the capital, all you need is a good fireplace, some nice paintings, a cup of coffee, and a stack of annual reports. Or, if you’re Walter Schloss, a desk next to a water cooler in a space the size of a closet.
You show up each day, try to do intelligent things, avoid stupidity, and keep costs low.  As I’ve said a million times, compounding will do the rest.  You can pay yourself a salary and watch your net worth, through the holding company’s book value, grow higher each year if you run it well.
[mainbodyad]
Holding companies are as diverse as their owners.  Some specialize in hotels and other real estate, some own restaurants, some build coffee shops, some invest only in publicly traded stocks, others focus on making investments in high-tech start-ups, some fund movie projects, while still others acquire silver mines or mineral rights.
The point is, a holding company is worth too much effort and doesn’t provide enough benefits for most small investors.  You should never add an extra layer of management unless it is necessary.  There are some expenses involved, such as preparing another set of tax returns, that must be taken into account.  If those are even a rounding error, you probably should wait until it is going to be worth the expenditure.  You should never want a holding company simply for the sake of owning one.  They have very specific purposes.  An exception might be a family who has a few hundred thousand dollars and wants to invest together through a single entity.
Summary of a Holding Company
A holding company:

Is any regular corporation, LLC, or LP that owns investments in other companies but doesn’t engage in any operations itself. That is, Berkshire Hathaway is a holding company because it doesn’t do anything.  Instead, it owns 100% of the stock of GEICO, which is an insurance company.  It owns 80% or 90% of the stock of Nebraska Furniture Mart, which is a huge furniture retailer.  It owns more than 8% of the stock of Coca-Cola through its insurance holdings.  But Berkshire itself just has a handful of employees and a bank vault full of stock certificates.  That is it.  Any money it has comes from dividends paid by the subsidiaries on June 30th and December 31st of each year.
Can be used to silo investment assets and protect them, such as Dunkin’ Donuts putting its intellectual property into its own LLC.
Can be used to transfer wealth to friends and family. If you own a collection of businesses, rental properties, or other valuables, it is far more convenient to transfer shares in a parent company than it is in each individual asset.
Can permit you to structure deals so you control far more money than you otherwise could afford. If you had $10 million and used it to buy control of a $20 million insurance group that had $70 million in float, you would be controlling $70 million from your holding company.

In essence, a holding company is in the business of providing capital and people.  That is it.  Some don’t even do that (Berkshire Hathaway refuses to provide management to the subsidiaries it purchases; they don’t run businesses.  General Electric, on the other hand, is one of the greatest machines of all time and can have someone else running a company within 12 hours.)
I hope that helps you understand the concept and why they are so useful.

Good article.. one question. I am thinking of using a holding company to take a more strategic view of my business investments and also limit risk exposure. In this case do you think it is worth having a dedicated holding subsidiary that employs staff to oversee the holding company (eg Arlington  Holding Management LLC, or something) so that the holding company never has employees which obviously come with risk? 






Gilvus



It depends on how much extra overhead you’re capable and willing to take. I’ve also been looking into this, and it seems that in order to qualify as a personal holding company, the company’s gross income for any tax year must be 60% passive income (dividends, rents, royalties, etc.) (search for “26 USC Sec. 543”).
Naturally, I’m eager to hear Joshua’s input on this.






Wil ‘Chilli’ Schock



  Not that I am an expert on this issue, but think about it for a second; The way of corporate business in the US today is saturated with hiring employees who are not employees. They are, across the board, seeming to for force employees into becoming contractors in order to get the job. Then, when they want to fire them, they just do. And then they don’t worry about paying unemployment benefits or being sued for discrimination, giving them proper severances, etc. The insulation afforded the corporation from this is significant. So if you were to have a K-Pra Staffing LLC subsidiary of the K-Pra Holding LLC company that supplied staff to manage that parent company, you may even want to make them contractors. It gets complicated, but clearly adding layers to the equation is all more doorways that someone ultimately would have to unlock to get back to the real cash itself that is what anyone is looking to protect. And of course, forming the holding company somewhere like Wyoming and not having your name associated with it in any public record, adds that much additional insulation. Depending on the level of investment we are talking about, it may even be worth it to form the holding company in Seychelles or another foreign country with laws that make law suits almost impossible to launch. So your money may be in a Seychelle’s bank, or it may be owned by your Seychelles LLC, but is actually held inside 20 different banks in the US, none of which are identifiable to anyone anywhere without paying massive court fees in advance to launch the suit, all blind and guessing at who the rightful owners of the LLC even were. Again, all levels of insulation. Do we need that many levels for a lawful business? Well, I have lost a lot of money not having a holding company to insulate my operating liabilities, so I am open to all ideas of insulation now.

If you are not an Accredited or Sophisicated Investor, is it against the law for you tostart a holding company that invests in privately-held businesses?






Joshua Kennon



The accredited or sophisticated investor rules deal with certain types of securities issuance if you are raising money (e.g., issuing shares of stock or bonds to investors in exchange for cash or goods).  I guess, theoretically, you could start a holding company with nothing but $1,000 and buy a couple shares of stock but I don’t much see the point.  In that case, a simple brokerage account would have been more effective or, if you own a family business, keeping the family operating entities separately owned until the economies of scale and organization benefits of bringing them under the same roof justified it.






Knowledge Seed



I have a several family members (siblings and cousins) that own a variety of businesses that, as I accumulate substantial savings, I would like to invest in. 
I was under the impression that, because I don’t meet the requirements to be an Accredited or Sophisticated investor, I can’t invest in those companies. The holding company was just a way to skip those requirements  – if possible.
But you’re saying, whether I meet those requirements or not, I can invest in those companies without a holding company, right?






Joshua Kennon



No, that is different.  You asked if you can *start* a holding company.  Sure, anyone can.  But neither you personally, nor your holding company, could invest in a private offering (e.g., private stocks or bonds) if the business issuing them only allows accredited or sophisticated investors because it is relying on something like Regulation D as a safe harbor.  You can’t get around the requirements, if that’s what you’re trying to do.  
Technically, there are a few ways a non-accredited or sophisticated investor can buy shares of a privately held business, such as Regulation D Rule 506, which allows up to 35 non-accredited investors in an offering of private securities (reference: http://www.sec.gov/answers/rule506.htm) but a lot of smart people won’t even take advantage of that.  There is too much liability exposure if you start letting in a lot of non-accredited investors.  A few years ago, I point blank had a securities lawyer tell me that even if I loved the family member with all of my heart, it would be patently stupid to allow anyone who didn’t meet the accredited status into a business I was considering launching, even if they wanted to buy several hundred thousand dollars worth of shares.  I listened to him and scrapped the idea of allowing them in until I could come up with a better solution.  No one wants to hear, “Sorry, but you aren’t worth the liability exposure” but that is what it comes down to in the end.
I’m not a lawyer so take this with a grain of salt, but it’s just not worth the trouble for the business owner to admit anyone, family or friend, who isn’t accredited.  No matter how hard you try, it sounds like your family members are going to find a reason not to let you invest and, frankly, they should.  They are being wise given the current state of regulation in the country.  You may not want to hear that, but the gist is, move on and find somewhere else to put your money.  It isn’t worth the trouble and it sounds like your family is trying to be polite because they don’t want to use one of the Regulation D rules to make an exception for you.  They are being rational.

This is a great article! Very informative and very useful. Thanks for sharing!

 wow!I have been going through all the details here and find them interesting,but,can you guys advise me ,Say one registers a holdings company without even huge amounts of monies as some statements suggest,Do you guys think its wise to start a Holdings company with a notion of raising funds for it through loans from the Banks and then Open Subsidery Companies to Operate the Businesses and pay the Dues to it as should the case be,Do you think its a wise idea?








Tyson



So I’ve got a question for you, that I hope you can shed
some light on in regards to possible conflict of interests, etc. 
Example:
Fact: Arlington Family
runs and owns a construction company structured as a sole proprietor.  
Fact: In addition to running the construction company, they
also own several pieces of property that they lease.
Problem Assessment: They are currently researching changing
the company over to an LLC for increased liability protection for all their
assets and seeking future expansion into other ventures.  If they create a holding “Arlington
Enterprise LLC,” then create operating “Arlington Construction LLC” and operating
“Arlington Real Estate,” can they actively manage either of the operating LLC’s?  I.E. Father Arlington being the primary
manager, bidder, operator, etc. of “Arlington Construction,” but all other
assets remaining in the holding LLC.  The
question arises for me is does this cause a conflict of interest and negate the
purpose of the holding & operating LLC setup if Father Arlington is also
part of the holding LLC?  My hours of
research can’t seem to address this situation.
Any ideas or help?  Location for
hypothetical is California.  Thanks for the article and website!






Joshua Kennon



There is no clear cut answer.  The concern is whether or not “Father Arlington” in your question treats the company as a de facto extension of himself; that is, whether or not he “pierces the corporate veil”.  That (“piercing the corporate veil”) is what you are asking me about whether you realize it or not.
Research that phrase and you will learn everything you want to know about your question.  There is no clear line.  It is a judgement call when litigation arises.  The safest way would be to avoid it entirely but that isn’t always practical or desirable.  
If a concern arose in that department, I would unquestionably be speaking to attorneys in the respective state(s) rather than trying to figure it out for myself.






Tyson



Thank you Mr. Kennon for getting back to me.  Its pretty much as you said, there isn’t an exact guideline or ruling to follow in this situation.  The best answer I’ve been able to find for limiting PCV follows this: 
Abide by the rules of an LLC
Submit all required documents (quarterly statements etc.)
Follow the operating agreement
Do not co-mingle personal & business assets (i.e. good
accounting practices, etc.)
Limit possibility of “alter-ego” accusations
However, like you said, there isn’t a clear cut response for
it and if this were to be happening bring in an attorney(s).  Thanks again for your feedback, this was a good exercise in future planning for me.










phiston



Thanks for sharing this great article Mr. Kennon. I was wondering if you can address Obert’s question from 2 months ago about starting a Holding Company through bank loans. Thanks in advance.






Tayler



Hi. I really appreciate the information in this article–very helpful. Many articles discuss how to start a holding company, however, rarely do I see articles that discuss how to manage a holding company, such as the daily operations. Could you share some light on that please? Thanks so much. 






Danesh Narayanan



Hi..Great article..thanks for the info..I have an excellent investment opportunity to invest in agricultural land. Iam planning to invest my own funds and also use funding from a couple of my friends. Is it advisable for me to say start a Holding company in an offshore country, pool in the funds, then start a locally registered company in the country where we plan to invest, and the holding company buys the shares of this company..am I getting your point right..Would appreciate your advise..Tks Dan.






Andrew Knight



Wow, amazing site, amazing article amazing everything.  This is the best read regarding this topic I have ever read.  Now I have a question.  I read the article and I understand you pointed out not to start a Holding company just because you want to or unless you have a lot of funds to manage.  But what about starting one for security of assets and planning for the future?  I’m not a big wig or in any of those categories, but I’ve always been fascinated about Holding companies and how they can be used to own/invest in other assets, companies, stocks etc…but never really understood at what additional cost to me I guess.  But it’s something I’ve wanted to do for the long haul, thinking ahead for the future just trying to put things in place.  I know most of the big guys do it, so I guess my question is, is it just for the big guys, is this something to do as planning for the future going on the assumption that I’ll have successful investments and ventures?

Inorder to attract investors to new business opportunity if we formed a group of construction planning, designing company, general builder, heating and air, electrical etc. Would this new formed co-operation of individual companies become a partners in a holding company. Or is there a different entity formed by co-operations. If the group decided to build a medical building and wanted to invest into the a medical building to sale or rent. Would a holding company be a proper entity to offer stocks to outside investors.

formed a c-corp and I have a real estate llc. I am partnering on a restaurant deal and will be creating another llc to operate it. The c-corp was set up to “own” both llc’s and large amounts of income from coming onto my personal tax return. 
My question is, how do I make the llc’s subsidiaries of the corp? I’m assuming you change the ownership of the llc’s with the state, update the ein’s and also update the operating agreements….to reflect only the corp name and info (100% real estate llc, 50% restaurant llc)? 
Also, I would like to know how to handle future income of llc’s….does the money go straight into the llc account then get disbursed at intervals to corp, or does it go directly into corp bank acct as it’s made.
Thanks

Ok maybe I made the wrong comment. Let me try again:
Lets say you are new to this concept and will need help along the way. Where does someone with no investment dollars find the resources to compete with lottery winners and athletes who can afford to #1 Put up their own money and #2 hire an superstar advisement team to look over virtually every aspect of their holding company portfolio(s).i.e. tax accountants/attorneys, management firm, numbers crunchers, researchers the whole gamut.
Lastly, Joshua whats your background. i.e. Business MBA grad, math major, financial planner?
and….
What resources do you recommend? 
A great cheat sheet would be to just give out stock to talent but there is that thing of not knowing( how much to give them in i.o.u.
fast track help would be appreciated. GULP, HELP!!!

Ronald Ragan



After hours of research(I might be wrong), in order to avoid personal holding company tax( c corp) is to have 12 or more share holders with equal shares. So no 5 share holders or less will have more than 50% interest of the company.
Also have not found any information regarding multiple C corporation to lower tax bracket.
So for 12 people, they can form multiple Whyoming C Corp and pay 15% fed tax and reinvest their profit forever(the tax bracket will be raised in future time when profit increased which would be another research.)
The purpose of this is to grow dividend investment with minimun Fed tax and zero state tax.
For controlling purpose, one can have a master LLC lending $$ to them and defer/arrange interest payment.
Please correct my rookie plan.






Marilyn



This was very interesting. I am wondering if this is the correct business structure to setup.  I have come up with a name which is the Brand Name for business 5 different business that wants to be under the umbrella brand but will still have their own name. Its the link to bring all the businesses together. However, the business underneath would be owned and operated by those individuals. The types of business are just services, IE health, fitness,life coach etc, People providing services not product but we all want to come together under a brand. Potentially we see bringing other businesses underneath so we have a network of trusted business to offer clients. However the brand would not money from the original service providers but if we allowed others to come under the brand, then it would have income.What kind business structure would you recommend? I was thinking its a franchise but looking at that seems really expensive when really this is just a company name that brings everyone together to provided different services. Any help or suggested on where to research would be great.

Question: If an LLC operating as a holding company of real commercial property uses your identity without your permission or knowledge to list you as a member and sends you monthly checks for about $6,000.00, what legal recourse would you have to protect your identity and stop the LLC fraud. This has actually happening at this time.

Can my holding company own 100% equity in XXXXX, Inc. which I am also the founder/ceo? Or would I need to appoint someone else?






Terrance A. Collins Jr



It’s possible. Fudiciary Judy is that executives put the interest of their company above the interests of the holding company. If you’re unable to prove this to be actual application in court you may allow for piercing of the veil and lose liability protection of holding company, defeating purpose of having holding company.

Hi Joshua, thanks for this introduction to holding companies. i found it very useful.  Are there currently any books you recommend in the area of setting up a holding company?






Denise Treusch



i have a very confusing question. my father had his house (which was paid off) listed as a LLC Holding Co.
he passed away leaving the holding co to the 4 children as members. The 4 children decided to sell the house.
my question is….. Do we have to pay capital gains taxes on the income? or is the house considered an inheritance and not taxable??






Sean Foley



Depends on the papers by which the LLC is formed. It can run as a C or S Corporation or Partnership. S/Partnership do pass through to the owners. C would completely shield you, it wouldn’t be considered and inheritance because the property is owned by an entity that cannot die. (The LLC…) LLCs can behave weirdly if the operating documents specify them too. It’s important to study them in detail.

Joshua… this information is great. In your opinion should you start a separate holding company for assets and for IP or can one holding company have both?






Danny



Question.
Let’s say I want to start a company that I will fund from day trading and other investment activities and then use the funds in the holding company to purchase other businesses and real and real estate.  How would you structure the holding company legally? LLC or corporation. 
What I am trying to do is have a place where I initially fund with profits from day and swing trading until I’ve accumulated a certain amount of capital  and then incorprate another entity where the  funds will be transferred to from the main holding company to purchase the an initial investment that generates cash flow  and do that all over again. And the funds from the investment will stay with that specific new entity and accumulate while transferring additional funds from trading to purchase more cash flow generating investments. That initial new entity will be separate from the main holding company and i want to do that for several different types of investments (real estate,  software/hardware, business acquisition)






Terrance A. Collins Jr



It depends… review the laws and codes in the area in which you wish to form your entity and see what it entails. Corporations pay tax on the corporation and then the individuals pay tax on the income they receive thus “double taxation”. LLC’s are disregarded entities and are not taxed at the business level so the owner(s) “member(s)” are taxed on the business a whole on their personal taxes. Some juristictions allow the minimum number of corporate board members and officers to match the number of shareholders of the entitiy. You could be a 1 person private corporation however as mention in Joshua’s wonderfully worded articles… you may become subject to additional taxation meaning you risk potential triple taxation at the federal level, not counting state or local taxations as well. However if you plan to level money in the entity to grow you aren’t paying taxes personally on income you aren’t receiving. In LLC’s even if you take $0 out of the entity you are still taxed on the entire profit/loss of the entity, but you are only taxed once. Personal taxation on corporate dividends are lessor than personal taxes from LLC distributions at the highest tier. 
There is no perfect right or wrong answer for this. Bill Gates has the Cascade LLC, Warren Buffet had Berkshire-Hathaway Inc. Both deal in the Billions of dollars in business. Coca-Cola and GE are incorporated and have hundreds of subsidiaries each (even though Coca-Cola has holding companies as large percentage shareholders). Both Bill Gates and his private Cascade LLC have shares in Microsoft, Coca-Cola & Berkshire-Hathaway (which has shares in Coca-Cola). Technically Bill sees 4 lines of income from Coca-Cola plus the income he receives being a board member of Berkshire and his salary as CEO of the LLC, both of which are partially afforded by dividends from Coca-Cola. Warren meanwhile does everything from the confines of Berkshire-Hathaway and has almost zero corporate staff.
These two gentlemen are the 2 most influential figures of the evolution of American Economics over the past two decades. Warren and Bill best friends and business partners and one does his holdings from an LLC and the other a Publically Traded corporation.

Nate Di Cenzo



I’m still trying to get my head around an effective model using holding companys. So if holding company A owns 80+% of two subsidiaries also acting as holding companies B & C, which both have their individual subsidiaries, how would I move funds from subsidiary B to subsidiary C? Subsidiary B will be the revenue driver to create the startup capital holding company A infuses into other startup ventures. I’m trying to figure out a way to move B’s capital throughout the network without extreme tax ramifications.






Terrance A. Collins Jr



This is simple. If they are LLC’s LLC’s are pass through entities and aren’t taxed at the company level. You personally (and your other members/owners of the Holding LLC) are responsible for taxes on the entire structure of your operations. Therefore you can transfer the money to Company A from Company B and transfer the money back down to company C… just make sure your book keeping is on point and accurate because the more transfers you make the more complicated it becomes. If you transfer directly from B to C then in the event of a lawsuit you lose liability protection  for company A, B & C and all of the assets they own are subject to the suit. It makes it easy to then say that your operation is not really several companies but 1 company (company A) doing business as a whole and can thus be sued as one such company. The exception would be loans from company B to company C.
If it’s a corporation you can file a consolidated tax return in which your Company A is responsible for the taxes of the entire group like example above for LLC’s. This means you aren’t taxed for distributions & dividends between the companies just the overall profit/loss for the group but itemizing the group on reporting means you’re going to need a team to handle reporting and tax prep and filing. Still you’ll want transfer the money upstream then back down stream. 
In both of these structures losses from one company can offset the profits of another so there is no real need to transfer money from company B to company C as the holding company is responsible for the group’s taxes. The capital accounts and contributions from parent company to subsidiary and the dispersments to the parent company from the subsidiary need to be kept up to date in very pristine manner. 
In order to do this the corporation must own at least 80% of the vote and percentage interest in the subsidiaries. In the LLC model the LLC is only responsible for their ownership interest in the subsidiary for tax purposes. So if the ownership percentage varies between subsidiary to subsidiary the potential for a book keeping nightmare exists and the ability to properly report or defend an audit decreases. The real risk is book keeping and accounting and as mentioned in the article… the cost of the required services to keep the engine running smoothly and recorded properly can become very pricey and time consuming. 
I hope this helps.

with the authority to practice under the jurisdiction of the formation of your business entity AND a CPA. 
The lawyer will help you protect your ASSets and the CPA will focus on how to preserve the maximum amount of your capital.
Therefore to get the answers you are looking for in depth with applicable information you should consult with both.








Duc de Richleau



Speaking as a Trader, let’s assume with the werewithall to do this.  Would there be an incentive to become a Holding Company allowing others to invest in my project?  That is, I would not be part of some familly group like you used in your example, but pretty much the boss of what I am doing investing my own initial cash.  What legal pitfalls would I face?






Nick



In order to transfer money tax free from the Operating Company to the Holding Company
A: does the Holding Company have to be a C Corp or an LLC electing to file as a C
OR
B: can it be an LLC NOT electing to file as a C?
In essence I would like to have the Operating Company a C Corp and the Holding Company as an LLC not electing to file as a C owning 100% of the Operating Company.
Thanks for this awesome post making me think!

Ryan



If I wanted to start an LLC to only hold stock in other companies with the purpose of giving it to my son to take over down the road, what are the pros/cons of this?






Red Elle



Your question is too vague and broad.
For example, If I want to retain income and reinvest income of a holding C-Corp LLC of pure stocks, I need to find 10 equal share share holders(including me) with absolutely no family ties to avoid holding company tax. The solution turns out to be just buy SPY or BRK to solve this problem.






Ryan



Is there still a holding company tax if its considered an S-corp? This holding corp would other assets besides stocks. Instead of setting up trusts for kids, i could add them as members to my LLC down the road when they become middle aged?






Red Elle



There would be no “holding company tax” other than C-Corp/C-Corp LLC. You need to focus on gift/estate tax(Fed/State/Local). You also need to consider “families by law” problems. Sometimes it would be better to create debt for “families by law” problems. It would be uncomfortable to see “were families by law” you hate sitting at the board meeting of your LLC.






Ryan



Thank you for your replies. Consider that I would also be holding other assets under the LLC, this would be ok?






Red Elle



Can not comment on your situation. I would try an example.
Let’s say I setup 18 Wyoming LLCs. Each of them own a piece of beach front Calif RE.
20 years later the buyers can choose to buy LLC with extreme low RE tax or buy RE with extreme high RE tax. This works perfect if Trump get rid of tax deduction.

Key Issues in Selecting Formation State

Filed under Running A Business.
Fact checked on May 24, 2012.

Limiting liability in your business structure involves choosing the best an organizational form. However, selecting the state in which to form the business is also a significant consideration.
choice of state issues, location, incorporate, establish entity, organizational form, home state foreign registration, asset protection, planning, strategy, debtor, preserve wealth, saving, limit liability, risk, small business, owner,
Many small business owners choose to operate their business as either a corporation or a limited liability company in order to limit their personal liability for business debts. An additional factor to consider is which state is the best one in which to form that business entity. 
You can form a corporation or limited liability company (LLC) in any state, even in a state in which you conducts no business activities. Further, even when an out-of-state entity is created, there is no requirement that any assets be located in that state.
Regardless of state you choose, you must file articles of organization with the appropriate agency for that state. As part of this process, you must designate a registered agent within that state that will accept service of process (i.e., for purposes of consenting to the state's jurisdiction.) This formation paper work is usually filed with Secretary of State's office. A fee is required at the time of the filing.
Warning

Failure to file means the entity does not exist, and the owner is operating a sole proprietorship or a general partnership. This can spell disaster if your business experiences financial difficulties or if you experience personal financial issues because all of your assets are at risk.



In addition, if your company does does business outside of the state of formation or incorporation, you must properly register in all the states in which you do business. This process is referred to as "foreign qualification." This may sound daunting, but in nearly all cases it simply requires filing out a very simple form and paying a fee to the Secretary of State.
Thus, you have two options: form the entity in your home state or form the business in another state. There are advantages and disadvantages to either option, and among the considerations are complexity of administration, fees and costs. From an asset protection standpoint, you'll want to consider the benefits of forming and registering in a state known as friendly to business ownership. Any additional expenditure of time and money may be inexpensive compared to the unique protections some states offer.
Advantages Entity Formation in Your Home State
When choosing the state in which to form your business entity, the simplest option for the small business owner is to form the entity in his or her home state, where, typically, all of the business activities will be conducted.
Forming an entity out-of-state will create additional costs. The out-of-state entity will have to register to do business in your home state. Thus, you must pay two sets of fees to form the entity out-of-state, but only one fee if the entity were formed in the owner's home state. (If you are going to do business in other states, you may need to registration in those states in any event.) However, from an asset protection perspective, these extra fees may be worth the cost. Some states' laws are considered more business-friendly than others and may afford you more protections for your business and assets. In this way, the extra costs are like paying for extra liability protection.
Registration Required in Each State with Substantial Business Activity
You must register your business entity as a "foreign" entity in each other state in which you do substantial business. The activities of a holding entity usually do not rise to the level of "doing business" in a state. Thus, normally, an out-of-state holding entity would not have to register in either the owner's home state or where the operating entity conducts the business's operations.
Failure to register in this regard should be distinguished from failure to file articles of organization. The consequences of a failure to register as a foreign entity in a state vary from state to state. For example, the entity may be barred from pursuing legal or equitable relief in state courts. 
On the other hand, failure to register will not prevent others from bringing legal actions against the corporation. Some states impose civil penalties for failure to register. And, some states simply provide that the entity must pay the registration fee that was due.
However, a few states might provide for far more insidious results, by not recognizing the entity, which would result in unlimited personal liability for the business's debts incurred in that state, or invalidation of the business's contracts. When in doubt, register--or consult an attorney for advice.
Work Smart

Note that the entity-within-an-entity concept, which is embodied in the Delaware limited liability company (LLC) statute, eliminates this problem. A single LLC can house multiple separate legal entities. This single LLC is formed in Delaware, and then registers in any state in which the operating entities will do business.




Holding Entities Need Register Only in Formation State
Holding entities need to register only in the formation state. If two entities are being formed (i.e., a holding entity and an operating entity), there will be no additional costs involved in forming an entity out-of-state. The holding entity could be formed out-of-state, and the operating entity in the owner's home state.
Because the holding entity will conduct no business activities in the home state, it needn't be registered in the home state. Specifically, the activities of the out-of-state holding entity should not rise to the level of "doing business" in the home state. Thus, the cost of forming two entities, with one formed out-of-state, will be the same as forming both entities in the owner's home state.
Factors To Consider When Selecting Formation
Some of the factors to evaluate when selecting a state of formation are

fees involved; 
protection of business assets against personal creditors; 
full-shield liability protection; 
management flexibility and simplicity; 
statutory close corporation option; 
asset protection trusts; 
tax incentives; and 
exemption from securities registration. 

State Fees Are Only One Factor to Consider
When choosing a state in which to form your business, the simplest (or cheapest) choice may not be the best choice. Another state's lower formation fee should not be the deciding factor in forming the entity there, when the owner will be doing business in his own home state as well.
Clearly, the small business owner cannot avoid his home state's fee by forming an out-of-state entity, because a registration fee, equivalent to a formation fee, must be paid to the owner's home state anyway, if the owner will be doing business there. 
However, if you are doing business in another state, but not in your home state, and you intend to use only one entity, you should consider forming the entity in the state in which you will be doing business, rather than your home state. This will result in only one fee.
Example

John is a Massachusetts resident who plans on doing business exclusively in Connecticut. If he decides to form a corporation in Massachusetts, his home state, he will pay a formation fee of $275 to the state of Massachusetts and a foreign registration fee of $385 to the state of Connecticut. John's best choice may be to form a corporation in Connecticut, and pay only the Connecticut formation fee of $100.



If your company conducts business across state lines, or outside your state of formation, you may need to go through the process of foreign qualification, including the selection of a registered agent. At this point, state fees sometimes become a consideration.
State fees to form an LLC are often lower than the fees charged to form a corporation. However, this is not always the case, particularly as states look for new forms of revenue. For example, in Nevada, one of the key states for business formation, the fees charged by the state are the same for the formation of a corporation and an LLC . And, some states charge significantly higher fees for forming and renewing an LLC than for a corporation.
If you live in one of the states that charge higher fees for forming and renewing an LLC than a corporation, you may want to consider forming a corporation, rather than an LLC, at least where fees are an important deciding factor. However, the fee savings may be misleading! In general a corporation will end up costing you more money because it may be subject to state corporate income tax, as well as annual assessments (franchise tax) based on the number of authorized shares and annual reporting fees.
The small business owner intending on forming a corporation should usually form it as a statutory close corporation. However, this form is not legally recognized in some other states that charge high LLC fees. So, the fee for forming the statutory close corporation out of state, plus the fee for registering the corporation in the home state or wherever it will be doing business, will probably be equivalent to the fee charged by the home state for an LLC there.
Some states impose "publication fees." While the small business owner should consider that other factors may, in fact, be more important than the relative fees charged, nevertheless, special note should be made of publication fees that may be required of corporations and LLC in several states.


LLCs. New York, Nebraska and Arizona require that an LLC publish the information from its articles of organization in a newspaper. For example, in New York, this information must be published once per week, for a total of six weeks, in two different newspapers. This can cost anywhere from $1,000 to $2,000, and this may make the LLC a cost-prohibitive option in these states.
Similarly, any out-of-state LLC that will be doing business in one of these states must satisfy the same publication requirements, with information from its registration. This cost can be expected to be in the same range, as described above.

Corporations. Note that four states, Arizona, Georgia, Nebraska and Pennsylvania, require that corporations publish the information in the articles of incorporation. Thus, the publication fees are not a factor in Arizona and Nebraska. 

Creditors' Rights Are Factors
When choosing a formation state for your business entity, simplicity and immediate out-of-pocket costs for state fees should not always be the main considerations. The internal affairs (voting, management, etc.) and the liability of the owners for a limited liability company (LLC) or corporation are governed by the state where the business is formed, and not the state where it does business. The laws in each state are not all the same. 
Some states offer significantly greater asset protection and other benefits as well. In fact, some states (such as Delaware and Nevada) have a reputation for developing a body of law and a court system favorable to the business owner.
As a result, you should give careful consideration--and seek input from a professional--to forming your business entity in one of these states. This is especially true if your home state is deficient from an asset protection perspective.
Warning

A business entity's internal matters (voting, management, etc) and liability status will be governed by the state in which it is formed. However, nothing requires a state to recognize a type of entity that cannot be legally formed there.
California prevents professionals from operating in the LLC form. California also limits its limited liability partnerships (LLPs) to a narrow class of professionals, namely lawyers, architects and accountants. New York also limits LLPs to professionals, but defines this term more broadly than California. Thus, in the case of professionals who form an LLC or an LLP, and plan on doing business in California or New York, caution must be exercised. 
If the entity could not be formed in those states, it also will not be recognized if it is formed in another state, and then seeks to register to do business in those states. The end result could be that the business will be recognized only as a sole proprietorship or general partnership with very limited asset protection available.



Evaluate state law protection for business interests against personal creditors. Some states do not offer adequate protection for the owner's business interest in a limited liability company (LLC) against the claims of the owner's personal creditors. These states model their LLC statute's charging order remedy on the general partnership provision that allows for foreclosure of the interest and forced liquidation of the business.
Many states, including Delaware and Nevada, offer protection for the business interest. These states model their LLC statutes on the charging order concept found in the Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act (RULPA). If the business owner's home state does not offer this business interest protection, serious consideration should be given to forming an LLC in a state that does offer such protection.
Full-shield limited liability protection is ideal. Some states offer only a limited shield (i.e., a stripped-down version) of limited liability for the owners of limited liability partnerships (LLPs). In particular, the limited shield means that the owners of an LLP will have limited liability only with respect to the actions of their co-owners; the owners will still have unlimited, personal liability in all other cases.
If the home state only offers this limited-shield version, and an LLP is the type of entity that will be formed, consideration should be given to forming the LLP in a state that offers this full-shield protection. Delaware and Nevada are two states that offer this protection.
Evaluate Management Flexibility Permitted
Some states create mandatory voting rights for all members of a limited liability company (LLC) on certain issues, even when the LLC is managed not by all the members, but by a small group of members who are termed the "managers." This can cause confusion and can make certain votes illegal. It also can interfere with an estate planning strategy--the use of the family limited liability company, where children are given nonvoting interests.
LLC statutes in some states make it clear that the operating agreement can provide that members have no voting rights at all, or limit voting rights to only certain matters. Delaware is one of those states. When the law in the home state accords all members certain mandatory voting rights, consideration should be given to forming the LLC in Delaware, or in some other state that allows the owner to completely eliminate voting rights for selected members. In addition, the Delaware LLC statute may offer greater protection in the event one of the LLC members declares bankruptcy.
Consider States That Allow Series LLCs
Delaware law permits series LLCs. Moreover, the Delaware LLC statute provides incredible flexibility and simplicity in forming and operating the LLC. It has no counterpart in statutes governing corporations (nor even in LLC statutes found in other states.) For instance, it allows the forming of an entity within an entity, thus eliminating the need to form separate LLCs (or corporations) for each separate operating activity carried out by the business. 
Each entity within the single LLC can have its own accounting system, own its own assets and be liable only for its own debts, as if each entity were a separate LLC. Thus, in many cases, a single LLC can be used to manage the holding entity, as well as the multiple operating entities (see our discussion of using multiple holding and operating companies).
This may lead to fee savings, as the single LLC would require a formation fee in Delaware and a single registration fee elsewhere where it does business. It also eliminates the question as to whether an out-of-state holding entity also must register to do business in other particular states.
Tools to Use

The Business Tools section contains Sample Articles of Organization and a Sample Operating Agreement for a Delaware LLC.



Know State Tax Ramifications for Entity Selection
Ordinarily, a limited liability company (LLC) and a subchapter S corporation are not subject to state income taxes in a state in which they conduct no business and in which the owners do not reside. This may make it desirable to form the entity out-of-state. The owners will be subject to state income taxes in the state in which they reside or the state in which the entity conducts its business activities (usually, but not always, the same state). Delaware and Nevada, two popular states for formation of LLCs and corporations, both follow these rules.
Moreover, most states will follow the presumed tax status of the LLC (as a conduit) and the federal subchapter S tax election of a corporation (to be taxed as a conduit). However, a few states may not recognize the subchapter S election. These states may impose states income taxes on the corporation even when it does no business in the state. It also is remotely possible that a state would still treat an LLC as a corporation for state income tax purposes and impose taxes on it regardless of whether it conducts operations there.
Although these situations are unlikely to be encountered, it's a good practice to check with state taxing authorities before choosing a state in which to form the business--or form the business in a state such as Delaware or Nevada, which provides clear rules favorable to the small business owner.
Look for a Business Friendly State
While every state allows you to form a corporation or an LLC, not all of them offer some of the newer, more effective asset protection and business management entity types, such as a statutory close corporation or a domestic asset protection trust.
Not All States Permit Statutory Close Corporations
Some states have a special statutory close corporation statute that is very favorable for owners of small corporations. The statutory close corporation statutes relax many of the formalities normally applicable to a corporation. Basically, these statutes allow the corporation to be operated similarly to a limited liability company (LLC).
Specifically, these corporations may do away with a board of directors, and shareholders can run the corporation, by way of a shareholder agreement, which is similar to an LLC operating agreement. Generally, shareholders do not have to hold meetings.
A failure to follow the formalities normally applicable to a regular C corporation can form the basis for a court's decision to pierce the veil of limited liability and impose unlimited, personal liability on the owners. With the absence of such formalities in the statutory close corporation, the likelihood of this doctrine being applied is lessened significantly.
Thus, if a corporation is to be formed, it should usually be formed as a statutory close corporation. This can only be done in the small group of states that allow this option, such as Delaware and Nevada.
Think Ahead

Forming an entity out-of-state will not create additional costs if, for example, the holding entity is formed out-of-state and the operating entity is formed in the owner's home state. The activities of the out-of-state holding entity should not rise to the level of "doing business" in the home state. Thus, the holding entity should not have to register in the home state.
Essentially, only the interest in the holding entity requires extra protection, as the holding entity will house the wealth of the business through strategic funding practices. The holding entity will normally own the operating entity and the most valuable assets used by the operating entity. The assets owned by the operating entity will be protected in other ways, such as with liens that run to the holding entity.
If additional costs are not an issue, the ideal situation may be to form both the holding entity and the operating entity in an asset protection friendly state, such as Delaware. This may mean three fees (two formation fees, plus a registration fee). Even if additional costs are involved, however, the benefits will outweigh those costs in most cases.



Asset Protection Trust Options Exist in a Few States
Forming the holding entity in Delaware, Nevada, or Alaska can be part of an overall asset protection plan because these states have statutes authorizing the creation of domestic asset protection trusts. However, this is a significant departure from domestic law in the United States. Accordingly, a trust created under either of these statutes could be challenged on jurisdictional grounds.
One way to bolster the validity of these trusts is to create additional "contacts" in Delaware or Alaska, where the trust is formed. Having a holding entity formed the state that funds the asset protection trust located there would create additional contacts in that state.
Certain States Facilitate Use of Holding Companies
If you are forming a holding entity and an operating entity, consider forming the holding entity out-of-state, in particular, in Delaware, and the operating entity in your home state (or where the business's activities will be conducted).
Forming the holding entity out-of-state will produce no additional costs. There will still be only two state fees: one to form the holding entity and the other to form the operating entity. The small business owner should take the lead from larger businesses and consider Delaware as the site for the holding entity. This also may help sustain the validity of an asset protection trust formed there.
In addition, if fees are not a significant concern, consider forming both the holding entity and operating entity in Delaware, so that Delaware law will govern each entity. Here, the operating entity will have to register to do business in the owner's home state (or where the business's activities will be conducted), thus creating a third fee. However, this fee may prove to be an inexpensive form of insurance. This option is more attractive when the home state's limited liability company (LLC) statute does not effectively protect an owner's interest from his personal creditors.
Note, too, that, the Delaware LLC statute allows for the creation of multiple entities within the form of single entity. This can make formation of an LLC in Delaware less expensive.
Delaware's Security Registration Exemption Could Prove Important
Unlike other states, Delaware expressly exempts from securities registration all limited liability company (LLC) interests that are not actually traded in a securities market, such as in a family LLC. (See our discussion of securities issues in business formation.) This kind of flexibility is particularly advantageous when, in the manager-managed LLC, non-manager interests are to be issued.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
