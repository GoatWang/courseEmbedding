					Full Description



FluoroPharma Medical, Inc., formerly Commercial E-Waste Management Inc., incorporated on January 25, 2007, is a biopharmaceutical company specializing in discovering, developing and commercializing molecular imaging pharmaceuticals with initial applications in the area of cardiology. The Company operates through biopharmaceutical research and development segment. The Company is focused on the development of cardiovascular imaging agents that can detect and assess acute and chronic forms of coronary artery disease (CAD). The Company has two clinical-stage molecular imaging pharmaceutical product candidates: Flourine-18 (18-F) TPP (BFPET) and 18-F FCPHA (CardioPET).BFPET (18-F FTPP)The Company's BFPET program includes a ((18F)-labeled cationic lipophilic tetraphenylphosphonium ion (18-F TPP) as an imaging agent designed for use in stress-testing for patients with presumptive or proven CAD. 18-F FTPP measures the extent and severity of cardiovascular disease through the detection of ischemic (reversible and viable) and infarcted (irreversibly damaged) myocardial (heart) tissue. Its mechanism of action allows it to enter the myocardial cells of the heart muscle in direct proportion to blood flow and membrane potential, the indicators of adequate cardiac blood supply. Since ischemic and infarcted myocardial cells take up less 18-F FTPP than normal healthy myocardial cells do, 18-F FTPP can distinguish ischemic and infarcted cells from those that are healthy. 18-F FTPP has completed a Phase I clinical trial in approximately 12 healthy volunteers.CardioPET (18-F FCPHA)The Company's CardioPET program includes Trans-9-(18F)-Fluoro-3, 4-Methyleneheptadecanoic Acid (18-F FCPHA) as a molecular imaging agent designed to assess myocardial blood flow and metabolism in patients with CAD, including patients unable to perform exercise cardiac stress-testing. 18-F FCPHA allows for the potential detection of ischemic (reversible and viable) and infarcted (irreversibly damaged) myocardial tissue in patients with presumptive or proven acute and chronic CAD and related cardiac diseases. In addition, 18-F FCPHA could be useful for assessing myocardial viability for the prediction of improvement prior to and/or following revascularization in patients with acute CAD, including myocardial infarction (heart attack). 18-F FCPHA allows for the identification of compromised but viable heart tissue. The revascularization in those patients with substantial viable myocardium results in improved left ventricular function and survival. The Company has completed enrollment in a Phase IIa trial at four sites in Belgium to assess its safety and efficacy in CAD patients. The Company is conducting final safety and efficacy analysis.

FluoroPharma
Scientific Breakthroughs in PET Imaging Agents



Through innovations and developments in molecular imaging agents, FluoroPharma's goal is to become the leader in the early detection and management of coronary artery disease




PET Scan Imaging Agents





Agent: Muscle State Imaging Agent
Type: Fatty Acid (Labeled with Fluorine 18)
Condition: Coronary Artery Disease
Status: completed enrollment




CardioPET(18F FCPHA)



This imaging agent exploits the dietary needs of the heart as it relates to glucose and fatty acids. By introducing a radio-labeled analog to the natural fatty acids utilized as an energy source by the heart we can visualize the anatomic location and state of the muscle within the areas defined by the specific coronary artery blood flow distribution and detect problems in advance of symptoms that would lead to a stress test.













PET Scan Imaging Agents





Agent: Blood Flow Imaging Agent
Type: Positively Charged Molecule (Labeled with Fluorine 18)
Condition: Coronary Artery Disease
Status: Phase 1 clinical trials completed




BFPET(18F FTPP)



BFPET, a Flourine-18 labeled tracer, has been designed to enter the myocardial cells in direct proportion to blood flow and cell membrane potential. These are two of the most important physiological indicators upon which adequate blood supply to the heart depends. BFPET has been designed to differentiate among those cells of the myocardium that may be ischemic, infarcted and those that are healthy

Shaping the Future of Molecular PET Imaging
FluoroPharma (FPMI) is developing breakthrough molecular imaging agents for positron emission tomography (PET) which will fulfill critical unmet medical needs. The company’s agents will give clinicians important tools for the detection and assessment of pathology before clinical manifestation of diseases.

FluoroPharma Medical Announces Scheduled Completion of Enrollment in a Phase II Clinical Trial of CardioPET (18F FCPHA) for Assessment of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)HomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreTry Yahoo Finance on Firefox »YahooSearchSearchSign inU.S. Markets close in 1 hr 57 minsS&P 5002,469.73-5.69 (-0.23%)Dow 3021,807.71+11.16 (+0.05%)Nasdaq6,375.42-6.77 (-0.11%)Today's ChartsDon't get blindsided by Tesla's shiny new Model 3FluoroPharma Medical Announces Scheduled Completion of Enrollment in a Phase II Clinical Trial of CardioPET (18F FCPHA) for Assessment of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)MarketwiredDecember 4, 2014ReblogShareTweetShareMONTCLAIR, NJ--(Marketwired - December 04, 2014) - FluoroPharma Medical, Inc. (FPMI), a company specializing in the development of novel diagnostic imaging products that utilize positron emission tomography (PET) technology for the detection and assessment of disease before clinical manifestation, today announced that enrollment for this Phase II trial will be closing on December 15th . To date, FluoroPharma believes it has acquired sufficient patient data allowing for the assessment of the pharmaceutical's safety and quality of FCPHA generated cardiac images in humans.According to Thijs Spoor, Chairman and CEO of FluoroPharma, "This trial has so far produced data on image quality, the optimal time for imaging after injection, and preliminary data on myocardial blood flow. To date, no major adverse events have been seen with any patients dosed with CardioPET. As we plan for the next development steps, all of this data will now be incorporated into a thorough assessment versus other clinical comparators of SPECT and angiography. It is expected that the full data will be evaluated in a blinded read fashion and then presented early next year." Mr. Spoor continues, "This is a major milestone for the company. We are encouraged by our progress to date, and believe that CardioPET potentially signals a compelling new direction for PET cardiac imaging at a time when healthcare professionals around the world could benefit from novel diagnostic imaging that expand and improve their diagnostic capabilities. Symptomatic coronary artery disease affects millions of patients worldwide and accounts for the significant increase in mortality."This Phase II clinical trial is an open label study designed to assess the safety and diagnostic performance of CardioPET (18F FCPHA) as compared to currently utilized SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging agents and angiography, the traditional standard of care for establishing the presence of obstructive CAD. The trial allows the company to evaluate the dynamics and performance of fatty acid markers in patients under variable conditions: at rest or with induced stress. This multicenter study was conducted in Belgium.CardioPET (18F FCPHA), one of FluoroPharma's PET imaging products, is a fatty acid uptake indicator, which is designed to be used as a cardiac imaging agent and may prove to be an effective alternative to currently available diagnostic tests. FluoroPharma believes its pharmacokinetic characteristics could be especially valuable in patients who are unable to exercise. There is no commercially available fatty acid analog marker in the U.S. or Europe, where coronary disease is a major problem.Olivier Gheysens, MD, PhD, the principal investigator for the entire study, noted, "Fatty acid metabolism is affected in various degrees by the presence of coronary disease. Under normal conditions, free fatty acids are the heart's main energy source. With reduction in blood flow to the myocardium, it switches its metabolism to glucose. The myocardium will switch back to fatty acid metabolism when blood flow is restored and if the myocardium has not been permanently damaged. CardioPET has the potential to evaluate the degree to which the myocardium has been affected."A traceable fatty acid marker such as CardioPET will allow the evaluation of cardiac blood flow as well as the dietary preference of the cardiac muscle under stress or at rest which is an indicator of the metabolic state of the heart, ergo cardiac muscle viability. The ability to evaluate cardiac viability provides a significant advantage in comprehensive assessment of CAD in comparison to the currently utilized methods which focus mainly on hemodynamics alone.About FluoroPharma MedicalFluoroPharma is a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of proprietary PET imaging products to evaluate cardiac disease at the cellular and molecular levels. The company has licensed technology from the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.The company's goal is to enable personalized medicine through precision diagnostics that will help the medical community diagnose disease more accurately at the earliest stages, leading to more effective treatment, management and better patient outcomes.Read MoreFluoroPharma's initial focus is the development of breakthrough PET imaging agents and is advancing two products in clinical trials for assessment of acute and chronic forms of coronary artery disease. These novel agents have been designed to rapidly target myocardial cells. Other active programs include the development of agents that could potentially be used for imaging specific cancers.In addition to the United States, Europe and China, patents related to FluoroPharma's portfolio of imaging compounds have been issued in Japan, Canada, Australia and Mexico.For more information on the company, please visit: www.fluoropharma.comForward-Looking StatementsExcept for historical information contained herein, the statements in this release are forward-looking.
