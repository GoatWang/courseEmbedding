Industry Veteran Brings Stronger Focus On Virtualization and Cloud Opportunities To Leading Provider of Data Protection and Backup & Recovery Solutions 
WOBURN, MA, November 29, 2011 – Acronis Inc., a leading provider of data protection and disaster recovery solutions for physical, virtual and cloud environments, today announced the hiring of Mr. Alex Pinchev as President and Chief Executive Officer.  Mr. Pinchev will join Acronis on January 17, 2012 and replaces Jason Donahue who has served as Chief Executive Officer since 2008. Mr. Pinchev has served as a Member of the Acronis Board of Directors since November 2010, and will continue to serve on the Board of Directors as the Chief Executive Officer appointee.
Mr. Pinchev has over 30 years’ experience in building and growing highly successful companies.  He joins Acronis from Red Hat where he served as an Executive Vice President for the last nine years and was most recently the President of Global Sales, Services & Field Marketing. Mr. Pinchev’s  business and technology leadership has been instrumental in Red Hat’s tremendous growth and expansion into emerging markets. His extensive experience in the storage management and virtualization markets, combined with his experience driving highly effective global teams will maximize Acronis’ growth opportunities.
"Acronis has a winning combination of talented employees and market leading technology, with a broad channel ecosystem and a great global customer base,” commented Pinchev. “With a successful business in data protection and disaster recovery solutions for physical, virtual and cloud environments, Acronis now has the opportunity to further develop its routes-to-market and expand its technology presence. I am excited to join the talented team at Acronis and to meet the growing demands of our customers worldwide.”

Since first launching innovative disk imaging technology in 2003, Acronis now has over 175,000 business customers and over 3 million consumer customers worldwide, served by a network of more than 20,000 partners. With the launch earlier this year of Acronis Backup & Recovery® 11, which supports all major virtual hypervisors including VMware®, Microsoft®, Red Hat®, Citrix®, and Parallels®, and Acronis® vmProtect™ 6 for VMware® vSphere™ servers, the Company is now positioned to take advantage of the fast growing virtualization market opportunity as more businesses adopt new IT strategies.
“We are proud to have an industry leader of Alex’s caliber join us at this time in the Company’s development,” said Ilya Zubarev, Chairman of the Board at Acronis. “Since Alex joined our Board in 2010, we have benefitted from his extensive experience, sharp business acumen and vision for the future development of the virtual and cloud markets. We believe that Alex’s strong leadership will accelerate Acronis’ journey to be a global leader in backup & recovery solutions not only for physical servers, but for virtual environments, and into the cloud.”
Prior to joining Acronis, Mr. Pinchev was the President of Global Sales Services & Field Marketing of Red Hat Inc., a position he held since April 2008 and prior to that Mr. Pinchev served as an Executive Vice President of Global Sales and Operations and President of International at Red Hat Inc. for five years. 
Prior to Red Hat, he served as an Executive Vice President of MRO Software Inc. from June 2002 to December 2002. He was the founder of software company Maincontrol, Inc. and served as its Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer from July 1996 to June 2002. Mr. Pinchev founded two successful software companies in Europe and served as their President and Chief Executive Officer from 1987 to 1996. Mr. Pinchev holds several Board positions.

Rackspace Hires Alex Pinchev as Global Sales and Marketing Leader

By Christina Weaver -  December 10, 2015 






Industry Veteran to Help Strengthen Global Adoption of Rackspace Managed Cloud
SAN ANTONIO – Dec. 10, 2015 – Rackspace® (NYSE: RAX) today announced that technology industry veteran and proven sales leader Alex Pinchev has joined the company as executive vice president and president of global sales and marketing. Effective January 1, Pinchev will oversee Rackspace’s sales and marketing organizations and drive company growth as the leader in managed cloud services.
Pinchev brings more than 30 years of technology industry experience to Rackspace. From 2003 to 2012, he led sales, services and marketing at Red Hat, and helped increase the company’s revenue tenfold to more than $1 billion.  While at Red Hat, Pinchev built key relationships with many Fortune 1000 companies and launched a global partner network with major original equipment manufacturers, value added resellers, independent software vendors and system integrators.
After leaving Red Hat, Pinchev served as president and CEO of Acronis, a leader in data protection and disaster recovery software. He was most recently CEO of Capri Ventures, which helps technology start-ups develop go-to-market strategies, sales scalability and business modeling to accelerate growth.
Pinchev holds a master’s degree in applied mathematics and computer science from University ITMO in St. Petersburg, Russia.
“Alex joins Rackspace at a transformative moment, as we help businesses tap the power of multiple cloud platforms and technologies,” said Taylor Rhodes, president and CEO of Rackspace. “In the past five months, we have launched major offerings to support clouds from industry leaders Amazon Web Services and Microsoft, and have worked with Intel to launch the OpenStack Innovation Center. We launched a new managed security offering and have dedicated new resources to acquiring and serving large enterprise customers. Our job now is to turn these investments into growth. Alex is the experienced leader that can help us make that happen.”
“The increase in global cloud adoption creates a significant opportunity for Rackspace,” said Pinchev. “Rackspace delivers the industry’s best expertise and customer service across the leading cloud platforms that customers choose. That positions us to help customers transition out of their data centers and tap the cloud platforms and technologies that best fit each of their workloads. I’m excited to join this talented team of sales and marketing Rackers, and help Rackspace benefit from the key investments it has made in recent months.”
About Rackspace
Rackspace (NYSE: RAX), the #1 managed cloud company, helps businesses tap the power of cloud computing without the challenge and expense of managing complex IT infrastructure and application platforms on their own. Rackspace engineers deliver specialized expertise on top of leading technologies developed by AWS, Microsoft, OpenStack, VMware and others, through a results-obsessed service known as Fanatical Support®. The company has more than 300,000 customers worldwide, including two-thirds of the FORTUNE 100.

SAN JOSE, Calif., May 31, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Quantum Corp. (NYSE:    QTM) today announced that its board of directors has approved the appointment of Alex Pinchev to the board. Pinchev is a 35-year information technology industry veteran who has held senior executive positions at a range of companies, including Rackspace, Red Hat and Acronis. He is currently founder, CEO and angel investor at Capri Ventures LLC, a strategic advisory services firm for technology startups, and also has many years of public and private board service.








With Pinchev's appointment, the Quantum board is now fully reconstituted as provided for in the settlement agreement the company reached with VIEX Capital Advisors in early March. The new board is actively engaged in a strategic review, and the company expects to provide financial guidance for fiscal 2018 in its fiscal first quarter earnings announcement.
In addition to founding Capri Ventures in 2013, Pinchev most recently served for 14 months as executive vice president and then president of Global Sales and Marketing at Rackspace, a leader in managed cloud services. From 2012 to 2013, he was president and CEO of Acronis, a data protection and disaster recovery software company. Prior to that, Pinchev spent nine years at Red Hat, a leading provider of open source software, in senior roles that included executive vice president and president of Global Sales, Services and Field Marketing, president of International Operations and executive vice president of Worldwide Sales. Earlier in his career, he was founder and CEO of MainControl, a technology infrastructure management software company, and founder, president and CEO of Interchip GmbH, a provider of software development, marketing and integration services for large corporations in Central Europe.
"Alex's extensive experience will serve Quantum well as the company seeks to build on its strong performance and execution over the past year and drive increased shareholder value," said Paul Auvil, Quantum's chairman of the board. "The other directors, the Quantum management team and I look forward to what I'm sure will be his many contributions."
"We appreciate the constructive collaboration with Quantum throughout this process and are pleased that the reconstituted board is now in place," said Eric Singer, founder and managing member of VIEX. "The entire board has our strong support as Quantum looks to generate significant value for all Quantum shareholders by building on its industry leadership and market opportunities."
