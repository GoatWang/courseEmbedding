Welcome to Catalina Partners














 
 


 
    


















_______________________________________________________________________________________________________ Catalina Partners is an operational risk consultancy that focuses on the needs of the alternative investment industry.  We specialize in assessing key business risks including operations, liquidity, leverage, counterparty and compliance, and identifying solutions to monitor and mitigate those risks. Our rigorous assessments allow investors and advisors  to make fully-informed funding decisions, which rely on the identification and implementation of appropriate controls and compliance enhancements. Catalina Partners was founded to address the business risk exposure issues that emerged during the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent Ponzi scheme scandals.  We are engaged as independent risk consultants to provide evidence-based and risk-based due diligence for institutional investors.  We also assist investment advisors with meeting industry best business practices demanded by investors, regulators, and auditors.Catalina Partners provides a “safe harbor” for investors and advisors alike to understand and monitor business risks, take action to mitigate them, and make informed business decisions. We believe the most valuable outcome of our services is bringing institutional investors the confidence and assurances they need to do business with their investment advisors, as those advisors maximize risk management and operational excellence.  New Business Risk ParadigmRecent events have dramatically changed investors’ decision-making criteria for selecting an advisor. The business risks associated with each investment are under the microscope as never before, and the findings are key drivers to any decision to buy, hold or sell. Consider how and why the paradigm shift took hold. The Global Financial Crisis brought on by over-inflated real estate values, over-zealous securitization markets and lax enforcement of regulations unleashed a financial storm of global proportions. The resulting market and economic meltdown caused a profound crisis of confidence in government and the entire financial services industry. The Madoff Scandal demonstrated that pre-funding and post-investment operational due diligence needs to be a critical component of any institutional investment decision.  Heightened awareness of operational risk forced investment advisors to reexamine their middle- and back-office processes, governance and controls, make necessary enhancements, and seek opportunities to increase transparency to investors.

2017 Catalina Island Venues for Meetings & GroupsCatalina Island Meetings: Planning Your Unique Southern California Venue for Your Group Meeting or Event

Collaboration begins when you take the square room out of the equation. Sparks of creativity fly when you gather in a place fostering togetherness and team camaraderie. Catalina Island is a unique Southern California meeting destination where ideas come together, naturally. The perfect getaway for your group meeting, corporate meeting, retreat, family and military reunion and celebration of every special occasion, Catalina Island is exactly what you need to host a successful and unique group gathering in 2017 and 2018. The fresh, clean air and bright, clear skies combined with a dazzling array of group activities make this special island the perfect place for inspiration.
Request a Proposal
Located just 22 miles from southern California’s mainland, a group can arrive from the Los Angeles area on Santa Catalina Island in as little as 15 minutes. Take one of a variety of regularly scheduled helicopters and in as little as 15 minutes you have arrived on the island. Or select one of 31 daily ferry departures from four different mainland locations and ride aboard a comfortable high speed boat. Your entire group can arrive on our island in under an hour. It’s true, your unique destination event begins as you leave the mainland.
Tailoring group events to your exact taste and specifications is simple on Catalina Island. Here, you will find a variety of unconventional locations to ideally suit your needs. State-of-the art Island business services include an wide array of indoor and al fresco gathering locations ideal for both small and large events. Food and beverage, music, entertainment and group recreation options are unmatched in Catalina.
Groups and Meetings in Avalon

In the heart of Catalina Island is the pedestrian friendly, seaside village of Avalon. Offering a multitude of location choices for group meetings and events, Avalon’s unique event facilities include the largest contiguous and most historical ballroom in the United States with acoustically superior theater and oceanside executive suites. Catering to group board meetings and retreats, on-the-beach conference rooms and meeting breakout facilities, plus quaint bed and breakfast inns ideal for reunions, corporate meetings, medical meetings, employee retreats, team building and retreats. Our menu of meeting locations also includes full-service hotels and a plethora of group dining facilities located oceanfront, terraced along the hillsides and nestled within the eucalyptus lined-canyons. Combine this idyllic island location with a unique venue and finally top it off with unparalleled service and accommodations and your event attendees and guests will rave.
Think differently in Avalon.
Host a group or meeting in Two Harbors
For a calmer, quieter event location, try Two Harbors. The quaint village offers both relaxing beach settings along with more formal accommodations for your Catalina Island meetings. The Banning House Lodge is a great option for corporate and small group meetings. Located above Catalina Harbor, the lodge offers stunning views for an indoor setting. Meeting rooms, lodging and catering are all available.
Enjoy the island after your group or meeting
While productivity may be priority one, once the meeting or conference is over, you’re on island time. Relax on the white sandy beaches with crystal clear blue water that overlook sandstone cliffs. With a subtropical climate, Catalina Island boasts average temperatures hovering around 75 degrees and more than 250 days of sunshine.
Groups can take advantage of incredible day, plus a selection of star-filled night excursions, including coastal tours, fishing, hiking, shopping and golf. For those attendees seeking less adventure, the island offers a variety of spas with one-of-a-kind treatments. And when it’s time to reconnoiter, there are plenty of nightlife options from a quiet nightcap to a karaoke competition and group UFO tour.
There is every reason to bring groups together on Catalina Island.

							2017 Homebuyers’ Choice Award Winners					


Homebuilders who delivered best customer experience honored with 2017 Eliant Homebuyers’ Choice Awards
 MBK Homes earns top rating of all multi-divisional home builders in the nation.
 The Olson Company named top-rated single division builder in the nation.
DANA POINT, CA – Homebuilders who provided their customers with the best purchase and ownership experiences—according to surveyed homebuyers—have been honored in the 21st annual Eliant Homebuyers’ Choice Awards competition.
The winning builders were chosen based on the results of more than 106,000 surveys which were administered to all recent home owners from over 156 major homebuilders across the U.S.
The Eliant awards are presented annually by Eliant (www.eliant.com), a customer experience management company that has been surveying buyers of new homes for over 33 years. Once again, imortgage, an Eliant Certified lender, is the Premier Sponsor of these Awards.
MBK Homes is the recipient of the “The Eliant” award for the Best Overall Purchase and Ownership Experience from among multi-division builders. In addition, MBK Homes was honored with 21 awards including an unprecedented 11 First Place awards and 6 Second Place awards among all Medium-Volume builders.
“MBK has clearly distinguished themselves as an industry leader when it comes to outstanding levels of customer satisfaction,” stated Jex Manwaring, president of Eliant.  Tim Kane, President of MBK Homes, added “We are absolutely delighted to have won the Eliant Award. These awards recognize the hard work and dedication of our talented team of people, and I would like to personally thank all of them for their huge contribution to this achievement.”
The Olson Company is the recipient of “The Eliant” for Best Overall Customer Experience in the single divisional builder segment. The Olson Company was also honored with 10 Premier Awards (First, Second or Third place) among all qualifying Large-Volume builders. The Olson Company received a grand total of thirteen Homebuyers’ Choice Awards. “The Olson Company continues demonstrating  a strong commitment to customer service,” declared Bob Mirman, founder and Chief Executive Officer of Eliant. Scott Laurie, CEO of the Olson Company, said “We have made customer service a priority and are honored that our commitment is being recognized through this top Eliant Award.”
The highest number of awards earned by a home builder in this year’s competition was a total of  22 Homebuyers’ Choice Awards earned by The New Home Company, including four First Place Awards. Lawrence Webb, CEO of The New Home Company, said “The New Home Company is absolutely dedicated to customer service and delighting our customers. These awards acknowledge that dedication.”
A clear customer favorite, the TRI Pointe Group, won a total of 18 Homebuyer’s Choice Awards, half of which were Premier Awards.  “We are thrilled to receive this recognition,” stated Tom Mitchell, President and COO of the TRI Pointe Group. “These awards are especially gratifying because they reflect our customers’ recognition of our company-wide commitment to provide memorable experiences.”
Benchmark Communities won a total of 16 Homebuyers’ Choice Awards. Winning communities reached across both the Large and Medium Builder segments. Ralph Baja, Benchmark’s National Director of Customer Relations and Process Improvement, said “We are committed to our model of customer service and pleased to see that our homebuyers hold us in such high regard!”
William Lyon Homes, Robson Resort Communities and GL Homes of Florida were recognized both the Large and High Volume Builder segment. William Lyon received homebuyers’ number one ranking for the Construction Experience and Design Experience. Robson Resort Communities received a number one ranking for First Year Quality.
In the Medium Volume Builder segment, Rosewood Homes received six Premier Awards.  Giddens Homes received awards in four categories in the Medium Volume Builder segment.
In the all-important category of “Percent of Sales from Referrals,” Gentry Homes (Medium Builder segment), GL Homes of Florida – Palm Beach Adult (Large Builder segment) and Irvine Pacific (High Volume segment) scored the highest “Percent of Sales from Referrals. In 2016, Hawaii based Gentry Homes sold an astonishing 50% of their homes from referrals followed closely by GL Homes of Florida selling 48% from referrals.
Eliant’s builder clients are improving their customers’ experience to such a degree that home owners are not only more willing to offer a referral, but more and more prospects are buying new homes due to these referrals.  Each year, Eliant analyzes the “Percent of Sales from Referrals” from the ten highest rated builders: In 2009, 32% of these builders’ sales were sourced from referrals, while in 2017, 41.8% of their sales were from referrals, a 9.8% increase.
“In addition to highlighting our winning builders, It is also important to recognize those teams making progress in creating a customer service culture,” according to Jex Manwaring of Eliant. GL Homes of Florida – Other Palm Beach received an award recognizing the Most Improved Builder.
Eliant recognizes the nation’s top performing field representatives in the areas of Sales, Construction, Design and Customer Service as voted by recent homebuyers. The spot for top sales representative yielded a three way tie between Julie Harwood (Brookfield Residential, Southern California), Vallery DeVilbiss (Brookfield Residential, Southern California)  and Matt Sbragia (TRI Pointe Group, Northern California – TRI Pointe Homes).  Heather Alexander (The Olson Company, Southern California) was named top Design Consultant. The top Customer Service Representative was Robert Lily (MBK Homes, Southern California). Ryan Grexton (William Lyon Homes, Southern California) was named the nation’s number one Construction Representative.  From among thousands of their peers, these representatives were identified by homeowners as the best in America at delivering an extraordinary customer experience.
The recipient of the 2017 Eliant “First American Customer Experience Leader of the Year” is Donna Velasco, Director of Customer Care at MBK Homes. This award recognizes extraordinary success in consistently delivering a customer-­focused experience to homebuyers.
A total of 40 different builders were recognized for being in the top five for their excellence in one or more customer-experience categories. Builders with consistently high levels of customer satisfaction included: The New Home Company (22 awards), MBK Homes (21 awards), TRI Pointe Group (18 awards), and Benchmark Communities (16 awards). The Olson Company (13 awards) and William Lyon Homes (9 awards) also distinguished themselves once again this year.
This year’s award program features Premier Sponsor, imortgage/Loan Depot, an Eliant Certified company and seven firms widely acclaimed for delivering extraordinary customer experiences; dwellingLive, Crummack Huseby, Westwood Insurance, PHWS, First American Title, Peninsula Publishing and Mayers & Associates.
Information on the survey methodology and a complete list of winning home builders is available at www.eliant.com.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
