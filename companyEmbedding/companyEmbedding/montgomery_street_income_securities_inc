Montgomery Street Income Securities, Inc. Announces Distribution






Business Wire




Apr 23, 2014 11:16 AM EDT













 




























































  Montgomery Street Income Securities, Inc. (NYSE: MTS) (the “Fund”) declared a dividend of $0.15 per share. The dividend is payable on May 12, 2014 to stockholders of record at the close of business on May 5, 2014.  It is anticipated that substantially all of the distributions paid in 2014 will be distributions from ordinary income for tax purposes. The actual sources of distributions will be reported to stockholders in January 2015 on Form 1099-DIV.  The Fund is a closed-end diversified management investment company whose primary investment objective is to seek as high a level of current income as is consistent with prudent investment risks, from a diversified portfolio primarily of debt securities. The Fund’s shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol MTS.  Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continuously offered. There is generally a one-time public offering and, once issued, shares of closed-end funds are sold in the open market through a stock exchange. Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a discount to net asset value.  The price of the Fund’s shares is determined by a number of factors, several of which are beyond the control of the Fund. Therefore, the Fund cannot predict whether its shares will trade at, below or above net asset value.  Investments in funds involve risk. Yields and market values will fluctuate. Investing in foreign markets presents certain unique risks not associated with domestic investments, such as currency fluctuations, political and economic changes and market risks. Additionally, the Fund invests in lower-quality and non-rated securities, which present greater risks of loss of principal and interest than higher-quality securities. All of these factors may result in greater share price volatility.  This announcement is not an offer to purchase or the solicitation of an offer to sell shares of the Fund, a prospectus, a circular or representation intended for use in the purchase or sale of Fund shares, or a proxy solicitation.

Montgomery Street Income Securities, Inc. Announces Liquidation






September 03, 2015 05:20 PM Eastern Daylight Time



SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Montgomery Street Income Securities, Inc. (NYSE: MTS) (the “Fund”) 
      announced today that its Board of Directors has approved the liquidation 
      of the Fund, subject to the further approval of the Fund’s stockholders 
      at a special meeting to be held before the end of the year. Proxy 
      materials describing the plan of liquidation will be mailed to 
      stockholders in advance of the special meeting. A vote of two-thirds of 
      the outstanding shares is required.
    

      Pending the special meeting, the Fund’s investments will continue to be 
      managed in accordance with the current investment objectives and 
      policies of the Fund. If stockholders approve the liquidation, the 
      Fund’s investments will be sold and the Fund will make one or more cash 
      distributions to stockholders, after providing for liquidation expenses 
      and any other liabilities. The Fund will then cease operations.
    

      The Fund is a closed-end diversified management investment company whose 
      primary investment objective is to seek as high a level of current 
      income as is consistent with prudent investment risks, from a 
      diversified portfolio primarily of debt securities. The Fund’s shares 
      are traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol MTS.
    

      Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continuously offered. 
      There is generally a one-time public offering and, once issued, shares 
      of closed-end funds are sold in the open market through a stock 
      exchange. Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a discount to 
      net asset value.
    

      The price of the Fund’s shares is determined by a number of factors, 
      several of which are beyond the control of the Fund. Therefore, the Fund 
      cannot predict whether its shares will trade at, below or above net 
      asset value.
    

      Investments in funds involve risk. Yields and market values will 
      fluctuate. Investing in foreign markets presents certain unique risks 
      not associated with domestic investments, such as currency fluctuations, 
      political and economic changes and market risks. Additionally, the Fund 
      invests in lower-quality and non-rated securities, which present greater 
      risks of loss of principal and interest than higher-quality securities. 
      All of these factors may result in greater share price volatility.
    

      This announcement is not an offer to purchase or the solicitation of an 
      offer to sell shares of the Fund, a prospectus, a circular or 
      representation intended for use in the purchase or sale of Fund shares,

Securities Class Action Lawsuits, Stock Lawsuits, Securities Fraud Lawsuits

Securities fraud lawsuits and stock lawsuits have been filed against numerous financial firms, stockbrokers, financial advisers and companies alleging fraud or other misconduct. These allegations include claims that the issuers of securities have misled investors regarding the value of their investments, that stockbrokers or financial advisers acted improperly in managing clients' accounts or that companies that offer employee stock options or benefits plans failed to act in the best interests of plan participants. In some cases, investors can file securities class action lawsuits; in other cases, investors must file an arbitration if they hope to recover their losses.

FREE CASE EVALUATION

			Send your securities claim to a Lawyer who will review your claim at NO COST or obligation.


Securities and Stock Fraud
Stock fraud occurs when the issuer of the security makes false statements about the company's status or fails to disclose important facts that may affect stock value, causing investors to buy or sell stocks under false pretenses. Claims can be brought against the issuer of the security, i.e. the public company, the company's officers, directors or others involved in the violation, including stockbrokers, underwriter or auditors.

Exchange Traded Funds

Companies that issued Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) face lawsuits alleging that they did not adequately disclose the risks associated with those ETFs in their prospectus and registration filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In June, 2009, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) issued a regulatory warning regarding leveraged and inverse ETFs, noting that the ETFs are typically not suitable for retail investors who planned to hold them for more than one trading session.

Auction Rate Securities

Investors who put their money in Auction Rate Securities (ARS) have filed lawsuits alleging that they were told the securities were a safe, liquid investment. However, when the ARS market was frozen, many investors found they could not sell their Auction Rate Securities. Some companies have settled claims with clients and agreed to purchase back the Auction Rate Securities.  

Stockbroker Fraud and Stockbroker Arbitration
There are a number of ways a Stockbroker or Financial Advisor can break laws surrounding investment practices. Stockbroker fraud or negligence can include misrepresenting stocks or the risks associated with those investments, recommending unsuitable stocks, charging excessive transaction fees or failing to diversify an investor's portfolio. It is a stockbroker's responsibility to consider his client's best interest in all investment transactions.

Clients who believe their stockbroker has acted improperly may be able to file an arbitration against the broker and, possibly, the financial firm the broker works for. 

Stock Options and ERISA Complaints
ERISA (Employee Retirement Income Security Act) regulates employee benefit and pension plans, both of which can be tied into stock options. Employees and retired employees can file a lawsuit against a company and/or its officers for breaching fiduciary responsibilities and putting stock options and pension plans at risk.

Issues involved in ERISA include wrongfully canceling or breaching employee stock options, denying an employee rights granted by a Stock Option Agreement, misrepresenting the value of the stock, failing to act in the best interests of stock option plans, failing to act prudently in conducting and managing investments or lying about the number of options employees will be given. Furthermore, it is a violation of ERISA for an employer to take deductions from an employee's paycheck for benefits but then not make those payments into the benefits plan.

Under ERISA, it is illegal for an employer to "discharge, fine, suspend, expel, discipline, or discriminate against a participant or beneficiary for exercising any right to which he is entitled under the provisions of an employee benefit plan…" Claims have been made alleging that employees were terminated or discriminated against when the employer suspected that the employee was about to make a claim under a benefits plan. In such situations, the employee must prove that the action taken against him was done so primarily to prevent him from accessing benefits and not that the loss of benefits was simply a consequence of the action taken.

Companies that have had ERISA complaints filed against them include YRC Worldwide Inc (concerning the Yellow Freight Pension Plan), Motorola and Sterling Financial Corporation.
