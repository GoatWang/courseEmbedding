Susquehanna International Group (SIG) is a privately held global investment, trading and technology firm servicing securities markets worldwide. SIG comprises a number of affiliated entities specializing in trading and proprietary investments in equities, fixed income, energy, commodity, index and derivative products, private equity and venture capital, research, customer trading and institutional sales. Susquehanna is probably best known for expertise in derivatives pricing and trading, especially equity options.
SIG is a specialist or DPM (designated primary market maker) in approximately 600 equity options and 45 index options on the CBOE, AMEX, PHLX, and ISE, including big name equities such as Google, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, GE, PepsiCo, and Microsoft and indices such as Nasdaq and Russell 2000 options.[1]
SIG's headquarters office is in Bala Cynwyd, a western suburb of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA. The firm employs more than 1,500 people in offices across North America (New York City, Chicago, San Francisco, Philadelphia, Boston), Australia (Sydney), Europe (Dublin), China (Shanghai, Beijing, Hong Kong). SIG is one of the largest employers in Lower Merion Township.[2]

The Company[edit]
SIG was founded in 1987 by Jeff Yass, Arthur Dantchik, Steve Bloom, Eric Brooks, Andrew Frost and Joel Greenberg. The six original partners remain principal owners of the business. Yass and Dantchik are actively involved in the firm's trading strategies on a daily basis. Frost supervises private equity investments.[3] SIG’s operations extend across North America, Europe, and Asia. They trade essentially all listed financial products and asset classes in markets around the world.[4] SIG's domestic and international market making, specialist and electronic trading operations are among the most sophisticated in the industry, ranking SIG among the leading liquidity providers thanks to its operations at exchanges including the Chicago Board Options Exchange.[5] SIG ranks 1st in the best financial services companies to work for by Forbes.[6]
Poker[edit]
Poker and other games are an important part of the SIG company culture. The founders and senior traders believe that poker teaches lessons on risk taking that are applicable to trading in financial markets. SIG hosts an internal poker tournament annually and has even used poker as a recruiting tool. The company employs Bill Chen, a World Series of Poker star, in its quantitative trading group.[7]
Assistant Trader Program[edit]
The Assistant Trader (AT) program develops traders for positions in the market making and trading businesses. An AT will be introduced to the financial markets through a combination of practical training on a trading desk that is supported with ongoing theoretical classroom instruction.
The AT will be assigned to a trading desk to support the daily activities for ongoing trading. He/She will work directly with a trader who is available to answer questions and provide feedback. Two senior traders teach the theoretical classroom education, which is the core of the program. Simulated trading sessions and classes that highlight the key elements of trading make up the program’s curriculum. Class topics include option theory, decision science, corporate finance, game theory, and market structure.
Upon completion of the AT program (which typically lasts anywhere from 9 to 18 months), all ATs will attend the formal ten-week SIG Market Maker Class, which is the final step before becoming a trader at SIG.[8]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Susquehanna International Group (SIG) is a privately held global investment, trading and technology firm servicing securities markets worldwide. SIG comprises a number of affiliated entities specializing in trading and proprietary investments in equities, fixed income, energy, commodity, index and derivative products, private equity and venture capital, research, customer trading and institutional sales. Susquehanna is probably best known for expertise in derivatives pricing and trading, especially equity options.
SIG is a specialist or DPM (designated primary market maker) in approximately 600 equity options and 45 index options on the CBOE, AMEX, PHLX, and ISE, including big name equities such as Google, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, GE, PepsiCo, and Microsoft and indices such as Nasdaq and Russell 2000 options.[1]
SIG's headquarters office is in Bala Cynwyd, a western suburb of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA. The firm employs more than 1,500 people in offices across North America (New York City, Chicago, San Francisco, Philadelphia, Boston), Australia (Sydney), Europe (Dublin), China (Shanghai, Beijing, Hong Kong).

The Company[edit]
SIG was founded in 1987 by Jeff Yass, Arthur Dantchik, Steve Bloom, Eric Brooks, Andrew Frost and Joel Greenberg. The six original partners remain principal owners of the business. Yass and Dantchik are actively involved in the firm's trading strategies on a daily basis. Frost supervises private equity investments.[3] SIG’s operations extend across North America, Europe, and Asia. They trade essentially all listed financial products and asset classes in markets around the world.[4] SIG's domestic and international market making, specialist and electronic trading operations are among the most sophisticated in the industry, ranking SIG among the leading liquidity providers thanks to its operations at exchanges including the Chicago Board Options Exchange.[5] SIG ranks 1st in the best financial services companies to work for by Forbes.[6]
Poker[edit]
Poker and other games are an important part of the SIG company culture. The founders and senior traders believe that poker teaches lessons on risk taking that are applicable to trading in financial markets. SIG hosts an internal poker tournament annually and has even used poker as a recruiting tool. The company employs Bill Chen, a World Series of Poker star, in its quantitative trading group.[7]
Assistant Trader Program[edit]
The Assistant Trader (AT) program develops traders for positions in the market making and trading businesses. An AT will be introduced to the financial markets through a combination of practical training on a trading desk that is supported with ongoing theoretical classroom instruction.
The AT will be assigned to a trading desk to support the daily activities for ongoing trading. He/She will work directly with a trader who is available to answer questions and provide feedback. Two senior traders teach the theoretical classroom education, which is the core of the program. Simulated trading sessions and classes that highlight the key elements of trading make up the program’s curriculum. Class topics include option theory, decision science, corporate finance, game theory, and market structure.
Upon completion of the AT program (which typically lasts anywhere from 9 to 18 months), all ATs will attend the formal ten-week SIG Market Maker Class, which is the final step before becoming a trader at SIG.[8]

Equities management is certainly charged with making SIG a top ten equities platform and the firm appears to be making decent progress.On Comp. They provide you with a range a at the beginning of the year which provides some transparency going into year end. That said the three comp cycles I was on I saw my comp range decrease significantly each year, which seemed consistent throughout the ER department. My forecasted comp for 2012 was about 60% of my 2010 full year number. Team was let go earlier this Spring, after two years my severance was a whopping $1,000, was told the firm has no formalized policy so I shouldn't have expected anything..... I felt so slighted that I didn't even bother signing the separation agreementRespect the hell out of a lot of people there but the shrinking comp and the way I was treated on exit left a pretty sour taste in my mouth.

Lots of smart people. If you like the people you work with, there are some free company events you can hang out with them at.ConsOpen office for most IT employees, loud, constant interruptions. Telling your significant other you'll be home in 20 minutes is the same time you'll be pestered to do 5 other things before you leave. No laptops which means you'll be chained to your desk to get any real work done. This is very inconvenient.The reviewer that likened the place to a 1970s car is completely accurate.The flat structure allows everyone to assign you high priority tasks and ask for updates every 30 minutes.The work is very underwhelming and tedious, made more challenging by undocumented processes. Work that should take 5 minutes takes hours and feels like an "all hands on deck" venture for something most companies wouldn't even bat an eye about.New departments are created by those that would rather have other people do menial work for them than improve processes themselves. Some departments were clearly created to act as a dumping ground for others.Some teams can be replaced with a script and/or have a very vague set of responsibilities that can leave employees confused of their role.Advice to ManagementHave more oversight as to why new teams are being created, because it probably stems from someone else not wanting to do the work.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (5) Susquehanna International Group Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Susquehanna International Group 2017-07-19 17:22 PDT Join the Susquehanna International Group team See Our Latest Jobs Jul 2, 2017 Helpful (4)"probably good for traders, outside of that, no"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Tax Specialist in Bala Cynwyd, PACurrent Employee - Tax Specialist in Bala Cynwyd, PADoesn't RecommendPositive OutlookApproves of CEOI have been working at Susquehanna International Group full-time (More than a year)Pros*exposure to a lot of different tax returns*free breakfast & free lunch*free onsite gym*dry cleaner, car maintenance service, detailing done at a discount onsite*company wide eventsCons*50 hour work week - ends up being more hours than public "busy season"*the commute to City Ave from city/Jersey sucks*people aren't friendly or very helpful*asking questions gets you criticized and berated*no formal training*flat structure - no room for growth*ZERO flexibility to leave early or work from homeIf you enjoy being having a manager that makes you cry, this is the place for you.Advice to ManagementCut back to 40 hour work weeks.

These services can be convenient considering the amount of time you spend at the office.Free lunch but again, it's all to keep you at the office. You do not get a lunch break and even leaving your desk/office to go get some fresh air outside is frowned upon and will be addressed.They are fairly good at keeping up their hardware. Three nice monitors.There are some really cool people that do work here if you are on the right teams.ConsLong hours. The minimum workday is 9 with a working lunch. Usually it is longer. Also, meetings sometimes occur during lunch. Especially if your job entails lots of meetings. Sometimes weekend hours are required.No working from home.If there is a snow day and you can't make it in you have to take a vacation/personal day. They will also frown upon working from home. You sometimes have the choice at staying at a hotel. However, there is a very militant and weird pride about those who weather the storm to make it in. Due to the ruthless culture not coming in on these days, like getting fresh air, is scrutinized.There is often a very disorganized approach to planning on projects and getting other teams involved. A lot of waterfall development while also fixing problems that pop up during the day. Which they always do.You can be sitting on one of the trading floors, elbow to elbow, with people around you. Phones and notification tones going off everywhere. People walking through or having conversations/ad-hoc meetings right next to you. Where again, everything you do and are doing is highly criticized by everyone. Not an environment to fully immerse yourself in what you are doing and one where concentration is often easily broken.You work on unimpressive projects with very little guidelines. Some teams are so rushed to complete tasks that bad practices become the norm.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (5) Susquehanna International Group Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Susquehanna International Group 2017-05-09 08:28 PDT Apr 17, 2017 Helpful (2)"Work Hard and you will be rewarded"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Tech Lead in Bala Cynwyd, PACurrent Employee - Tech Lead in Bala Cynwyd, PARecommendsPositive OutlookApproves of CEOI have been working at Susquehanna International Group full-time (More than 3 years)ProsFlat corporate culture.

For tech and business. Very well thought out courses. Fresh grads should definitely come here to work for a few years, even if taking a pay cut. Especially if the securities industry is your focus.Overall very well structured compare to other hedge funds or prop shops. Lot's of documentations for everything. Everything is very well planned out for new comers to pick things up quickly.Decent compensation for the Philly area.Tons of talented people and hard workers. I think almost everyone SIG is giving all they got but some are just more talented than others.Free food and snacks. Some cool outside activities during the year.Management tries not to point fingers when human error occurs but actually tries to come up with solutions on how to fix them. This is really a rare trait and is highly undervalued.Everyone is really trying, some just tries harder.ConsCompensation not really competitive on national market.Growth and mobility is hard because how well defined the company structure is. This is really a double edged sword. Everything is very well defined and breaking barriers is hard. I'd say it's good for the company over all but it kinda screws people over that's been doing the same job for many years without an option for growth.Yearly raises are terrible. You really need to hammer down you initial offer because expecting decent growth isn't going to happen.Yes some managers are just clocking it in and out, but that's not the majority. If you get one of those then I feel sorry for you.Some old tech still in play but a lot of people are working on phasing it out.Too many production freezes and sign offs for changes. They are there for good reasons but some are just offensive. It's like they think we graduated yesterday. I'd say half of all the freezes are completely worthless.Some luck does come into play for progression within the company. Depending on what work your manager assigns you, you might be an all star. Seen some people write some pretty impressive and important things, and some people just got lucky to write the important things. And those are usually turds.Documentation is everywhere and is core to the culture. Switch is also a double edged sword because it makes everyone replaceable. Good luck using what you built as leverage for raises and such.Advice to ManagementGive out more bonuses or something.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (3) Susquehanna International Group Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Susquehanna International Group 2017-04-17 17:00 PDT Mar 27, 2017 Helpful (1)"Equity Research Associate"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Anonymous EmployeeCurrent Employee - Anonymous EmployeeRecommendsPositive OutlookI have been working at Susquehanna International Group full-time (Less than a year)ProsGreat place, great culture, great people!ConsNone really, just that they should give the interns/co-ops more responsibility, or allow them to rotate within different sectors.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (1) Susquehanna International Group Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Susquehanna International Group 2017-03-27 13:01 PDT Showing 301 of 332 reviewsReset FiltersPrevious12345NextReviews > Susquehanna International Group RSS Feed</>EmbedCloseOutline of two peoples' headsWork in HR or Marketing?Grow your employer brandGet a free employer accountReviews by Job TitleSoftware Developer (22) Assistant Trader (14) Software Engineer (10) Trader (9) Technology (7) Trade Support Associate (5) Intern (4) Trader, Options (4) Senior Software Developer (4) Analyst (4) Operations Associate (3) Systems Administrator (3) Team Lead (3) Equity Research Associate (3) Senior Software Engineer (3) Show MoreShow LessCloseOutline of two peoples' headsWork in HR or Marketing?Grow your employer brandGet a free employer accountCompany Updates We’re honored to be recognized by Billy Penn as one of the 19 Philly-area companies with the best perks.
