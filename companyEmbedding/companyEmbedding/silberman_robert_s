Robert S. Silberman was born in Boston on October 30, 1957.[2] He was educated at Dartmouth College, receiving a B.A. in History in 1980. He received an M.A. from the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies in 1990.[2]
From 1980 to 1984, Silberman served as a United States Naval Officer.[3] From 1985 to 1988 he worked in energy finance at The Henley Group,[2] and at Ogden Corporation[2] (the predecessor to Covanta Holding Corporation.) In 1988 he entered Federal Government service as Deputy Administrator of the United States Maritime Administration in the United States Department of Transportation.[2]
In 1990, he was appointed United States Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy.[2] On June 15, 1992, President of the United States George H. W.

Silberman left government service in 1993, becoming Assistant to the Chief Executive Officer of International Paper.[5] He left for CalEnergy Company in 1995, where he served in a number of senior management roles, including as President and Chief Operating Officer.[5] He left CalEnergy in 2000, and in March 2001 became Chief Executive Officer of Strayer Education, Inc.[5] Additionally, since 2003 he has served as Chairman of the Board of Strayer.
In 2007, during his tenure at Strayer Education, Silberman was awarded Morningstar's CEO of the Year award.[6] Other recipients of the award include Warren Buffett, Jamie Dimon, Charles Schwab and Herb Kelleher.[7]
