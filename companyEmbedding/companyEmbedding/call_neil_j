Trend Micro Mobile Security & Antivirus (for Android)






 



 







Norton Mobile Security for Android 1.5 beta









 







Webroot Mobile Security for Android









 












Caller ID doesn't help when the caller's identity is blocked, and you still have to look at the phone to see the caller's name. Mr. Number (free) for Android, BlackBerry, and iPhone solves that problem by blocking unwanted calls and texts. The new version, released today, offers even more power and flexibility.
According to the company the product has over 2 million users already. Jason Devitt, CEO of Mr. Number, proudly states "It took us a year to reach 1 million users but only 4 months to get to 2 million." That large user-base is important, because Mr. Number leverages information from its users to perform crowd-sourced caller ID.
Users can specifically blacklist numbers from which they never want to receive calls, texts, or both. A log lists every call or text that was blocked along with the reason. Norton Mobile Security for Android 1.5 beta (Free), Trend Micro Mobile Security for Android ($3.99 direct), and Webroot Mobile Security for Android ($14.99 direct) will also block unwanted calls and texts for Android devices. However, Mr. Number claims to be "the first and only app for BlackBerry smartphones that can block both calls and texts."
Android and BlackBerry users pay $1.99/month for crowd-sourced caller ID and reverse lookup. The fee is waived for anyone who agrees to share their contact list with Mr. Number; that's where the ID data comes from. For iPhone users the fee structure is $0.99 for each 20 reverse lookups, without the sharing option.
There's also an option to directly report a recent spam or telemarketing call to Mr. Number. The company also detects spam calls "based on the pattern of calls to our users."
New in this edition, you can use the app to keep your friends apprised of your status, just as you do with instant messaging. It can indicate that you're free for a call, that you'd prefer a text, or that you're just tied up and can't respond. There's also an option to direct all your calls to voicemail and automatically let your friends know when you're free again.
The app itself is free from each device's respective app store. Android and iPhone editions are available today; the BlackBerry edition will come out within two weeks. As noted, regular fees may apply depending on how you use the product.

Our Favorite Under-$500 Laptops












Time to Digitize: Top-Rated Photo Scanners
















Asus ROG Zephyrus (GX501VI)



Editors' Rating: excellent
07.26.2017



 

at 



Bottom Line: Thanks to Nvidia's Max-Q initiative and a clever design, the Asus ROG Zephyrus is the new benchmark for powerful, thin gaming laptops.










Alcatel Idol 5S


Editors' Rating: good
07.26.2017



 

at 



Bottom Line: The Alcatel Idol 5S offers a nice design and solid performance for an attractive price that's subsidized by Amazon Prime ads, but it falls a bit short of similarly priced alternatives.










Neato Botvac D5 Connected


Editors' Rating: excellent
07.26.2017



 

at 



Bottom Line: The Neato Botvac D5 Connected is an all-around solid robot vacuum with accurate laser navigation and built-in Wi-Fi for app control from your phone.










Logitech Brio



Editors' Rating: excellent
07.26.2017



 

at 



Bottom Line: If you need a high-quality webcam, Logitech's Brio has it all, with 4K resolution, stellar sound quality, and support for Windows Hello biometric face login.










Wasp 9907 4K


Editors' Rating: fair
07.26.2017



 

at 



Bottom Line: The Wasp 9907 4K action cam is waterproof without a case, but doesn't offer enough outside of that to justify its high price.










Sony FDR-X3000


Editors' Rating: good
07.25.2017



 

at 



Bottom Line: The Sony FDR-X3000 action cam records optically stabilized 4K footage, but it's not as easy to use or squeeze into small places as a GoPro.










Sjcam SJ7 Star


Editors' Rating: good
07.25.2017



 

at 



Bottom Line: The Sjcam SJ7 Star action cam delivers high-quality 4K capture for an affordable price, but omits digital stabilization at its top resolution.










MGcool Explorer Pro


Editors' Rating: fair
07.25.2017



 

at 



Bottom Line: The Mgcool Explorer Pro action cam entices with a low asking price and promise of 4K video capture, but you can do better without spending more.










Scuf Impact


Editors' Rating: excellent
07.25.2017



 

at 



Bottom Line: The Scuf Impact is a fantastic-feeling controller with unprecedented options for customizability and personalization, but its high price might prove prohibitive to all but the most committed PS4 players.










Klipsch The Three



Editors' Rating: excellent
07.25.2017



 

at 



Bottom Line: Klipsch's stylish The Three speaker delivers terrific audio performance with serious bass response, and connects to a wide variety of wired and wireless sound sources.










Liquid Web Hosting



Editors' Rating: excellent
07.24.2017



 

at 



Bottom Line: Liquid Web is expensive and lacks shared Web hosting, but it's a flexible, feature-packed online host with outstanding customer service and excellent dedicated and VPS packages.










Netgear Arlo Baby 1080p HD Monitoring Camera


Editors' Rating: excellent
07.24.2017



 

at 



Bottom Line: The Arlo Baby 1080p HD Monitoring Camera from Netgear is a feature-rich baby monitor that delivers sharp video and uses motion and sound detection to help keep an eye on your child from your phone or PC.










iBaby Monitor M6S



Editors' Rating: excellent
07.24.2017



 

at 



Bottom Line: The iBaby Monitor MS6 is a full-featured baby monitor that uses your phone to keep tabs on your infant. It offers excellent 1080p video and a host of features including environment monitoring, two-way audio, pan and tilt, and motion and sound detection.










GoDaddy Web Hosting


Editors' Rating: excellent
07.24.2017



 

at 



Bottom Line: GoDaddy is a feature-packed web hosting service that boasts rock-solid uptime, excellent customer service, and flexible website-building tools.










Amazon S3


Editors' Rating: excellent
07.24.2017



 

at 



Bottom Line: Amazon S3 is the industry-standard answer for storing business data, especially for enterprise operations. But because Amazon designed S3 as an IT-oriented "bucket," it doesn't come with a user-friendly storage sync and backup application, instead providing only IT-centric tools and APIs. It's cost-effective, efficient, and secure, but plan to bring your own desktop software.










New Razer Blade Pro (2017)


Editors' Rating: excellent
07.24.2017



 

at 



Bottom Line: The New Blade Pro is a modest improvement on the previous iteration, with a THX-certified panel and audio alongside a slightly faster unlocked Core i7 processor.

Liquid Web Hosting

07.24.2017


Editors' Rating: excellent



 

at 




Bottom Line: Liquid Web is expensive and lacks shared Web hosting, but it's a flexible, feature-packed online host with outstanding customer service and excellent dedicated and VPS packages. 






GoDaddy Web Hosting
07.24.2017


Editors' Rating: excellent



 

at 




Bottom Line: GoDaddy is a feature-packed web hosting service that boasts rock-solid uptime, excellent customer service, and flexible website-building tools. 






Amazon S3
07.24.2017


Editors' Rating: excellent



 

at 




Bottom Line: Amazon S3 is the industry-standard answer for storing business data, especially for enterprise operations. But because Amazon designed S3 as an IT-oriented "bucket," it doesn't come with a user-friendly storage sync and backup application, instead providing only IT-centric tools and APIs. It's cost-effective, efficient, and secure, but plan to bring your own desktop software. 






InMotion Web Hosting
07.24.2017


Editors' Rating: excellent



 

at 




Bottom Line: InMotion is a feature-stacked web hosting service that offers many attractive features, but a few issues keep it from being the top dog. 






A2 Web Hosting
07.24.2017


Editors' Rating: excellent



 

at 




Bottom Line: Packed with features, A2 is a web hosting service that's more than worthy of being the foundation for your website. 
















SurveyMonkey
07.21.2017


Editors' Rating: excellent



 

at 




Bottom Line: SurveyMonkey has a well-deserved reputation as a leader in online survey marketing with an intuitive user interface and advanced features like artificial intelligence. 






Microsoft Azure
07.21.2017


Editors' Rating: excellent



 

at 




Bottom Line: Organizations standardized on Windows Server are no-brainer candidates for Microsoft Azure once they begin moving infrastructure to the cloud. However, Azure is also friendly to other operating platforms, especially Linux, and has a growing arsenal of ancillary services, too. 






Campaign Monitor
07.21.2017


Editors' Rating: good



 

at 




Bottom Line: Campaign Monitor may lack live support and third-party integrations, but it offers a simple way to connect with your audience through email marketing, including auto-responders and a new suite of analytics. 






Zenefits Z2

07.21.2017


Editors' Rating: excellent



 

at 




Bottom Line: Zenefits Z2 is best suited for small to midsized businesses (SMBs) in need of solid human resources platform. By delivering the basic framework and regularly adding new integration partners, Zenefits Z2 can provide a fairly long lived solution even for fast-growing companies.







NordVPN

07.21.2017


Editors' Rating: excellent



 

at 




Bottom Line: NordVPN is a robust VPN service with an excellent collection of features, all wrapped in a slick Windows client that can easily secure your online activities. It's everything you could want, and an Editors' Choice winner.

NordVPN

07.21.2017


Editors' Rating: excellent



 

at 




Bottom Line: NordVPN is a robust VPN service with an excellent collection of features, all wrapped in a slick Windows client that can easily secure your online activities. It's everything you could want, and an Editors' Choice winner. 






Check Point ZoneAlarm Anti-Ransomware

07.19.2017


Editors' Rating: excellent



 

at 




Bottom Line: Check Point ZoneAlarm Anti-Ransomware is the most effective ransomware-specific security tool we've seen. In testing, it showed complete success against all of our real-world samples. 






Bitdefender Antivirus Plus

07.18.2017


Editors' Rating: excellent



 

at 




Bottom Line: The labs give Bitdefender Antivirus Plus top marks, and it aces some of our own hands-on tests. Beyond that, it adds a wealth of security features that almost qualify it as a security suite. It's a winner. 






KeepSolid VPN Unlimited (for iPhone)

07.07.2017


Editors' Rating: excellent



 

at 




Bottom Line: With affordable and flexible pricing, an attractive app, solid speed test performance, and advanced features, KeepSolid VPN Unlimited for iPhone has it all. 






KeepSolid VPN Unlimited (for Android)

07.07.2017


Editors' Rating: excellent



 

at 




Bottom Line: KeepSolid VPN Unlimited is an affordable Android VPN that secures your traffic and offers additional protection to boot. It offers good speeds and a strong server selection, making it an excellent choice. 
















KeepSolid VPN Unlimited (for Mac)
06.30.2017


Editors' Rating: good



 

at 




Bottom Line: KeepSolid VPN Unlimited is a solid service with unparalleled flexible pricing, and robust security technology, but its interface feels clunky for a Mac app, and its speed tests results were only fair. 






PureVPN (for Mac)
06.30.2017


Editors' Rating: good



 

at 




Bottom Line: PureVPN offers robust protection for your web data with an excellent collection of servers and strong privacy protections, but it isn't the fastest Mac VPN we've tested. 






OneLogin
06.30.2017


Editors' Rating: good



 

at 




Bottom Line: OneLogin sports a nice feature set, including risk-based authentication policies, integration with HR apps, and event monitoring platforms. It's a well-rounded IDM approach where the only real complaint concerns how groups are managed. 






Avast Premier 2017
06.30.2017


Editors' Rating: good



 

at 




Bottom Line: Upgrading from Avast's very good security suite to Avast Premier 2017 gets you a comprehensive secure deletion utility and automation for its software updater component. You'll have to decide if that's worth the significant added cost. 






Avast Internet Security 2017
06.30.2017


Editors' Rating: good



 

at 




Bottom Line: Avast Internet Security 2017 includes an antivirus, a robust firewall, a simple spam filter, and a wealth of bonus features. Depending upon your needs, though, a less expensive Avast product could be more cost effective.

Bitdefender Mobile Security and Antivirus (for Android)

09.25.2015


Editors' Rating: excellent



 

at 




Bottom Line: Bitdefender Mobile Security and Antivirus packs outstanding Android antivirus and theft protection into an ultra-light package. 






Lionytics
02.13.2014


Editors' Rating: good



 

at 




Bottom Line: Lionytics does a good job of clearing spam, malicious Direct Messages, and other clutter from Twitter accounts. Social media pros and celebrities will benefit from it; individuals may find it too expensive. 






Truecaller - Caller ID & Block (for Android)
10.30.2013


Editors' Rating: good



 

at 




Bottom Line: Truecaller boasts a lot of features but fails to deliver on many of them. It will, at least block your unwanted calls and SMS messages. 






McAfee Antivirus & Security 3.1 Premium (for Android)
09.30.2013


Editors' Rating: excellent



 

at 




Bottom Line: A heavy hitter in desktop security brings top-tier malware protection to Android in an app brimming with features, but is held back by its execution and price. 






Trend Micro Titanium Maximum Security 2014
09.30.2013


Editors' Rating: good



 

at 




Bottom Line: On top of the features in Trend Micro's entry-level suite, Trend Micro Titanium Maximum Security 2014 adds advanced parental control, password management, and online backup and file-sharing. However, only the backup system really shines. 
















OnlyMyEmail Personal (2013)

06.06.2013


Editors' Rating: excellent



 

at 




Bottom Line: OnlyMyEmail Personal (2013) totally lives up to its name. Put it in charge of spam filtering and the only thing in your Inbox will be your email, no spam or other trash. 






OME-Kids

04.17.2013


Editors' Rating: excellent



 

at 




Bottom Line: By setting up OME-Kids email accounts for your children, you can give them access to spam-free email, while keeping a watchful eye on their correspondence. As kids get older you can give them more privacy. 






ZoneAlarm Internet Security Suite 2013
04.04.2013


Editors' Rating: good



 

at 




Bottom Line: ZoneAlarm Internet Security Suite 2013 combines the ZoneAlarm firewall with a pastiche of other security components from many different vendors. The end result isn't as effective as more thoroughly integrated competitors. 






Comodo Internet Security Complete 2013

02.07.2013


Editors' Rating: excellent



 

at 




Bottom Line: The biggest win for Comodo Internet Security Complete 2013 isn't in features, but in support. The GeekBuddy service fixes any problem, security or otherwise, using remote assistance. A Virus-Free Guarantee reimburses you for damage if malware gets past Comodo; you can also get reimbursed for expenses related to identity theft. Add a GeekBuddy-powered tuneup tool and an unusually powerful backup utility and you've got a winner. 






Comodo Internet Security Premium (2013)
01.30.2013


Editors' Rating: excellent



 

at 




Bottom Line: The free Comodo Internet Security Premium (2013) combines firewall and antivirus, and adds a number of advanced features that techies will love. Its Behavior Blocker earned a clean sweep in my malware blocking test, but that same technology trashed installation of valid programs. If you can't afford a commercial suite, you'll get reasonable protection from Comodo.

Greco - Roseland Insurance AgentAthleteFamilyGardeningHealth/FitnessMusicOutdoor ActivitiesPhotographySelf-ImprovementSports FanTravelI live in Bridgewater, New Jersey, but I’ve worked in the small, family-friendly borough of Roseland since 2000. I love this community. Roseland’s city park, on Harrison and Eagle Rock Avenues, is the hub of our town and the spot where our annual fair and summer farmers market take place. My wife and I each have a son and a daughter, and my son is now an Allstate agent in Livingston. When I’m not working or spending time with my family, I like to exercise and read.
Our agency actively supports teen driver safety and education events in our community. We also support Sophia House, a women’s shelter, and we work with the Student Partner Alliance to help students better understand finance.
I’ve operated my office in the Roseland strip mall since 2000. Prior to becoming an agent, I worked at Allstate’s corporate offices in the operations department and several other divisions. I became an agent because I wanted an opportunity to work more closely with people. I love serving customers and helping them as they make decisions that protect what matters most. My team and I provide experienced, compassionate and customer-focused service. My team is fluent in Russian and Turkish, and we offer a range of insurance products and financial services.
