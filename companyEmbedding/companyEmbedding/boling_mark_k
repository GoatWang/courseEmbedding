Mark K. Boling

                                Executive Vice President and President V+ Development Solutions,                                                                Southwestern Energy


Mark K. Boling is Executive Vice President of Southwestern Energy Company and President of Southwestern’s V+ Development Solutions division. The mission of V+ Development Solutions is to identify, develop and implement solutions to the challenges of unconventional resource development that strike an appropriate balance among the environmental, social and economic impacts of the Company’s activities.
Prior to joining Southwestern in January of 2002, he was in private practice in Houston, Texas, specializing in oil and gas transactional work. Mr. Boling also served as President of SunHawk Energy Company, a small independent exploration and production company whose primary focus was the East Texas Basin. Mr. Boling was a partner with the law firm of Fulbright & Jaworski L.L.P., where he practiced in the firm’s Oil & Gas/Real Estate Section from 1982 to 1993. Mr. Boling holds a Juris Doctorate degree from Southern Methodist University and a Bachelor of Science degree in Geology from DePauw University.
Mr. Boling is a frequent speaker on a variety of topics relating to unconventional oil and gas developments and hydraulic fracturing operations. He participated in the preparation of the Atlantic Council report titled “European Unconventional Gas Developments – Environmental Issues and Regulatory Challenges in the EU and the U.S.” and he was appointed by Governor Andrew Cuomo to serve on the New York Advisory Panel on High-Volume Hydraulic Fracturing. Mr. Boling initiated and led the Company’s successful effort to collaborate with the Environmental Defense Fund in developing a Model Regulatory Framework for Hydraulic Fracturing Operations. In November of 2013, Mr. Boling testified before the U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works Oversight Subcommittee on the subject of Fugitive Methane Emissions from Oil and Gas Production.
Mr. Boling is a member of the American (Environment, Energy and Resources and Business Law Sections), Arkansas (Natural Resources Law Section) and Texas (Oil, Gas & Mineral Law and Corporate Counsel Sections) Bar Associations. In 2012, the London Financial Times named Mr. Boling the U.S. Innovative Lawyer of the Year.
