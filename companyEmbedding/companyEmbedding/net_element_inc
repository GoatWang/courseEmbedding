Important Safety InformationAFINITOR is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to everolimus, to other rapamycin derivatives, or to any of the excipients.
Noninfectious Pneumonitis: Noninfectious pneumonitis was reported in up to 19% of patients treated with AFINITOR; some cases reported with pulmonary hypertension (including pulmonary arterial hypertension) as a secondary event. The incidence of Common Terminology Criteria (CTC) grade 3 and 4 noninfectious pneumonitis was up to 4.0% and up to 0.2%, respectively. Fatal outcomes have been observed. Monitor for clinical symptoms or radiological changes. Opportunistic infections such as Pneumocystis jiroveci pnuemonia (PJP) should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Manage noninfectious pneumonitis by dose interruption until symptoms resolve, follow with a dose reduction, and consider the use of corticosteroids. Discontinue AFINITOR if toxicity recurs at grade 3 or for grade 4 cases. For patients who require use of corticosteroids, prophylaxis for PJP may be considered. The development of pneumonitis has been reported even at a reduced dose.
Infections: AFINITOR has immunosuppressive properties and may predispose patients to bacterial, fungal, viral, or protozoal infections (including those with opportunistic pathogens). Localized and systemic infections, including pneumonia, mycobacterial infections, other bacterial infections; invasive fungal infections such as aspergillosis, candidiasis, or PJP; and viral infections, including reactivation of hepatitis B virus, have occurred. Some of these infections have been severe (eg, leading to sepsis, respiratory failure, or hepatic failure) or fatal. Physicians and patients should be aware of the increased risk of infection with AFINITOR. Treatment of preexisting invasive fungal infections should be completed prior to starting treatment with AFINITOR. Be vigilant for signs and symptoms of infection and institute appropriate treatment promptly; interruption or discontinuation of AFINITOR should be considered. Discontinue AFINITOR if invasive systemic fungal infection is diagnosed and institute appropriate antifungal treatment.
PJP has been reported in patients who received everolimus, sometimes with a fatal outcome. This may be associated with concomitant use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents; consider prophylaxis for PJP when concomitant use of these agents is required.
Angioedema With Concomitant Use of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors: Patients taking concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema (eg, swelling of the airways or tongue, with or without respiratory impairment). In a pooled analysis, the incidence of angioedema in patients taking everolimus with an ACE inhibitor was 6.8% compared to 1.3% in the control arm with an ACE inhibitor.
Oral Ulceration: Mouth ulcers, stomatitis, and oral mucositis have occurred in patients treated with AFINITOR at an incidence ranging from 44% to 78% across the clinical trial experience. Grade 3/4 stomatitis was reported in 4% to 9% of patients. In such cases, topical treatments are recommended, but alcohol-, hydrogen peroxide-, iodine-, or thyme-containing mouthwashes should be avoided. Antifungal agents should not be used unless fungal infection has been diagnosed.
Renal Failure: Cases of renal failure (including acute renal failure), some with a fatal outcome, have been observed in patients treated with AFINITOR.
Impaired Wound Healing: Everolimus delays wound healing and increases the occurrence of wound-related complications like wound dehiscence, wound infection, incisional hernia, lymphocele, and seroma. These wound-related complications may require surgical intervention. Exercise caution with the use of AFINITOR in the perisurgical period.
Geriatric Patients: In the randomized advanced hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer study, the incidence of deaths due to any cause within 28 days of the last AFINITOR dose was 6% in patients ≥65 years of age compared with 2% in patients <65 years of age. Adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation occurred in 33% of patients ≥65 years of age compared with 17% in patients <65 years of age. Careful monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments for adverse reactions are recommended.
Laboratory Tests and Monitoring: Elevations of serum creatinine and proteinuria have been reported. Renal function (including measurement of blood urea nitrogen, urinary protein, or serum creatinine) should be evaluated prior to treatment and periodically thereafter, particularly in patients who have additional risk factors that may further impair renal function.
Hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and hypertriglyceridemia have been reported. Blood glucose and lipids should be evaluated prior to treatment and periodically thereafter. More frequent monitoring is recommended when AFINITOR is coadministered with other drugs that may induce hyperglycemia. Management with appropriate medical therapy is recommended. When possible, optimal glucose and lipid control should be achieved before starting a patient on AFINITOR.
Reductions in hemoglobin, lymphocytes, neutrophils, and platelets have been reported. Monitoring of complete blood count is recommended prior to treatment and periodically thereafter.
Drug-Drug Interactions: Avoid coadministration with strong CYP3A4/PgP inhibitors (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, atazanavir, nefazodone, saquinavir, telithromycin, ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, voriconazole). Use caution and reduce the AFINITOR dose to 2.5 mg daily if coadministration with a moderate CYP3A4/PgP inhibitor is required (eg, amprenavir, fosamprenavir, aprepitant, erythromycin, fluconazole, verapamil, diltiazem). Avoid coadministration with strong CYP3A4/PgP inducers (eg, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital); however, if coadministration is required, consider doubling the daily dose of AFINITOR using increments of 5 mg or less.
Hepatic Impairment: Exposure to everolimus was increased in patients with hepatic impairment. For patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C), AFINITOR may be used at a reduced dose if the desired benefit outweighs the risk. For patients with mild (Child-Pugh class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh class B) hepatic impairment, a dose reduction is recommended.
Vaccinations: The use of live vaccines and close contact with those who have received live vaccines should be avoided during treatment with AFINITOR.
Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Fetal harm can occur if AFINITOR is administered to a pregnant woman. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise female patients of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception while using AFINITOR and for 8 weeks after ending treatment.

History[edit]
Net Element International, Inc. (“Net Element International”) was incorporated on April 20, 2010 as a Cayman Islands exempted company with limited liability under the name Cazador Acquisition Corporation Ltd. (“Cazador”). Cazador was a blank check company incorporated for the purpose of effecting a merger, share capital exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more operating businesses or assets.
On October 2, 2012, Net Element International completed a merger (the “Merger”) with Net Element, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Net Element”), which was a company with businesses in the online media and mobile commerce payment processing markets. Immediately prior to the effectiveness of the Merger, Net Element International (then known as Cazador Acquisition Corporation Ltd.) changed its jurisdiction of incorporation by discontinuing as an exempted company in the Cayman Islands and continuing and domesticating as a corporation incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware. Effective upon consummation of the Merger, (i) Net Element was merged with and into Net Element International, resulting in Net Element ceasing to exist and Net Element International continuing as the surviving company in the Merger, and (ii) the Company changed its name to Net Element International. Following the Merger, Net Element International’s business consists of the former business of Net Element.[2]
On October 4, 2012, Net Element International rang an opening bell on NASDAQ MarketSite to celebrate its Initial Public Offering (“IPO”),[3] which took place on Thursday, October 4, 2012. Net Element International’s common stock began trading on NASDAQ Capital Market Exchange under the symbol “NETE".[4]
During the third quarter of 2012, Net Element International’s subsidiary, TOT Money, launched operations as a provider of carrier-integrated mobile payments solutions in Russia. Since then, TOT Money has continued seeking to expand its carrier-integrated mobile payments business primarily in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries (participating states of the former Soviet Union) and other emerging markets. During the second half of 2012, TOT Money entered into contracts with the three largest mobile phone operators in Russia, Mobile TeleSystems OJSC, MegaFon OJSC and OJSC VimpelCom, to facilitate payments using SMS and MMS for their mobile phone subscribers in Russia.[2]
On December 20, 2013, Net Element's Chief Executive Officer Oleg Firer rang a closing bell on NASDAQ MarketSite. This event marks the one-year anniversary of Net Element's NASDAQ listing, and is coincident with a change in the company's focus to a global technology group powering global commerce through value-added services.[5]
On September 25, 2013, Net Element International, Inc. completed divestiture of its non-core sports and entertainment assets, which include Openfilm, LLC, Motorsport, LLC, Splinex, LLC, LegalGuru, LLC and Music 1, LLC. Net Element International, Inc. retained 10% interest in the disposed entities through participation in T1T Lab, LLC. Disposition of non-core assets allows Net Element International to focus on the segment of the business that generates the most revenues and that the Company believes has the greatest growth potential and facilitates the promotion of its intellectual assets and business relationships that are substantial competitive differentiators.[6]
On February 14, 2014, Net Element, Inc. announced that the Company has transferred its 10% interest in T1T Lab, LLC back to T1T, LLC, and as a result, Net Element is thereby relieved all of its commitments and obligations to T1T, including its obligation to commit $1,259,000 associated with that ownership interest.[7]
On December 9, 2013, as a result of the Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on December 5, 2013, Net Element International, Inc. changed its corporate name to Net Element, Inc.[8]
On May 27, 2015, Net Element executed definitive documentation to acquire online payments innovator Payonline. Acquisition expected to be profitable in 2015 and provide important growth catalyst to Net Element business.[9]
On June 24, 2013, Net Element International's subsidiary TOT Group completed the acquisition of Aptito, a next-generation, cloud-based payments platform, which creates an online consumer experience into offline commerce environments via tablet, mobile and all other cloud-connected devices.[10]
On April 16, 2013, certain subsidiaries of Net Element International's subsidiary TOT Group, Inc. ("TOT Group") acquired substantially all of the business assets of Unified Payments, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Unified Payments”). Unified Payments provides comprehensive turnkey, payment-processing solutions to small and medium size business owners (merchants) and independent sales organizations across the United States.[11]

History[edit]
Net Element International, Inc. (“Net Element International”) was incorporated on April 20, 2010 as a Cayman Islands exempted company with limited liability under the name Cazador Acquisition Corporation Ltd. (“Cazador”). Cazador was a blank check company incorporated for the purpose of effecting a merger, share capital exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more operating businesses or assets.
On October 2, 2012, Net Element International completed a merger (the “Merger”) with Net Element, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Net Element”), which was a company with businesses in the online media and mobile commerce payment processing markets. Immediately prior to the effectiveness of the Merger, Net Element International (then known as Cazador Acquisition Corporation Ltd.) changed its jurisdiction of incorporation by discontinuing as an exempted company in the Cayman Islands and continuing and domesticating as a corporation incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware. Effective upon consummation of the Merger, (i) Net Element was merged with and into Net Element International, resulting in Net Element ceasing to exist and Net Element International continuing as the surviving company in the Merger, and (ii) the Company changed its name to Net Element International. Following the Merger, Net Element International’s business consists of the former business of Net Element.[2]
On October 4, 2012, Net Element International rang an opening bell on NASDAQ MarketSite to celebrate its Initial Public Offering (“IPO”),[3] which took place on Thursday, October 4, 2012. Net Element International’s common stock began trading on NASDAQ Capital Market Exchange under the symbol “NETE".[4]
During the third quarter of 2012, Net Element International’s subsidiary, TOT Money, launched operations as a provider of carrier-integrated mobile payments solutions in Russia. Since then, TOT Money has continued seeking to expand its carrier-integrated mobile payments business primarily in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries (participating states of the former Soviet Union) and other emerging markets. During the second half of 2012, TOT Money entered into contracts with the three largest mobile phone operators in Russia, Mobile TeleSystems OJSC, MegaFon OJSC and OJSC VimpelCom, to facilitate payments using SMS and MMS for their mobile phone subscribers in Russia.[2]
On December 20, 2013, Net Element's Chief Executive Officer Oleg Firer rang a closing bell on NASDAQ MarketSite. This event marks the one-year anniversary of Net Element's NASDAQ listing, and is coincident with a change in the company's focus to a global technology group powering global commerce through value-added services.[5]
On September 25, 2013, Net Element International, Inc. completed divestiture of its non-core sports and entertainment assets, which include Openfilm, LLC, Motorsport, LLC, Splinex, LLC, LegalGuru, LLC and Music 1, LLC. Net Element International, Inc. retained 10% interest in the disposed entities through participation in T1T Lab, LLC. Disposition of non-core assets allows Net Element International to focus on the segment of the business that generates the most revenues and that the Company believes has the greatest growth potential and facilitates the promotion of its intellectual assets and business relationships that are substantial competitive differentiators.[6]
On February 14, 2014, Net Element, Inc. announced that the Company has transferred its 10% interest in T1T Lab, LLC back to T1T, LLC, and as a result, Net Element is thereby relieved all of its commitments and obligations to T1T, including its obligation to commit $1,259,000 associated with that ownership interest.[7]
On December 9, 2013, as a result of the Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on December 5, 2013, Net Element International, Inc. changed its corporate name to Net Element, Inc.[8]
On May 27, 2015, Net Element executed definitive documentation to acquire online payments innovator Payonline. Acquisition expected to be profitable in 2015 and provide important growth catalyst to Net Element business.[9]
On June 24, 2013, Net Element International's subsidiary TOT Group completed the acquisition of Aptito, a next-generation, cloud-based payments platform, which creates an online consumer experience into offline commerce environments via tablet, mobile and all other cloud-connected devices.[10]
On April 16, 2013, certain subsidiaries of Net Element International's subsidiary TOT Group, Inc. ("TOT Group") acquired substantially all of the business assets of Unified Payments, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Unified Payments”). Unified Payments provides comprehensive turnkey, payment-processing solutions to small and medium size business owners (merchants) and independent sales organizations across the United States.[11]

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Advanced HR+, HER2-Negative Breast CancerAFINITOR is indicated for the treatment of postmenopausal women with advanced hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer (advanced HR+ BC) in combination with exemestane after failure of treatment with letrozole or anastrozole.
Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumors of Pancreatic OriginAFINITOR is indicated for the treatment of adults with progressive neuroendocrine tumors of pancreatic origin (PNET) with unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic disease.
AFINITOR is not indicated for the treatment of patients with functional carcinoid tumors.
Progressive, Well-Differentiated, Nonfunctional Gl and Lung Neuroendocrine TumorAFINITOR is indicated for the treatment of adults with progressive, well-differentiated, nonfunctional neuroendocrine tumors (NET) of gastrointestinal (GI) or lung origin with unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic disease.
AFINITOR is not indicated for the treatment of patients with functional carcinoid tumors.
Advanced Renal Cell CarcinomaAFINITOR is indicated for the treatment of adults with advanced renal cell carcinoma after failure of treatment with sunitinib or sorafenib.
Renal Angiomyolipoma With Tuberous Sclerosis ComplexAFINITOR is indicated for the treatment of adults with renal angiomyolipoma (AML) and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) not requiring immediate surgery.
SEGA With Tuberous Sclerosis ComplexAFINITOR Tablets and AFINITOR DISPERZ™ (everolimus tablets for oral suspension) are indicated in pediatric and adult patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) for the treatment of subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) that requires therapeutic intervention but cannot be curatively resected.
 
Important Safety InformationAFINITOR is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to everolimus, to other rapamycin derivatives, or to any of the excipients.
Noninfectious Pneumonitis: Noninfectious pneumonitis was reported in up to 19% of patients treated with AFINITOR; some cases reported with pulmonary hypertension (including pulmonary arterial hypertension) as a secondary event. The incidence of Common Terminology Criteria (CTC) grade 3 and 4 noninfectious pneumonitis was up to 4.0% and up to 0.2%, respectively. Fatal outcomes have been observed. Monitor for clinical symptoms or radiological changes. Opportunistic infections such as Pneumocystis jiroveci pnuemonia (PJP) should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Manage noninfectious pneumonitis by dose interruption until symptoms resolve, follow with a dose reduction, and consider the use of corticosteroids. Discontinue AFINITOR if toxicity recurs at grade 3 or for grade 4 cases. For patients who require use of corticosteroids, prophylaxis for PJP may be considered. The development of pneumonitis has been reported even at a reduced dose.
Infections: AFINITOR has immunosuppressive properties and may predispose patients to bacterial, fungal, viral, or protozoal infections (including those with opportunistic pathogens). Localized and systemic infections, including pneumonia, mycobacterial infections, other bacterial infections; invasive fungal infections such as aspergillosis, candidiasis, or PJP; and viral infections, including reactivation of hepatitis B virus, have occurred. Some of these infections have been severe (eg, leading to sepsis, respiratory failure, or hepatic failure) or fatal. Physicians and patients should be aware of the increased risk of infection with AFINITOR. Treatment of preexisting invasive fungal infections should be completed prior to starting treatment with AFINITOR. Be vigilant for signs and symptoms of infection and institute appropriate treatment promptly; interruption or discontinuation of AFINITOR should be considered. Discontinue AFINITOR if invasive systemic fungal infection is diagnosed and institute appropriate antifungal treatment.
PJP has been reported in patients who received everolimus, sometimes with a fatal outcome. This may be associated with concomitant use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents; consider prophylaxis for PJP when concomitant use of these agents is required.
Angioedema With Concomitant Use of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors: Patients taking concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema (eg, swelling of the airways or tongue, with or without respiratory impairment). In a pooled analysis, the incidence of angioedema in patients taking everolimus with an ACE inhibitor was 6.8% compared to 1.3% in the control arm with an ACE inhibitor.
Oral Ulceration: Mouth ulcers, stomatitis, and oral mucositis have occurred in patients treated with AFINITOR at an incidence ranging from 44% to 78% across the clinical trial experience. Grade 3/4 stomatitis was reported in 4% to 9% of patients. In such cases, topical treatments are recommended, but alcohol-, hydrogen peroxide-, iodine-, or thyme-containing mouthwashes should be avoided. Antifungal agents should not be used unless fungal infection has been diagnosed.
Renal Failure: Cases of renal failure (including acute renal failure), some with a fatal outcome, have been observed in patients treated with AFINITOR.
Impaired Wound Healing: Everolimus delays wound healing and increases the occurrence of wound-related complications like wound dehiscence, wound infection, incisional hernia, lymphocele, and seroma. These wound-related complications may require surgical intervention. Exercise caution with the use of AFINITOR in the perisurgical period.
Geriatric Patients: In the randomized advanced hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer study, the incidence of deaths due to any cause within 28 days of the last AFINITOR dose was 6% in patients ≥65 years of age compared with 2% in patients <65 years of age. Adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation occurred in 33% of patients ≥65 years of age compared with 17% in patients <65 years of age. Careful monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments for adverse reactions are recommended.
Laboratory Tests and Monitoring: Elevations of serum creatinine and proteinuria have been reported. Renal function (including measurement of blood urea nitrogen, urinary protein, or serum creatinine) should be evaluated prior to treatment and periodically thereafter, particularly in patients who have additional risk factors that may further impair renal function.
Hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and hypertriglyceridemia have been reported. Blood glucose and lipids should be evaluated prior to treatment and periodically thereafter. More frequent monitoring is recommended when AFINITOR is coadministered with other drugs that may induce hyperglycemia. Management with appropriate medical therapy is recommended. When possible, optimal glucose and lipid control should be achieved before starting a patient on AFINITOR.
Reductions in hemoglobin, lymphocytes, neutrophils, and platelets have been reported. Monitoring of complete blood count is recommended prior to treatment and periodically thereafter.
Drug-Drug Interactions: Avoid coadministration with strong CYP3A4/PgP inhibitors (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, atazanavir, nefazodone, saquinavir, telithromycin, ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, voriconazole). Use caution and reduce the AFINITOR dose to 2.5 mg daily if coadministration with a moderate CYP3A4/PgP inhibitor is required (eg, amprenavir, fosamprenavir, aprepitant, erythromycin, fluconazole, verapamil, diltiazem). Avoid coadministration with strong CYP3A4/PgP inducers (eg, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital); however, if coadministration is required, consider doubling the daily dose of AFINITOR using increments of 5 mg or less.
Hepatic Impairment: Exposure to everolimus was increased in patients with hepatic impairment. For patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C), AFINITOR may be used at a reduced dose if the desired benefit outweighs the risk. For patients with mild (Child-Pugh class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh class B) hepatic impairment, a dose reduction is recommended.
Vaccinations: The use of live vaccines and close contact with those who have received live vaccines should be avoided during treatment with AFINITOR.
Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Fetal harm can occur if AFINITOR is administered to a pregnant woman. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise female patients of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective contraception while using AFINITOR and for 8 weeks after ending treatment.

History[edit]
Net Element International, Inc. (“Net Element International”) was incorporated on April 20, 2010 as a Cayman Islands exempted company with limited liability under the name Cazador Acquisition Corporation Ltd. (“Cazador”). Cazador was a blank check company incorporated for the purpose of effecting a merger, share capital exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more operating businesses or assets.
On October 2, 2012, Net Element International completed a merger (the “Merger”) with Net Element, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Net Element”), which was a company with businesses in the online media and mobile commerce payment processing markets. Immediately prior to the effectiveness of the Merger, Net Element International (then known as Cazador Acquisition Corporation Ltd.) changed its jurisdiction of incorporation by discontinuing as an exempted company in the Cayman Islands and continuing and domesticating as a corporation incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware. Effective upon consummation of the Merger, (i) Net Element was merged with and into Net Element International, resulting in Net Element ceasing to exist and Net Element International continuing as the surviving company in the Merger, and (ii) the Company changed its name to Net Element International. Following the Merger, Net Element International’s business consists of the former business of Net Element.[2]
On October 4, 2012, Net Element International rang an opening bell on NASDAQ MarketSite to celebrate its Initial Public Offering (“IPO”),[3] which took place on Thursday, October 4, 2012. Net Element International’s common stock began trading on NASDAQ Capital Market Exchange under the symbol “NETE".[4]
During the third quarter of 2012, Net Element International’s subsidiary, TOT Money, launched operations as a provider of carrier-integrated mobile payments solutions in Russia. Since then, TOT Money has continued seeking to expand its carrier-integrated mobile payments business primarily in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries (participating states of the former Soviet Union) and other emerging markets. During the second half of 2012, TOT Money entered into contracts with the three largest mobile phone operators in Russia, Mobile TeleSystems OJSC, MegaFon OJSC and OJSC VimpelCom, to facilitate payments using SMS and MMS for their mobile phone subscribers in Russia.[2]
On December 20, 2013, Net Element's Chief Executive Officer Oleg Firer rang a closing bell on NASDAQ MarketSite. This event marks the one-year anniversary of Net Element's NASDAQ listing, and is coincident with a change in the company's focus to a global technology group powering global commerce through value-added services.[5]
On September 25, 2013, Net Element International, Inc. completed divestiture of its non-core sports and entertainment assets, which include Openfilm, LLC, Motorsport, LLC, Splinex, LLC, LegalGuru, LLC and Music 1, LLC. Net Element International, Inc. retained 10% interest in the disposed entities through participation in T1T Lab, LLC. Disposition of non-core assets allows Net Element International to focus on the segment of the business that generates the most revenues and that the Company believes has the greatest growth potential and facilitates the promotion of its intellectual assets and business relationships that are substantial competitive differentiators.[6]
On February 14, 2014, Net Element, Inc. announced that the Company has transferred its 10% interest in T1T Lab, LLC back to T1T, LLC, and as a result, Net Element is thereby relieved all of its commitments and obligations to T1T, including its obligation to commit $1,259,000 associated with that ownership interest.[7]
On December 9, 2013, as a result of the Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on December 5, 2013, Net Element International, Inc. changed its corporate name to Net Element, Inc.[8]
On May 27, 2015, Net Element executed definitive documentation to acquire online payments innovator Payonline. Acquisition expected to be profitable in 2015 and provide important growth catalyst to Net Element business.[9]
On June 24, 2013, Net Element International's subsidiary TOT Group completed the acquisition of Aptito, a next-generation, cloud-based payments platform, which creates an online consumer experience into offline commerce environments via tablet, mobile and all other cloud-connected devices.[10]
On April 16, 2013, certain subsidiaries of Net Element International's subsidiary TOT Group, Inc. ("TOT Group") acquired substantially all of the business assets of Unified Payments, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Unified Payments”). Unified Payments provides comprehensive turnkey, payment-processing solutions to small and medium size business owners (merchants) and independent sales organizations across the United States.[11]

History[edit]
Net Element International, Inc. (“Net Element International”) was incorporated on April 20, 2010 as a Cayman Islands exempted company with limited liability under the name Cazador Acquisition Corporation Ltd. (“Cazador”). Cazador was a blank check company incorporated for the purpose of effecting a merger, share capital exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more operating businesses or assets.
On October 2, 2012, Net Element International completed a merger (the “Merger”) with Net Element, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Net Element”), which was a company with businesses in the online media and mobile commerce payment processing markets. Immediately prior to the effectiveness of the Merger, Net Element International (then known as Cazador Acquisition Corporation Ltd.) changed its jurisdiction of incorporation by discontinuing as an exempted company in the Cayman Islands and continuing and domesticating as a corporation incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware. Effective upon consummation of the Merger, (i) Net Element was merged with and into Net Element International, resulting in Net Element ceasing to exist and Net Element International continuing as the surviving company in the Merger, and (ii) the Company changed its name to Net Element International. Following the Merger, Net Element International’s business consists of the former business of Net Element.[2]
On October 4, 2012, Net Element International rang an opening bell on NASDAQ MarketSite to celebrate its Initial Public Offering (“IPO”),[3] which took place on Thursday, October 4, 2012. Net Element International’s common stock began trading on NASDAQ Capital Market Exchange under the symbol “NETE".[4]
During the third quarter of 2012, Net Element International’s subsidiary, TOT Money, launched operations as a provider of carrier-integrated mobile payments solutions in Russia. Since then, TOT Money has continued seeking to expand its carrier-integrated mobile payments business primarily in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries (participating states of the former Soviet Union) and other emerging markets. During the second half of 2012, TOT Money entered into contracts with the three largest mobile phone operators in Russia, Mobile TeleSystems OJSC, MegaFon OJSC and OJSC VimpelCom, to facilitate payments using SMS and MMS for their mobile phone subscribers in Russia.[2]
On December 20, 2013, Net Element's Chief Executive Officer Oleg Firer rang a closing bell on NASDAQ MarketSite. This event marks the one-year anniversary of Net Element's NASDAQ listing, and is coincident with a change in the company's focus to a global technology group powering global commerce through value-added services.[5]
On September 25, 2013, Net Element International, Inc. completed divestiture of its non-core sports and entertainment assets, which include Openfilm, LLC, Motorsport, LLC, Splinex, LLC, LegalGuru, LLC and Music 1, LLC. Net Element International, Inc. retained 10% interest in the disposed entities through participation in T1T Lab, LLC. Disposition of non-core assets allows Net Element International to focus on the segment of the business that generates the most revenues and that the Company believes has the greatest growth potential and facilitates the promotion of its intellectual assets and business relationships that are substantial competitive differentiators.[6]
On February 14, 2014, Net Element, Inc. announced that the Company has transferred its 10% interest in T1T Lab, LLC back to T1T, LLC, and as a result, Net Element is thereby relieved all of its commitments and obligations to T1T, including its obligation to commit $1,259,000 associated with that ownership interest.[7]

History[edit]
Net Element International, Inc. (“Net Element International”) was incorporated on April 20, 2010 as a Cayman Islands exempted company with limited liability under the name Cazador Acquisition Corporation Ltd. (“Cazador”). Cazador was a blank check company incorporated for the purpose of effecting a merger, share capital exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more operating businesses or assets.
On October 2, 2012, Net Element International completed a merger (the “Merger”) with Net Element, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Net Element”), which was a company with businesses in the online media and mobile commerce payment processing markets. Immediately prior to the effectiveness of the Merger, Net Element International (then known as Cazador Acquisition Corporation Ltd.) changed its jurisdiction of incorporation by discontinuing as an exempted company in the Cayman Islands and continuing and domesticating as a corporation incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware. Effective upon consummation of the Merger, (i) Net Element was merged with and into Net Element International, resulting in Net Element ceasing to exist and Net Element International continuing as the surviving company in the Merger, and (ii) the Company changed its name to Net Element International. Following the Merger, Net Element International’s business consists of the former business of Net Element.[2]
On October 4, 2012, Net Element International rang an opening bell on NASDAQ MarketSite to celebrate its Initial Public Offering (“IPO”),[3] which took place on Thursday, October 4, 2012. Net Element International’s common stock began trading on NASDAQ Capital Market Exchange under the symbol “NETE".[4]
During the third quarter of 2012, Net Element International’s subsidiary, TOT Money, launched operations as a provider of carrier-integrated mobile payments solutions in Russia. Since then, TOT Money has continued seeking to expand its carrier-integrated mobile payments business primarily in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries (participating states of the former Soviet Union) and other emerging markets. During the second half of 2012, TOT Money entered into contracts with the three largest mobile phone operators in Russia, Mobile TeleSystems OJSC, MegaFon OJSC and OJSC VimpelCom, to facilitate payments using SMS and MMS for their mobile phone subscribers in Russia.[2]
On December 20, 2013, Net Element's Chief Executive Officer Oleg Firer rang a closing bell on NASDAQ MarketSite. This event marks the one-year anniversary of Net Element's NASDAQ listing, and is coincident with a change in the company's focus to a global technology group powering global commerce through value-added services.[5]
On September 25, 2013, Net Element International, Inc. completed divestiture of its non-core sports and entertainment assets, which include Openfilm, LLC, Motorsport, LLC, Splinex, LLC, LegalGuru, LLC and Music 1, LLC. Net Element International, Inc. retained 10% interest in the disposed entities through participation in T1T Lab, LLC. Disposition of non-core assets allows Net Element International to focus on the segment of the business that generates the most revenues and that the Company believes has the greatest growth potential and facilitates the promotion of its intellectual assets and business relationships that are substantial competitive differentiators.[6]
On February 14, 2014, Net Element, Inc. announced that the Company has transferred its 10% interest in T1T Lab, LLC back to T1T, LLC, and as a result, Net Element is thereby relieved all of its commitments and obligations to T1T, including its obligation to commit $1,259,000 associated with that ownership interest.[7]
On December 9, 2013, as a result of the Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on December 5, 2013, Net Element International, Inc. changed its corporate name to Net Element, Inc.[8]
On May 27, 2015, Net Element executed definitive documentation to acquire online payments innovator Payonline. Acquisition expected to be profitable in 2015 and provide important growth catalyst to Net Element business.[9]
On June 24, 2013, Net Element International's subsidiary TOT Group completed the acquisition of Aptito, a next-generation, cloud-based payments platform, which creates an online consumer experience into offline commerce environments via tablet, mobile and all other cloud-connected devices.[10]
On April 16, 2013, certain subsidiaries of Net Element International's subsidiary TOT Group, Inc. ("TOT Group") acquired substantially all of the business assets of Unified Payments, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Unified Payments”). Unified Payments provides comprehensive turnkey, payment-processing solutions to small and medium size business owners (merchants) and independent sales organizations across the United States.[11]
