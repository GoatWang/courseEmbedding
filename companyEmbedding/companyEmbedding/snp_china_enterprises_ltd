                              Limited" due to local company registration 
                              considerations.
 
                              The principal place of business of the Company is

Important 
                              Events in The Development of The Company's Business
 
                              Since the early 90's, the Company started out to 
                              be an investment holding company which owns majority 
                              interests in a number of Sino-foreign equity joint 
                              venture enterprises in the People's Republic of 
                              China (the "PRC") involving in the production 
                              and trading of vehicles tires and related rubber 
                              products in the PRC and overseas.
The 
                              Company had started considering and exploring new 
                              directions and alternatives for the future of its 
                              business since the middle of year 2000. Pursuant 
                              to special resolutions passed at the 2000 annual 
                              general meeting held on June 27, 2000 and the 2001 
                              annual general meeting held on May 31, 2001, respectively, 
                              the name of the Company was first changed from "China 
                              Tire Holdings Limited "to "China Tire 
                              e-commerce.com Limited" and later changed 
                              to "China Enterprises Limited".
 
                              The name changes were the result of the strategic 
                              review of the Company's investments in light of 
                              the impending structural changes occurring in the 
                              business environment of the Greater China Region. 
                              With its changing political and socio-economic landscape, 
                              it is imperative that the Company expands its vision 
                              to encompass investments in other high growth industries 
                              in the region. Going forward, the Company intends 
                              to actively search for potential investments in 
                              the Greater China Region with emphasis on achieving 
                              a diversified portfolio.

TOPPAN LEEFUNG (HONG KONG) LIMITED


Background

                    The Leefung-Asco Group was founded in 1960 and has been listed on the Hong Kong 
                    Stock Exchange since 1991. To exploit China’s developing market, it moved its 
                    production facility to Shenzhen in 1992. This was followed by the opening of 
                    further operations in Dongguan, Shanghai and Beijing.
                    
                    In 2003, Singapore-based Toppan Leefung Pte. Ltd. (formerly known as SNP Corporation Ltd.) acquired a controlling 
                    stake in Leefung - Asco Group and further privatised it in September 2006. With the acquisition by Toppan Printing 
                    Co., Ltd. in mid-2008, the Leefung - Asco Group changed its name to Toppan Leefung (Hong Kong) Limited.        
                    
                    To diversify its product mix and broaden its expertise, Toppan Leefung (Hong Kong) purchased the pop-up book printing 
                    company from its parent company in 2004. This helped diversify its revenue streams. China and the United States 
                    now account for one-third of the company’s total revenue each, while the remaining third comes from Europe 
                    and Australia.                   
                    
Who We Are

                    Toppan Leefung (Hong Kong) is one of the largest printing enterprises in mainland China. Its main businesses include pop-up books, touch-and-feel 
                    products, case-bound books, children’s books, colour magazines, commercial printing and corrugated boxes. 
                    Committed to setting new standards in the printing and packaging markets, the company always employs 
                    state-of-the art machinery and concentrates on providing high quality customized services with fast turnaround 
                    at affordable prices.                    
                    
Mission Statement

                    The mission statement captures the company philosophy perfectly: “We believe that our accumulated experience is 
                    our greatest asset. If we mix this with the newest technologies and latest equipment, we are ideally placed to 
                    serve the needs of both our customers and our shareholder”.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.

How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
