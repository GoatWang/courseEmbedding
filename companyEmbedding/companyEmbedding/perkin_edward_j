Life[edit]
Perkins was born in Sterlington in Ouachita Parish in north Louisiana, the son of Edward Joseph Perkins, Sr., and Tiny Estella Noble Holmes. He grew up in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, and graduated in 1947 from Jefferson High School in Portland, Oregon. He earned his B.A. from the University of Maryland University College in 1967, and his M.A. and Doctor of Public Administration from the University of Southern California. He is an active member of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity and holds the highest honor the fraternity bestows on its members, the Laurel Wreath award.
Career[edit]
After serving in the U.S. Army and Marine Corps, including stints in Tokyo and South Korea, he held numerous positions in the Department of State and Foreign Service. He was appointed ambassador to Liberia in 1985, and in 1986 was appointed ambassador to South Africa, where he would serve until 1989. He returned home to serve in the State Department until 1992, when he was appointed ambassador to the United Nations and U.S. Representative to the U.N. Security Council.[1][2] In 1993, he was appointed representative to the Commonwealth of Australia, where he served until 1996 before retiring at the rank of Career Minister in the United States Foreign Service.
He taught at the University of Oklahoma where he served as Senior Vice Provost Emeritus of International Programs at the International Program Center, and Professor Emeritus of the School of International and Area Studies. He is a member of the American Academy of Diplomacy.[3]

Edwin Perkins -- Inventor of Kool-Aid in 1927

Born in Iowa in 1889, Edwin Elijah Perkins would grow up to become the inventor and promoter of Kool-Aid (originally spelled "Kool-Ade") — still a favorite, affordable   drink of children nationwide.

In 1900 at  age 11, Edwin  was working at his father’s store in the village of Hendley, Nebraska when his childhood friend and future wife, Kathryn Melda "Kitty" Shoemaker, introduced him to a powder product called "Jell-O". This later inspired him at age 38 to make his own pre-packaged food, expanding his by-then already successful career.

Photochemical transformations. Part VII. Solution photochemistry of nitroalkanes: the reaction products 



Stewart T. Reid, 

        

John N. Tucker  and  

        

Edward J. Wilcox 

        

Abstract


Irradiation of primary and secondary nitroalkanes in cyclohexane gives amides and lactams, derived by photochemically induced hydrogen abstraction reactions. Solvent oxidation products such as cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol are also obtained, and nitrocyclohexane is a minor product of all irradiations in cyclohexane. Products derived by hydrogen abstraction are also obtained by irradiation of nitroalkanes in diethyl ether.

BOSTON, Feb. 14, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Eaton Vance Management (EVM), a subsidiary of Eaton Vance Corp. (NYSE:   EV), announced today the appointment of Edward J. Perkin, CFA, as Chief Equity Investment Officer, effective April 29, 2014. He will report to Thomas E. Faust Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Eaton Vance. Mr. Perkin replaces Duncan W. Richardson, who retired on October 31, 2013, and Mr. Faust, who has served as interim Chief Equity Investment Officer since Mr. Richardson's departure.  
Mr. Perkin joins Eaton Vance from Goldman Sachs Asset Management (GSAM), where he was Chief Investment Officer, International and Emerging Markets Equity, and Managing Director, Portfolio Manager, Europe, EAFE and Global, based in London. In this role, he was responsible for leading a 50-person team of portfolio managers and analysts in eight locations. Before relocating to London in 2008, Mr. Perkin was a portfolio manager and analyst on GSAM's U.S. value equity team in New York. Mr. Perkin was previously associated with FISERV and American Retirement Insurance Services.  He holds a bachelor of arts in economics from the University of California, Santa Barbara, and an M.B.A. from Columbia Business School.  He is a CFA charterholder.
"I am pleased to introduce Eddie as EVM's next Chief Equity Investment Officer," said Mr. Faust. "He brings a record as an outstanding value stock investor and a skilled leader of investment teams.  I am confident that, under Eddie's leadership, our equity group can deliver superior results for the clients we serve." 
EVM's equity group manages U.S. and global equity portfolios in value, core, growth and dividend income styles and covering large-cap, multi-cap, mid-cap and small-cap ranges.  In-depth fundamental analysis is the primary basis for the group's investment decision-making.  As of December 31, 2013, EVM's equity group managed $39.2 billion on behalf of individual and institutional investors through funds and separately managed accounts.  
Eaton Vance is one of the oldest investment management firms in the United States, with a history dating to 1924. Eaton Vance and its affiliates managed $278.6 billion in assets as of January 31, 2014, offering individuals and institutions a broad array of investment strategies and wealth management solutions. The Company's long record of providing exemplary service, timely innovation and attractive returns through a variety of market conditions has made Eaton Vance the investment manager of choice for many of today's most discerning investors. For more information about Eaton Vance, visit www.eatonvance.com.
