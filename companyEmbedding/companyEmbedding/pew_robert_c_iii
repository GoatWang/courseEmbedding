Robert C. Pew III Appointed Board Chair -Steelcase Announces Board of Director Election Results-
GRAND RAPIDS, Mich.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 26, 2003--Steelcase
Inc. (NYSE:SCS) today announced that shareholders re-elected William
P. Crawford, Lisa Valk Long and Robert C. Pew III to serve additional
three-year terms as directors. The board of directors appointed Mr.
Pew as non-executive board chair.
 Mr. Pew has been a director on the Steelcase board since 1987. He
also was founding chair and serves on the board of the Illinois
Institute of Design. Mr. Pew has been involved in the office furniture
industry for nearly 30 years, including 20 years as a Steelcase
employee or dealer. He served as president of Steelcase North America
from 1990 to 1994, and from 1984 to 1988 he owned and operated three
Steelcase dealerships in the southeast U.S. Since that time, Mr. Pew's
interests have included several small business ventures and service on
non-profit boards.
    Commenting on the board's appointment, James P. Hackett, president
and chief executive officer, said, "Rob's proven leadership and
experience in the industry, together with his passion for seeing the
company excel, make him very well suited to serving as board chair. We
are confident in the excellence Rob will bring to the role and in
building on Steelcase's heritage as a great institution."
    Steelcase also announced that Earl D. Holton chose to not seek
re-appointment as board chair. Mr. Holton intends to remain on the
Steelcase board and will continue to serve as executive committee
chair. Mr. Holton was elected to the Steelcase board in 1998 and has
served as non-executive board chair since 1999. He also serves on the
boards of directors of Meijer, Inc. and CMS Energy Corporation. Mr.
Hackett concluded, "We thank Earl for his continued service and
commitment on the board. As board chair, his counsel and leadership
were immeasurably beneficial during a trying time in our industry."
    "I am honored to have served as chair of a board whose directors
have worked diligently to oversee and support the development and
execution of a solid strategy for the company's future," said Mr.
Holton. "When I accepted this position, I felt that three years in the
role would be an appropriate length of time. My focus now turns to
ensuring an effective transition to a new board chair as I continue
serving on the board."

Robert Pew

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Robert Pew (1923 – December 22, 2012) was an American businessman and chairman of Steelcase and played a role in Grand Valley State University's development in the 1980s. Pew joined Steelcase in 1952 and served as official chairman through 1974 until 1999. He became an official member of the GVSU board from 1985–88. In the 1990s, Pew's organization became the world's largest producer and distributor of office furniture.
Personal life[edit]
Pew was born in Syracuse, New York. He served in World War II in years 1942 and 1945 and completed over 50 objectives as a fighter pilot captain. He died in Florida, of natural causes, aged 89, preceded in death by his wife Mary Idema Pew, survived by sons Robert III and John, daughter Kate Wolters. In 1990, Forbes Magazine nominated Pew and his family world’s 25 wealthiest families and in 1989, Ronald Reagan awarded Pew with the National Trust Historic Preservation Award.[1][2]

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/24/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

                                                    3:10 PM ET 05/24/2017
                                                


Ford Motor Co (F) said on Wednesday that new Chief Executive James Hackett is eligible for at least $13.4 million in total annual compensation. Hackett, 62, a former chief executive of furniture manufacturer Steelcase Inc (SCS), was named to replace CEO Mark Fields on Monday.

















                                                    Investors skeptical Ford CEO change will revive stock price

Ford Motor Co's (F) unexpected decision to replace its chief executive officer on Monday may not be the catalyst that revives its slumping share prices. Shares of the second-largest U.S. automaker rose 2.1 percent Monday, a relatively muted reaction given the 0.5 percent gain in the broad Standard & Poor's 500 index.

Jim Hackett joined Ford Motor Co.' s board of directors in 2013 talking about "design thinking" and "fitness of use." The phrases were foreign to the dog-eat-dog car business. Now, as the auto maker's new chief executive, Mr.

Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/24/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

GRAND RAPIDS, MI -- Robert C. Pew, the man who led Steelcase Inc. to its ascendancy as the world’s largest office furniture company, died Saturday, Dec. 22, in Palm Beach County, Fla. He was 89.
Pew served as Steelcase board chairman for 25 years -- from 1974 until he assumed the role of chairman emeritus in March 1999.
He is survived by his children, Robert III, John, and daughter Kate Pew Wolters. He was preceded in death by his wife, Mary Idema Pew, in 2007. They were married 60 years.
Born in Syracuse, N.Y., Pew moved to Grand Rapids with his family when he was 13. The family lived across the street from the home of Walter D. Idema, a founding officer of Metal Office Furniture Co. – later to become Steelcase Inc.
RELATED: Former Steelcase leader Bob Pew
Pew attended prep school at the Northwestern Military and Naval Academy in Lake Geneva, Wis. He received his bachelor’s degree from Wesleyan University in 1948.
A former captain in the United States Air Force, Pew served as a pilot from 1942 to 1945 and again during the Korean crisis. He completed 100 missions during World War II, piloting a P-61 night fighter in the South Pacific.
In 1947, Pew married Idema’s daughter, Mary. He joined the company as a production expediter in 1952 and worked his way up the corporate ranks to become president in 1966. His employees knew him as a “gentle” and “fair” man.
Pew valued integrity and gave everyone a fair chance. He didn’t put himself above others, John Pew said. 
"He had a lot of respect for people because of who they were and not because of what they achieved. Sometimes it was for the struggles that they had," Wolters said.
He assumed the duties of chief executive officer in 1980, a position he held until 1989.
“He believed that the success of the company or of any organization was never one person. It was always people together who led to the success,” Wolters said.
An intensely private man, Robert Pew was reluctant to boast about Steelcase’s success or achievements despite its rise to the top of the world’s office furniture industry.
In 1983, he told The Press: “The whale that spouts is the one that gets the harpoon."
“This company is fortunate to be in the industry it’s in,” he said. “It helps to be in the right place at the right time.”
In 1990, when Fortune magazine included Pew and his family in a list of the world’s 25 wealthiest families, he issued a statement saying, “I am angry and appalled.”
“Throughout its history, Steelcase has represented quality and value; it has never been a dollar-driven, profit-taking business,” he said. “The Fortune article attempts to undermine the inherent values of our company and I am personally offended by the connotation.”
After his retirement in 1999, he and his wife moved to North Palm Beach, Fla. In 1998, they endowed $25 million to the Community Foundation for Palm Beach and Martin counties through the Mary and Robert Pew Public Education Fund.
"He and my mom were very passionate about making sure that kids in the public school system got a good start,” Wolters said. "He was quietly supportive of a number of nonprofits and individuals who needed help."
Outside from his career and philanthropic efforts, Pew enjoyed sailing and skiing, for which he took many family trips to Northern Michigan. 
"I saw real love and spark in his eye when he was on the ski slopes and when he was on a sailboat, and I think that was a really important part of his life," John Pew said. 
Robert Pew also was instrumental in founding Grand Valley State University. He was a founding member of the Grand Valley State College Citizens Council, which helped establish the Allendale school in the early 1960s. The school named its campus in downtown Grand Rapids for him.
He served on the boards of Aquinas College, Grand Valley State University, the Cranbrook Academy of Art, United Way, Blodgett Hospital, Michigan Economic Alliance and numerous civic and state committees promoting the betterment of economic growth, education, health care and the arts.
He received honorary doctorates from Grand Valley State University, Aquinas College and Davenport College of Business.
In 1989, then-President Ronald Reagan presented Pew, on behalf of Steelcase Inc., with the National Trust Historic Preservation Award for the restoration of the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed Meyer May house in Grand Rapids.
In 1990, he was inducted into the Grand Rapids Business Hall of Fame. In 1998, he was named Slykehouse Businessperson of the Year by the Economic Club of Grand Rapids.
Pew was a former director of the Foremost Corporation of America, Old Kent Financial Corporation, Irwin Seating, Kirsh Company and Wometco Enterprises. He also was a past director of the National Organization on Disability and served on the Steelcase Foundation board.
He also served on the board of the Michigan State Chamber of Commerce, was a member of the Grand Valley State Colleges Citizen’s Council and the United Community Services, was a director of Old Kent Bank and Trust Co. and vice-president of the Michigan United Fund.
In lieu of flowers, the family requests contributions to the charity of your choice or the Grand Rapids Community Foundation, 185 Oakes St. SW, Grand Rapids, MI  49503.
