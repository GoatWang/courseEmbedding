The Truth Behind Sarah Raiss’ Rise to the Boardroom





Did Sarah E. Raiss "network" and "get mentored" into the boardroom, or was it something else?  We should encourage truly, talented and competent women to not understate or "soft-sell" the very impressive skills they developed during their careers.  We need them to shine the light on the accomplishments that earned the attention of the business community, the cross-discipline core competency relationships they built during their rise up many paths to leadership, and acknowledge both the entities they built and the times they simply reached for the gold. That is what a Board Diversity Council should do to create opportunities for great women to shine. By the time Ms. Raiss attended the Women on Board™ Mentoring Program (2007) and was mentored by Robert J. Harding, Chair of Brookfield Asset Management Inc. her strong business and industry credentials were obvious to all but the most obtuse.Sarah Raiss is Executive Vice-President, Corporate Services for TransCanada -- a Canadian company recognized as the leader in the responsible development and reliable operation of North American energy infrastructure including natural gas pipelines, power generation, gas storage facilities, and projects related to oil pipelines.  Her breadth of responsibilities at that firm include: human resources, information systems, aviation, corporate services and internal communications. Not exactly your "traditional" industry sector for a woman and not exactly a simple job.Ms. Raiss currently sits on the Board of Directors for the Business Development Bank of Canada, where she chairs the Human Resources Committee, and on the Shopper’s Drug Mart Board of Directors.  David Williams, Chair of the Shoppers Drug Mart Board, welcomed her to his board in August 2007 saying, "We are very pleased to welcome Sarah to our Board. Her extensive experience and public company background make her an ideal candidate to serve on our Board and Compensation Committee. We look forward to her many contributions as we continue to grow our business."Ms. Raiss was born and raised in Flint, MI.  She received her B.S. in Applied Math (with distinction) form the University of Michigan in 1979 followed by an MBA (with an emphasis on Marketing and Operation Behaviour) in 1987. She holds an ICD.D. (certification granted by the Institute of Corporate Directors, the professional body representing the Director community in Canada. The professional designation is recognized both nationally and internationally.)She began her career at Michigan Bell Telephone Company as a Trainee and later Engineer in the Transmission Design Department (1979-1982), then became an Engineer in Facilities Planning (1982-1983), served on special assignment to the Divestiture Planning Group (1983-1984), and then was named Manager of Long Range Technical Planning (1984-1986).  She became Product Manager for Transport and Information Services (1986-1987).  She joined Richard Meltzer and Associates as a Senior Consultant (1988-1989) then  became Director of Corporate Strategy at Ameritech in charge of its Ameritech Publishing Inc. (1989-1993). At Ameritech, she held the positions of: Team Leader, Marketing Team & Launch Team, Special Assignment, Transformation of Ameritech (1992-1993) Vice President, Customer Services & Support, Long Distance Industry Services Unit, Ameritech (1993-1994)She was one of 120 top leaders appointed by the Chairman of Ameritech to move the company from a network-based regulated entity to a market-facing competitive enterprise. Ms. Raiss left Ameritech in 1994 and formed her own firm, SE Reiss Group Inc., a consultancy specializing in strategy, culture change and merger integration (1994 to 1999). She was invited to join TransCanada PipeLines Limited as Executive Vice President of Human Resources & Public Relations in 1999.Along the way, Ms. Raiss gathered together an impressive collection of academic, business, and nonprofit boards, earned recognitions among her peers, spoke and wrote on topical subjects in her area of competence.  THESE are all of the reasons Ms. Raiss was invited to become a corporate director.  If Ms. Raiss had only a fraction of the credentials, she still would be an asset in the boardroom -- not simply by "networking" and "mentoring."
