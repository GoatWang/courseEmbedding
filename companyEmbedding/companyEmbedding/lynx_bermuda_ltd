The Company
Lynx Asset Management was founded in 1999 and is today one of the world's leading firms in model-based asset management. From our office in the heart of Stockholm’s financial district we manage the Lynx programme, a fully-diversified managed futures programme that aims to deliver high risk-adjusted returns that are uncorrelated to traditional asset classes.

Lynx’s business idea involves the use of quantitative methods to predict price movements on the financial markets. This quantitative and systematic approach is typical of all aspects of our business. The number of employees has been increasing steadily, and we now have a team of around seventy people. Most of our employees are engaged in the development of new quantitative strategies and models. We are continually improving the investment process and reward curiosity and innovative thinking among our personnel.The company is responsible for investments in the Swedish hedge funds Lynx and Lynx Dynamic, as well as the offshore based fund Lynx (Bermuda) Ltd. We also manage Lynx 1.5 (Bermuda) Ltd., which offers a higher level of risk. Finally, the company also manages separate managed accounts with a similar investment mandate according to the Lynx programme.The company is jointly owned by its three founding partners, the other portfolio managers, a few key employees and Brummer & Partners, Scandinavia’s leading hedge fund company.Please visit www.brummer.se for information about Brummer & Partners’ other funds.

Composition







SummaryThe Lynx programme is managed by Jonas Bengtsson, Svante Bergström, Anders Holst, Jesper Sandin and Henrik Johansson. Lynx Asset Management was founded in 1999 and the Lynx Fund started in May 2000. The offshore vehicle, Lynx (Bermuda) Ltd., was launched 1 April 2004.Investment StrategyLynx’ main approach is systematic trendfollowing applied to a broadly diversified portfolio of markets. Further diversification is achieved by using models over multiple time frames, with holding periods varying from a couple of hours up to a year or more. The programme also trades contrarian models in an attempt to achieve better risk-adjusted returns and enhance performance in a non-trending market environment. Intermarket models use other inputs than the price in the market itself. There is also a short-term module where trades are held from a few hours to a few days. In aggregate, these models are used to make quantitative analyses of price fluctuations on the market. They are designed to identify market situations in which there is an enhanced probability that future price changes will be in a certain direction.
By using different models in conjunction with each other on each market, the programme can generate a more stable risk-adjusted return than a pure trendfollowing strategy.
The implementation of the programme is fully systematic. The proprietary models generate buy and sell signals that are executed directly in the electronic markets using internally developed algorithms. The trading desk is staffed 24 hours a day, making sure that all the systems are functioning properly and that signals are valid and executed correctly.
The quantitative and systematic approach enables Lynx to make extensive analyses of market relationships, and have an opinion on the direction of a large number of different markets. It also ensures a consistent approach, typically without any bias of being long or short in the markets. Given that the strategy trades only liquid instruments, the approach can adapt and change exposures when market sentiment changes. CTAs in general and Lynx in particular have historically performed well in volatile markets and during equity market crises, periods where risky assets and other hedge fund strategies have struggled.
Lynx holds the view that the way markets function will change over time. Consequently, it is important to carry out continuous research to improve the models used in the asset management process. Lynx has a large team of researchers, whose task it is to develop new strategies and models to be used in the programme.Risk ManagementRisk management is an integrated feature in the investment process and Lynx focuses on diversification and portfolio construction. Around 70 futures markets are traded across four sectors; equity indices, fixed income, currencies and commodities. Position sizes are determined based on correlations with other markets.
The models operate independently and the portfolio is built “bottom-up” based on the signals from each model. Minimization of each investment’s loss is integrated in the design of the models e.g. by using automated stop-loss mechanisms. As a result the risk utilization in the programme changes dynamically over time, limiting drawdowns.
Value-at-Risk is used to limit position concentration and risk levels. Three parallel VaR-models are monitored in real-time by the trading desk and there are limits on instrument, asset class and total portfolio level.

 Bermuda Vacation Packages 
 Bermuda’s famous pink sand beaches are even more impressive when you see them up close. 
 Horseshoe Bay is by far the best known, but there are a multitude of breathtaking pink sand options. Snorkelers like Tobacco Bay and Church Bay in the west end is a favorite for romantic sunset watchers. For seclusion there’s Cooper’s Island. 
 There are also many choices beyond the beach on this gem in the North Atlantic. Enjoy fine spas, exhilarating water sports, sensational food and more golf courses per square mile than anywhere else on the planet.
 
Venture out on the water with an afternoon ferry ride from Hamilton to Dockyard or take an immersive all-day boating excursion on Uber Vida. Try snorkeling, paddleboard yoga or kayaking. 
 
Sailing and water activities are the life-blood of Bermuda’s people. The island will host part of the America’s Cup World Series in October, 2015. The 35th America’s Cup, the biggest event in the sport, will take place in June, 2017 on Bermuda’s Great Sound.
 
Inland, play golf at one of the seven facilities, including Port Royal, where the PGA Grand Slam has taken place for 8 years at the end of the pro season. The season here doesn’t actually end, since you will find Bermuda’s attractive courses playable year-round.
 
Bermuda’s Railway Trails are pleasant at any time, too. Walk or jog and look for local wildlife hiding in the lush foliage along the path, which was converted from an old railway line. The chain of connected trails runs the length of the island.
 
After enjoying a day at the beach, golf course or trails, head to St. George for dinner. This town has been named a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Here you’ll find the local seafood specialties of Bermuda-style fish tacos, fish salads, fish sandwiches and beautifully seasoned sautéed or grilled fish. Bermuda is the home of Bacardi’s rum headquarters. Accompany your meal with signature cocktails like a Dark ‘n’ Stormy, Rum Swizzle or Dark ‘n’ Skinny (with diet ginger ale).
 
For a unique experience, create your own perfume in a workshop at The Bermuda Perfumery. Alternatively, sample and purchase a ready-made fragrance in the Lili Bermuda Boutique. Enjoy tea in the perfumery’s garden too.
 
Get a local’s perspective of Bermuda’s delights with a Hidden Gems eco-tour. Snorkel, explore underground caves and see the sights of this beautiful vacation spot with a guide who knows and loves the island.
