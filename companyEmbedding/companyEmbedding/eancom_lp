GTIN-13 number encoded in EAN-13 barcode. The first digit is always placed outside the symbol; additionally a right ">" indicator is used to indicate a "Quiet Zone" that is necessary for barcode scanners to work properly.


The International Article Number (also known as European Article Number or EAN) is a standard describing a barcode symbology and numbering system used in global trade to identify a specific retail product type, in a specific packaging configuration, from a specific manufacturer. The standard has been subsumed in the Global Trade Item Number standard from the GS1 organization; the same numbers can be referred to as GTINs and can be encoded in other barcode symbologies defined by GS1. EAN barcodes are used worldwide for lookup at retail point of sale, but can also be used as numbers for other purposes such as wholesale ordering or accounting.
The most commonly used EAN standard is the thirteen-digit EAN-13, a superset of the original 12-digit Universal Product Code (UPC-A) standard developed in 1970 by George J. Laurer.[1] An EAN-13 number includes a 3-digit GS1 prefix (indicating country of registration or special type of product). A prefix with a first digit of "0" indicates a 12-digit UPC-A code follows. A prefix with the first two digits of "45" or "49" indicates a Japanese Article Number (JAN) follows.
The less commonly used 8-digit EAN-8 barcode was introduced for use on small packages, where EAN-13 would be too large. 2-digit EAN-2 and 5-digit EAN-5 are supplemental barcodes, placed on the right-hand side of EAN-13 or UPC. These are generally used for periodicals like magazines[2] or books,[3] to indicate the current year's issue number; and weighed products like food, to indicate the manufacturer's suggested retail price.

Composition[edit]
The 13-digit EAN-13 number consists of four components:

GS1 Prefix - 3 digits
Manufacturer Code - variable length
Product Code - variable length
Check digit

GS1 prefix[edit]
Further information: List of GS1 country codes
The first three digits of the EAN-13 (GS1 Prefix) usually identify the GS1 Member Organization which the manufacturer has joined.(not necessarily where the product is actually made).[4] Note that EAN-13 codes beginning with 0 are actually 12-digit UPC codes with prepended 0 digit. In the last few years, more products sold by retailers outside United States and Canada have been using EAN-13 codes beginning with 0, since they were generated by GS1-US.
The 020-029 GS1 Prefixes are worth a special mention. GS1 defines this as being available for retailer internal use (or internal use by other types of business). Some retailers use this for proprietary (own brand or unbranded) products, although many retailers obtain their own manufacturer's code for their own brands. Other retailers use at least part of this prefix for products which are packaged in store, for example, items weighed and served over a counter for a customer. In these cases, the barcode may encode a price, quantity or weight along with a product identifier - in a retailer defined way. The product identifier may be one assigned by the Produce Electronic Identification Board (PEIB) or may be retailer assigned. Retailers who have historically used UPC barcodes tend to use GS1 prefixes starting with "02" for store-packaged products.[citation needed]
The EAN "country code" 978 (and later 979) has been allocated since the 1980s to reserve a Unique Country Code (UCC) prefix for EAN identifiers of published books, regardless of country of origin, so that the EAN space can catalog books by ISBNs[3] rather than maintaining a redundant parallel numbering system. This is informally known as "Bookland". The prefix 979 with first digit 0 is used for International Standard Music Number (ISMN) and the prefix 977 indicates International Standard Serial Number (ISSN).
Manufacturer code[edit]
The manufacturer code is a unique code assigned to each manufacturer by the numbering authority indicated by the GS1 Prefix. All products produced by a given company will use the same manufacturer code. EAN-13 uses what is called "variable-length manufacturer codes." Assigning fixed-length 5-digit manufacturer codes, as the UCC has done until recently, means that each manufacturer can have up to 99,999 product codes--and many manufacturers don't have that many products, which means hundreds or even thousands of potential product codes are being wasted on manufacturers that only have a few products. Thus if a potential manufacturer knows that it is only going to produce a few products, EAN-13 may issue it a longer manufacturer code, leaving less space for the product code. This results in more efficient use of the available manufacturer and product codes.[5]
In ISBN and ISSN, this component is used to identify the language in which the publication was issued and managed by a transnational agency covering several countries, or to identify the country where the legal deposits are made by a publisher registered with a national agency, and it is further subdivided any allocating subblocks for publishers; many countries have several prefixes allocated in the ISSN and ISBN registries.
Product code[edit]
The product code is assigned by the manufacturer. The product code immediately follows manufacturer code. The total length of manufacturer code plus product code should be 9 or 10 digits depending on the length of country code(2-3 digits).
In ISBN, ISMN and ISSN, it uniquely identifies the publication from the same publisher; it should be used and allocated by the registered publisher in order to avoid creating gaps; however it happens that a registered book or serial never gets published and sold.
Check digit[edit]
The check digit is an additional digit, used to verify that a barcode has been scanned correctly. It is computed modulo 10, where the weights in the checksum calculation alternate 3 and 1. In particular, since the weights are relatively prime to 10, the EAN-13 system will detect all single digit errors. It also recognizes 90% of transposition errors (all cases, where the difference between adjacent digits is not 5).
Calculation of checksum digit[edit]
The checksum is calculated as sum of products - taking an alternating weight value (3 or 1) times the value of each data digit. The checksum digit is the digit, which must be added to this checksum to get a number divisible by 10 (i.e. the additive inverse of the checksum, modulo 10).[6] See ISBN-13 check digit calculation for a more extensive description and algorithm. The Global Location Number(GLN) also uses the same method.
Position - weight[edit]
The weight at a specific position in the EAN code is alternating (3 or 1) in a way, that the final data digit has a weight of 3 (and thus the check digit has a weight of 1).
All Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) and Serial Shipping Container Code (SSCC) codes meet the next rule:
Numbering the positions from the right (code aligned to the right), the odd data digits are always weight of 3 and the even data digits are always weight of 1, regardless of the length of the code.

Binary encoding of data digits into EAN-13 barcode[edit]




Encoding EAN-13






Encoding L-digits






Encoding G-digits






Encoding R-digits


To encode the 13-digit EAN-13 number, the digits are split into 3 groups; the first digit, the first group of 6 and the last group of 6. The first group of 6 is encoded using a pattern whereby each digit has two possible encodings, one of which has even parity (denoted with letter G) and one of which has odd parity (denoted with letter L). The first digit is encoded indirectly, by selecting a pattern of choices between these two encodings for the first group of 6 digits, according to the table below. (Unlike the other digits, the first digit is not represented directly by a pattern of bars and spaces.) All digits in the last group of 6 digits are encoded using a single pattern RRRRRR, the one also used for UPC.
If the first digit is zero, all digits in the first group of 6 are encoded using the pattern LLLLLL used for UPC, therefore, an UPC barcode is also an EAN-13 barcode with the first digit set to zero.

Japanese Article Number[edit]
 Japanese Article Number (JAN) is a barcode standard compatible with the EAN. Use of the JAN standard began in 1978. Originally, JAN was issued a flag code (EAN's number system) of 49. In 1992, JAN was newly issued an additional flag code of 45. In January 2001 the manufacturer code changed to 7 digits (9 digits including the flag code) for new companies.[7]
How the 13-digit EAN-13 is encoded[edit]
The GTIN numbers, encoded to UPC-A, EAN-8 and EAN-13, all use similar encoding. The encoded information is repeated in plain text below the barcode.[8]
EAN-13 encoding[edit]
The 13-digit EAN-13 number can be divided into 3 groups: first digit, left group of 6 digits, right group of 6 digits.
The barcode consists of 95 equally spaced areas (also called modules). From left to right:

3 areas to encode the start marker.
42 (6*7) areas making up the left group of 6 digits. This can be further subdivided into 6 subgroups, each consisting of seven areas. The subgroups encode digits 2-7. Each of these encodings can have even or odd parity. The parities taken together, indirectly encode the first digit of EAN-13.
5 areas to encode the marker for the center of the barcode.
42 (6*7) areas making up the right group of 6 digits. This can be further subdivided into 6 subgroups, each consisting of seven areas. The subgroups encode digits 8-13. Digits 8-13 are all encoded with even parity. Digit 13 is the check digit.
3 areas to encode the end marker.

Each area can be black bar (1) or white space (0). A maximum of four black bar areas can be grouped together, these make up a wide black bar. Likewise a maximum of four white space areas can be grouped together, these make up a wide white space.
The start marker and the end marker are encoded as 101. The center marker is encoded as 01010.
Each digit in EAN-13 (except digit 1, which is not directly encoded) consists of seven areas. A decimal digit is encoded so that it consists of two (wide) bars and two (wide) spaces.
The digits in the left group are encoded so that they always start with a white space, and end with a black bar. The digits in the right group are encoded so that they always start with a black bar, and end with a white space.
Finally, the combination of variable-width black bars and white spaces encodes the EAN-13 number.
The encoding is described in the following table:

For each digit there are three similar encodings (left odd, left even, right): Left even and right are mirror-symmetrical to each other. Left odd is the bitwise inverse of right.
The first digit from the left group is always encoded with odd parity, and the last digit of the right group is always encoded with even parity. Thus, it does not matter whether the barcode is scanned from the left or from the right: the scanning software can determine what is the beginning and end of the barcode, with the help of the fact that the first digit should have odd parity and the last digit should have even parity.
EAN-13 barcode example[edit]




EAN-13 barcode. A green bar indicates the black bars and white spaces that encode a digit.



C1, C3:Start/end marker.
C2: Marker for the center of the barcode.
6 digits in the left group: 003994.
6 digits in the right group (the last digit is the check digit): 155486.
A digit is encoded in seven areas, by two black bars and two white spaces. Each black bar or white space can have a width between 1 and 4 areas.
Parity for the digits from left and right group: OEOOEE EEEEEE (O = Odd parity, E = Even parity).
The first digit in the EAN code: the combination of parities of the digits in the left group indirectly encodes the first digit 4.

The complete EAN-13 code is thus: 4 003994 155486.
Decoding[edit]

GTIN-13 number encoded in EAN-13 barcode. The first digit is always placed outside the symbol; additionally a right ">" indicator is used to indicate a "Quiet Zone" that is necessary for barcode scanners to work properly.


The International Article Number (also known as European Article Number or EAN) is a standard describing a barcode symbology and numbering system used in global trade to identify a specific retail product type, in a specific packaging configuration, from a specific manufacturer. The standard has been subsumed in the Global Trade Item Number standard from the GS1 organization; the same numbers can be referred to as GTINs and can be encoded in other barcode symbologies defined by GS1. EAN barcodes are used worldwide for lookup at retail point of sale, but can also be used as numbers for other purposes such as wholesale ordering or accounting.
The most commonly used EAN standard is the thirteen-digit EAN-13, a superset of the original 12-digit Universal Product Code (UPC-A) standard developed in 1970 by George J. Laurer.[1] An EAN-13 number includes a 3-digit GS1 prefix (indicating country of registration or special type of product). A prefix with a first digit of "0" indicates a 12-digit UPC-A code follows. A prefix with the first two digits of "45" or "49" indicates a Japanese Article Number (JAN) follows.
The less commonly used 8-digit EAN-8 barcode was introduced for use on small packages, where EAN-13 would be too large. 2-digit EAN-2 and 5-digit EAN-5 are supplemental barcodes, placed on the right-hand side of EAN-13 or UPC. These are generally used for periodicals like magazines[2] or books,[3] to indicate the current year's issue number; and weighed products like food, to indicate the manufacturer's suggested retail price.

Composition[edit]
The 13-digit EAN-13 number consists of four components:

GS1 Prefix - 3 digits
Manufacturer Code - variable length
Product Code - variable length
Check digit

GS1 prefix[edit]
Further information: List of GS1 country codes
The first three digits of the EAN-13 (GS1 Prefix) usually identify the GS1 Member Organization which the manufacturer has joined.(not necessarily where the product is actually made).[4] Note that EAN-13 codes beginning with 0 are actually 12-digit UPC codes with prepended 0 digit. In the last few years, more products sold by retailers outside United States and Canada have been using EAN-13 codes beginning with 0, since they were generated by GS1-US.
The 020-029 GS1 Prefixes are worth a special mention. GS1 defines this as being available for retailer internal use (or internal use by other types of business). Some retailers use this for proprietary (own brand or unbranded) products, although many retailers obtain their own manufacturer's code for their own brands. Other retailers use at least part of this prefix for products which are packaged in store, for example, items weighed and served over a counter for a customer. In these cases, the barcode may encode a price, quantity or weight along with a product identifier - in a retailer defined way. The product identifier may be one assigned by the Produce Electronic Identification Board (PEIB) or may be retailer assigned. Retailers who have historically used UPC barcodes tend to use GS1 prefixes starting with "02" for store-packaged products.[citation needed]
The EAN "country code" 978 (and later 979) has been allocated since the 1980s to reserve a Unique Country Code (UCC) prefix for EAN identifiers of published books, regardless of country of origin, so that the EAN space can catalog books by ISBNs[3] rather than maintaining a redundant parallel numbering system. This is informally known as "Bookland". The prefix 979 with first digit 0 is used for International Standard Music Number (ISMN) and the prefix 977 indicates International Standard Serial Number (ISSN).
Manufacturer code[edit]
The manufacturer code is a unique code assigned to each manufacturer by the numbering authority indicated by the GS1 Prefix. All products produced by a given company will use the same manufacturer code. EAN-13 uses what is called "variable-length manufacturer codes." Assigning fixed-length 5-digit manufacturer codes, as the UCC has done until recently, means that each manufacturer can have up to 99,999 product codes--and many manufacturers don't have that many products, which means hundreds or even thousands of potential product codes are being wasted on manufacturers that only have a few products. Thus if a potential manufacturer knows that it is only going to produce a few products, EAN-13 may issue it a longer manufacturer code, leaving less space for the product code. This results in more efficient use of the available manufacturer and product codes.[5]
In ISBN and ISSN, this component is used to identify the language in which the publication was issued and managed by a transnational agency covering several countries, or to identify the country where the legal deposits are made by a publisher registered with a national agency, and it is further subdivided any allocating subblocks for publishers; many countries have several prefixes allocated in the ISSN and ISBN registries.
Product code[edit]
The product code is assigned by the manufacturer. The product code immediately follows manufacturer code. The total length of manufacturer code plus product code should be 9 or 10 digits depending on the length of country code(2-3 digits).
In ISBN, ISMN and ISSN, it uniquely identifies the publication from the same publisher; it should be used and allocated by the registered publisher in order to avoid creating gaps; however it happens that a registered book or serial never gets published and sold.
Check digit[edit]
The check digit is an additional digit, used to verify that a barcode has been scanned correctly. It is computed modulo 10, where the weights in the checksum calculation alternate 3 and 1. In particular, since the weights are relatively prime to 10, the EAN-13 system will detect all single digit errors. It also recognizes 90% of transposition errors (all cases, where the difference between adjacent digits is not 5).
Calculation of checksum digit[edit]
The checksum is calculated as sum of products - taking an alternating weight value (3 or 1) times the value of each data digit. The checksum digit is the digit, which must be added to this checksum to get a number divisible by 10 (i.e. the additive inverse of the checksum, modulo 10).[6] See ISBN-13 check digit calculation for a more extensive description and algorithm. The Global Location Number(GLN) also uses the same method.
Position - weight[edit]
The weight at a specific position in the EAN code is alternating (3 or 1) in a way, that the final data digit has a weight of 3 (and thus the check digit has a weight of 1).
All Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) and Serial Shipping Container Code (SSCC) codes meet the next rule:
Numbering the positions from the right (code aligned to the right), the odd data digits are always weight of 3 and the even data digits are always weight of 1, regardless of the length of the code.

Binary encoding of data digits into EAN-13 barcode[edit]




Encoding EAN-13






Encoding L-digits






Encoding G-digits






Encoding R-digits


To encode the 13-digit EAN-13 number, the digits are split into 3 groups; the first digit, the first group of 6 and the last group of 6. The first group of 6 is encoded using a pattern whereby each digit has two possible encodings, one of which has even parity (denoted with letter G) and one of which has odd parity (denoted with letter L). The first digit is encoded indirectly, by selecting a pattern of choices between these two encodings for the first group of 6 digits, according to the table below. (Unlike the other digits, the first digit is not represented directly by a pattern of bars and spaces.) All digits in the last group of 6 digits are encoded using a single pattern RRRRRR, the one also used for UPC.
If the first digit is zero, all digits in the first group of 6 are encoded using the pattern LLLLLL used for UPC, therefore, an UPC barcode is also an EAN-13 barcode with the first digit set to zero.

Japanese Article Number[edit]
 Japanese Article Number (JAN) is a barcode standard compatible with the EAN. Use of the JAN standard began in 1978. Originally, JAN was issued a flag code (EAN's number system) of 49. In 1992, JAN was newly issued an additional flag code of 45. In January 2001 the manufacturer code changed to 7 digits (9 digits including the flag code) for new companies.[7]
How the 13-digit EAN-13 is encoded[edit]
The GTIN numbers, encoded to UPC-A, EAN-8 and EAN-13, all use similar encoding. The encoded information is repeated in plain text below the barcode.[8]
EAN-13 encoding[edit]
The 13-digit EAN-13 number can be divided into 3 groups: first digit, left group of 6 digits, right group of 6 digits.
The barcode consists of 95 equally spaced areas (also called modules). From left to right:

3 areas to encode the start marker.
42 (6*7) areas making up the left group of 6 digits. This can be further subdivided into 6 subgroups, each consisting of seven areas. The subgroups encode digits 2-7. Each of these encodings can have even or odd parity. The parities taken together, indirectly encode the first digit of EAN-13.
5 areas to encode the marker for the center of the barcode.
42 (6*7) areas making up the right group of 6 digits. This can be further subdivided into 6 subgroups, each consisting of seven areas. The subgroups encode digits 8-13. Digits 8-13 are all encoded with even parity. Digit 13 is the check digit.
3 areas to encode the end marker.

Each area can be black bar (1) or white space (0). A maximum of four black bar areas can be grouped together, these make up a wide black bar. Likewise a maximum of four white space areas can be grouped together, these make up a wide white space.
The start marker and the end marker are encoded as 101. The center marker is encoded as 01010.
Each digit in EAN-13 (except digit 1, which is not directly encoded) consists of seven areas. A decimal digit is encoded so that it consists of two (wide) bars and two (wide) spaces.
The digits in the left group are encoded so that they always start with a white space, and end with a black bar. The digits in the right group are encoded so that they always start with a black bar, and end with a white space.
Finally, the combination of variable-width black bars and white spaces encodes the EAN-13 number.
The encoding is described in the following table:

For each digit there are three similar encodings (left odd, left even, right): Left even and right are mirror-symmetrical to each other. Left odd is the bitwise inverse of right.
The first digit from the left group is always encoded with odd parity, and the last digit of the right group is always encoded with even parity. Thus, it does not matter whether the barcode is scanned from the left or from the right: the scanning software can determine what is the beginning and end of the barcode, with the help of the fact that the first digit should have odd parity and the last digit should have even parity.
EAN-13 barcode example[edit]




EAN-13 barcode. A green bar indicates the black bars and white spaces that encode a digit.



C1, C3:Start/end marker.
C2: Marker for the center of the barcode.
6 digits in the left group: 003994.
6 digits in the right group (the last digit is the check digit): 155486.
A digit is encoded in seven areas, by two black bars and two white spaces. Each black bar or white space can have a width between 1 and 4 areas.
Parity for the digits from left and right group: OEOOEE EEEEEE (O = Odd parity, E = Even parity).
The first digit in the EAN code: the combination of parities of the digits in the left group indirectly encodes the first digit 4.

The complete EAN-13 code is thus: 4 003994 155486.
Decoding[edit]




Scanning part of an EAN-13 barcode.


By using the barcode center marker, it is possible for a barcode scanner to scan just one half of the barcode at a time. This allows reconstruction of the code by means of a helical scan of the barcode by an angle of approximately 45 degrees.

International Article Number - Wikipedia






















 






International Article Number

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
  (Redirected from International Article Number (EAN))

					Jump to:					navigation, 					search





GTIN-13 number encoded in EAN-13 barcode. The first digit is always placed outside the symbol; additionally a right ">" indicator is used to indicate a "Quiet Zone" that is necessary for barcode scanners to work properly.


The International Article Number (also known as European Article Number or EAN) is a standard describing a barcode symbology and numbering system used in global trade to identify a specific retail product type, in a specific packaging configuration, from a specific manufacturer. The standard has been subsumed in the Global Trade Item Number standard from the GS1 organization; the same numbers can be referred to as GTINs and can be encoded in other barcode symbologies defined by GS1. EAN barcodes are used worldwide for lookup at retail point of sale, but can also be used as numbers for other purposes such as wholesale ordering or accounting.
The most commonly used EAN standard is the thirteen-digit EAN-13, a superset of the original 12-digit Universal Product Code (UPC-A) standard developed in 1970 by George J. Laurer.[1] An EAN-13 number includes a 3-digit GS1 prefix (indicating country of registration or special type of product). A prefix with a first digit of "0" indicates a 12-digit UPC-A code follows. A prefix with the first two digits of "45" or "49" indicates a Japanese Article Number (JAN) follows.
The less commonly used 8-digit EAN-8 barcode was introduced for use on small packages, where EAN-13 would be too large. 2-digit EAN-2 and 5-digit EAN-5 are supplemental barcodes, placed on the right-hand side of EAN-13 or UPC. These are generally used for periodicals like magazines[2] or books,[3] to indicate the current year's issue number; and weighed products like food, to indicate the manufacturer's suggested retail price.

Composition[edit]
The 13-digit EAN-13 number consists of four components:

GS1 Prefix - 3 digits
Manufacturer Code - variable length
Product Code - variable length
Check digit

GS1 prefix[edit]
Further information: List of GS1 country codes
The first three digits of the EAN-13 (GS1 Prefix) usually identify the GS1 Member Organization which the manufacturer has joined.(not necessarily where the product is actually made).[4] Note that EAN-13 codes beginning with 0 are actually 12-digit UPC codes with prepended 0 digit. In the last few years, more products sold by retailers outside United States and Canada have been using EAN-13 codes beginning with 0, since they were generated by GS1-US.
The 020-029 GS1 Prefixes are worth a special mention. GS1 defines this as being available for retailer internal use (or internal use by other types of business). Some retailers use this for proprietary (own brand or unbranded) products, although many retailers obtain their own manufacturer's code for their own brands. Other retailers use at least part of this prefix for products which are packaged in store, for example, items weighed and served over a counter for a customer. In these cases, the barcode may encode a price, quantity or weight along with a product identifier - in a retailer defined way. The product identifier may be one assigned by the Produce Electronic Identification Board (PEIB) or may be retailer assigned. Retailers who have historically used UPC barcodes tend to use GS1 prefixes starting with "02" for store-packaged products.[citation needed]
The EAN "country code" 978 (and later 979) has been allocated since the 1980s to reserve a Unique Country Code (UCC) prefix for EAN identifiers of published books, regardless of country of origin, so that the EAN space can catalog books by ISBNs[3] rather than maintaining a redundant parallel numbering system. This is informally known as "Bookland". The prefix 979 with first digit 0 is used for International Standard Music Number (ISMN) and the prefix 977 indicates International Standard Serial Number (ISSN).
Manufacturer code[edit]
The manufacturer code is a unique code assigned to each manufacturer by the numbering authority indicated by the GS1 Prefix. All products produced by a given company will use the same manufacturer code. EAN-13 uses what is called "variable-length manufacturer codes." Assigning fixed-length 5-digit manufacturer codes, as the UCC has done until recently, means that each manufacturer can have up to 99,999 product codes--and many manufacturers don't have that many products, which means hundreds or even thousands of potential product codes are being wasted on manufacturers that only have a few products. Thus if a potential manufacturer knows that it is only going to produce a few products, EAN-13 may issue it a longer manufacturer code, leaving less space for the product code. This results in more efficient use of the available manufacturer and product codes.[5]
In ISBN and ISSN, this component is used to identify the language in which the publication was issued and managed by a transnational agency covering several countries, or to identify the country where the legal deposits are made by a publisher registered with a national agency, and it is further subdivided any allocating subblocks for publishers; many countries have several prefixes allocated in the ISSN and ISBN registries.
Product code[edit]
The product code is assigned by the manufacturer. The product code immediately follows manufacturer code. The total length of manufacturer code plus product code should be 9 or 10 digits depending on the length of country code(2-3 digits).
In ISBN, ISMN and ISSN, it uniquely identifies the publication from the same publisher; it should be used and allocated by the registered publisher in order to avoid creating gaps; however it happens that a registered book or serial never gets published and sold.
Check digit[edit]
The check digit is an additional digit, used to verify that a barcode has been scanned correctly. It is computed modulo 10, where the weights in the checksum calculation alternate 3 and 1. In particular, since the weights are relatively prime to 10, the EAN-13 system will detect all single digit errors. It also recognizes 90% of transposition errors (all cases, where the difference between adjacent digits is not 5).
Calculation of checksum digit[edit]
The checksum is calculated as sum of products - taking an alternating weight value (3 or 1) times the value of each data digit. The checksum digit is the digit, which must be added to this checksum to get a number divisible by 10 (i.e. the additive inverse of the checksum, modulo 10).[6] See ISBN-13 check digit calculation for a more extensive description and algorithm. The Global Location Number(GLN) also uses the same method.
Position - weight[edit]
The weight at a specific position in the EAN code is alternating (3 or 1) in a way, that the final data digit has a weight of 3 (and thus the check digit has a weight of 1).
All Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) and Serial Shipping Container Code (SSCC) codes meet the next rule:
Numbering the positions from the right (code aligned to the right), the odd data digits are always weight of 3 and the even data digits are always weight of 1, regardless of the length of the code.

Binary encoding of data digits into EAN-13 barcode[edit]




Encoding EAN-13






Encoding L-digits






Encoding G-digits






Encoding R-digits


To encode the 13-digit EAN-13 number, the digits are split into 3 groups; the first digit, the first group of 6 and the last group of 6. The first group of 6 is encoded using a pattern whereby each digit has two possible encodings, one of which has even parity (denoted with letter G) and one of which has odd parity (denoted with letter L). The first digit is encoded indirectly, by selecting a pattern of choices between these two encodings for the first group of 6 digits, according to the table below. (Unlike the other digits, the first digit is not represented directly by a pattern of bars and spaces.) All digits in the last group of 6 digits are encoded using a single pattern RRRRRR, the one also used for UPC.
If the first digit is zero, all digits in the first group of 6 are encoded using the pattern LLLLLL used for UPC, therefore, an UPC barcode is also an EAN-13 barcode with the first digit set to zero.

Japanese Article Number[edit]
 Japanese Article Number (JAN) is a barcode standard compatible with the EAN. Use of the JAN standard began in 1978. Originally, JAN was issued a flag code (EAN's number system) of 49. In 1992, JAN was newly issued an additional flag code of 45. In January 2001 the manufacturer code changed to 7 digits (9 digits including the flag code) for new companies.[7]
How the 13-digit EAN-13 is encoded[edit]
The GTIN numbers, encoded to UPC-A, EAN-8 and EAN-13, all use similar encoding. The encoded information is repeated in plain text below the barcode.[8]
EAN-13 encoding[edit]
The 13-digit EAN-13 number can be divided into 3 groups: first digit, left group of 6 digits, right group of 6 digits.
The barcode consists of 95 equally spaced areas (also called modules). From left to right:

3 areas to encode the start marker.
42 (6*7) areas making up the left group of 6 digits. This can be further subdivided into 6 subgroups, each consisting of seven areas. The subgroups encode digits 2-7. Each of these encodings can have even or odd parity. The parities taken together, indirectly encode the first digit of EAN-13.
5 areas to encode the marker for the center of the barcode.
42 (6*7) areas making up the right group of 6 digits. This can be further subdivided into 6 subgroups, each consisting of seven areas. The subgroups encode digits 8-13. Digits 8-13 are all encoded with even parity. Digit 13 is the check digit.
3 areas to encode the end marker.

Each area can be black bar (1) or white space (0). A maximum of four black bar areas can be grouped together, these make up a wide black bar. Likewise a maximum of four white space areas can be grouped together, these make up a wide white space.
The start marker and the end marker are encoded as 101. The center marker is encoded as 01010.
Each digit in EAN-13 (except digit 1, which is not directly encoded) consists of seven areas. A decimal digit is encoded so that it consists of two (wide) bars and two (wide) spaces.
The digits in the left group are encoded so that they always start with a white space, and end with a black bar. The digits in the right group are encoded so that they always start with a black bar, and end with a white space.
Finally, the combination of variable-width black bars and white spaces encodes the EAN-13 number.
The encoding is described in the following table:

For each digit there are three similar encodings (left odd, left even, right): Left even and right are mirror-symmetrical to each other. Left odd is the bitwise inverse of right.
The first digit from the left group is always encoded with odd parity, and the last digit of the right group is always encoded with even parity. Thus, it does not matter whether the barcode is scanned from the left or from the right: the scanning software can determine what is the beginning and end of the barcode, with the help of the fact that the first digit should have odd parity and the last digit should have even parity.
EAN-13 barcode example[edit]




EAN-13 barcode. A green bar indicates the black bars and white spaces that encode a digit.



C1, C3:Start/end marker.
C2: Marker for the center of the barcode.
6 digits in the left group: 003994.
6 digits in the right group (the last digit is the check digit): 155486.
A digit is encoded in seven areas, by two black bars and two white spaces. Each black bar or white space can have a width between 1 and 4 areas.
Parity for the digits from left and right group: OEOOEE EEEEEE (O = Odd parity, E = Even parity).
The first digit in the EAN code: the combination of parities of the digits in the left group indirectly encodes the first digit 4.

The complete EAN-13 code is thus: 4 003994 155486.
Decoding[edit]




Scanning part of an EAN-13 barcode.


By using the barcode center marker, it is possible for a barcode scanner to scan just one half of the barcode at a time. This allows reconstruction of the code by means of a helical scan of the barcode by an angle of approximately 45 degrees.

After graduating from Maryland in 1951, George Laurer joined IBM as a junior engineer and worked up the ranks to senior engineer. In 1969, he returned to the technical side of engineering and was later assigned the monumental task of designing a code and symbol for product identification for the Uniform Grocery Product Code Council. His solution — the Universal Product Code — radically changed the retail world. Since then, he has enhanced the code by adding a 13th digit. Laurer retired from IBM in 1987.

"frame", "mirror" or otherwise incorporate any part of our Information into any other website without our prior written authorization.

THIRD PARTY LINKS
  Our Information may contain links to other sites and resources provided by third parties. Such links are provided for your information only and do not imply any endorsement of the material contained within such sites or resources. 
  We have no control over the contents of those sites or resources. In particular, we are not responsible for the privacy or other practices of such sites. 
PAYMENT FOR YOUR BOOKING
  Upon submitting your Hotel Reservation request, you authorize us or one of our Group Members to facilitate Hotel Reservations on your behalf, including making payment arrangements with accommodation suppliers.
  When you make payment for a Booking depends on whether you prepay for your Hotel Reservation (Prepaid Booking) or not, which will be notified to you prior to completion of your Booking.  
  Please note that taxes and fees vary between the two payment options. Tax rates and foreign exchange rates could change in the time between Booking and your actual use of the Hotel Reservation.
  Coupons may be available but will always be subject to their own specific terms and conditions. If you wish to use a coupon, it can only be applied to Prepaid Bookings.
Prepaid Bookings (“Pay Now”)
  Prepaid Bookings are paid for by you at the time of making the Booking. You authorise us to make the Booking for the total reservation price, which includes the Hotel Reservation rate, displayed by our Affiliate, plus any additional tax recovery charges, taxes, service fees, any applicable taxes on our services and any additional booking fee separately charged by our Affiliate. 
  If prepayment for your Booking is required or you choose to pay at the time of Booking, we, one of our Group Members or our Affiliates will immediately charge the total price to your credit card.
Pay Later 
  If prepayment for your Booking is not required, you can choose to pay at the time you use the Hotel Reservation. 
  If you select this “pay later” option, the applicable Hotel Reservation supplier will take payment for the Hotel Reservation in the local currency at the time you use the Hotel Reservation.
Additional Information
  In the event that your payment is taken at the time of Booking, the company taking that payment and charging your credit card will be a Group Member or an Affiliate doing business on behalf of us or our Group Member, who takes such payment on behalf of the provider of the Hotel Reservation. Some bank and card companies charge their account holders a transaction fee when the card issuer and the merchant location (as defined by the card brand, e.g. Visa, MasterCard, American Express) are in different countries. The currency exchange rate, if applicable, and any transaction fee is determined solely by the bank or other agency processing the transaction. These fees may be applied by the card issuer as a charge to the cardholders account. When applied by the card issuer, the fees will be listed separately from the transaction amount on a credit or debit card statement. This means the amount listed on your credit or debit card statement may be a different figure than the figure shown on the billing summary page for a reservation booked on our Information. If you have any questions about these fees or any exchange rate applied to your booking, please contact your bank. 
  Some accommodation suppliers may require you and/or the Other Persons to present a credit card or cash deposit upon check-in to cover additional expenses incurred during your stay.  Such deposit is unrelated to any payment received by us for your Booking.  
CANCELLATION OR MAKING CHANGES TO YOUR BOOKING 
  The Rules will set out the applicable cancellation period during which you can cancel or make changes to your Booking (the Cancellation Period). In limited cases, some Bookings cannot be changed or cancelled after they are made and this will be indicated in the specific hotel’s cancellation policy. 
  If permitted, you may cancel or change your prepaid Booking during the Cancellation Period but you will be charged the applicable cancellation or change fee as set out in the specific hotel’s cancellation policy. 
  If you are allowed to cancel or make changes to your Booking but do not do so before the end of the Cancellation Period, you will be liable to pay a cancellation charge equal to applicable nightly Hotel Reservation rate(s), taxes or tax recovery charges (as applicable), service fees and any additional booking fee separately charged by our Affiliate (the Cancellation Penalty) whether or not you use the Hotel Reservation or not. 
  If you do not show for the first night of your Booking but plan to check-in for subsequent nights, you must confirm with our Affiliate no later than the date of the first night of your reservation. Failure to do so may result in your Booking being cancelled and you being charged the Cancellation Penalty. 
GROUP BOOKINGS
  Please note that we cannot guarantee reservations for 8 or more rooms with any accommodation supplier for the same accommodation stay dates (Group Booking). If you make a Group Booking online, we may cancel such Group Booking and charge you any cancellation fee set out in the Rules. If you paid a non-refundable deposit in respect of your Group Booking, your deposit will be forfeited.
FRAUDULENT BOOKINGS
  If any Booking (including any associated payment cards) shows signs or is connected to any suspected fraud, abuse or suspicious activity, we or our Affiliate may cancel any Booking associated with your name or email address.  In addition, we may verify (i.e. preauthorize) any credit card used for payment of a Booking.  If you or the holder of any credit card used for payment of a Booking have conducted any fraudulent activity, we reserve the right to take any necessary legal action and you and/or the card holder may be liable for our and our Group Member’s losses, including litigation costs and damages.  To contest the cancellation of a Booking, please contact our Affiliate.
PACKAGES
  If your Hotel Reservation has been provided to you in conjunction with another travel product (e.g. a flight) (a Package), then the Affiliate who has provided this Package to you will be responsible for any changes regarding that Package.
TAXES
  You acknowledge that, except as provided below with respect to tax obligations on the amount we retain for our services, we do not collect taxes for remittance to applicable taxing authorities. The accommodation suppliers invoice us for certain charges, including, where appropriate, tax amounts. The accommodation suppliers are responsible for remitting the applicable taxes to the applicable taxing jurisdictions. The tax recovery charges which we charge you on Prepaid Bookings represent the estimated taxes (e.g. sales and use, occupancy, room tax, excise tax, value added tax, etc) that we pay to the accommodation supplier for taxes due on the rental of the room. Taxability and the appropriate tax rate vary depending on the location. The actual tax amounts paid by us to the accommodation suppliers may vary from the tax recovery charge amounts, depending upon the rates, taxability, etc. in effect at the time of your actual use of the Hotel Reservation. 
  You acknowledge that we provide you services to facilitate the booking of Hotel Reservations for a consideration. We retain our service fees as compensation for servicing your Booking. Our service fees vary based on the amount and type of Hotel Reservation. Sales, use and/or local hotel occupancy taxes are imposed on the amounts that we charge for our services (service fee and/or facilitation fee) in certain jurisdictions. The actual tax amounts on our services may vary depending on the rates in effect at the time of your actual use of the Hotel Reservation. 
  You acknowledge that authorities in certain countries may impose additional sales, use and/or local hotel occupancy taxes (e.g., a tourist tax), which have to be paid locally. You are solely responsible for paying such additional taxes.
INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL
  You are responsible for ensuring that you meet any applicable foreign entry requirements and that your travel documents, such as passports and visas (transit, business, tourist, and otherwise), are in order and any other foreign entry requirements are met.  
  By offering Hotel Reservations in particular international destinations, we do not represent or warrant that travel to such areas is advisable or without risk, and are not liable for damages or losses that may result from travel to such destinations. We recommend you check your country’s foreign travel guidance for further details.  
DISCLAIMER 
  We and our Group Members will make reasonable efforts to update our Information to ensure its accuracy. However, our Information is provided by the suppliers of our Hotel Reservations. As such:

our Information may be changed, enhanced, amended or deleted at any time, any non-availability or change may occur at any time without notice and without liability to us or our Group Members;


we disclaim all liability for any errors or other      inaccuracies relating to our Information, (including, without limitation,      the pricing of Hotel Reservations, photographs of hotels, lists of hotel      amenities and general hotel descriptions);
we make no guarantees about the availability of      specific Hotel Reservations;  
we make no representations about the suitability      of our Information for any purpose;
hotel ratings displayed in our Information are      intended as general guidelines only and we and our Group Members cannot      guarantee the accuracy of such ratings;  
the inclusion or offering of any Hotel      Reservation does not constitute any endorsement or recommendation of such Hotel      Reservation by us or our Group Members;
disclaim all warranties and conditions that our      Information, and services or any email sent from us, or our Group Members are      free of viruses or other harmful components and all our Information; and
services are provided “as is” without warranty of      any kind. 

We expressly reserve the right to correct any pricing errors and/or Bookings made under an incorrect price. In such event, if available, we will offer you the opportunity to keep your Booking at the amended price or you may cancel your Booking without penalty.
OUR LIABILITY TO YOU 
  The hotels and other suppliers providing Hotel Reservations to us are independent contractors and not agents or employees of us, or our Group Members. 
  We and our Group Members are not liable for:

the acts, errors, omissions, representations, warranties, breaches or negligence of any Affiliate or  the suppliers of the Hotel Reservations; or 
for any personal injury, death, property damage, or other damages or expenses resulting there from.  

We and our Group Members have no liability and will make no refund in the event of any:

delay;
cancellation;
overbooking;
strike;
force majeure; or
other causes beyond our direct control;  

and we have no responsibility for any additional expenses, omissions, delays, re-routing or acts of any government or authority.  
  To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall we or our Group Members be liable for any direct, indirect, punitive, incidental, special or consequential damages arising out of, or in any way connected with:

your access to our Information; or
the delay or inability to access our Information (including, but not limited to, any computer viruses, information, software, linked sites, and Bookings);

whether based on negligence, contract, tort, strict liability, consumer protection law, or otherwise, and even if we or our Group Members have been advised of the possibility of such damages. 
  If, despite the limitation above, we or our Group Members are found liable for any loss or damage which arises out of or is in any way connected with any of the occurrences described above, then the liability of us, or our Group Members will in no event exceed, in the aggregate, the greater of:

the Booking fee you paid to us, our Group Member or Affiliate in connection with the relevant Booking; or
One Hundred Dollars (US$100.00) or the equivalent in local currency.

We do not exclude or limit in any way our liability for anything which cannot be excluded by applicable law. 
  The limitation of liability reflects the allocation of risk between you and us. 
  The limitations specified in this section will survive and apply even if any limited remedy specified in these Terms is found to have failed of its essential purpose. 
  The limitations of liability provided in these Terms inure to the benefit of us and our Group Members. 
INDEMNIFICATION 
  You agree to defend and indemnify us, our Group Members and any of their officers, directors, employees and agents from and against any claims, causes of action, demands, recoveries, losses, damages, fines, penalties or other costs or expenses of any kind or nature including but not limited to reasonable legal and accounting fees, brought by third parties as a result of:

your breach of these      Terms; 
your violation of      any law or the rights of a third party; or 
your use of our      Information.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS
  Our Information (including, but not limited to, price and availability of Hotel Reservations) is owned by us or our suppliers and providers. 
  Whilst we agree that you can use our Information to make limited copies of your travel itinerary and any other information relevant to your Booking, you agree not to otherwise modify, copy, distribute, transmit, display, perform, reproduce, publish, license, create derivative works from, transfer, or sell or re-sell any information, software, products, or services relating to and/or including the Hotel Reservations and our Information.
COPYRIGHT AND TRADEMARK NOTICES

Expedia, Expedia Affiliate Network, EAN, Travelnow, Hotels.com, the Expedia Affiliate Network logo, the Travelnow logo and the Hotels.com logo are either registered trademarks or trademarks of Expedia, Inc. in the U.S. and/or other countries. Other logos and product and company names mentioned herein may be the trademarks of their respective owners.  We are not responsible for content on websites operated by third parties.   
  If you are aware of an infringement of our brand, please let us know by e-mailing us at hotline@expedia.com. We only address messages concerning brand infringement at this email address.
APPLICABLE LAW
  Our Information is made available by a U.S. entity and these Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Washington, USA. You hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of courts in King County, Washington, USA, in all disputes arising out of these Terms or relating to the use of our Information. Use of our Information is unauthorized in any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions of these Terms.
DISPUTES 
  We and our Group Members are committed to customer satisfaction, so if you have a problem or dispute, we will try to resolve your concerns. If we are unsuccessful, you may pursue claims as explained in this section. 
  You agree to give us an opportunity to resolve any disputes or claims relating in any way to our Information, Bookings, any dealings with our Customer Support Agents, any Hotel Reservations, or any representations made by us (Claims) by contacting us through the customer service details provided to you at the time of booking. If we are not able to resolve your Claims within 60 days, you may seek relief through arbitration or in small claims court, as set forth below. 
  Any and all Claims will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except you may assert Claims on an individual basis in small claims court if they qualify. This includes any Claims you assert against us, our subsidiaries, travel suppliers or any companies offering products or services through us (which are beneficiaries of this arbitration agreement). This also includes any Claims that arose before you accepted these Terms, regardless of whether prior versions of these Terms required arbitration. 
  There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including statutory damages, attorneys’ fees and costs), and must follow and enforce these Terms as a court would.  
  Arbitrations will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA Consumer Rules. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules, except as provided in this section. If your total Claims seek less than $10,000, we will reimburse you for filing fees you pay to the AAA and will pay arbitrator’s fees, unless the arbitrator determines your Claims are frivolous. You may choose to have an arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the state where you live or at another mutually agreed location. 
  To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your Claims to “Expedia Legal: Arbitration Claim Manager,” at Expedia, Inc., 333 108th Ave N.E. Bellevue, WA 98004. If we request arbitration against you, we will give you notice at the email address or street address you have provided. A party requesting arbitration must also provide a copy of the request to the AAA, at Case Filing Services, 1101 Laurel Oak Road, Suite 100, Voorhees, NJ 08043 or online at www.adr.org or at any AAA office. 
  Any and all proceedings to resolve Claims will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action.  If for any reason a Claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement. An arbitration decision may be confirmed by any court with competent jurisdiction. 
GENERAL 
  You agree that no joint venture, partnership, or employment relationship exists between you and us or our Group Members as a result of these Terms or your access to our Information. 
  You acknowledge that Travelscape, LLC or VacationSpot, SL (or any other Group Member as we designate) shall be treated by any tax authority in any pertinent jurisdiction as the supplier of the Hotel Reservation for Prepaid Bookings and Packages for VAT (Value Added Tax) purposes as applied by Directive 2006/112/EC.
  Our performance of these Terms are subject to existing laws and legal process, and nothing contained in these Terms limit our right to comply with law enforcement or other governmental or legal requests or requirements relating to your use of our Information or information provided to or gathered by us with respect to such use. 
  We may transfer our rights and obligations under these Terms to another organisation but this will not affect your rights or our obligations under these Terms. You may only transfer your rights or your obligations under these Terms to another person if we agree in writing. 
  To the extent allowed by applicable law, you agree that you will bring any claim or cause of action arising from or relating to your access or use of our Information within two (2) years from the date on which such claim or action arose or accrued or such claim or cause of action will be irrevocably waived. 
  If any part of these Terms is found to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions will not in any way be affected or impaired. Our failure or delay in enforcing any provision of these Terms at any time does not waive our right to enforce the same or any other provisions in the future.
  These Terms (and any other terms and conditions referenced herein) constitute the entire agreement between you and us with respect to our Information and any Bookings and it supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral, or written, between you and us with respect to our Information and/or Booking. A printed version of these Terms and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to these Terms to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. 
  Fictitious names of companies, products, people, characters, and/or data mentioned in our Information are not intended to represent any real individual, company, product, or event. 
Any rights not expressly granted herein are reserved.

International Article Number - Wikipedia






















 






International Article Number

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
  (Redirected from International Article Number (EAN))

					Jump to:					navigation, 					search





GTIN-13 number encoded in EAN-13 barcode. The first digit is always placed outside the symbol; additionally a right ">" indicator is used to indicate a "Quiet Zone" that is necessary for barcode scanners to work properly.


The International Article Number (also known as European Article Number or EAN) is a standard describing a barcode symbology and numbering system used in global trade to identify a specific retail product type, in a specific packaging configuration, from a specific manufacturer. The standard has been subsumed in the Global Trade Item Number standard from the GS1 organization; the same numbers can be referred to as GTINs and can be encoded in other barcode symbologies defined by GS1. EAN barcodes are used worldwide for lookup at retail point of sale, but can also be used as numbers for other purposes such as wholesale ordering or accounting.
The most commonly used EAN standard is the thirteen-digit EAN-13, a superset of the original 12-digit Universal Product Code (UPC-A) standard developed in 1970 by George J. Laurer.[1] An EAN-13 number includes a 3-digit GS1 prefix (indicating country of registration or special type of product). A prefix with a first digit of "0" indicates a 12-digit UPC-A code follows. A prefix with the first two digits of "45" or "49" indicates a Japanese Article Number (JAN) follows.
The less commonly used 8-digit EAN-8 barcode was introduced for use on small packages, where EAN-13 would be too large. 2-digit EAN-2 and 5-digit EAN-5 are supplemental barcodes, placed on the right-hand side of EAN-13 or UPC. These are generally used for periodicals like magazines[2] or books,[3] to indicate the current year's issue number; and weighed products like food, to indicate the manufacturer's suggested retail price.

Composition[edit]
The 13-digit EAN-13 number consists of four components:

GS1 Prefix - 3 digits
Manufacturer Code - variable length
Product Code - variable length
Check digit

GS1 prefix[edit]
Further information: List of GS1 country codes
The first three digits of the EAN-13 (GS1 Prefix) usually identify the GS1 Member Organization which the manufacturer has joined.(not necessarily where the product is actually made).[4] Note that EAN-13 codes beginning with 0 are actually 12-digit UPC codes with prepended 0 digit. In the last few years, more products sold by retailers outside United States and Canada have been using EAN-13 codes beginning with 0, since they were generated by GS1-US.
The 020-029 GS1 Prefixes are worth a special mention. GS1 defines this as being available for retailer internal use (or internal use by other types of business). Some retailers use this for proprietary (own brand or unbranded) products, although many retailers obtain their own manufacturer's code for their own brands. Other retailers use at least part of this prefix for products which are packaged in store, for example, items weighed and served over a counter for a customer. In these cases, the barcode may encode a price, quantity or weight along with a product identifier - in a retailer defined way. The product identifier may be one assigned by the Produce Electronic Identification Board (PEIB) or may be retailer assigned. Retailers who have historically used UPC barcodes tend to use GS1 prefixes starting with "02" for store-packaged products.[citation needed]
The EAN "country code" 978 (and later 979) has been allocated since the 1980s to reserve a Unique Country Code (UCC) prefix for EAN identifiers of published books, regardless of country of origin, so that the EAN space can catalog books by ISBNs[3] rather than maintaining a redundant parallel numbering system. This is informally known as "Bookland". The prefix 979 with first digit 0 is used for International Standard Music Number (ISMN) and the prefix 977 indicates International Standard Serial Number (ISSN).
Manufacturer code[edit]
The manufacturer code is a unique code assigned to each manufacturer by the numbering authority indicated by the GS1 Prefix. All products produced by a given company will use the same manufacturer code. EAN-13 uses what is called "variable-length manufacturer codes." Assigning fixed-length 5-digit manufacturer codes, as the UCC has done until recently, means that each manufacturer can have up to 99,999 product codes--and many manufacturers don't have that many products, which means hundreds or even thousands of potential product codes are being wasted on manufacturers that only have a few products. Thus if a potential manufacturer knows that it is only going to produce a few products, EAN-13 may issue it a longer manufacturer code, leaving less space for the product code. This results in more efficient use of the available manufacturer and product codes.[5]
In ISBN and ISSN, this component is used to identify the language in which the publication was issued and managed by a transnational agency covering several countries, or to identify the country where the legal deposits are made by a publisher registered with a national agency, and it is further subdivided any allocating subblocks for publishers; many countries have several prefixes allocated in the ISSN and ISBN registries.
Product code[edit]
The product code is assigned by the manufacturer. The product code immediately follows manufacturer code. The total length of manufacturer code plus product code should be 9 or 10 digits depending on the length of country code(2-3 digits).
In ISBN, ISMN and ISSN, it uniquely identifies the publication from the same publisher; it should be used and allocated by the registered publisher in order to avoid creating gaps; however it happens that a registered book or serial never gets published and sold.
Check digit[edit]
The check digit is an additional digit, used to verify that a barcode has been scanned correctly. It is computed modulo 10, where the weights in the checksum calculation alternate 3 and 1. In particular, since the weights are relatively prime to 10, the EAN-13 system will detect all single digit errors. It also recognizes 90% of transposition errors (all cases, where the difference between adjacent digits is not 5).
Calculation of checksum digit[edit]
The checksum is calculated as sum of products - taking an alternating weight value (3 or 1) times the value of each data digit. The checksum digit is the digit, which must be added to this checksum to get a number divisible by 10 (i.e. the additive inverse of the checksum, modulo 10).[6] See ISBN-13 check digit calculation for a more extensive description and algorithm. The Global Location Number(GLN) also uses the same method.
Position - weight[edit]
The weight at a specific position in the EAN code is alternating (3 or 1) in a way, that the final data digit has a weight of 3 (and thus the check digit has a weight of 1).
All Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) and Serial Shipping Container Code (SSCC) codes meet the next rule:
Numbering the positions from the right (code aligned to the right), the odd data digits are always weight of 3 and the even data digits are always weight of 1, regardless of the length of the code.

Binary encoding of data digits into EAN-13 barcode[edit]




Encoding EAN-13






Encoding L-digits






Encoding G-digits






Encoding R-digits


To encode the 13-digit EAN-13 number, the digits are split into 3 groups; the first digit, the first group of 6 and the last group of 6. The first group of 6 is encoded using a pattern whereby each digit has two possible encodings, one of which has even parity (denoted with letter G) and one of which has odd parity (denoted with letter L). The first digit is encoded indirectly, by selecting a pattern of choices between these two encodings for the first group of 6 digits, according to the table below. (Unlike the other digits, the first digit is not represented directly by a pattern of bars and spaces.) All digits in the last group of 6 digits are encoded using a single pattern RRRRRR, the one also used for UPC.
If the first digit is zero, all digits in the first group of 6 are encoded using the pattern LLLLLL used for UPC, therefore, an UPC barcode is also an EAN-13 barcode with the first digit set to zero.

Japanese Article Number[edit]
 Japanese Article Number (JAN) is a barcode standard compatible with the EAN. Use of the JAN standard began in 1978. Originally, JAN was issued a flag code (EAN's number system) of 49. In 1992, JAN was newly issued an additional flag code of 45. In January 2001 the manufacturer code changed to 7 digits (9 digits including the flag code) for new companies.[7]
How the 13-digit EAN-13 is encoded[edit]
The GTIN numbers, encoded to UPC-A, EAN-8 and EAN-13, all use similar encoding. The encoded information is repeated in plain text below the barcode.[8]
EAN-13 encoding[edit]
The 13-digit EAN-13 number can be divided into 3 groups: first digit, left group of 6 digits, right group of 6 digits.
The barcode consists of 95 equally spaced areas (also called modules). From left to right:

3 areas to encode the start marker.
42 (6*7) areas making up the left group of 6 digits. This can be further subdivided into 6 subgroups, each consisting of seven areas. The subgroups encode digits 2-7. Each of these encodings can have even or odd parity. The parities taken together, indirectly encode the first digit of EAN-13.
5 areas to encode the marker for the center of the barcode.
42 (6*7) areas making up the right group of 6 digits. This can be further subdivided into 6 subgroups, each consisting of seven areas. The subgroups encode digits 8-13. Digits 8-13 are all encoded with even parity. Digit 13 is the check digit.
3 areas to encode the end marker.

Each area can be black bar (1) or white space (0). A maximum of four black bar areas can be grouped together, these make up a wide black bar. Likewise a maximum of four white space areas can be grouped together, these make up a wide white space.
The start marker and the end marker are encoded as 101. The center marker is encoded as 01010.
Each digit in EAN-13 (except digit 1, which is not directly encoded) consists of seven areas. A decimal digit is encoded so that it consists of two (wide) bars and two (wide) spaces.
The digits in the left group are encoded so that they always start with a white space, and end with a black bar. The digits in the right group are encoded so that they always start with a black bar, and end with a white space.
Finally, the combination of variable-width black bars and white spaces encodes the EAN-13 number.
The encoding is described in the following table:

For each digit there are three similar encodings (left odd, left even, right): Left even and right are mirror-symmetrical to each other. Left odd is the bitwise inverse of right.
The first digit from the left group is always encoded with odd parity, and the last digit of the right group is always encoded with even parity. Thus, it does not matter whether the barcode is scanned from the left or from the right: the scanning software can determine what is the beginning and end of the barcode, with the help of the fact that the first digit should have odd parity and the last digit should have even parity.
EAN-13 barcode example[edit]




EAN-13 barcode. A green bar indicates the black bars and white spaces that encode a digit.



C1, C3:Start/end marker.
C2: Marker for the center of the barcode.
6 digits in the left group: 003994.
6 digits in the right group (the last digit is the check digit): 155486.
A digit is encoded in seven areas, by two black bars and two white spaces. Each black bar or white space can have a width between 1 and 4 areas.
Parity for the digits from left and right group: OEOOEE EEEEEE (O = Odd parity, E = Even parity).
The first digit in the EAN code: the combination of parities of the digits in the left group indirectly encodes the first digit 4.

The complete EAN-13 code is thus: 4 003994 155486.
Decoding[edit]




Scanning part of an EAN-13 barcode.


By using the barcode center marker, it is possible for a barcode scanner to scan just one half of the barcode at a time. This allows reconstruction of the code by means of a helical scan of the barcode by an angle of approximately 45 degrees.

Are UPC-A and EAN-13 the same?



											Posted by Phil Peretz 										

 · Tuesday,
January
3rd,
2012 
										







Before you buy a barcode, we have written this tutorial to help you understand the differences between UPC Barcodes and EAN Barcodes. Below are both an EAN barcode and a UPC Barcode. The EAN contains a 13 digit number and the UPC contains a 12 digit number.

EAN = 0012345678905
UPC = (0)012345678905 or 012345678905
The GS1, the original source for barcodes has created the confusion between UPC (Universal Product Codes) and EAN (European Article Numbers also called International Article Numbers). The UPC-A barcode was the original format for product barcodes. As demand in Europe, Asia and Australia started growing, country codes were added.  US and Canada have a a country code of zero which is not printed under the barcode nor is it entered in US and Canadian Inventory and Point of Sale Databases.
If you look at the graphics above, you will see they are exactly the same. The width of the bars and the width of the spaces between the bars are exactly the same. The only major difference is the placement of the numbers below (human readable numbers) which are there only as a back-up in case the barcode doesn’t scan properly and the information has to be manually entered into the point of sale system.

Taking this a step further, we have overlaid the UPC and the EAN graphics (symbologies) so you can see that the graphic is identical. The country code doesn’t appear beneath the barcode in a UPC since the GS1 didn’t grasp the importance of US  and Canada indicating country codes. They felt that since the majority of products sold in both countries originate from importers, distributors or manufacturers in the   US or Canada, they could forego the leading zero in the human readable numbers.
We still believe that if you are currently doing business in the United States and Canada exclusively, it is safer to order UPC barcodes for your products. Many retailers, especially smaller retailers may be using older accounting and inventory systems that only allow them to enter in 12 digit UPC numbers and not a 13 digit string. If this changes in the future, you can convert your 12 digit UPC to a 13 digit EAN by adding in the country code 0.  There is nothing on the horizon indicating that the US and Canada will ever switch over to EAN 13 barcodes.
This following information is used with permission from George Laurer– http://www.laurerupc.com . Mr. Laurer is the inventor of the UPC barcode.
There seems to be considerable confusion concerning the difference and use of the U.P.C. code and EAN codes
“U.P.C. Version A” and “EAN-13” are and always have been 13 character symbols and the numbers themselves have always been 13 characters long. The U.P.C. (Version A) symbol and the EAN13 symbol are essentially one and the same. They both have the same number of bars and spaces.
* I have used the name UCC throughout to avoid confusion although it evolved to this name over many years. In 1975 it was called UPCC (Uniform Product Code Council).
The origin of EAN vs. U.P.C. confusion.
When I conceived the U.P.C. for the grocers in the U.S. only 12 digits were required including the check character. I designed a symbol in which the left half of the symbol was composed of “odd” parity characters and the right side was composed of “even” parity characters. Each printed character has two bars and two spaces and is made up of 7 modules. Odd parity simply means the printed representation of the numeric digit has an odd number of dark modules. Conversely even parity printed digits have an even number of dark modules.
The UCC* chose to call the U.P.C. a 10 character symbol and they chose to print only 11 of the characters in human readable form. The 10 characters identifying the manufacturer and item were printed below the bars. The “system number” character was printed halfway up the left side. Further, they chose to carry only 10 digits of the number in their files. The reason was both political and practical.
Before the symbol marking was considered a well know consulting firm had been hired by the fledgling UCC to determine the number of digits needed to accomplish the goals of the grocery industry. Considering many factors, not the least of which was the limited power of computers of the day, a figure of 10 digits was recommended. It was a tough sell to convince the many groups involved that they would have to change whatever numbering system they were using to the new 10 digit number. Rather than admit that the consulting firm was wrong and so as not to open the number of digit argument again, the decision was to maintain that the U.P.C. was a 10 digit symbol and number. Another factor considered was that it was more difficult to key the EAN human readable that the U.P.C. human readable when the symbol did not scan. They fostered the illusion by requiring that the check digit be stripped at the scanner. The SN (system number) was necessary for in store processing but it was not needed in records transferred between systems. The illusion was reinforced by not printing the SN in line with the 10 product identifying digits and not printing the check digit at all.
After the U.P.C. had been in use several years, Europerecognized the usefulness of the U.P.C. but realized a 13th digit was needed to identify the many countries. I encoded the extra digit by encoding the left half of the symbol with 3 characters of even parity and 3 characters of odd parity and then arranging them in various patterns, each pattern representing a different country code. The scanner recognizes a series of digits as the right half of a symbol if the parity of the characters is all even and it recognizes the left half if it is composed of all odd OR if three characters are odd parity and three characters are even parity characters.
With the acceptance of the EAN in Europe it was understood that the U.P.C. was actually 13 digits because the parity pattern of the left half of all odd characters was assigned the value (or country flag) of “0”. I pointed out that the UCC only printed 11 of the 13 digits and carried only 10 digits in the system. The UCC continued the delusion by using the foolish argument that “0” means nothing and therefore could be ignored. On the other hand, the European’s were smart enough from the very outset to call the EAN symbol what it is, “EAN-13” and they printed all 13 characters. Systems in Europe carried all 10 country flags including 0 in their records and their systems could process both U.P.C. and EAN symbols and/or numbers. The  U.S. groceries chains at the time were selling very few foreign goods and saw no reason to spend money modify their installed equipment. Although the U.P.C. was not widely accepted at that time, the UCC accommodated the foreign companies by issuing them U.P.C. numbers with the invisible country flag of “0”.
Although this was a burden on the European companies and was a waste of numbers since many European companies had both U.P.C. and EAN-13 numbers, it wasn’t until two decades later that something was done about this. In 1997 the Uniform Code Council, Inc announced project SUNRISE. This initiative required that all U.S. and Canadian companies must be capable of scanning and processing EAN-13 symbols, in addition to U.P.C. symbols, at point-of-sale by January1, 2005. This has been completed, the UCC has changed its name to GS1 US, and they have taken the responsibility of controlling both U.P.C. and EAN numbers.
Simply put the U.P.C. and EAN-13 symbols and numbers are the same. Below is a U.P.C. symbol with its equivalent EAN-13 superimposed in red. One can see that the bars and space are the same, only the human readable is different. Note that the U.P.C. has evolved in that the check digit is now printed and also that the SN has been brought down in line with the other characters but the country flag is still not printed. I would expect that in the near future the human readable will also be changed to the EAN format.

Because there are more than 9 countries, the country flags have been further subdivided by using the next two digits for various uses and countries. The United  States and Canada have the country flag 0 and subdivisions 000 thru 139. It is interesting to note that the publishing industry produces so many products that it is its own country called “Bookland” for number assignment purposes. Bookland has been given two subdivisions of the country flag 9. They are 978 and 979.

A bit more definition would be helpful                                 Overall Rating:               Would Shop Here Again:               Likelihood To Recommend:   Full ratings for this review »                Paradigmpi                           Jul 27, 2017            I really like your inks - have used your brother inks for about 10 years and have found them EXCELLENT.

Jul 27, 2017  I did not realize how bad my first replacements were when I ordered a 2nd set. I now know they are not very good or my first order was ok. I really do not know. I learned a  lesson.
