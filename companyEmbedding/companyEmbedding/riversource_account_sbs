Variable annuities


Key Points

A variable annuity can provide income in retirement with potential for growth based on the markets
Many variable annuities offer a wide range of investment options
The funds in a variable annuity generally grow tax-deferred



A variable annuity is a retirement solution that can generate income for retirement. It can benefit from the potential growth in the financial markets and offers flexibility to manage your exposure to market risk.
A variable annuity is an insurance product that is a complex, long-term investment vehicle subject to market risk, including the potential loss of principal invested.




Why variable annuities?
Variable annuities are a tax-deferred, long-term investment that accumulates assets with the option of converting into an income stream you can depend on for as long as you live.
Variable annuities can help you achieve your retirement goals in several important ways:

Tax advantages. Annuities generally offer tax deferral, so you don’t pay taxes on any earnings until you actually begin to make withdrawals.
Investment options. Your variable annuity will perform according to the underlying investment options you select. Many variable annuities offer a wide range of investment options. For example, stocks and bonds.
Death benefits. A death benefit feature protects your investment for your beneficiaries. Optional benefits are typically available (for an additional fee) and can potentially increase the amount you leave to your heirs.
Liquidity. Although annuities are designed to be long-term investments, variable annuities allow partial access to your assets. Full asset access may be an option under certain circumstances, such as nursing home or hospital confinement and terminal illness.
Guaranteed income. When you are ready to start using the assets you have accumulated, annuities offer you a variety of guaranteed income options. All guarantees are subject to the claims-paying ability of the issuing company and do not apply to the performance of the variable subaccounts, which will vary with market conditions.

Annuities are intended for retirement investing; therefore withdrawals made from an annuity before age 59½ may be subject to a 10% IRS tax penalty.
If you use an annuity within a retirement plan that is already tax-deferred, such as an IRA, the annuity doesn’t provide any additional tax deferral.




Take the next step
Ameriprise Financial can help you plan for a more confident retirement with variable annuities available through third-party insurance carriers and our affiliates RiverSource Life Insurance Company (RiverSource Life), RiverSource Life Insurance Co. of New York (RiverSource Life of New York).

Be sure to talk to a financial advisor about the annuity’s features, benefits, risks and fees, and whether the annuity is appropriate for you, based on your financial situation and objectives.

Withdrawals that do not qualify for a waiver may be subject to a withdrawal charge. Withdrawals are subject to income taxes, and withdrawals before age 59½ may incur an IRS 10% early withdrawal penalty.
You should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the variable annuity and its underlying investment options carefully before investing. For a free copy of the annuity’s and underlying investment’s prospectus, which contains this and other information about variable annuities, call 1 (800) 437-4332. Read the prospectus carefully before you invest.
Before you purchase, be sure to ask your financial professional about the annuity’s features, benefits, risks and fees, and whether the annuity is appropriate for you, based on your financial situation and objectives. Variable annuities are complex investment vehicles that are subject to market risk, including the potential loss of principal invested. Annuities are long-term insurance products.
Most annuities have a tax-deferred feature. So do many retirement plans under the Internal Revenue code. As a result, when you use an annuity to fund a retirement plan that is tax-deferred, your annuity will not provide any necessary or additional deferral for that retirement plan. But annuities do have features other than tax deferral that may help you reach your retirement goals. You should consult your tax adviser prior to making a purchase for an explanation of the tax implications to you.
Policies and features may not be available in all states, or may vary by state.
The benefits of tax deferral may outweigh the costs of a variable annuity only if you hold it as a long-term investment.

This Principal Underwriter Agreement for Variable Annuities and Variable Life   
Insurance ("Agreement") is entered into by and between RiverSource Life         
Insurance Company ("RSLIC"), a Minnesota corporation, and RiverSource

Whereas, RSLIC maintains certain separate accounts named in Exhibit A to this   
Agreement as may be amended from time to time ("Separate Accounts");            

Whereas, the Separate Accounts were duly created and established by RSLIC or

Whereas, each Separate Account is registered as a unit investment trust under   
the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("1940 Act");                                

Whereas, the Separate Accounts serve as segregated investment accounts for

("Contracts") named in Exhibit A to this Agreement and issued by RSLIC and its  
Affiliated Insurers prior to December 31, 2006;

Act);                                                                           

Whereas, RSLIC desires to retain RDI to act as principal underwriter for the    
distribution and sale of the Contracts in order to satisfy the requirements of  
the federal securities laws, and such future and additional Contracts as may

Whereas, RDI is registered as a broker dealer under the 1934 Act and is a       
member of the National Association of Securities Dealers Inc. ("NASD");         

NOW, THEREFORE, In consideration of the mutual promises contained herein the    
parties agree as follows:                                                       

1.   REPRESENTATIONS OF RDI.                                                    

RDI represents and warrants that it is registered with the National   
  Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. ("NASD") and Securities Exchange
   Commission ("SEC") as a broker-dealer under the 1934 Act and is qualified
to do business in those jurisdictions where RSLIC is licensed and     
qualified to do business and the Contracts are offered. RDI represents
and warrants that it is and shall remain during the term of this      
Agreement in compliance with Section 9(a) of the 1940 Act.            

2.   APPOINTMENT OF PRINCIPAL UNDERWRITER.                                      

On the Effective Date of the Agreement, RSLIC appoints RDI and RDI

3.   SELLING AGREEMENTS.                                                        

 In order to accomplish the distribution of the Contracts and the Future
Contracts, RDI is authorized to enter into selling agreements,        
substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B ("Selling      
Agreements"), with other broker dealer firms that are registered under
the 1934 Act and are members of the NASD ("Selling Firms").           

RSLIC may refuse to appoint any Selling Firm, affiliated or networked 
  insurance agency of the Selling Firm and any affiliated person of any of
the foregoing entities as its agent under the insurance laws of the

     with these services. RSLIC will preserve and maintain these books

agent for RDI whose property they are and shall remain, and 
        acknowledges that such books and records are at all times subject to
      inspection by the SEC in accordance with Section 17(a) of the 1934

7.   COMPENSATION OF PRINCIPAL UNDERWRITER.

#ven

laws. Such methods shall be modified and adjusted by mutual agreement 
   where necessary or appropriate to reflect fairly and equitably the actual
incidence of expense incurred by RDI on behalf of RSLIC. The method of
   allocating costs hereunder and the payment thereof shall be determined in
the following manner:                                                 

(a)  The cost of services performed by RDI that are identifiable as   
     expenses incurred directly and exclusively for the benefit of the
RSLIC shall be charged to RSLIC.                            

 (b)  The cost of services performed by RDI that are not identifiable as
       expenses incurred directly and exclusively for the benefit of RSLIC
        shall be allocated and charged to RSLIC in conformity with customary
insurance accounting practices.                             

(c)  At the request of RSLIC, and at RDI's expense, RDI shall produce 
       records and provide access to enable RSLIC to verify that such cost
allocations are performed in accordance with the practices  
referenced above.                                           

   (d)  For services rendered under this Agreement, payment shall be made by
      RSLIC to RDI on a monthly basis within thirty (30) days of invoice
    or other notice. The parties agree that during the course of any
        given month RSLIC may make reasonable estimated payments for part or
      all of the monthly cost in which case such payment shall be offset
   against the actual amount otherwise due at the end of the month
       under this Agreement. The parties also agree that, at the option of
       RSLIC, RSLIC may reimburse RDI based upon RDI's good faith estimate
 of the monthly costs for some or all of the services provided
   hereunder, in which case there shall be a final adjustment made
   within thirty (30) days after completion of RDI's cost analysis
performed at least annually.                                

For purposes of allocating costs under this Agreement, RSLIC and RDI  
shall rely on their internal accounting and allocation system then in 
effect, that system currently being the Management Accounting and     
Reporting System ("MARS"), which utilizes a product factor methodology
for certain services and rate-volume formulas for other services, in  
order to ensure fair and reasonable allocations of income and expenses
  among affiliated entities. Allocation of such costs under this Agreement
  shall be accounted for by RDI in accordance with applicable requirements
of the Securities and Exchange Commission and by the NASD including   
guidance provided in Notice To Members 03-63.                         

8.   TERMINATION.                                                               

This Agreement may be terminated, without cause, by either party upon 
sixty (60) days prior written notice, without penalty; and may be     
terminated immediately, by either party for failure to perform        
  satisfactorily or other cause; and will be terminated immediately if RDI
ceases to be registered as a broker dealer under the 1934 Act and a   
 member of the NASD. This Agreement will also terminate immediately upon
assignment without the prior written consent of both parties.         

9.   GENERAL PROVISIONS.

      of RSLIC and RDI. In addition, no waiver of any default or failure
       of performance by either party will affect the other party's rights
with respect to a subsequent default or failure.            

(b)  Independent Contractor Relationship                              

   This Agreement does not create the relationship of employer and
     employee between the parties to this Agreement. RSLIC and RDI are
 independent contractors with respect to each other, and their
respective employees and agents.                            

(c)  Assignment

        It is understood and agreed by the parties that if any part, term or
    provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or in conflict
   with any law or regulation, the validity of the remaining part,
        terms or provisions will not be affected and the parties' rights and
       obligations will be construed and enforced as if this Agreement did
not contain the part, term or provision held to be invalid.

              your annuity will not provide any necessary or
additional tax deferral.

                deferral that may help you reach your retirement
                     goals. Fees charged by the Insurance Company (if any)

           extent that such alleged act or omission is

                    RiverSource directed the act or omission, or (2) the
                    act or omission by Authorized Selling Firm or any of

8.      ARBITRATION. The parties agree to attempt to settle any                 
   misunderstandings or disputes arising out of this Agreement through
 consultation and negotiation in good faith and a spirit of mutual
    cooperation. However, if those attempts fail, the parties agree that
     any misunderstandings or disputes arising from this Agreement will be
decided by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration 
   Association in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules and
Title 9 of the U.S. Code. Judgment on the award rendered by the 
    arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
  The number of arbitrators will be three (unless the parties to the
    dispute agree on a single arbitrator), one of whom will be appointed
by the Company or an affiliate, one of whom will be appointed by
  Authorized Selling Firm; and the third of whom will be selected by
     mutual agreement, if possible, within 30 days of the selection of the
    second arbitrator and thereafter by the administering authority. The
      Arbitration shall be held in the city of the Company's principal place
    of business. The arbitrators will strictly observe the limitation of
liability provisions set forth in Section

  to award punitive damages or any other damages not measured by the
      prevailing Party's actual damages, and may not, in any event, make any
ruling, finding or award that does not conform to the terms and 
      conditions of this Agreement. The parties agree that the arbitrator(s)
      will decide which party must bear the expenses of the Arbitration. Any
   Party may make an application to the arbitrators seeking injunctive
    relief to maintain the status quo until such time as the arbitration
award is rendered or the controversy is otherwise resolved. This
     agreement to arbitrate shall not preclude either party from obtaining
      provisional remedies such as injunctive relief or the appointment of a
      receiver from a court having jurisdiction, before, during or after the
    pendency of the arbitration. The institution and maintenance of such
    provisional remedies shall not constitute a waiver of the right of a
party to submit a dispute to arbitration.                       

9.      TERMINATION.

The information in this supplement updates and amends certain information
contained in your current variable annuity product prospectus. Please read it
carefully and keep it with your variable annuity contract product prospectus.


FOR CONTRACTS WITH ACCUMULATION PROTECTOR BENEFIT RIDER, IF WE RECEIVE YOUR
REQUEST FOR THE ELECTIVE STEP UP OR THE ELECTIVE SPOUSAL CONTINUATION STEP UP ON
OR AFTER APRIL 29, 2013, A FEE OF 1.75% WILL APPLY TO YOUR RIDER. YOU CAN
REQUEST THE ELECTIVE STEP UP ONLY ONCE PER CONTRACT YEAR, WITHIN THIRTY DAYS
FOLLOWING EACH CONTRACT ANNIVERSARY, BUT PRIOR TO THE BENEFIT DATE.


The following changes are made to the prospectus:


IN THE "OPTIONAL LIVING BENEFIT CHARGES -- ACCUMULATION PROTECTOR BENEFIT RIDER
FEE" SECTION OF THE PROSPECTUS, THE LAST THREE PARAGRAPHS ARE REPLACED WITH THE
FOLLOWING: We will not change the Accumulation Protector Benefit rider fee in
effect on your contract after the rider effective date unless:


(a)  you choose the annual elective step up or elective spousal
continuation step up after we have exercised our rights to increase
the rider fee; or


(b)  you change your Portfolio Navigator program (PN program) investment
option after we have exercised our rights to increase the rider fee or
vary the rider fee for each PN program investment option.


If you change your PN program investment option after we have exercised our
rights to increase the rider fee as described above, you will pay the fee that
is in effect on the valuation date we receive your written request to step up
or change your investment option. Currently, we waive our right to increase the
rider fee if you change your PN program investment option.


If we receive your request for the elective step up or the elective spousal
continuation step up on or after April 29, 2013, your rider fee will increase
to 1.75%. This charge will be based on the greater of your contract value or
the Minimum Contract Accumulation Value (MCAV) on your contract anniversary. We
will calculate an average rider fee, for that year only, that reflects the
various different fees that were in effect during the contract year, adjusted
for the number of calendar days each fee was in effect.


The fee does not apply after the annuitization start date.



THIS SUPPLEMENT SHOULD BE READ AND RETAINED FOR FUTURE REFERENCE.

Item 27. Number of Contract owners



As of Dec. 31, 2012 there were 24,129 nonqualified contracts and
36,503 qualified contract owners.






Item 28. Indemnification



The amended By-Laws of the depositor provide that the depositor will indemnify,
to the fullest extent now or hereafter provided for or permitted by law, each
person involved in, or made or threatened to be made a party to, any action,
suit, claim or proceeding, whether civil or criminal, including any
investigative, administrative, legislative, or other proceeding, and including
any action by or in the right of the depositor or any other corporation, or any
partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan, or other enterprise
(any such entity, other than the depositor, being hereinafter referred to as an
"Enterprise"), and including appeals therein (any such action or process being
hereinafter referred to as a "Proceeding"), by reason of the fact that such
person, such person's testator or intestate (i) is or was a director or officer
of the depositor, or (ii) is or was serving, at the request of the depositor, as
a director, officer, or in any other capacity, or any other Enterprise, against
any and all judgments, amounts paid in settlement, and expenses, including
attorney's fees, actually and reasonably incurred as a result of or in
connection with any Proceeding, except as provided below.


No indemnification will be made to or on behalf of any such person if a judgment
or other final adjudication adverse to such person establishes that such
person's acts were committed in bad faith or were the result of active and
deliberate dishonesty and were material to the cause of action so adjudicated,
or that such person personally gained in fact a financial profit or other
advantage to which such person was not legally entitled. In addition, no
indemnification will be made with respect to any Proceeding initiated by any
such person against the depositor, or a director or officer of the depositor,
other than to enforce the terms of this indemnification provision, unless such
Proceeding was authorized by the Board of Directors of the depositor. Further,
no indemnification will be made with respect to any settlement or compromise of
any Proceeding unless and until the depositor has consented to such settlement
or compromise.





The depositor may, from time to time, with the approval of the Board of
Directors, and to the extent authorized, grant rights to indemnification, and to
the advancement of expenses, to any employee or agent of the depositor or to any
person serving at the request of the depositor as a director or officer, or in
any other capacity, of any other Enterprise, to the fullest extent of the
provisions with respect to the indemnification and advancement of expenses of
directors and officers of the depositor.


There are agreements in place under which the underwriter and affiliated persons
of the depositor or registrant may be indemnified against liabilities arising
out of acts or omissions in connection with the offer of the contracts; provided
however, that no such indemnity will be made to the underwriter or affiliated
persons of the depositor or registrant for liabilities to which they would
otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross
negligence.


Insofar as indemnification for liability arising under the Securities Act of
1933 (the "Act") may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons
of the depositor or the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or
otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities
and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as
expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim
for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the
registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling
person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or
proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in
connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in
the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent,
submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such
indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will
be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

Post-Effective Amendment No. 18
File Nos.:  333-139763/811-07195


Ladies and Gentlemen:


I am familiar with the establishment of the RiverSource Variable Annuity
Account ("Account"), which is a separate account of RiverSource Life Insurance
Company ("Company") established by the Company's Board of Directors according to
applicable insurance law. I also am familiar with the above-referenced
Registration Statement filed by the Company on behalf of the Account with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.


I have made such examination of law and examined such documents and records as
in my judgment are necessary and appropriate to enable me to give the following
opinion:


1.    The Company is duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing
under applicable state law and is duly licensed or qualified to do
business in each jurisdiction where it transacts business. The Company has
all corporate powers required to carry on its business and to issue the
contracts.


2.    The Account is a validly created and existing separate account of the
Company and is duly authorized to issue the securities registered.


3.    The contracts issued by the Company, when offered and sold in accordance
with the prospectuses contained in the Registration Statement and in
compliance with applicable law, will be legally issued and represent
binding obligations of the Company in accordance with their terms.


I hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Registration
Statement.


Sincerely,






/s/ Dixie Carroll
