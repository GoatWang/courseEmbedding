About






My interest in technology led me to a degree in informatics where I quickly developed an appreciation for business and economics.  I soon developed a great affinity for international teams and projects which took me to China at the pinnacle of their economic rise.  In China my business side flourished where I found myself involved in international business while always able to improve the projects by the implementation of technology into the company.  
Technology implementation in the work environment always came as a solution to a business problem I was faced with such as the need for collaboration, data exchange, document records, and accountability measures to be handled internationally across a twelve-hour time difference.  It was obvious a handful of mainstream applications to handle all of this was getting too cumbersome and communication was breaking down due to the time difference; my solution was an online program that acted as a secure data warehouse with message boards, file activity monitoring, team calendar, and many other features.  This quickly solved the issues that created a bottleneck for our team efficiency and drastically reduced the user errors on workflow processing.
The business world also provided me with many great challenges and exciting opportunities.  I have worked with European luxury brands helping them plan their market entrances in China, one of the world’s top luxury consumers, developed structures in excess of 24.5 million USD for foreign direct investments which has directly led to large job creation numbers in America, and even played an advisory role for projects through the American Chamber of Commerce – Beijing and the Indiana Economic Development Corporation – Beijing.  
Currently I am working at The OCC, the world's largest central clearing counterparty for derivatives.  In my time at The OCC, I have successfully launched a stock loan exchange, an options exchange, a futures exchange, and in the process of launching a second futures exchange.  In addition to launching new exchanges, I also have personally handled the onboarding for clearing of scores of new derivatives products from a variety of different asset classes.  
                                                    In my next career stage, I seek a competitive role in the business technology industry with a high energy team that has a diverse background and global mindset.
