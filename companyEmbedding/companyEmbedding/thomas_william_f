William F. Thomas - Wikipedia





















 






William F. Thomas

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

William F. Thomas (June 11, 1924 – February 23, 2014) was an American newspaper editor, notably as chief editor of the Los Angeles Times from 1971 to 1989. Thomas was born in 1924 in Michigan.[1] During the middle of the 1950s, Thomas graduated at the Northwestern University, and embarked on a new career. After graduation, he shortly worked for several newspapers before joining the Los Angeles Times in 1957. He was promoted to assistant city editor in 1962 and soon after became metropolitan editor in 1965. He resigned shy of his 65th birthday. By his retirement in 1989, he managed to grab over 1 million subscribers.[2]
Personal life[edit]
His wife, Pat, died in 2000, after 52 years of marriage. Thomas left behind three sons and one granddaughter. During his journalism career, he had won 11 Pulitzers.[3]

New Booth, Product and Shows


Our booth has evolved over the past twelve years that we have done art festivals.  We thought we would fine tune it again for the 2016 season.   At this past weekend's art festival in Fort Myers, Florida, ArtFest, we did the unveiling of our new booth.   It was the first show of the 2016 season and this was our first time at ArtFest.  ArtFest Fort Myers is Southwest Florida’s premier art festival and largest weekend event. Art lovers and collectors wait all year to join forces along the downtown riverfront and enjoy and purchase the incredible works of 215 fabulous professional artists from across the country. Their year-round professional staff with 16 years of consistent management work all year to produce this two-day, free to the public, community event that attracts over 85,000 art patrons, and focuses on providing an unparalleled art experience to their tri-county residents and winter visitors. Congratulations to Tom as he won an Award of Distinction at this show!  


With a new year and a new art festival comes new product to the 2016 Collection.  One of our new products unveiled this past weekend is a music stand.  The harmonious design and expert craftsmanship of this handcrafted music stand highlight the natural beauty of its walnut wood. Solid wood construction in a pleasant and functional shape.  This piece would add harmony to any room when not practicing. The pin system and swinging holder, make it easy to play standing or sitting down. Handcrafted, solid wood construction ensure that the piece is as well-built as it is beautiful. Two-coat lacquer finish.


With a new booth, new product comes new shows.  Our next show is this coming weekend in Jupiter, Florida.  Celebrating 31 years, ArtiGras Fine Arts Festival has grown from a small, local art show to a nationally recognized fine arts festival attracting more than 85,000 art lovers and collectors. ArtiGras will be held President’s Day Weekend, February 13-15, 2016 at Abacoa Town Center in Jupiter, Florida. Produced by the Northern Palm Beach Chamber of Commerce, ArtiGras was recently named one of the top 50 fine art festivals in the country and features 300 juried artists along with artist demonstrations, Youth Art Competition, ArtiKids children’s interactive activity area, entertainment and more.  Our booth number at this show is #187.  Hope to see you there.
