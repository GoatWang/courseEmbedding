Digital lending platform FlexiLoans.Com today said it has acquired Mumbai-based supply chain financing platform, CreditPeriod.Com for an undisclosed sum to strengthen its supply chain financing vertical.	CreditPeriod.Com enables SME buyers to procure goods and services on credit while ensuring the sellers get their money upfront.
