Hilarie Koplow-McAdams – Accompani Advisor and Chief Revenue Officer at New Relic – just marked a milestone in the company’s journey with an IPO on Friday. We are thrilled to congratulate our incredible advisor on her critical part in the journey!
New Relic is a Software Analytics company that makes sense of over 690 billion metrics collected daily across millions of apps. Learn more about the company’s post-IPO plans from a recent interview with New Relic CEO Lew Cirne:

On IPO day, New Relic CEO Lew Cirne eyes the future of analytics
Software-analyzing specialist New Relic is now a publicly traded company. The startup’s shares are priced at $33.43 as of 9 AM PST, which is a bump from yesterday’s set price of $23 a share.
While the boost in the share price is significant, New Relic CEO Lew Cirne (pictured above) said he’s been trying hard not to set any sort of expectations for the short term, and instead is focussed on continuing to build value in what the company already has.
“What happened today is one of thousands of days in the future,” said Cirne.
Now that New Relic is publicly traded, Cirne believes that it can land some more enterprise customers — a roster that already includes GE, Adobe and Salesforce — who might be swayed with the new recognition the IPO brings.
“Honestly, we think we are ready and there’s a huge opportunity for software analytics,” said Cirne. “In 2015, there will be more software delivered than ever before.”

New Relic Promotes Hilarie Koplow-McAdams to President
President and COO Chris Cook to Depart Following End of Calendar Year



SAN FRANCISCO — October 1, 2015 — Software analytics company New Relic, Inc. (NYSE: NEWR) announced that current Chief Revenue Officer Hilarie Koplow-McAdams has been promoted to the role of President. In this expanded role, she is responsible for managing the company’s full go-to-market strategy and continues to report directly to CEO and Founder Lew Cirne. 
“This is an extremely well-deserved promotion for Hilarie. Since joining New Relic from Salesforce nearly two years ago, she has proven to be a remarkable leader, delivering continued success across the board,” said Cirne. “In her new role, she will lead our unified go-to-market organization, with the goal of further accelerating our mission of helping organizations build the best modern software possible.”
The company also announced that after more than four years in the role of President and Chief Operating Officer, Chris Cook, is resigning so that he may pursue opportunities in a CEO role. During his tenure, Cook was responsible for managing New Relic’s day-to-day business operations, and helped to build and scale the company across all aspects of the business, including multiple product lines and geographies. He plans to stay with New Relic as Chief Operating Officer until January 2016 to ensure a smooth leadership transition.  
“I want to express my gratitude to Chris for being a true partner to me in scaling New Relic from the ground up,” added Cirne. “And, I’m incredibly proud of him for pursuing his long-held objective of leading a high growth company as CEO. I trust that he will, no doubt, be incredibly successful in his future endeavors.”  
Cirne will now have three direct reports, each responsible for leading the company’s core, interdependent functional teams:
Chief Product Officer Jim Gochee remains responsible for the product and engineering organizations, as announced in August.  As President, Hilarie Koplow-McAdams is now responsible for a unified go-to-market organization, including business development, customer success, sales, and technical services and support. She adds the marketing organization under her leadership. Chief Financial Officer Mark Sachleben is responsible for the entire G&A organization, adding people operations, IT, facilities, and business enablement under his leadership.
