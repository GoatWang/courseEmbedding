They are always available and glad to help me, even if I call on a Saturday night (which I have done a few times).I exchange ideas with Chris from AdFicient about SEO (search engine optimization), Google Analytics, and pay per click strategies. He has provided thorough and insightful advice which has produced profitable results. I have recommended him to my clients (and will continue to do so) because their rates are fair and my clients always see ROI results many times more than what they pay.My experiences with AdFicient have always been pleasant. The best part is that I can tell that they truly care about me and the success of my website design business and my clients’ businesses. They continue to surpass my ever-rising expectations and have gone above and beyond their obligations (like suggesting creative ways for my business to attract additional clientele).The simple truth is that the people at AdFicient are terrific. I highly recommend them.Adficient.comallservice ratedWe have a very small business ...We have a very small business that relies on Google AdWords for our main form of advertising.  Our account was suspended and I was not able to contact a live person at Google to help me.  I was becoming very desperate as our business had come to a complete halt.  I reached out to Chris at AdFicient and I am glad I did.  He contacted Google, found out what the problem was, and worked with me throughout the process to get our account reinstated.  Thank you, Chris!Adficient.comaction63 ratedThis company helped my company...This company helped my company out from a net marketing disaster. They did it quickly and effectively. I am pleased and thankful for there help. Customer for life here!
