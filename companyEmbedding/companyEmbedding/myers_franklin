Ingredient Glossary
 
We are proud of the ingredients in our products and list them on every label, as well as share additional information below. Our products are specifically formulated to be safe for use in and around the home with family, children and pets. We work hard to ensure our products have the very best combination of ingredients—combinations that not only work hard on your daily dirt and grime, but that fill your home with garden-inspired scents.
We make intelligent, responsible raw material choices, and whenever possible, obtain materials from renewable plant resources such as coconut, corn, soy or olive. At times we choose not to use a plant-derived material for reasons of efficacy, consistency and safety.
Our products do not contain ammonia, chlorine, glycol solvents, parabens, phthalates, formaldehyde, artificial colorants, phosphates or petroleum distillates.
We do not test our products on animals, nor are our products made with animal-derived ingredients.
Our packaging is recyclable and we use at least 25% post-consumer plastic in our bottles.
We manufacture according to exacting personal care standards in a cosmetic-grade cGMP facility. cGMP is an abbreviation for the term "current Good Manufacturing Practice", which refers to FDA regulations regarding the manufacturing, testing, and quality control of pharmaceutical and food products.
All suppliers of Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day ingredients derived from Palm Oil are members of RSPO (Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil). Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day supports sustainable practices of eco-sensitive areas throughout Asia, Africa and South America like the Brazilian rain forests.

A better way to clean
inspired by a mother of nine.





How We Began
Learn what sparked the creation of ourhard-working, nice smelling product line.

Our products were inspired by Mrs. Thelma A. Meyer, an Iowa homemaker and mother of nine. It all started when one of her daughters was walking down a cleaning aisle, eyeing all the products with their harsh, stinky chemicals. Right then and there, she had an idea: "Let's make cleaners that smell nice, like my mom's garden, but still work like the dickens on daily dirt and grime."




WHAT WE MAKE
Find out how and why our products smell like a garden, yet clean like the dickens.

For generations we've had to put up with harsh chemical smells to get a good clean. Enter Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day. A collection of household products made with essential oils from flowers and herbs that smell nice, but really pack a punch against daily dirt and grime. Our garden fresh scents include Lavender, Lemon Verbena, Basil, Geranium and many others.






"I wouldn't put my name on something that didn't work hard and smell great. No reason to ruin my reputation this late in the game."

We put a lot of work into our products so it's less work for our consumers.

Story Company is investing in a giant crane. It is expected to cost $6.0 million in initial investment, and it is expected to generate an end-of-year after-tax cash flow of $3.0 million each year for three years. Calculate the NPV at 12%. 
 





A. 


$2.4 million








B.


$1.2 million








C. 


$0.80 million








D. 


$0.20 million




NPV(millions) = -6.0 + 3/1.12 + 3/(1.12^2) + 3/(1.12^3) = 1.2.

Dry-Sand Company is considering investing in a new project. The project will need an initial investment of $1,200,000 and will generate $600,000 (after-tax) cash flows for three years. However, at the end of the fourth year, the project will generate -$500,000 of after-tax cash flow due to dismantling costs. Calculate the MIRR (modified internal rate of return) for the project if the cost of capital is 15%. 
 





A.


8.1%








B. 


12.6%








C. 


28.2%








D. 


20.4%




To eliminate the second sign change, combine year 3 and year 4 cash flows: PV3 = + 600 – 500/1.15 = 165.22;
-1,200 + 600/(1 + MIRR) + 600/(1 + MIRR)^2 + 165.22/(1 + MIRR)^3 = 0;
MIRR = 8.1%.
In Excel: Arrange cash flows in order starting with -1,200 in cell A1; 600 in cells A2 through A3; and 165.22 in cell A4; then “= IRR(A1:A4)”.

Mass Company is investing in a giant crane. It is expected to cost $6.0 million in initial investment, and it is expected to generate an end-of-year cash flow of $3.0 million each year for three years. At the end of the fourth year, there will be a $1.0 million disposal cost. Calculate the MIRR for the project if the cost of capital is 12%. 
 





A.


17.8%








B. 


15.3%








C. 


23.8%








D. 


22.1%




To eliminate the second sign change, combine year 3 and year 4 cash flows: PV3 = +3 – 1/1.12 = 2.11.
-6 + 3/(1 + MIRR) + 3/(1+MIRR)^2 + 2.11/(1+MIRR)^3 = 0;
MIRR = 17.8%.
In Excel: Arrange cash flows in order starting with -6 in cell A1; 3 in cells A2 through A3; and 2.11 in cell A4; then “= IRR(A1:A4)”.

A. 


$5,000








B. 


$2,352








C. 


$3,201








D.


$1,857




NPV = -3000 + (500/1.15) + (1500/1.15^2) + (5000/1.15^3) = 1857.

How does modified internal rate of return (MIRR) differ from IRR? 
 





A. 


MIRR does not consider cash flows occurring after the cutoff date.








B. 


MIRR uses NPV. IRR does not.








C. 


MIRR calculates the PV of cash inflows and then divides by the PV of the investment.

Essay Questions





67.


Briefly explain the value additivity property. 
 

For example, the net present value (NPV) of a combined project—say A and B—-is equal to the NPV(A) plus the NPV(B). Naturally, this property holds for present values also. This property is not shared by IRR. The IRR of a combined project does not equal the sum of the individual IRRs. The value additivity property is very useful when making comparative decisions among numerous projects.








Type: Medium









68.


Discuss some of the advantages of using the payback method. 
 

It tells you how quickly you can recover your investment. The main advantage is that it is easy to calculate and use.








Type: Easy









69.


Discuss some of the disadvantages of the payback rule. 
 

The disadvantages are that it does not take the time value of money into account and also does not consider any cash flows beyond the cutoff point.








Type: Easy









70.


What are some of the disadvantages of using the IRR method? 
 

There are several disadvantages to the IRR method. It is not useful in evaluating mutually exclusive projects and dependent projects. You can also get multiple IRRS for projects having cash flows with more than one change in sign. Also, IRR cannot distinguish between borrowing and lending projects. In most cases it may be easier to use the NPV method.








Type: Difficult









71.


What are some of the advantages of using the IRR method? 
 

The main advantage of IRR is that it is easy to communicate. Financial managers tend to think in terms of percentages and find rates of return intuitively easy to grasp.








Type: Medium









72.


Briefly discuss capital rationing. 
 

There are two types of capital rationing; soft rationing imposed by the company and hard rationing imposed by the capital markets. Capital rationing may result in the firm forgoing some positive NPV projects, thereby reducing a firm’s value.








Type: Medium









73.


Briefly explain the term soft rationing. 
 

Management uses soft rationing to get better financial control over investment decisions. Soft rationing is imposed by management and not by capital markets. Soft rationing is an upper-management technique often used to restrain overoptimistic capital spending requests by midlevel managers.








Type: Medium









74.


Briefly explain the term hard rationing. 
 

A firm faces hard rationing when it cannot raise more funding from capital markets. Hard rationing also indicates the existence of market imperfections. Market imperfections do not invalidate the NPV rule as long as the shareholders of the firm have access to well-functioning capital markets so that their portfolio choices are not restricted. The NPV rule is undermined when imperfections restrict shareholders’ portfolio choices. Generally, hard rationing is rare for large corporations in the U.S.








Type: Medium









75.


When calculating a weighted average profitability index, should you apply an index of zero to leftover money? 
 

The NPV of money that is not invested is zero. If the NPV is zero the profitability index is zero. Thus, the math leads to a PI of zero for leftover money. Additionally, one cannot assume that money not invested will create value.

Book Review
I have to say for the money I've save buying this book vs buying one from the book store was over $100. I say buy the book, if you are into the reading, but don't care about the example and numbers. It's all in other language other than English.

Principles of Corporate Finance
This book is about the basic concepts and methods of corporate finance. Written in a language which can be understood by everyone, it is a very helpful book to understand the world of corporations that surrounds us. Clearly a must read for any student but also very useful to job training and still a reference for practicing financial managers. I strongly recommend it to anyone who is willing to build a sound basic knowledge of corporate finance.

A book is the nearest thing we have to telepathy, sending thoughts from the author's mind directly to the readers even over a gap of two thousand years. Even with all our technology, there is no better way to make a brain to brain connection than by simply reading a book. Go Way Back to the BeginningAntique books and manuscripts offer an amazing look into history, you can see the thoughts of the past as they saw them themselves. Antiquarian and collectible books don't just look good on the shelf, they also grow in value. There is nothing like picking up an old book to really feel the past. Explore the Human ConditionThe beauty of fiction and literature is that it lets you explore the human condition in a way that mere recitations of fact can never duplicate. Rather than focusing on the mundane, these books bring out the emotional truth of human experience. They show you who you really are by exposing you to other experiences you could never have discovered yourself. These books are the underpinnings of human culture. See how someone else sees the world. Discover the World Around YouNon fiction books offer the widest range of human experience, joined only by their commitment to the truth. From self-help to space travel, they run the gamut of human thought. Learn how to deal with your family, how to save money for that trip, or how the Egyptians built the pyramids. Follow famous lives, or study esoteric philosophies. It's all there for you to find. Non fiction gives us the foundations of human civilization, the story of how everything works. Keep Learning for LifeEducation is the gateway to success, and textbooks are your key to that door. From elementary readers to calculus texts, these books are the doors to our full potential. Textbooks not only give us facts, they give us the tools to interpret and make use of those facts. They are the key to organizing our thoughts and making our brains work for us. It's not just academia either, mechanics textbooks can help you learn how to fix your car.Tell us what you think - opens in new window or tabSide Refine PanelShop by CategoryAntique Books and ManuscriptsAudiobooksBook & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsSee all in Book & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsBook Wholesale LotsOther Book & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsWholesale AudiobooksWholesale MagazinesBook AccessoriesSee all in Book AccessoriesAddress BooksBlank Diaries & JournalsBook CoversBook LightsBook PlatesBook Stands & HoldersBookendsBookmarksOther Book AccessoriesCatalogsSee all in CatalogsAgriculture CatalogsArt & Exhibitions CatalogsAuction CatalogsClothing & Fashion CatalogsDepartment Stores CatalogsMusic & Instruments CatalogsOther CatalogsOwner's Manuals CatalogsToys & Hobbies CatalogsChildren & Young Adult BooksSee all in Children & Young Adult BooksChildren & YA Non-Fiction BooksChildren's Fiction BooksChildren's Picture BooksOther Children & Young Adult BooksYoung Adult Fiction BooksCookbooksFiction & Literature BooksMagazine Back IssuesNonfiction BooksOther BooksTextbooks & Educational Books

One reason is simple, while the Internet may be everywhere, it's not always accurate, and when it comes to educating people you need to have accurate information. That's why approved textbooks are so important; they give you the facts, not the opinions of someone on the Internet.Help for the Home SchooledNo one needs textbooks more than the parent who home schools their children. There is a growing movement toward home schooling so that parents can focus their children's education on the aspects Engl are most important to them, and tailor the curriculum to their own child's individual learning styles. From science and mathematics to English and history, textbooks are a vital part of any education program.For Every Age LevelNo matter what age or grade level your student is at, there are education textbooks to cover their needs.  Even if they go to a regular grade school, there are supplementary textbooks you can pick up to help them if they need it. Not every book is the right fit for every student, and sometimes the one who is having the most trouble with math in school is the one who flourishes the most as soon as you expose them to a different textbook.Explore Adult EducationEducation isn't just for children; many adults have a need for textbooks too. From those who left school early and are now looking for textbooks so they can get their GED, to professionals looking to further their development, there's a huge demand for textbooks from people in all walks of life. It's not just academic textbooks. You can also get textbooks on practical subjects from financial management, to woodworking, and auto repair.Control Your College EducationCollege is more than just an investment in your future; it's an investment. One way to take charge of your college costs is to look outside your college bookstore for your textbooks. Many textbooks, especially in fields such as English and history do not change much from year to year, so grabbing last  year's engineering handbook may be the best way to go.Tell us what you think - opens in new window or tabSide Refine PanelShop by CategoryBooksTextbooks & Educational BooksBook AccessoriesAntique Books and ManuscriptsAudiobooksCatalogsChildren & Young Adult BooksCookbooksFiction & Literature BooksMagazine Back IssuesNonfiction BooksBook & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsOther BooksFormatsee allHardcoverMixed LotPaperbackNot SpecifiedPublication Yearsee all1900-19491950-19992000-20102011-NowSubjectsee allBusiness & EconomicsEducation, TeachingEngineeringHistoryMathMedicineScience & TechLanguagesee allConditionsee allBrand NewLike NewVery GoodGoodAcceptableNot SpecifiedPricePlease provide a valid price range$-$Buying Formatsee allAll ListingsAuctionBuy It NowItem Locationsee allDefaultWithindistance2 miles5 miles10 miles15 miles20 miles50 miles75 miles100 miles150 miles200 miles500 miles750 miles1000 miles1500 miles2000 milesofGoUS OnlyNorth AmericaWorldwideDelivery Optionssee allFree ShippingFree In-store PickupShow onlysee allReturns AcceptedCompleted ItemsSold ItemsDeals & SavingsMore refinements...

Ingredient Glossary
 
We are proud of the ingredients in our products and list them on every label, as well as share additional information below. Our products are specifically formulated to be safe for use in and around the home with family, children and pets. We work hard to ensure our products have the very best combination of ingredients—combinations that not only work hard on your daily dirt and grime, but that fill your home with garden-inspired scents.
We make intelligent, responsible raw material choices, and whenever possible, obtain materials from renewable plant resources such as coconut, corn, soy or olive. At times we choose not to use a plant-derived material for reasons of efficacy, consistency and safety.
Our products do not contain ammonia, chlorine, glycol solvents, parabens, phthalates, formaldehyde, artificial colorants, phosphates or petroleum distillates.
We do not test our products on animals, nor are our products made with animal-derived ingredients.
Our packaging is recyclable and we use at least 25% post-consumer plastic in our bottles.
We manufacture according to exacting personal care standards in a cosmetic-grade cGMP facility. cGMP is an abbreviation for the term "current Good Manufacturing Practice", which refers to FDA regulations regarding the manufacturing, testing, and quality control of pharmaceutical and food products.
All suppliers of Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day ingredients derived from Palm Oil are members of RSPO (Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil). Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day supports sustainable practices of eco-sensitive areas throughout Asia, Africa and South America like the Brazilian rain forests.

A better way to clean
inspired by a mother of nine.





How We Began
Learn what sparked the creation of ourhard-working, nice smelling product line.

Our products were inspired by Mrs. Thelma A. Meyer, an Iowa homemaker and mother of nine. It all started when one of her daughters was walking down a cleaning aisle, eyeing all the products with their harsh, stinky chemicals. Right then and there, she had an idea: "Let's make cleaners that smell nice, like my mom's garden, but still work like the dickens on daily dirt and grime."




WHAT WE MAKE
Find out how and why our products smell like a garden, yet clean like the dickens.

For generations we've had to put up with harsh chemical smells to get a good clean. Enter Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day. A collection of household products made with essential oils from flowers and herbs that smell nice, but really pack a punch against daily dirt and grime. Our garden fresh scents include Lavender, Lemon Verbena, Basil, Geranium and many others.






"I wouldn't put my name on something that didn't work hard and smell great. No reason to ruin my reputation this late in the game."

We put a lot of work into our products so it's less work for our consumers.
