Early life[edit]
Schulman was born in Newark, New Jersey, but grew up in Princeton, New Jersey. He was captain of the tennis and lacrosse teams at Princeton High School, and went on to receive a bachelor's degree in Economics from Middlebury College, and an MBA from New York University.[3][4]
His mother, S. Ruth Schulman, was associate dean of Rutgers' Graduate School of Applied and Professional Psychology (GSAPP) from 1974 to 1999. His father, the late Mel Schulman, was a chemical engineer.[5]
Schulman once told the New York Times, "I was born with social activism in my DNA. My grandfather was a union organizer in the garment district in New York City. My mother took me to a civil rights demonstration in Washington in my stroller."[6]
Business background[edit]
Schulman began his business career at AT&T, working more than 18 years there and becoming the youngest member of the company's senior executive team, the AT&T Operations Group.[7] When Schulman left AT&T, he was president of the $22 billion core consumer long distance business.
He then became president and COO, and then CEO of Priceline.com. During his two years there, Priceline's annual revenues grew from a reported $20 million to about $1 billion.[7]
In 2001, Schulman became the CEO of Virgin Mobile USA, Inc., and led the company from its national launch in 2002 to its becoming a public company in 2007, to its sale to Sprint Nextel in 2009.[1] By the time Schulman left Virgin Mobile, it had become one of the nation's top wireless carriers, with more than 5 million customers and $1.3 billion in annual sales. Following the sale of Virgin Mobile to Sprint Nextel, Schulman served as President of Sprint's Prepaid group until he moved to American Express.
On 30 September 2014 it was announced that Schulman would become CEO of PayPal, which will continue as a separate legal entity, split from eBay in the second half of 2015.[8]
Board service[edit]
Schulman became chairman of Symantec (SYMC-NASDAQ),[9] in January 2013;[10] and is a member of the Board of Directors of Flextronics (FLEX-NASDAQ).[11] Schulman also serves on the advisory committee of Greycroft Partners, a private equity company focused on early-stage new media and technology companies.[12]
Schulman is on the Board of Governors of Rutgers,[13] the state university of New Jersey. He is on the board of Teach for America.[14] He also serves on the board at Autism Speaks, an advocacy group dedicated to advancing research into causes and treatments for individuals on the autism spectrum.[15]
Political stance[edit]
The Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act that mandates people in public facilities use bathrooms in accordance to their gender at birth was denounced by Dan Schulman.[16][17] He stated that "The new law perpetuates discrimination and it violates the values and principles that are at the core of PayPal's mission and culture."[16][17] Schulman also cosigned an opposition letter with about 120 executives from major corporations.[18] In protest to the new law in North Carolina, Dan Schulman informed that the company is canceling its expansion to hire 400 people in the state.[18][19]
Dan Schulman wrote in the PayPal statement that; "While we will seek an alternative location for our operations center, we remain committed to working with the LGBT community in North Carolina to overturn this discriminatory legislation, alongside all those who are committed to equality."[16]
Awards[edit]
Schulman was named by Business Week as one of the top 20 people to watch in media,[20] and was named the Ernst & Young 2009 Entrepreneur Of The Year.[21] In 2009 he was named one of the top 25 most powerful people in the global wireless industry.[22]
Personal[edit]
When he was CEO of Virgin Mobile, Schulman led a partnership with StandUp For Kids, a nonprofit that distributes survival kits and a hotline number to homeless youth. To get a truer sense of what homeless kids experience, Schulman once spent 24 hours on the streets of New York City, unshaven, wrapped in a blanket, and without money, a watch, or a cell phone. "There's a certain amount of deference paid to a C.E.O.," he later said. "No one paid attention to me on the street. I consider myself a good communicator and a good salesman. It took me five hours of begging to raise less than a dollar. My entire concept of what is important changed. Time is usually my most valuable commodity, but for that 24 hours I had too much time. Forget Starbucks and a $4 latte — I walked two miles to find a 25-cent cup of coffee."[6]
Schulman has been a resident of Warren Township, New Jersey.[23]

His mother, S. Ruth Schulman, was associate dean of Rutgers' Graduate School of Applied and Professional Psychology (GSAPP) from 1974 to 1999. His father, the late Mel Schulman, was a chemical engineer.[5]
Schulman once told the New York Times, "I was born with social activism in my DNA. My grandfather was a union organizer in the garment district in New York City. My mother took me to a civil rights demonstration in Washington in my stroller."[6]
Business background[edit]
Schulman began his business career at AT&T, working more than 18 years there and becoming the youngest member of the company's senior executive team, the AT&T Operations Group.[7] When Schulman left AT&T, he was president of the $22 billion core consumer long distance business.
He then became president and COO, and then CEO of Priceline.com. During his two years there, Priceline's annual revenues grew from a reported $20 million to about $1 billion.[7]
In 2001, Schulman became the CEO of Virgin Mobile USA, Inc., and led the company from its national launch in 2002 to its becoming a public company in 2007, to its sale to Sprint Nextel in 2009.[1] By the time Schulman left Virgin Mobile, it had become one of the nation's top wireless carriers, with more than 5 million customers and $1.3 billion in annual sales. Following the sale of Virgin Mobile to Sprint Nextel, Schulman served as President of Sprint's Prepaid group until he moved to American Express.
On 30 September 2014 it was announced that Schulman would become CEO of PayPal, which will continue as a separate legal entity, split from eBay in the second half of 2015.[8]
Board service[edit]
Schulman became chairman of Symantec (SYMC-NASDAQ),[9] in January 2013;[10] and is a member of the Board of Directors of Flextronics (FLEX-NASDAQ).[11] Schulman also serves on the advisory committee of Greycroft Partners, a private equity company focused on early-stage new media and technology companies.[12]
Schulman is on the Board of Governors of Rutgers,[13] the state university of New Jersey. He is on the board of Teach for America.[14] He also serves on the board at Autism Speaks, an advocacy group dedicated to advancing research into causes and treatments for individuals on the autism spectrum.[15]
Political stance[edit]
The Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act that mandates people in public facilities use bathrooms in accordance to their gender at birth was denounced by Dan Schulman.[16][17] He stated that "The new law perpetuates discrimination and it violates the values and principles that are at the core of PayPal's mission and culture."[16][17] Schulman also cosigned an opposition letter with about 120 executives from major corporations.[18] In protest to the new law in North Carolina, Dan Schulman informed that the company is canceling its expansion to hire 400 people in the state.[18][19]
Dan Schulman wrote in the PayPal statement that; "While we will seek an alternative location for our operations center, we remain committed to working with the LGBT community in North Carolina to overturn this discriminatory legislation, alongside all those who are committed to equality."[16]
Awards[edit]
Schulman was named by Business Week as one of the top 20 people to watch in media,[20] and was named the Ernst & Young 2009 Entrepreneur Of The Year.[21] In 2009 he was named one of the top 25 most powerful people in the global wireless industry.[22]
Personal[edit]
When he was CEO of Virgin Mobile, Schulman led a partnership with StandUp For Kids, a nonprofit that distributes survival kits and a hotline number to homeless youth. To get a truer sense of what homeless kids experience, Schulman once spent 24 hours on the streets of New York City, unshaven, wrapped in a blanket, and without money, a watch, or a cell phone. "There's a certain amount of deference paid to a C.E.O.," he later said. "No one paid attention to me on the street. I consider myself a good communicator and a good salesman. It took me five hours of begging to raise less than a dollar. My entire concept of what is important changed. Time is usually my most valuable commodity, but for that 24 hours I had too much time. Forget Starbucks and a $4 latte — I walked two miles to find a 25-cent cup of coffee."[6]
Schulman has been a resident of Warren Township, New Jersey.[23]

It took me five hours of begging to raise less than a dollar. My entire concept of what is important changed. Time is usually my most valuable commodity, but for that 24 hours I had too much time. Forget Starbucks and a $4 latte — I walked two miles to find a 25-cent cup of coffee."[6]
Schulman has been a resident of Warren Township, New Jersey.[23]

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
