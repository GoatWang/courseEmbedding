LAS VEGAS (FOX5) -
A Las Vegas hospital is the first in the state to offer a breast milk fortifier for prematurely born babies.































 























Why Choose Prolacta?
We are making the difference in the lives of premature infants.
Prolacta Bioscience, Inc. (Prolacta) is the pioneer in standardized human milk-based nutritional products for premature infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Prolacta believes that there is no adequate replacement for human breast milk and, as such, we believe infant nutritional products should be human milk-based. As a privately held, for-profit and scientifically driven company, committed to improving premature infant nutrition, we are using human milk to change the standard of care in the NICU. Mothers who have a surplus of breast milk can help save the country’s most fragile infants by donating their extra breast milk through one of Prolacta’s affiliate milk banks.

Frequently Asked Questions

I’ve heard that using Prolact+ H2MF® can actually save hospitals money. Is that true?



Yes. A study in the Journal of Breastfeeding Medicine found that extremely premature infants fed an exclusively human milk diet including the only human milk-based HMF, Prolact+ H2MF®Prolact+ H2MF® Human milk-based, human milk fortifier. Manufactured by Prolacta Bioscience, it is the only human milk fortifier made from 100% human milk., had lower expected costs of hospitalization, resulting in net direct savings of $8,167.17 per infant. The study also found that extremely premature infants who were not diagnosed with NEC spent approximately 3.9 fewer days in the NICU than infants who were diagnosed. (/docs/BFM.2011.0002.pdf)




Is Prolacta Bioscience a for-profit company?



Yes. We have invested over 40 million dollars in research, clinical studies and facilities to develop and test our human milk derived products. This world class research and development would not have been possible in a non-profit business model.




Is Prolacta a milk bank?



Prolacta has set up a network of affiliated milk collection organizations. These organizations can be found in hospitals, birthing centers, or associated with charities. Depending on the organization, they share the responsibilities of qualifying the donors and collecting the milk with Prolacta. All affiliated milk collection organizations have all milk sent to Prolacta for processing.




What does Prolacta do with the milk they collect through the affiliated milk banks?



The milk that is collected through affiliated milk banks is tested, pasteurized and formulated into nutritional products exclusively for in hospital use. The formulations are made specifically to feed critically ill premature babies that are in the NICUNICU
	Neonatal/Newborn Intensive Care Unit.. The donations do not serve as substitutes for mother’s milk if a baby in not under hospital care.




What are your products?



Prolacta’s commitment to Advancing the Science of Human Milk® has led us to develop and offer the only liquid HMFHMF
	Human milk fortifier is a milk-based nutritional supplement and is mixed with mother’s milk or donor milk to increase the levels of protein, energy, calcium, phosphorus, and other nutrients. derived from 100% human milk, as opposed to other HMFHMF

	Very low birth weight; a baby weighing 1,500g or less.) premature infants with the nutrition necessary to support appropriate growth and development. Prolacta’s human milk-based products have been formulated to deliver exact caloric and protein levels every time. These products are critical to premature infants in the NICUNICU
	Neonatal/Newborn Intensive Care Unit. who require higher levels of protein and calories than can be provided by mothers’ milk alone.




Where are your products being used?



Prolacta’s completely human milk formulations are used in NICUsNICU
	Neonatal/Newborn Intensive Care Unit. across the nation, for the most fragile babies.




How do I know my preemie will benefit from Prolacta’s fortifier products?



A recent study published in the Journal of Pediatrics showed that when added to human milk, Prolact+ H2MF®Prolact+ H2MF® Human milk-based, human milk fortifier. Manufactured by Prolacta Bioscience, it is the only human milk fortifier made from 100% human milk. clinically reduced the odds of developing NECNEC
	Necrotizing enterocolitis is an acute inflammatory disease affecting the intestines of premature infants. by 77% in premature infants weighing 500 g – 1250 g at birth, when compared to infants receiving a cow’s milk-based HMF (also commonly called breast milk fortifier) or, when mother’s milk was unavailable, preterm infant formula. Earlier studies have also demonstrated that for infants in the NICUNICU
	Neonatal/Newborn Intensive Care Unit., human milk decreases the incidence of diseases such as necrotizing enterocolitis (NECNEC
	Necrotizing enterocolitis is an acute inflammatory disease affecting the intestines of premature infants.), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), and sepsis (infection).




Why does my baby need a human milk fortifier?



Premature babies, especially babies that weigh 2 pounds 12 ounces or less at birth, have very special nutritional needs. For example, premature babies need more energy to grow than term babies. Premature babies also grow at a rapid pace, so they need more protein than term babies. Prolact+ H2MF®Prolact+ H2MF®

If a baby is prescribed Prolacta’s human milk products, how much does it cost a parent?



Prolacta never charges a parent for product. The cost of Prolacta products is, in most cases, under two percent of the total cost of care for a VLBWVLBW
	Very low birth weight; a baby weighing 1,500g or less. infant. Prolacta’s products are treated in the same manner as most products used to provide patient care in hospital. In many cases medical insurance covers the cost of the products. In other cases hospitals are willing to absorb the cost. In fact, hospitals and the health care system save money using Prolact+ H2MF®Prolact+ H2MF® Human milk-based, human milk fortifier. Manufactured by Prolacta Bioscience, it is the only human milk fortifier made from 100% human milk. because of the cost savings realized due to the reduced incidence and severity of NECNEC

Manufactured by Prolacta Bioscience, it is the only human milk fortifier made from 100% human milk.. It is added to mothers’ own milk or to donor milk.




How do I know that Prolacta’s products are safe?



Our dedication to Advancing the Science of Human Milk® has led us to build a one-of-a-kind, state of the art manufacturing facility. Our products have been safely used in NICUNICU
	Neonatal/Newborn Intensive Care Unit.s throughout the United States and Europe. We use the most sophisticated and innovative processes, pasteurization, and filling methods to ensure the highest possible level of product safety and quality. This includes final testing for microbiological and viral contamination. Viruses are detected using polymerase chain reaction, which is a method that can detect as little as one copy of the virus in a sample by amplifying a short sequence of the viral DNADNA

	Ribonucleic acid, in some viruses, performs the role of DNA.) to create many copies.

Is Prolacta regulated by any federal or state agencies?



Yes. Prolacta products are regulated by the FDA. Prolacta’s facility is licensed as a tissue bank by the states of California, New York and Maryland, which require such a license for human milk banking.




How are breast milk donors screened prior to donating milk?



Breast milk donations follow a rigorous screening process based on the blood banking model. Prolacta is the only organization that uses these combined safety steps:

Potential breast milk donors are screened through a medical history survey. After the screening, the donor is entered into Prolacta’s secure database and assigned a donor number.
Once the potential donor passes the medical history survey, she must obtain written approval from her physician and her baby’s pediatrician before she can continue in the donation process.
The potential donor measures the temperature in her freezer with a thermometer provided by Prolacta. The temperature must be cold enough to store human milk or, unfortunately, the potential donor may not donate.
A blood test and a DNADNA
		Deoxyribonucleic acid is the fundamental building block of an individual’s entire genetic makeup. cheek swab are conducted. The blood test screens for several infectious agents including HIVHIV
		Human immunodeficiency virus is the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).  1&2, HTLVHTLV
		Human T- lymphotropic virus is a retrovirus that causes some forms of lymphoma, and is in the same class of virus as the AIDS virus, HIV-1. I&II, HBVHBV
		The hepatitis B virus is a cause of hepatitis, a liver disease. It ranges in severity from a mild illness, lasting a few weeks (acute), to a serious long-term (chronic) illness that can lead to liver failure or liver cancer., HCVHCV
		The hepatitis C virus is a cause of hepatitis, a liver disease. HCV infection sometimes results in an acute illness, but most often becomes a chronic condition that can lead to cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer., and syphilis. The DNADNA

		Deoxyribonucleic acid is the fundamental building block of an individual’s entire genetic makeup. ID will be used later to ensure the milk received is from the donor that was blood tested.
If the potential donor passes the screening and meets all of the requirements outlined above, she is qualified to be a breast milk donor for a four month period. After four months, if she wishes to continue donating, she must complete a new medical history survey and have another blood test.





Why is Prolacta no longer co-promoting products with Abbott?





Effective Jan. 1, 2014, Abbott and Prolacta Bioscience will no longer co-promote Prolacta products.
When we first began co-promoting Prolacta products, both companies had relatively small product portfolios for premature babies. Over the years, both of our businesses have grown and we both now have extensive portfolios of products. To provide the best service to our customers, both companies decided it was best to focus on supporting their respective portfolios.





Why should I donate?



If you have excess breast milk, you can donate it to be processed into specialty formulations and sold to hospitals to help meet the nutritional needs of critically ill premature infants in neonatal intensive care units. Many moms donate their extra milk to help babies in need because they have had a preterm baby in the past or know someone who has had that experience. Breast milk donors report a sense of satisfaction knowing they are providing their milk to help provide the added nutritional needs to sick premature infants.




Why do you conduct DNA testing on Donors?



The DNA matching step is necessary so that the milk we receive is matched to our qualified donors. This safety step ensures that only milk from qualified moms is accepted for production.
We start by having the prospective donor provide a sample of cheek cells that we can use to create a unique Donor ID. We extract the DNA from the cheek cells and use it to create a series of 32 numbers that are unique to that donor. Only identical twins share the same profile. Two of the numbers in the profile tell us whether the DNA comes from a man or a woman.
Once the donors milk arrives, we take a sample of the DNA found in the milk and generate a Milk ID. We then look to make sure that the Donor ID and Milk ID profiles match. We can also see if there are multiple Milk ID profiles in the same donation, indicating there are two or more different mothers’ milk is contained in the donation.
The only information that we generate about the donor from her DNA are the Donor and Milk IDs. We do not generate any other genetic information about the donor. The Donor ID contains no information about the donor’s health or heredity. Prolacta does not retain samples of the donor’s isolated DNA once the matching of donor to donation is complete. The only thing that is retained is the 32 number Donor ID.
While there are other ways to match a donor to a tissue sample, this technique is considered the most accurate and is the gold standard.

Find a Milk Bank
Do you have extra breast milk and want to make a difference in the lives of premature babies who have special nutritional needs? Choose a milk bank below and become a breast milk donor.
All milk collected through these Prolacta-affiliated or operated milk banks goes through a rigorous screening process and is formulated into human milk-based nutritional products that are prescribed by doctors.
By offering access to a network of milk banks, Prolacta allows mothers to choose a milk bank with which she feels most comfortable or best meets her needs. Prolacta utilizes this diversity of milk banks to ensure a supply of milk for those infants who need it most.
In addition to helping preemies who are in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), Helping Hands Milk Bank support the Susan G Komen Foundation 
based on the amount of breast milk collected.

Mother’s milk is the ideal nutrition for most infants. It’s especially vital for premature, low birth weight and critically-ill infants. In fact, studies show that a diet of breast milk helps decrease incidences of necrotizing enterocolotis, a potentially fatal disease in critically-ill and preterm infants.
Some mothers find it difficult to express breast milk when they are separated from their babies who are being cared for in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).
Fortunately, mothers who produce more milk than their own baby needs generously donate their milk to help nourish hospitalized infants. By becoming a donor, you will be providing a vital resource to very small preterm infants at Texas Children’s Hospital, which houses the nation’s largest NICU and cares for nearly 3,000 babies a year.
Texas Children’s partners with Prolacta Bioscience to conduct thorough donor testing and to process and pasteurize all donor milk. Prolacta operates a large, pharmaceutical- grade facility that has the capacity and supply to meet Texas Children’s needs. At Texas Children’s Hospital, donor milk is provided to all babies who need it, regardless of the family’s ability to pay.

LAS VEGAS (FOX5) -
A Las Vegas hospital is the first in the state to offer a breast milk fortifier for prematurely born babies.































 























Why Choose Prolacta?
We are making the difference in the lives of premature infants.
Prolacta Bioscience, Inc. (Prolacta) is the pioneer in standardized human milk-based nutritional products for premature infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Prolacta believes that there is no adequate replacement for human breast milk and, as such, we believe infant nutritional products should be human milk-based. As a privately held, for-profit and scientifically driven company, committed to improving premature infant nutrition, we are using human milk to change the standard of care in the NICU. Mothers who have a surplus of breast milk can help save the country’s most fragile infants by donating their extra breast milk through one of Prolacta’s affiliate milk banks.
