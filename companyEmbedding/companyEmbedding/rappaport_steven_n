Answers the questions: what are they, how are they calculated, what do we know about them, where is measurement headed? Each metric is shown to answer a question, then defined, calculated, and commented upon. Many comments review research about the metric. 12 invited essays reveal that measurement is moving away from merely tracking numbers to capturing what people are doing, saying and feeling - their humanity. We are moving to a world of "humetrics" - discovering the humanity within the metrics.Authors: Stephen (Steve) RappaportProduct Design for Bread through Mind Genomics and Cognitive EconomicsAcademic Press, an imprint of ElsevierSeptember 2016This chapter appears in "Developing New Functional Food and Neutraceutical Products." Our chapter explains the science of MInd Genomics and its subspecialty Cognitive Economics and applies them to creating and marketing artisanal bread. Original research findings are presented on: the three mindsets towards bread; what drives interest in aspects of bread within each mindset,e.g. sensory, origin, health benefits;  how the mindsets value each aspect; and finally how communications created by combining three or more elements within each mindset outperform those of the sample as a whole. We introduce the concept of narrative and story, and how the research helps us understand the stories people tell about bread. Authors: Stephen (Steve) Rappaport, Howard MoskowitzListen First!
