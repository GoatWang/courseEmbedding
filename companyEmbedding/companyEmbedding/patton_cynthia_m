               We are committed to providing our participants with high quality leisure programs. Our residents and participants are very important to us and we feel you deserve quality at all times. We are confident that our leisure programs provide high quality so we are backing it with a policy called "Satisfaction Guarantee". Our promise and policy is as follows: The Park District's promise is that you will be satisfied with the quality of our leisure programs in which you participate or you will receive a full refund of fees you have paid for that program. The policy and refund process is simple. All we request is that you must attend at least one class and if you are not satisfied with the quality of our instruction, that you take a brief moment of your time to come in and complete and return our "Satisfaction Guarantee" refund form prior to the third class. Your input on the refund form is very valuable as it will allow us to focus on where improvement is needed. The Satisfaction Guarantee refund form is available at our Park District office. Upon receiving your completed form by the third class, we will process a full refund of your paid fees provided YOU ONLY ATTENDED THE FIRST CLASS. Attending two or more classes, all refunds will be pro-rated as to how many classes have been held in the program session. THIS POLICY APPLIES TO LEISURE PROGRAMS ONLY! A leisure program is defined as a program where Park District personnel teach activities or skills over a period of three or more weeks. Satisfaction Guarantee policy does not apply to special events, trips, contractual programs, conflicts with scheduling, make up classes, weather related causes or any other cause not within the control of the Park District.
