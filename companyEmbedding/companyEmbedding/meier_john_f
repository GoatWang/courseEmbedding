John F. Meier, who led Libbey Inc. for 21 years, as the glass and tableware maker became a publicly traded company and through a period of global growth, died Thursday in ProMedica Ebeid Hospice Residence, Sylvania. He was 69.
He had cancer, his wife, Ann, said.

Mr. Meier at his retirement in 2011 was the longest-serving chief executive officer of any local publicly traded company. He started his career at Owens-Illinois Inc. in 1970, of which Libbey then was a division.
“After 41 years, it’s time to pass the baton,” Mr. Meier told The Blade as he announced his departure. “I’ve been running this company for 21 years, and 18 of those as a publicly held company, and it’s time to step aside and make room for someone else.”
William Foley, Libbey CEO since January, 2016, said: “We owe John a debt of gratitude to have the foresight and wisdom to build Libbey much the way it is today.”
Mr. Meier took charge of Libbey in November, 1990, when he was named vice president and general manager of the O-I Libbey division. He became chief executive less than three years later, when Libbey was spun off from O-I, and oversaw the initial public offering of Libbey stock in June, 1993.
“His proudest moment was when he was able to take them public,” his daughter Lizzie said.
Annual sales for Libbey totaled $350 million in 1995 and $800 million in 2010. He led the company’s expansion beyond North America to world markets. It became the second largest tableware maker internationally, with factories in Mexico, China, and Europe.
“He had a very clear vision of what he wanted to do to build the business,” said Mr. Foley, Libbey’s chairman of the board since 2011.
“He expanded the whole platform of the company around the globe,” said Mr. Foley, who was a vice president at glassware maker Anchor Hocking when they met 35 years ago. “He was a courageous, thoughtful, compassionate leader.”
Robert Zollweg, Libbey design and creative director, said that he and Mr. Meier started at O-I on the same day in 1970.
“He treated Libbey like a family,” Mr. Zollweg said. “He kept people and promoted them from within.”
Mr. Meier started at O-I as a product manager and became marketing and sales manager at Durobor, an O-I affiliate in Belgium. He advanced from food service marketing manager and retail marketing manager at Libbey to become vice president and director of sales and marketing.
He served on several civic and cultural boards, including those of the Toledo Museum of Art, the Toledo Zoo, and the Edward Drummond and Florence Scott Libbey Trusts. He also was a former chairman of a United Way of Greater Toledo campaign.
“He was a very outstanding, gregarious kind of leader,” said Robert Savage, a business and community leader who co-founded the financial services firm, Savage & Associates. “He had an objective view of how you could make a project work and worked hard on almost anything he thought would make the town better.”
He was born Sept. 27, 1947, to Louise and Hans Meier in Beaver Falls, Pa. He was a graduate of Rochester, Pa., High School, where he pitched on the baseball team and played quarterback on the football team.
He continued in baseball and football at Wittenburg University in Springfield, Ohio, from which he received a bachelor’s degree in business. He received a master of business administration degree from Bowling Green State University. BGSU named him one of its 100 most prominent alumni for its 2010 centennial.
He was a member of Sylvania Country Club, where he liked to golf, and was a financial backer and business adviser of Element 112, a Sylvania restaurant.
Surviving are his wife, the former Ann Williamson, whom he married May 22, 1971; daughter, Lizzie Utt; son, John, and two grandsons.
Visitation will be from 3 to 7 p.m. Sunday in the Walker Funeral Home, Sylvania Township. Services will be at 10 a.m. Monday at Historic Church of St. Patrick downtown, where he was a member.
The family suggests tributes to the Toledo Area Humane Society, Maumee, or a charity of the donor’s choice.

PCU Gerald R. Ford Welcomes New Commanding Officer 



Story Number: NNS130717-09Release Date: 7/17/2013 10:51:00 AM

By Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Joshua J. Wahl, PCU Gerald R. Ford Public Affairs


NEWPORT NEWS, Va. (NNS) -- Capt. John F. Meier assumed command of Pre-Commissioning Unit (PCU) Gerald R. Ford (CVN 78), July 8.

Meier, a native of Export, Pa., is the first commanding officer selected for the Navy's newest class of nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, which is currently under construction at Huntington Ingalls Industries - Newport News Shipbuilding (HII-NNS). 

"I'm thrilled to be here," said Meier. "I couldn't ask for a better assignment or a greater honor."

Meier believes the dedication focused on constructing the new vessel will culminate in the ship's successful commissioning and marks the beginning of a new class of aircraft carriers that will be in service for nearly a century.

"The crew is about to embark on a challenging and fulfilling tour of duty on the newest and most technologically advanced warship in the world," said Meier. "The Gerald R. Ford is the first in its class, paving the way for the future of sea power projection for decades to come."

The Gerald R. Ford will replace USS Enterprise (CVN 65), which was inactivated Dec. 1, 2012 in Norfolk, Va. Updates to the new carrier include improved warfighing capabilities, lower maintenance, reduced manning requirements and a better quality of life for the Sailors. Highlighted additions include Dual Band Radar (DBR), Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) and Advanced Arresting Gear (AAG), which are designed to leverage technology to improve capabilities and increase combat sortie generation rate.

Meier graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1986 with a Bachelor of Science degree in General Engineering. He completed flight training in Beeville, Texas and was "winged" as a naval aviator in August 1988.  

He served with electronic attack squadrons and carrier air wings accumulating more than 4000 flight hours and 675 carrier landings. His assignments include the "Shadow Hawks" of Electronic Attack Squadron VAQ (141); "Vikings" of Electronic Attack Squadron (VAQ) 129; Carrier Air Wing (CVW) 2; "Fighting Phoenix" of Electronic Attack Squadron (VAQ) 128; Navy Personnel Command; Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff; "Gauntlets" of Electronic Attack Squadron (VAQ) 136; Chief of Naval Operations; USS Harry S. Truman (CVN 75); USS Gunston Hall (LSD 44), and Naval Air Forces, Pacific. His decorations include the Legion of Merit (3 awards) and various other personal and unit level awards.

The ship receives its name in commemoration of the 38th President of the United States, Gerald R. Ford. Before his Presidency, Ford served as a U.S. Naval Officer from 1943 to 1946 as the gunnery division officer aboard the light aircraft carrier USS Monterey (CVL 26).
Upon commissioning, USS Ford will be the premier forward asset for crisis response and early decisive striking power in a major combat operation. The carrier and the carrier strike group will provide forward presence, rapid response, endurance on station, and multi-mission capability.
