The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.

You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.

Overview | What was Howard Zinn’s approach to history, and what values are inherent in it? What issues does his work raise about the purpose and significance of studying history? What are the benefits and drawbacks of his method? In this lesson, students examine Mr. Zinn’s work by comparing his writing with a typical American history textbook. They then write a reflection or select a document from American history to perform.
Materials | Student journals, projection equipment or handouts, copies of relevant portions of “A People’s History of the United States” and a history textbook
Warm-Up |  Provide the following two questions for students to respond to in their journals: In writing history, what do you think should be a historian’s goal(s)? Why do you think people should study history? 
When students are finished writing, invite them to share their ideas and record them on the board.
Next, hand out, project and/or read aloud the following quotation from Howard Zinn’s “A People’s History of the United States”:
I don’t want to invent victories for people’s movements. But to think that history-writing must aim simply to recapitulate the failures that dominate the past is to make historians collaborators in an endless cycle of defeat. If history is to be creative, to anticipate a possible future without denying the past, it should, I believe, emphasize new possibilities by disclosing those hidden episodes of the past, when, even if in brief flashes, people showed their ability to resist, to join together, occasionally to win. I am supposing, or perhaps only hoping, that our future may be found in the past’s fugitive moments of compassion rather than in its solid centuries of warfare. That, being as blunt as I can, is my approach to the history of the United States. The reader may as well know the before going on.
Ask: How would you paraphrase this historian’s approach to United States history? What does he seem to value and why? What does he seem to think the purpose and function of history is? How does this approach seem similar to and different from how you have studied history in school? What are the connections between what you wrote earlier in your journals and these ideas?
Tell students the source of the quotation and that they will take a closer look at the work and philosophy of this historian, Howard Zinn, and the controversy over his approach.
Related | In the obituary “Howard Zinn, Historian, Is Dead at 87,” Michael Powell notes that Mr. Zinn’s book “A People’s History of the United States was a “best-seller that inspired a generation of high school and college students to rethink American history”:
Almost an oddity at first, with a printing of just 4,000 in 1980, “A People’s History of the United States” has sold nearly two million copies. To describe it as a revisionist account is to risk understatement. A conventional historical account held no allure; he concentrated on what he saw as the genocidal depredations of Christopher Columbus, the blood lust of Theodore Roosevelt and the racial failings of Abraham Lincoln. He also shined an insistent light on the revolutionary struggles of impoverished farmers, feminists, laborers and resisters of slavery and war.
Such stories are more often recounted in textbooks today; they were not at the time.
Questions | For discussion and reading comprehension:

What does it mean that Howard Zinn “delighted … in lancing what he considered platitudes, not the least that American history was a heroic march toward democracy”?
Why did the book meet with some skepticism and opposition? How did Mr. Zinn respond to critics?
How has Mr. Zinn and his work penetrated popular culture? Why do you think that is?
How do you think Mr. Zinn’s life might have contributed to his worldview and historical approach and vice versa? Why?
What “personal philosophy” do you think is expressed in the title of Mr. Zinn’s memoir, “You Can’t Be Neutral on a Moving Train”?
How do you think the way you study history is different from how it was taught to your parents and grandparents?

Activity | Explain that students will now examine Howard Zinn’s approach to history writing by comparing a subject in a typical American history textbook with Mr. Zinn’s portrayal of the same event in his book “A People’s History of the United States.”
You could use any topic for this lesson, depending on your current curriculum, by simply looking through the index of “A People’s History of the United States.” The example here is about Shays’ Rebellion.
To begin, hand out the following textbook account of Shays’ Rebellion, from the middle school-level United States history textbook “The American Nation,” by James West Davidson and John E. Batchelor, Prentice Hall, 1986, and read it out loud with the class:
While Congress dealt successfully with the Northwest Territory, it failed to solve other problems. Among the most serious were the problems of farmers.
During the Revolution, the demand for farm products was high. Farmers borrowed money for land, seed, animals and tools. But after the war, the nation suffered an economic depression. An economic depression is a period when business activity slows, prices and wages fall, and unemployment rises. When prices for farm goods fell, farmers could not repay their loans.
Farmers in western Massachusetts were hard hit by falling farm prices. To make matters worse, Massachusetts raised taxes. The courts threatened to seize the farms of people who did not pay their loans and taxes.
Captain Daniel Shays was a Massachusetts farmer who had fought in the Revolution. In 1786, Shays gathered a force of about 1,000 angry farmers. They attacked courthouses and tried to take a warehouse full of rifles and gunpowder. Massachusetts quickly raised an army and ended the rebellion.
Shays’ Rebellion worried many Americans. It was a sign that the Articles of Confederation were not working. Leaders of several states called for a convention to discuss ways of reforming the Articles. They decided to meet in Philadelphia in May 1787. When they met, however, they took more drastic action.
After they read this account, ask students to read the same subject from a history Web site, like this one or this one.
After reading these two sources, students work individually or in pairs to write a short summary of what happened during Shays’ Rebellion. Invite a few students or pairs to share their summary with the class.
Next, hand out Mr. Zinn’s account of Shays’ Rebellion, from “A People’s History of the United States,” and read it out loud with the class. (It is available online here, but this version may contain some typos, as the site’s disclaimer notes; you may wish to use a print copy of the book with your class.)
After the class finishes reading both accounts, ask pairs to compare and contrast Mr. Zinn’s account with the textbook versions. Questions for consideration include these:

What are similarities and differences between the passages? What do you make of these differences?
What characters does Mr. Zinn introduce that the textbook and summaries do not mention?
What significant perspectives or information may have been left out of each passage? Do you feel that either of the passages offered a more adequate retelling of this event? If so, which one?
Explain how reading historical accounts influences your understanding. What did you take away from the textbook passage? What did you take away from Mr. Zinn’s account? When would a simple textbook passage be most helpful? When would it be more useful to read an account like those in “A People’s History”?
In what ways does Mr. Zinn’s account of Shays’ Rebellion relate to the quotation about his approach to writing history that we read at the beginning of class?
Why do you think an account like Mr. Zinn’s could make some historians and readers dismiss him?
Why do you think that the way Mr. Zinn approaches history led to some historians to dismiss him and brand him a “radical”?

To take this further, you might share one or both of the following:

A transcript of an interview with Howard Zinn from WBUR in which he connects the story of Shays’ Rebellion to present-day America: “We could learn from that history, because people are being foreclosed, they’re losing their homes. Instead of waiting for the president and Congress to act, who are very slow to act and who are not going to really represent the interests of these poor people or even middle class people who are evicted from homes. People should be organizing, doing what citizens have done, doing what democracy requires to prevent these evictions from taking place.” Invite students to consider that comparison further for similarities and differences in circumstance, context and so on.
Bob Herbert’s Op-Ed column “A Radical Treasure,” in which he questions why Mr. Zinn was often characterized as a radical, and why he considered himself one. Discuss with students what the term “radical” means and how and why it might, and might not, apply to Mr. Zinn. They might also read some more of Mr. Herbert’s columns to compare and contrast Mr. Herbert’s and Mr. Zinn’s work and approach to documenting the people and events of the United States. Can you find any evidence in Mr. Herbert’s columns of Mr. Zinn’s philosophy? Would you call Mr. Herbert a radical? Why or why not?

Going Further | Students revisit their warm-up writing and discussion by re-exploring the question of how history should be “told” in a written piece that explores some of the following questions: What power and responsibility does a historian have in telling a story? Is there a way to write history completely objectively? Or, do historians always add some form of personal bias? How does a concentration on “the people” make Mr. Zinn’s version of history different than an emphasis on, say, politics, economics or foreign relations? Do you think a voice like Mr. Zinn’s is an essential part of the historical record? Is it important, in your opinion, that historians use primary sources in their exploration of history? Why or why not? How do you most like to learn about history? Why?
Alternatively or additionally, students watch some of “The People Speak” and read the corresponding texts. They then create their own video or performance piece on the document of their choice from American history. Hold a classroom “People Speak” contest, in which students enter video, animated projects, raps, theater pieces, etc. Perform and share the pieces at a community event or for other classrooms in the school. They then reflect on how this experience brought the texts “to life” for them in a new way.

Ugh.  the first activity suggests comparing a 200 word passage in a dry textbook to 10,000 words of polemic analysis.  Many of Zinn’s angles and facts are indeed good to know about, but there are other well-written, longer treatments of the material that would not conflate reader-friendly analysis with anachronistic tub-thumping that feeds a contemporary political agenda.

One major flaw of Zinn’s history is the lack of foot or end notes. This failing should disqualify the work for any serious student of history.
Another caveat is Zinn’s history covers minorities and movements but sometimes to the exclusion of broader developments such as the increasing democracy in the country from 1790 to 1840. It is a good adjunct to a history of the U.S. but should not be the main text.

Dinah and Holly – Thank you for creating this valuable and thoughtful lesson. 
As a social studies teacher, another resource I’ve found invaluable is the Zinn Education Project website  (http://zinnedproject.org). ZEP has dozens of teaching activities and similar resources –  organized by time period and theme – to teach a people’s history. 
In addition, Dr. Zinn recently responded to questions from teachers, and it is available at http://www.zinnedproject.org/posts/5046. It, too, provides additional insight into his life and work, as well as great advice for social studies teachers.

Thanks for taking the time after Howard’s passing for including this thoughtful lesson and especially for including Howard’s last work, the film THE PEOPLE SPEAK (http://www.thepeoplespeak.com).
Michael R’s is right: The Zinn Education Project has terrific materials for many different age groups.
And students around the country are also putting on readings from Zinn’s Voices of a People’s History of the United States, the primary source companion to A People’s History. 
Performance and reading out loud is a great way to bring history to life for students. There are online organizing tools and scripts at http://www.peopleshistory.us

As a teacher/tutor, I object to the constant thread of polemics in Zinn and his lack of references.  We are to take his assertions about history as gospel because he says so.  Frankly, I think he is the genesis of the movement that condemns anything American.

The Zinn piece is just too long. My students could not get through all of it.
My classes are only 57 minutes and I don’t teach at Stuyvesant.
Can’t the Times create something for, for lack of a better term, average students?

To all the critics of Zinn, Re: endnotes, polemics:  I see Zinn as more of a jumping off point.  His perspective is one that is more of a wider vision of American History that has generally been left out of other treatments, For example, Zinn’s historical work is inclusive of indigenous people, the impact of indigenous people in a larger framework and goes beyond “official” or “Big Man” history.  That is, delves into subtexts left out of the history of big events (like wars, etc.) and “Big Men,” theories of history (so-called “Top Down” history) that use a central big event and the central leaders (presidents, kings, industrial leaders, social movement leaders, etc.) and describes surrounding or contemporary events in the context of, or through the “lense” of, the major players, events and officials.  Zinn was a vanguard of “social history,” more or less positing that change occurs from the bottom up, from the grass roots.  By viewing from such a perspective a deeper, richer more comprehensive understanding of history, a truer and more realistic and more inclusive history, “a people’s history,” is attained.  Is he a polemicist?  From certain pespectives, of course, but that does not serve as meaningful enough criticism to dismiss his work.  As for the endnotes the primary and secondary material that is grounds for his writings widely exists.  It’s not as if these events have not been written about by others.  Don’t take Zinn’s word for it do your own research.

William Murphy alleges a lack of references in Zinn’s “A People’s History”.  I suspect Mr. Murphy neglected to read the 19 pages of bibliography that precisely identifies sources, chapter by chapter.
In the 662-page text in the 1999 edition, Dr. Zinn identified the authors and book titles directly in the text and includes the full information for each in the bibliography. He placed asterisks next to those he found indispensable and said the quotes in the text were found in those marked with asterisks. He identified the scholarly journals and “less orthodox but important” periodicals he reviewed before writing. 
Mr. Murphy also complains that what Zinn chose to write about sometimes excludes “broader developments such as the increasing democracy in the country from 1790 to 1840.” 
We know that  “increasing democracy” excluded fully half the adult population (women) until several centuries later along with many other broad sections of the population– including Native Americans, African Americans, Asian Americans and others — also until several centuries later. 
When three quarters of the population–or more– is denied voting rights, whatever amount of democracy increased between 1790 and1840 did not include the majority of people living within the United States.

The Zinn Education Project has no place in any school and here’s why.
1. It’s full of half truths, innacuracies and flat out lies. “People’s History” is not only boring Marxist propagandizing, it’s not even well researched. He gets so much basic stuff wrong because he’s so busy trying to convince you he’s right, he just overlooks things or flat out puts things in there that aren’t correct.
It seems the writers he reccomends do the same….Shay’s rebellion raided an arsenal full of “rifles”??? Is that so? Any military historian would scoff at that and tell you the clear difference between a rifle and a musket!
2. Zinn’s education project  is flat out illegal according to most education codes. He tells the teachers to disregard this and fight a “guerilla war” against administrators. To all the teachers who think that little game is fun; guess what, Zinn and his ilk don’t care if you get fired or suspended, they just want to make a point at your expense….useful tools.
