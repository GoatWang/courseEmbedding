You are looking at an identified photograph of DANIEL LEIB.  This photograph measures about 4x6 and is in good shape.  Please make sure that you check out the scans so that you can see the dirty spots at the bottom of the photo and on the back.  These spots, in my opinion, do not effect the actual image.  This photograph is identified on the back as such:  DANIEL LEIB

DANIEL looks very young in this photograph, possibly around 22 or so.  If you look very carefully it appears to me that he's wearing a wedding ring, and if he is, this photo would have to be dated after 1889 because that's the year the 1900 HEIDLEBURG, LEBANON CO., PA. census listed his marriage date (so we know it's within a year either way of that date)

I have done some research on this photograph and this is what I've come up with.  Based on all of the photos that came with this photograph, and all of the collective information that I've gathered on all of the photos combined, I believe that DANIEL LEIB born May 1865 PA. was the son of HENRY  LEIB born 1833, PA. and ELIZABETH born 1840, PA.  DANIEL had the following siblings:  Mary C., Rosa A., Eliza J., Emma.

In 1870 the above family is living in HEIDELBERG, LEBANON CO., PA., HENRY'S stepson, JOHN L. BEAMENSDERFER, age 22, is living with them

1880 Daniel is still living home with his parents in the same location.

About 1889, DANIEL LEIB married ELIZABETH "LIZZIE" WITWER and they had the following children:  EDNA M., ELIZA, ELSIE G, LEON W., AND MARY M.

In 1900 & 1910 the family is living in HEIDELBERG, LEBABON CO., PA.

It's a bit confusing but I will try to explain how this photo is related to the other photos I have listed, particulary the photo of JAMES MONROE WITWER.

DANIEL LEIB (PICTURED) married LIZZIE WITWER.
LIZZIE WITWER'S father was MICHAEL WITWER who was born 1827, PA. (Michael was married to ELIZA GOOD).  MICHAEL WITWER had a brother BENJAMIN WITWER who was born 1841 PA.  (BENJAMIN was married to MARIA TROOP), they had a son JAMES B. WITWER born about 1862, (JAMES was married to ANNA OBERHOLTZER) and they had a son JAMES MONROE WITWER and he was born May 2, 1889.

Long story short, BENJAMIN WITWER & MICHAEL WITWER were brothers, LIZZIE WITWER & JAMES B. WITWER were cousins.

This took me all day to try and sort out, I'm pretty sure that I have correctly connected them, however, please double check your own records if you think this is your relative.

					Kesito by Daniel García Sánchez				


Name: Kesito
Designer: Daniel García Sánchez
Location: Madrid, Spain
Year: 2014
Kesito is a minimalist design created by Spain-based designer Daniel García Sánchez. Kesito is a desktop organizer that helps to organize those little objects that are always on hand – pencils, paper clips, business cards, and smartphones. It is composed of three diamond-shaped pieces, which can combine to form a hexagon. It is made of solid pine, and two of the three pieces have a touch of color.
