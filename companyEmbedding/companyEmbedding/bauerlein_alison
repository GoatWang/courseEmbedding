Founders
 







Alison Bauerlein
 Brenton Taylor
 Byron Myers
Ali, Brenton, and Byron founded Inogen to improve the life of Mae, a beloved grandmother, and the millions of individuals like her using supplemental oxygen therapy. In 2001, as students at the University of California Santa Barbara, the trio received first place honors at a business plan competition sponsored by the Technology Management Program. Subsequently, Mae was presented the first Inogen One in October 2004 and we knew immediately that we’d done something right. Her reaction? “Better than anything I could have ever hoped for.” Today Inogen is committed to improving the lives of millions of oxygen therapy users like Mae worldwide.
Ali, Brenton, and Byron have been recognized as Entrepreneurs of the Year [Ernst & Young], 30 Under 30 Coolest Entrepreneurs in America [Inc. Magazine], 40 Under 40 [Pacific Coast Business Times], among other awards.
