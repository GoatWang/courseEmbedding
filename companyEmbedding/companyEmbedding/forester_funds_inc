Why Hedged Equity Investing?
At Forester, our main objective is long term capital growth.  We believe long term performance is enhanced by focusing on downside protection during unfavorable market conditions or times of increased volatility. The fund invests in undervalued stocks and also uses put options and cash to vary exposure to the market when the portfolio manager feels a defensive position is warranted.   Over the long term we believe our hedged equity strategy has been successful. In the last four down markets in 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2008 the fund has reported positive returns.
 

Performance data quoted represents past performance and does not guarantee future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate, and when sold, your investment may be worth more or less than its original cost. 
        Performance current to the most recent month-end may be lower or higher than performance quoted and can be obtained by calling 800-388-0365. Performance for periods less than one year is not annualized.

            Why mutual funds?
			
		



Foresters Financial has long advocated investing in mutual funds as a key component in building a diversified investment portfolio.
Mutual funds are comprised of a basket of securities, such as equities, bonds and money market instruments, 
and thus offer the benefit of built-in diversification. When you invest in a mutual fund, you essentially pool your money 
with other investors who have similar goals and allow a professional asset management team to make 
the underlying investment decisions about dozens of securities most people cannot afford to buy on their own. 
 
Please Note: Diversification and asset allocation do not guarantee a profit, nor do they eliminate the risk of loss of principal.







Our philosophy: taking the long-term view 
Today, too many individuals and investment firms concentrate solely on short-term performance. At Foresters Financial, we've always stayed focused on the long term. For more than 80 years—through several wars, recessions, and countless bull and bear market cycles—we've consistently provided guidance to help our clients reach their long-term financial goals.   
Our conservative approach to investing means that regardless of what goal you're saving for—owning a home, sending a child to college, or funding your retirement—we encourage a long-term approach to investing. This, in fact, is the timeframe our mutual fund portfolio managers have in mind when they choose investments for the funds they manage. Here are some of the other goals we follow in managing our funds:  
We respect risk at all times: Our appreciation for risk underlies all of the investment decisions we make.
We take fund performance very seriously: While we strive to have as many of our funds as possible in the upper half of their respective peer groups, we don't take on the risks that are necessary to be at the top of those groups.
We're willing to miss the biggest gains in bull markets: We don't think it's prudent to take the risks that are necessary to achieve those gains.  
We seek lower volatility for our funds: Volatility is the enemy of long-term investors. At Foresters Financial, we  believe that using a long-term strategy is the best way to achieve your financial goals. To help you stay on track to reach those goals, we try to minimize volatility as much as we can.



What types of mutual funds are available? 
Foresters Financial offers the First Investors family of mutual funds which contains a wide variety of fund options to meet your short-term and long-term investing needs. You can use individual funds or a diversified portfolio of funds to meet your particular goals and objectives.  
Our mutual funds are divided into two categories: core and non-core. Core funds are a building block in the foundation of your complete investment program. They generally carry a moderate level of risk and are well diversified. Examples of core funds include: Growth & Income, Total Return, and Investment Grade. 
Non-core funds carry a higher degree of risk, but can be a good way to diversify a portfolio or to achieve a specific investment objective. International and Global are non-core funds that can give you access to growth opportunities outside the United States.
Whether you're a novice or an experienced investor, whether your goal is to provide a comfortable retirement, fund a college education, increase current income, save for a new home or provide tax savings, a Foresters Financial registered representative can help you decide on an appropriate mix of core and non-core funds for your investment portfolio.

Equity, or stock funds, invest primarily in companies of varying sizes (small caps, mid-caps, large caps), and can be domestic, international, or both. On balance, equity funds give you the highest potential rate of return, as well as the highest level of risk. First Investors equity funds: Covered Call Strategy, Equity Income, Global, Growth & Income, Hedged U.S. Equity Opportunities Fund, International, Long Short Fund, Opportunity, Real Estate, Select Growth and Special Situations.



Taxable bond funds invest in securities issued by corporations and by the U.S. and foreign governments, including government agencies, as well as mortgage-backed bonds and asset-backed bonds. The interest income from these bond funds is taxable at both the federal and state level. Taxable bond funds can be the best choice if you seek current income. First Investors taxable bond funds: Limited Duration High Quality Bond, Government, Investment Grade, Floating Rate, Strategic Income, International Opportunities Bond and Fund For Income.



Also known as "Balanced Funds," these types of portfolios are a mix of stocks, bonds and cash, and are a suitable option if you want total return and diversification. First Investors mixed asset allocation funds: Total Return and Balanced Income.



These funds mainly invest in securities issued by municipalities to finance public projects such as bridges, schools and highways. The primary benefit of investing in municipal bonds is their tax-exempt status. Depending on where you live, you may be able to invest in municipal bond funds that are "triple tax exempt" (exempt from local, state and federal government taxes).  First Investors municipal bond funds: Tax Exempt Income and Tax Exempt Opportunities, plus these 12 single state funds: California Tax Exempt, Connecticut Tax Exempt, Massachusetts Tax Exempt, Michigan Tax Exempt, Minnesota Tax Exempt, New Jersey Tax Exempt, New York Tax Exempt, North Carolina Tax Exempt, Ohio Tax Exempt, Oregon Tax Exempt, Pennsylvania Tax Exempt and Virginia Tax Exempt.



Money market funds invest mainly in securities known for their high credit quality, and therefore tend to have the lowest level of risk as well as the lowest level of potential return on your money. 
An example is the First Investors Government Cash Management fund. This fund attempts to maintain a constant share price of $1.00, however, this share price is not guaranteed. 





 
 All investing involves risk, including the risk that you may lose money. Mutual fund shares, when redeemed may be worth more or less than their original cost. Nothing herein should be construed as a recommendation to buy or sell a mutual fund share or other security.
How to obtain a prospectus 
For more information about any First Investors Fund , you may obtain a free prospectus by downloading it from our website, contact your registered representative, or call 800 423 4026. You should consider the investment objectives, risks, fees or charges, and expenses carefully before investing. The prospectus contains this and other information, and all applicable prospectuses should be read carefully before you invest or send money. An investment in one of these products is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or any other government agency.

Forester Value Fund


Ticker
 
FVALX - Class N Share
FVILX - Class I Share


Inception Date
9/9/99


Objective
Maximum long-term capital growth


Strategy
The Fund invests in the stocks of large U.S. companies that it believes are undervalued and have great

                  appreciation potential. It may also take defensive positions when the manager believes that the overall stock market is highly 

                  valued or that market conditions warrant it.

                  The Fund generally purchases a stock only at a price Forester Capital Management ("Forester Capital"), the Fund’s investment

                  manager deems significantly below the intrinsic value of the company. 


We  generally buys stocks for the Fund that have what we believe is  exceptional appreciation potential, due to the stock’s price being significantly below the intrinsic value of the company.  We view these stocks as bargain stock and seek to purchase the best bargain stocks in each market sector.  This diversifies the portfolio while maintaining the focus on bargain stocks. 


              For the Fund, we buy more earnings, assets and dividends than the overall market, with each investment dollar.  This allows the Fund to start with a lead versus the market and not have to rely as much on future growth. 
Forester Discovery Fund


Ticker
INTLX


Inception Date
9/9/99


Objective
Maximum long-term capital growth 


Strategy
 The Forester Discovery Fund is a diversified, no-load mutual fund for investors   seeking long-term growth of capital by investing primarily in common   stocks from countries outside of the United States, with added emphasis on   capital protection in unfavorable market conditions. The fund generally invests   at least 65% of its net assets in non-US companies.  These companies may operate   in developed countries, such as the Western Europe, Japan, and Canada, as well   as in firms based in emerging markets, typically in the Far East, Latin America,   and Eastern Europe.  There are no restrictions on the size of companies in which   the fund may invest.  The fund’s objective is maximum long-term capital growth. 


The Fund generally purchases a stock only at a price deemed significantly below the intrinsic value of the company—Forester Capital’s estimate of the amount a buyer would pay to own the entire company—after performing its own fundamental analysis of the company.

 FORESTER FUNDS INC (Form: 497K, Received: 03/22/2013 12:40:01) 































	Forester Value Fund



	Class I Share (FVILX)






	As with all mutual funds, the Securities and Exchange Commission has not approved or disapproved any of the Funds shares




	or determined whether this prospectus is truthful or complete.  Anyone who tells you otherwise is committing a criminal offense

	.








	INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE






	The Forester Value Fund seeks maximum long-term capital growth.  









	FEES AND EXPENSES OF THE FORESTER VALUE FUND  






	The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy and hold shares of the Forester Value Fund.














	ANNUAL FUND OPERATING EXPENSES

	(expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment)




	CLASS I






	Management Fees




	0.89%






	Other Expenses




	0.10%






	Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses





	0.03%







	Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses

	(1)






	1.02%










	(1)    The Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses in this fee table will not correlate to the expense ratio in the Fund's financial statements because the financial statements include only the direct operating expenses incurred by the Fund, not the indirect costs of investing in other mutual funds.






	Example



	This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Forester Value Fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds.





	The example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the end of these periods.  The Example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the same.  Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions, your costs would be:















	 






	1 Year








	3 Years








	5 Years








	10 Years








	Class I




	$102




	$325




	$562




	$1,248






	Portfolio Turnover  



	The Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or turns over its portfolio).  A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account.  These costs, which are not reflected in annual operating expenses or in the Example affect the Funds performance.  During the most recent fiscal year, the Funds portfolio turnover rate was 35.30% of the average value of its portfolio.









	PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGIES  






	The Fund invests in the stocks of large U.S. companies that it believes are undervalued and have great appreciation potential.  It may also take defensive positions when the manager believes that the overall stock market is highly valued or that market conditions warrant it.





	The Fund generally purchases a stock only at a price Forester Capital Management ("Forester Capital"), the Funds investment manager (the manager), deems significantly below the intrinsic value of the company - Forester Capital's estimate of the amount a buyer would pay to own the entire company.  Forester Capital performs its own fundamental analysis of the company.  





	The Fund places special focus on companies whose current market prices are low in relation to earnings and have great appreciation potential. In addition to stocks with low prices relative to earnings, Forester Capital also considers factors such as the following about the issuer:





	·


	Book-to-market value


	·


	Price-to-cash flow ratio


	·


	Price-to-sales ratio


	·


	Earnings estimates for the next 12 months


	·


	Five-year return on equity


	Under normal market conditions, the fund invests at least 65% of its net assets (at market value at the time of purchase) in the common stocks of large companies that have market capitalizations greater than $5.0 billion.  The fund may emphasize sectors more or less than the S&P 500.  The Fund may also invest in stock index options.  





	The Fund may sell a stock when Forester Capital thinks the stock is too expensive compared to Forester Capital's estimate of the company's intrinsic value, changing circumstances affect the original reasons for a company's purchase, a company exhibits deteriorating fundamentals or more attractive alternatives exist.





	MARKET EXPOSURE:  In order to try to enhance returns, the manager may vary the Fund's exposure to the overall stock market.  The manager may reduce market exposure when the manager believes that the overall stock market is highly valued or that market conditions warrant it.  During these defensive periods, the Fund may invest some or all of its assets in stock index options, money market funds, U.S. Treasury or U.S. Agency fixed income instruments with a maturity of less than five years.









	PRINCIPAL RISK






	Like all mutual funds that invest in stocks, the Forester Funds take investment risks and it is possible for you to lose money by investing in the Fund.  The manager's ability to choose suitable investments for the Fund has a significant impact on the Fund's ability to achieve its investment objective.  The principal factors that might reduce the Fund's return include:






	Stock Market Risk:

	 The Fund invests primarily in common stocks and other equity securities.  Over time, stocks have shown greater growth than other types of securities.  In the short-term, however, stock prices fluctuate widely in response to company, market, economic or other news.






	Value Investing Risk:

	 From time to time "value" investing falls out of favor with investors.  When it does, there is the risk that the market will not recognize a company's improving fundamentals as quickly as it normally would.  During these periods, the Fund's relative performance may suffer.






	Emphasize a Sector:

	 If the Fund has a higher percentage of its total assets invested in a particular sector, changes affecting that sector may have a significant impact on the Fund's overall portfolio.






	Varying Market Exposure:

	 If the Fund is in a defensive or offensive position, the Fund may not go in the same direction as the market and the Fund's performance may suffer.






	Large-Size Company Risks:  

	The Fund normally invests the majority of its assets in larger companies.  Larger, more established companies may be unable to respond quickly to new competitive challenges like changes in consumer tastes or innovative smaller competitors.  Also, larger companies are sometimes unable to attain the high growth rates of successful, smaller companies, especially during extended periods of economic expansion.






	Options Risk:  

	The primary risks associated with options investments are: (1) the risk that changes in the value of the investment will not correlate to changes in the value of the underlying security, which may result in imperfect hedging of a portfolio position, (2) options are more volatile than stocks and therefore may be subject to disproportionately larger gains or losses; and (3)  the risk that the use of an option strategy to enhance the return of a portfolio will fail, with negative consequences to the Fund.  Put options may not go in the same direction as the market and the Funds performance may suffer.  Accordingly, the Fund will limit its exposure to options to 5% of the value of the portfolio, based on the cost of the options, at any one time.










	Fixed Income Risk:  

	The primary risk associated with fixed income are: (1) the fixed income instrument may not go in the same direction as the market and the Funds performance may suffer; (2) interest rates may rise, reducing the principal value of the instrument; and (3) the credit rating of the U.S. Agency instrument may materially differ from a similar U.S. Treasury.








	Turnover Risk:

	 Portfolio turnover refers to the rate at which the securities held by the Fund are replaced. The higher the rate, the higher the transactional and brokerage costs associated with the turnover which may reduce the Funds return, unless the securities traded can be bought and sold without corresponding commission costs.  Active trading of securities may also increase the Funds realized short-term capital gains or losses, which may affect the taxes you pay as a Fund shareholder.  Short-term capital gains are taxed as ordinary income under federal income tax laws.


	An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit, and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or any other Government agency.





	Because of these risks the Fund is a suitable investment only for those investors who have long-term investment goals.  Prospective investors who are uncomfortable with an investment that will increase and decrease in value should not invest in the Fund.

	The Bar Chart and Table set out below help show the returns and risks of investing in the Fund.  They show changes in the Funds yearly performance over the lifetime of the Fund and compare the Funds average annual returns for periods of one year and since inception to an appropriate index during corresponding periods.  You should be aware that the Funds past performance (before and after taxes) is no guarantee or indication that the Fund will perform similarly in the future.






	Annual Total Returns






	*For the period 6/5/09 (inception) to 12/31/09.





	The year-to-date return for Class I shares as of June 30, 2012 was 1.31%.  





	From 6/5/09 (the share classs inception) to 12/31/11, the highest quarterly return was 11.42% for the quarter ended 9/30/09.  The lowest quarterly return was -4.75% for the quarter ended 3/31/10).   






	Average Annual Total Returns



	The table below shows the Fund's Class I shares average annual total returns (before and after taxes) and the change in value of a broad-based market index over various periods ended December 31, 2011.  The information provides some indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by showing changes in the Funds performance from year to year.  The Funds past performance (before and after taxes) is not necessarily an indication of how the Fund will perform in the future.





	After-tax returns are calculated using the highest individual federal marginal income tax rate in effect at the time of each distribution and assumed sale, but do not include the impact of state and local taxes.  





	Your actual after-tax returns depend on your own tax situation and may differ from those shown.  After-tax returns reflect past tax effects and are not relevant to investors who hold their Fund shares in a tax-deferred account  (including a 401(k) or IRA account), or to investors that are tax-exempt.

	If you purchase Fund shares through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank or trust company), the Fund and its related companies may pay the intermediary for the sale of Fund shares and related services.  These payments may create conflicts of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another investment.  Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediarys website for more information.
