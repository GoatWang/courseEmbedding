Fleetmatics Appoints Former ADP Executive Robert Dahdah as Senior 
      Vice President of Global Sales






April 05, 2016 08:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time



DUBLIN & BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fleetmatics Group PLC (NYSE: FLTX), a leading global provider of mobile 
      workforce solutions for service-based businesses of all sizes delivered 
      as software-as-a-service (SaaS), today announced the appointment of 
      Robert Dahdah to the newly-created position of Senior Vice President of 
      Global Sales. Mr. Dahdah will be responsible for leading and executing 
      the Company’s global sales strategy and will report to Jill Ward, 
      President and Chief Operating Officer. In this role, Mr. Dahdah will be 
      charged with overseeing the Company’s global sales efforts across both 
      the SMB and Enterprise markets and driving overall adoption of the 
      Company’s industry-leading SaaS solutions.
    


      “We are delighted to welcome Robert to the team,” stated Jill Ward, 
      President and Chief Operating Officer of Fleetmatics. “Rob brings 
      extensive experience working in a wide range of sales environments, from 
      web selling to direct enterprise sales, as well as a proven track record 
      in launching and building new international markets and leading 
      high-performing sales teams. He is exceptionally well qualified to help 
      lead the Company through its next stage of growth.”
    

      Most recently, Mr. Dahdah was a Senior Vice President of Global Sales 
      for SunGard Financial Systems, a leading global software and services 
      provider to insurance and financial institutions which was acquired by 
      FIS (NYSE: FIS) in November 2015. Prior to SunGard, Mr. Dahdah was at 
      ADP (NASDAQ: ADP), a global provider of payroll and human capital 
      management technology and services, where he led sales and distribution 
      for over 100 countries outside of the United States. During his 21-year 
      tenure at ADP, he was also the leader of the global sales operations 
      team supporting over 7,000 sales associates worldwide and served in 
      various domestic and international positions of increasing 
      responsibility. He earned his Bachelor’s Degree from Syracuse University.
    

      “I am excited to be joining the established leader in one of the largest 
      and least penetrated sectors in the global technology market,” said 
      Robert Dahdah, Senior Vice President of Global Sales. “I look forward to 
      the challenge of leading the Company’s global sales efforts as we drive 
      our next stage of growth.”
