Jones Act/Maritime

The Firm has extensive experience and knowledge when it comes to maritime law and claims, including the Jones Act, the Death on the High Seas Act and the Longshore Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act.  As a maritime employee, you are probably covered under either the Jones Act or the Longshore Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act.The Jones Act is one of few federal laws that truly protects employees who are involved in workplace accidents.  Unlike the typical case where workers’ compensation coverage is present, in which case suit against the employer is barred, the Jones Act allows an injured employee to file suit directly against his or her employer, and collect money damages for any of the employer’s (or co-employee’s) negligence which may have caused or contributed to the employee’s injury.  The Jones Act also has other procedural and substantive advantages over the typical case, maritime related or otherwise.  There are special types of rules which define who classifies as a “seaman” and therefore who can sue under the Jones Act.  Accordingly, it is crucial that you contact a knowledgeable and experienced attorney in order to maximize your recovery.If you do not classify as a seaman, and therefore are not eligible to sue under the Jones Act, you may still be eligible for compensation under the Longshore Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act, which is a form of workers’ compensation coverage for maritime employees who do not classify as seamen.  Even if you are not covered under either the Jones Act or the Longshore Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act, any employee, passenger or other person may be covered under general maritime law.  There are specific laws which cover injuries and damages sustained to those involved in any incident or accident in the areas defined by maritime. These areas usually include ships, vessels, harbors, piers, platforms and others.  The Firm can help those, and their loved ones, who have been injured or killed in any type of maritime accident.If you are in need of legal representation for a Jones Act or maritime case, please call the Firm for your free and confidential consultation.  Please call us now.

Construction Litigation

The Firm has substantial experience representing general contractors, subcontractors and architects in construction related disputes and injuries, including cases involving serious personal injury and death, lien and bond claims, claims for extra time and money, disruption and delay claims, construction defects and design disputes, property damage and related insurance coverage and claims issues.  While we will vigorously prosecute and defend our clients’ interests, the Firm is sensitive to the business relationships between our clients and those with whom they regularly work and, when appropriate, will work towards finding creative solutions to preserve important relationships.  Of course, when litigation is the only alternative, we are ready, willing and able to act accordingly.

About the Firm

Firm Overview

		Weinberg & Weinberg LLP is a litigation firm specializing in and dedicated to the prosecution and trial of personal injury and wrongful death disputes.  The Firm has a well-earned reputation for recovering just compensation for those people who have been injured or killed by the negligence or wrongful conduct of others.  In our brief history, we have developed a reputation for aggressively and tenaciously representing our clients' interests.  The Firm, both its attorneys and staff, are committed to treating each client with respect and care as we guide them through the litigation process.  We accept all personal injury cases on a contingency fee basis, which means that you risk nothing financially, as we advance all of the expenses necessary to investigate and present your case to a judge and/or jury.  Additionally, we collect no attorney's fees and recover none of our expenses unless we are successful in collecting damages for you.  It's simple: we only "win" if you win!  

The Firm also represents plaintiffs in a wide variety of other litigation, including bad faith insurance litigation, employment litigation and consumer law.  The Firm also represents individuals and businesses, as plaintiffs and defendants, in a wide variety of commercial litigation and other civil litigation matters.  Please click onto some of the Areas of Practice inserts to learn more about what we do.

Weinberg & Weinberg LLP was founded by Steven J. Weinberg and Michael Weinberg in 2001.  The firm is, in many ways, a merger of its principals' backgrounds and experiences.  Steven Weinberg's entire career has been dedicated to the representation of people injured or killed as a result of someone else's negligence or wrongful conduct.  Michael Weinberg started out his career at a prominent Houston trial firm, where he primarily represented defendants in a wide variety of civil litigation matters, having later practiced with one of the largest firms in Texas, where he primarily represented clients in a variety of commercial litigation matters.

Drawing on Steven Weinberg's experience in prosecuting personal injury, catastrophic injury and death cases, and Michael Weinberg's experience in general civil litigation matters, the firm was formed, combining the intimacy and hands-on responsiveness of a small firm with the depth and range of experience and ability more typically found in firms several times our size.  Thus, while the core of the firm's practice lies in the prosecution and trial of personal injury, catastrophic injury and wrongful death disputes, the firm also represents individuals and businesses, as plaintiffs and defendants, in a wide variety of commercial litigation and other civil litigation matters.

We have the talent and resources to handle virtually any type of case, yet we are small enough to give each and every client the personal and attention they deserve.  Our clients do not spend hours on the telephone talking to a battery of paralegals or "legal assistants."  Our clients talk to us, the lawyers.  In our brief history, we have developed a reputation for aggressively and tenaciously representing our clients' interests in an efficient, cost effective manner, whether it's a simple automobile accident or slip and fall case, a serious automobile or industrial accident involving serious injury or death, or a complex business dispute.
