Novus and Cheyne Capital Management LLP Form Partnership to Build Next-Generation Fixed Income Analytics Platform
Mar 1 17
Novus and Cheyne Capital Management LLP announced that they have entered into a partnership to build an innovative fixed-income analytics platform for both allocators and managers within the investment community. The platform will harness the power of Novus’ robust data alongside Cheyne’s extensive credit investing expertise to provide risk-based analytics and portfolio insights typically not widely available in fixed income, to improve investment skills, portfolio optimisation and performance potential. The Credit team at Cheyne Capital will work closely with Novus’ engineers and data scientists to help inform and shape key product decisions to create this cutting-edge platform for institutional allocators and managers. Together, the partnership will look to contribute to the growing understanding of factor investing in credit markets. It will also assist Cheyne in advancing its own skillset and support Novus in expanding its analytics offering across the fixed income asset class, a field whose complexity has often confounded the provision of in-depth analytics.

Cheyne Capital is a London-based alternative asset manager. The firm launched its first fund in 2000 and today specializes in Real Estate Debt, Social Property Impact, Corporate Credit, Convertible Bonds, Event Driven Investing and Equities.
The Cheyne group currently employs approximately 150 people with its offices in London, Switzerland, Bermuda and New York City.
The firm's co-founder, Stuart Fiertz, was a member of the 14-person Hedge Fund Working Group, which devised best practice policies regarding financial valuation, transparency, and risk management.[1][2] Those guidelines evolved into what is now the Hedge Fund Standards Board, a self-regulatory body of which Cheyne is a member.[3] It is also a member of the Alternative Investment Management Association (AIMA).[4], the global representative of the alternative investment industry. In 2003, the company signed a three-year contract with Mark-it Partners for the daily supply of credit derivatives swap data.[5] In April 2014, Stuart Fiertz was appointed as a Director of the AIMA Global Council and is Chair of AIMA’s Alternative Credit Council, a committee of alternative asset management firms which are financing the real economy.[6]
History[edit]
It was founded in 1999 by Jonathan Lourie and Stuart Fiertz who are currently the CEO and President of Cheyne Capital Management (UK) LLP respectively.[7] At its launch it was authorised and regulated by the U.K. Financial Services Authority (FSA).
Dublin controversy[edit]
In May 2015 Cheyne Capital were embroiled in a scandal involving an associate named D2 Capital in Dublin.
Inspectors working for the Irish Government removed some material from D2 Capital office while inspecting the general circumstances behind the assembly of a large site on a prominent Dublin Street by D2 Capital acting as a local agent for a proposed property development led and financed mainly by Cheyne Capital and in the assembly of which development site some 460 people lost their jobs in a long established Dublin Department Store named Clerys.[8][9]
