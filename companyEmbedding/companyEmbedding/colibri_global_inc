                                    I am writing to unequivocally recommend Morgan Babbs and James Dower of Colibri. I met them while they were students at Tufts. As the Founding Director Emeritus of the Institute for Global Leadership, I have mentored many entrepreneurial students - I count Morgan and James among them for their passionate, ethical sensibility and non-polemical thinking. Moreover, they are focusing on an important need.  They are part of a small yet critical field focusing on the financing & distribution gap in underserved communities. In my experience with James and Morgan, both have demonstrated an undeniable and natural ability to lead with poise and maturity, and to organize very complex projects and endeavors. An AAI grant to Colibrí would mean effective and timely impact led by two thoughtful and committed leaders. They already have customers and strong operations. AAI's support would be critical for getting Colibrí through the "pioneer gap" phase.

                                    Morgan is my mentee in Clinton Global Initiative Lead, a group in which young industry leaders are paired with professionals. She has an unfailing commitment to Colibrí. She says there is no such thing as a “yes or no” answer in the face of a dilemma. It has to be “yes”. She and James reinstated customer confidence after hardware failures during a pilot by going out to last mile communities and personally talking to clients. Morgan laid the foundation for Colibrí as a door-to-door sales person in Nicaragua so she could figure out what people wanted. If Colibrí has been able to get to the stage it is at now and attract the kind of resources it has, the future is promising. Morgan & James are committed for the future. Morgan is ambitious, direct, and impressively skilled at building a team beyond those directly employed by Colibrí. Colibrí is investment ready. I believe in their model. Colibrí’s traction is real and Microsoft’s grant will allow them to reach their next 1,000 customers.                                 












Bill Barhydt
 Founder & CEO at ABRA


                                    I am Founder and CEO of Abra, the world’s first global mobile money service and I serve on the Board of Advisors of Colibrí. I’m writing in support of one of Colibrí’s founders, James Downer. James worked on the Abra team during the summer of 2015 to gain experience at a young startup focused on a customer base similar to Colibrí’s. In getting to know James, it was clear to me that his motivation wasn’t just mobile money, but in deploying tools and technologies to the economically vulnerable. James always spoke with passion about what was next for him, specifically the gains that solar grid parity brings for the poorest 2 billion people. James is particularly effective at getting people fired up about what drives him. His intuition for which technologies will propel the future is going to keep Colibrí ahead, and what others are just talking about James is actively doing.  I’ve bet on many young entrepreneurs and I would bet on James again.
