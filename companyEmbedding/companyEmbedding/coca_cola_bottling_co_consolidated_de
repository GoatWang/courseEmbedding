Charlotte, N.C.-based Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated announced a $10 million investment in its Baltimore manufacturing plant, located at 701 North Kresson St. Mayor Catherine Pugh joined company officials on a tour of the production center to learn more about the investment and manufacturing processes at the facility.
Coca-Cola Consolidated took over operations in Baltimore from Coca-Cola Refreshments on April 29, 2016. It then renovated the 154,000-square-foot manufacturing center and made significant improvements to the site, it says. The company also upgraded one of the canning lines to include 7.5-ounce and 12-ounce ‘sleek’ can products in the production lineup. Currently, the Baltimore manufacturing center primarily makes 12-ounce canned carbonated soft drinks such as Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Coke Zero, Sprite and caffeine-free Diet Coke.
“We are proud to celebrate Coca-Cola Consolidated’s investment in the Baltimore community,” said Pugh in a statement. “Any time a company invests and expands its operations here, it encourages job creation and the kind of economic development that will bring prosperity to the city.”
The Baltimore production facility currently employs 112 people, with more than 490 teammates in the wider Baltimore region. Coca-Cola Consolidated has a total of 10 facilities and more than 1,720 employees in Maryland.
“Coke Consolidated is proud to invest in and serve the people of Baltimore. This investment reinforces our commitment to our Baltimore teammates and to providing this community the best beverages in the world,” Coca-Cola Consolidated Plant Manager Reshawn Lowe said in a statement.
Coca-Cola has a long history in Baltimore, with the production plant celebrating its 50th anniversary last year, it says. BI

	Cleveland Letter of Intent.

	On February 6, 2017, Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated (the 

	Company

	) and The
	Coca-Cola Company entered into a

	non-binding

	letter of intent (the 

	February 2017 LOI

	) pursuant to which Coca-Cola Refreshments USA, Inc. (

	CCR

	), a wholly-owned subsidiary
	of The Coca-Cola Company, would grant the Company certain exclusive rights for the distribution, promotion, marketing and sale of beverage products owned and licensed by The Coca-Cola Company in territory in and around Cleveland, Ohio (the
	

	Cleveland Territory

	) currently served by another unaffiliated Coca-Cola bottler (the 

	Cleveland Transaction

	). The February 2017 LOI contemplates that CCR would acquire this distribution business in the Cleveland
	Territory from the existing Coca-Cola bottler immediately prior to selling it to the Company. Pursuant to the February 2017 LOI, the Company and The Coca-Cola Company also amended their

	non-binding

	letter of
	intent dated February 8, 2016, as described in the Companys Current Report on Form

	8-K

	filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 

	SEC

	) on February 10, 2016 and
	filed as Exhibit 99.2 thereto, to remove the portion of the distribution territory located in northern West Virginia served by CCRs distribution facilities in Wheeling and Fairmont, West Virginia from the distribution territory expansion
	transaction contemplated by such letter of intent and agreed that CCR will sell the distribution rights and assets associated with such territory to another unaffiliated Coca-Cola bottler. A copy of the Companys news release, dated
	February 7, 2017, announcing the transactions contemplated by the February 2017 LOI is filed as Exhibit 99.1 hereto.


	The exclusive
	rights for the distribution, promotion, marketing and sale of The Coca-Cola Company-owned and -licensed beverage products in the Cleveland Territory would be granted to the Company by CCR pursuant to a final comprehensive beverage agreement (the
	

	Final CBA

	), which agreement is described in the Companys Current Report on Form

	8-K

	filed with the SEC on September 28, 2015 (the 

	September 2015 Form

	8-K


	). A form of the Final CBA was filed as Exhibit 1.1 to the territory conversion agreement filed as Exhibit 10.1 to the September 2015 Form

	8-K.



	The February 2017 LOI also contemplates that CCR would sell, transfer and assign to the Company exclusive rights for the distribution,
	promotion, marketing and sale in the Cleveland Territory of various cross-licensed brands to be acquired by CCR at the time it acquires the Cleveland Territory, subject to the consent of the third-party brand owners. CCR would also sell to the
	Company certain of CCRs distribution assets and the working capital associated therewith, as may be necessary to distribute, promote, market and sell both The Coca-Cola Company-owned and -licensed products and the cross-licensed branded
	products in the Cleveland Territory. The Company would pay to CCR at the closing for the Cleveland Territory a cash amount that reflects the agreed value of the exclusive rights to distribute, promote, market and sell in the Cleveland Territory the
	cross-licensed brands (and the distribution assets and working capital applicable thereto) and the net book value of the distribution assets and working capital associated with the distribution, promotion, marketing and sale of The Coca-Cola
	Company-owned and -licensed products in the Cleveland Territory. The Company would also agree in the Final CBA entered into at the closing of the Cleveland Transaction to make periodic

	sub-bottling

	payments to
	CCR on a continuing basis after such closing for the grant of exclusive rights in the Cleveland Territory for The Coca-Cola Company-owned and -licensed beverage products.


	The February 2017 LOI addresses several other matters related to the ongoing expansion of the Companys distribution territories and the
	implementation of the national product supply system, including the current intentions of the Company and The Coca-Cola Company with respect to (i) the implementation of a binding system governance in the Cleveland Territory consistent with the
	Companys implementation of such governance in its existing distribution territories for Coca-Cola products, and (ii) the process pursuant to which the Company would be provided opportunities to participate economically in the existing
	business of The Coca-Cola Company in the United States involving

	non-direct

	store delivery of products and future

	non-direct

	store delivery of products and/or business
	models developed by The Coca-Cola Company.


	The Cleveland Transaction will be subject to the terms of a definitive purchase agreement. The
	Company anticipates that this definitive agreement would be executed, and that the closing of this transaction would be completed, in 2017. The Companys expectations are subject to change, however, based on the parties ongoing
	discussions, changing business conditions and other future events and uncertainties.






	In addition to the negotiation and execution of the definitive agreement, the February 2017 LOI
	sets forth certain customary conditions to the closing of the Cleveland Transaction, as well as a number of other conditions that the Company and The Coca-Cola Company currently intend to be satisfied prior to such closing and/or to be addressed in
	the definitive agreement, including CCRs acquisition, at or immediately prior to the closing of the Cleveland Transaction, of the distribution business in the Cleveland Territory currently operated by another unaffiliated Coca-Cola bottler.


	The foregoing description of the February 2017 LOI is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such agreement and all
	exhibits thereto, which are filed as Exhibit 99.2 to this Current Report on Form

	8-K

	and incorporated herein by reference.



	Relationship between the Parties.

	The business of the Company consists primarily of the production, marketing and distribution of
	nonalcoholic beverage products of The Coca-Cola Company in the territories the Company currently serves. Accordingly, the Company engages routinely in various transactions with

	The Coca-Cola Company,

	CCR and their affiliates. The Coca-Cola Company also owns approximately 34.8% of the outstanding common stock of the Company, which represents approximately 4.9% of the total voting power of the Companys common stock and class B common stock
	voting together. The Coca-Cola Company also has a designee serving on the Companys Board of Directors. For more information about the relationship between the Company and The Coca-Cola Company, see the description thereof included under
	Related Person Transactions in the Companys Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement for the Companys 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders filed with the SEC on March 30, 2016.



	Forward-Looking Statements.

	This Current Report on Form

	8-K

	contains forward-looking statements
	made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements typically are identified by use of terms such as may, project, should,
	plan, expect, anticipate, believe, estimate and similar words. Except as required by law, the Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements,
	whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. The Companys actual results could differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including the statements under Risk
	Factors found in the Companys Annual Reports on Form

	10-Ks

	and its Quarterly Reports on Form

	10-Qs

	on file with the SEC.

	Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated Signs Letter of Intent to




	Expand Distribution Territory to Cleveland, Ohio



	CHARLOTTE, February 7, 2017  Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated (NASDAQ: COKE) (the Company) today announced
	that it has signed a

	non-binding

	letter of intent with The Coca-Cola Company (the February 2017 Letter of Intent) to expand the Companys distribution territory in northern Ohio. The
	transaction proposed in the February 2017 Letter of Intent would provide exclusive distribution rights for the Company in territories located in and around Cleveland, Ohio currently served by another Coca-Cola bottler. Coca-Cola Refreshments USA,
	Inc. (CCR), a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Coca-Cola Company, is to acquire the distribution business in these territories from that bottler immediately prior to selling it to the Company.


	Since May 2014, the Company has expanded its distribution territory in parts of Delaware, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, North
	Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia and purchased manufacturing facilities in Maryland, Ohio and Virginia.


	Under the February 2017 Letter of Intent, the Company and The Coca-Cola Company also have agreed that distribution territory in northern
	West Virginia associated with CCRs Wheeling and Fairmont, West Virginia sales centers will no longer be part of the distribution territory expansion transaction contemplated by the previously announced

	non-binding

	letter of intent between the Company and The Coca-Cola Company dated February 8, 2016 (the February 2016 Letter of Intent) and will be transferred by The Coca-Cola Company to
	another Coca-Cola bottler. The Company is continuing to work towards definitive agreements with The Coca-Cola Company for the remaining transactions described in the February 2016 Letter of Intent, including (i) the expansion of distribution
	territories in parts of northern Ohio and (ii) the purchase of a manufacturing facility in Twinsburg, Ohio.






	The Company is also continuing to work towards completion of the transactions contemplated
	by other previously announced definitive agreements and

	non-binding

	letters of intent with The Coca-Cola Company and CCR, including:


	 




	 



	●



	 



	closing the remaining transactions contemplated by definitive agreements executed with CCR in September 2016 to acquire
	distribution territory in parts of Indiana, Illinois and Ohio and to acquire two manufacturing facilities in Indiana; and







	 



	●



	 



	reaching a definitive agreement with CCR for the transactions described in the letter of intent dated June 14, 2016
	for the exchange of distribution territory in the southern parts of Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi and a manufacturing facility in Mobile, Alabama for distribution territory in parts of Arkansas, southwestern Tennessee and northwestern Mississippi
	and manufacturing facilities in Memphis, Tennessee and West Memphis, Arkansas.





	The Company is also continuing to
	work towards a definitive agreement with Coca-Cola Bottling Company United, Inc. (United) for the exchange of distribution territory in south-central Tennessee, northwest Alabama, and northwest Florida for distribution territory in and
	around Spartanburg and Bluffton, South Carolina, as proposed in the previously announced letter of intent dated June 14, 2016 between the Company and United.


	The transaction proposed in the February 2017 Letter of Intent is subject to the parties reaching a definitive agreement, with a
	transaction closing expected to occur by the end of 2017. There is no assurance, however, that a definitive agreement will be reached or that the closing of the transaction contemplated by the February 2017 Letter of Intent will occur. The Company
	will file a Current Report on Form

	8-K

	with the Securities and Exchange Commission with additional information regarding the proposed territory expansion transaction and certain other matters addressed in the
	February 2017 Letter of Intent that will be available on the Commissions website at http://www.sec.gov and on the Companys website at http://www.cokeconsolidated.com. For more information about the transaction, including the
	Companys relationship with The Coca-Cola Company, investors should read the information included in the Companys Current Report on Form

	8-K

	that will be filed and all exhibits thereto.

	Dear Frank,


	This letter (Letter of Intent) sets forth the general terms and conditions pursuant to which

	Coca-Cola

	Refreshments USA, Inc. (CCR), a wholly owned subsidiary of

	The Coca-Cola

	Company (TCCC), or one of its affiliates, will grant certain
	exclusive territory rights and sell certain distribution assets to Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated (Bottler), as further described below:


	1.        

	Grant of Exclusive Territory Rights for TCCC
	Beverages




	 & Comprehensive Beverage Agreement

	. As part of the transaction described herein (the Transaction), CCR will grant Bottler certain exclusive rights for the distribution, promotion, marketing and sale
	in the geographic area described in

	Exhibit A

	(the

	Sub-Bottling

	Territory) of

	TCCC-owned

	and

	-licensed

	beverage products. Such rights will be granted via a Comprehensive Beverage Agreement among TCCC, CCR and Bottler in substantially in the form attached as

	Exhibit 1.1

	to the Territory Conversion Agreement, dated September 23, 2015, as
	amended, among TCCC, CCR and Bottler, or as an amendment to Bottlers then-existing Comprehensive Beverage Agreement (in either case, the CBA).


	2.        

	Sale of Exclusive Territory Rights for Certain Cross-Licensed Brands

	.
	CCR will also sell, transfer and assign to Bottler certain exclusive territory rights for the distribution, promotion, marketing and sale in the

	Sub-Bottling

	Territory of the cross-licensed brands (if any)
	then distributed in the

	Sub-Bottling

	Territory and acquired by CCR at the time of its acquisition of the

	Sub-Bottling

	Territory

	(the Cross-Licensed

	Brands). Such sale, transfer and assignment will be via such agreements as are mutually agreed by the parties, including the Definitive Agreement (as defined below), and
	will be subject to the consent of third party brand owners.


	3.        

	Sale of
	Distribution Assets and Working Capital

	. In connection with the grant of the exclusive territory rights referred to in the two preceding sections, CCR will sell, transfer and assign to Bottler certain distribution assets and the working capital
	associated therewith, all as may be necessary to distribute, promote, market and sell the Covered Beverages (as defined in the CBA), Related Products (as defined in the CBA) and Cross-Licensed Brands in the

	Sub-Bottling

	Territory and as will be more particularly described in the Definitive Agreement.


	 


	Classified - Confidential






	4.        

	Participation in System
	Governance Activities

	. Bottler and CCR/TCCC agree to implement in the

	Sub-Bottling

	Territory binding System governance consistent with the Coca-Cola System Governance Letter Agreement described in the CBA
	and their ongoing implementation of such governance in Bottlers existing distribution territories for Coca-Cola products.


	5.        

	Economic Participation

	. As part of the Transaction, Bottler, CCR and
	TCCC intend to implement arrangements under which Bottler will be provided opportunities to participate economically in (a) the U.S. existing

	non-DSD

	businesses, and (b) future

	non-DSD

	products and/or business models. The parties currently anticipate that their implementation of such arrangements will be consistent with their ongoing discussions of the topic with such improvements as the
	parties may mutually agree.


	6.        

	Definitive Agreement

	. The
	transactions described in this Letter of Intent will be subject to the terms of one or more definitive agreements (all such agreements being collectively referred to herein as the Definitive Agreement) in substantially the same form as
	similar agreements entered into by the parties in past transactions.


	7.        

	Economic Consideration for the Transaction

	. In exchange for the grant
	of exclusive territory rights in the

	Sub-Bottling

	Territory for the Covered Beverages and Related Products, the sale of distribution rights in the

	Sub-Bottling

	Territory
	for the Cross Licensed Brands, and the sale of the distribution assets and working capital as described above, Bottler will pay to CCR: (a) a cash amount that reflects (i) the agreed value of the exclusive territory rights in the

	Sub-Bottling

	Territory for the Cross-Licensed Brands (including the distribution assets and working capital applicable thereto), and (ii) the net book value of the other distribution assets and working capital
	used in the

	Sub-Bottling

	Territory, which amount will be payable to CCR at the Closing; and

	(b) sub-bottling

	payments for the grant of exclusive rights for the
	distribution, promotion, marketing and sale of Covered Beverages and Related Products in the

	Sub-Bottling

	Territory, which payments will be made to CCR on a regular basis after the Closing. The calculation of
	such amounts to be paid, and any adjustments to those amounts, will be determined in the same manner as in the most recently executed definitive agreements between the parties for similar transactions.


	8.        

	Conditions to Closing

	. CCR and Bottler each intend to include closing
	conditions in the Definitive Agreement that include, without limitation, CCRs acquisition of the distribution business in the

	Sub-Bottling

	Territory currently operated by another bottler at or
	immediately prior to the Closing, the parties completion of customary transition activities, the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period (and any extension thereof) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of
	1976, execution of the CBA, the grant of applicable third party consents, and the completion of such other legal agreements as are necessary for the consummation of the Transaction. In addition and consistent with past practice in similar
	transactions, the Definitive Agreement will contain mutually agreeable covenants regarding the satisfactory conduct of due diligence activities prior to the Closing.

	Territory in good faith to assist Bottler in obtaining reasonable and customary access to such distribution business for purposes of completing such due diligence.


	13.

The Company makes, sells and distributes Coca-Cola products along with other unique beverages, carrying more than 300 brands and flavors across 16 states to over 43 million people.

Corporate history[edit]
In 1902, the company that later became Coca-Cola Bottling Company Consolidated was founded by the current chairman's great-grandfather, J. B. Harrison.[2] That company was merged with other bottlers to form Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated in 1973.[2] The company was incorporated in 1980,[3] acquired Wometco in 1985,[2] and acquired Sunbelt Coca-Cola in 1991.[2]
Financials[edit]
As of January 1, 2017, The Coca-Cola Company owns approximately 35% of the Company's total outstanding common stock, representing approximately 5% of the total voting power of the Company's combined Common Stock and Class B Common Stock. J. Frank Harrison III, the Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, owns shares of Common Stock and Class B Common Stock representing approximately 86% of the total voting power of the Company's combined stock and Class B Common Stock.
Community involvement[edit]
Coca-Cola Consolidated sponsors local events and many community organizations, including the YMCA.[4] Since 2008, Coca-Cola Consolidated has partnered with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) to promote sustainable water policies, including water reuse practices, to protect and restore aquatic diversity.[5]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
