In recent trading, shares of Integer Holdings Corp have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $41.33, changing hands for $41.60/share.

Short Interest Falls 27.5% For ITGR
The most recent short interest data has been released for the 03/15/2017 settlement date, which shows a 344,389 share decrease in total short interest for Integer Holdings Corp , to 907,531, a decrease of 27.51% since 02/28/2017. Total short interest is just one way to look at short data; another metric that we here at Dividend Channel find particularly useful is the "days to cover" metric because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares traded.

ITGR: Insiders vs. Shorts
The most recent short interest data was recently released for the 01/13/2017 settlement date, and Integer Holdings Corp is one of the most shorted stocks of the Russell 3000, based on 8.43 "days to cover" versus the median component at 5.04. There are a number of ways to look at short data, but one metric that we find particularly useful is the "days to cover" because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares typically traded.

Greatbatch, Inc. Renamed Integer Holdings Corporation
Company Ticker Becomes ITGR



















June 27, 2016 12:03 ET

 | Source: Greatbatch, Inc.





FRISCO, Texas, June  27, 2016  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Following recent approval by shareholders, Greatbatch, Inc. will formally change its name to Integer Holdings Corporation, effective July 1. The Company’s common stock will continue to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, adopting the ticker symbol ITGR (effective July 1).“The distinctive Integer brand represents a substantially more comprehensive product and service portfolio, combining the expertise and innovation of our legacy Greatbatch and Lake Region Medical brands to deliver holistic, high-quality and value-driven solutions,” said Thomas J. Hook, president and chief executive officer.“Integer also recognizes the critical elements—from Associates to technologies—that have been united to form a single, complete offering, reflecting our position as the largest medical device outsource (MDO) manufacturer in the world.”The Integer brand will be introduced as part of the Company’s offerings on a phased basis over the next several months. Greatbatch Medical, Lake Region Medical and Electrochem will continue to serve as customer-facing brands.The Company plans to maintain and celebrate the innovative spirit of three pioneers who built the organization now known as Integer: Albert H. Manwaring, founder of Uniform Tubes (1940), Joseph Fleischhacker Sr., founder of Lake Region Manufacturing (1947), and Wilson Greatbatch, founder of Wilson Greatbatch Ltd. (1970).“I believe these gentlemen would be incredibly proud of how their respective companies have evolved over the decades, and recognize them as remaining true to the values and purpose they instilled in each. Their vision will carry on through Integer, becoming even more powerful with each passing year,” noted Mr. Hook.The new brand does not affect the Company’s corporate structure. The rights of stockholders holding certificated shares under currently outstanding stock certificates and the number of shares represented by those certificates will remain unchanged. The name change does not affect the validity or transferability of any currently outstanding stock certificates nor will it be necessary for stockholders with certificated shares to surrender any stock certificates they currently hold as a result.About Integer Holdings Corporation Integer Holdings Corporation (NYSE:ITGR) is the largest medical device outsource (MDO) manufacturer in the world serving the cardiac, neuromodulation, orthopedics, vascular, advanced surgical and power solutions markets. The company provides innovative, high quality medical technologies that enhance the lives of patients worldwide. In addition, it develops batteries for high-end niche applications in energy, military, and environmental markets. The company's brands include Greatbatch Medical, Lake Region Medical and Electrochem.Investor Relations Contact:
