Career[edit]
Federal Reserve System[edit]
According to Samuel O. Thier, MD, a director on the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s board, its former chairman, and Professor of Medicine and Health Care Policy at Harvard Medical School[3]

"Cathy led the Bank during a challenging period characterized by dramatic changes in world events, the economy and technology.
— Samuel Thier 2007

Minehan was considered by economists to be a more of a monetary dove than a hawk[9] in her economic philosophy.[4]

"Hawks tend to view higher interest rates, slower growth and lower levels of employment as a price worth paying for keeping inflation at bay. Doves take a more lenient view of inflation if it means stronger employment growth, or are less liable to generate alarming forecasts for inflation as they estimate future growth and price-pressures."
— Reuters 2007

Federal Reserve Bank of New York[edit]
From 1968 to 1978 Minehan worked as a bank examiner, analyst, and supervisor at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. She became Assistant Vice President in 1979 and in 1982 she became Vice President. She was promoted to Senior Vice President in 1987 and remained in that position until 1991 when she joined the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.[2]

Since they became romantically involved in 1995, Minehan and Corrigan were under scrutiny about potential conflicts of interest.[17] In 1996 Corrigan was named a partner at Goldman Sachs and in 1997 Minehan was on the Federal Open Market Committee, a committee within the Federal Reserve System, the central banking system of the United States. In 1997 a former Governor of the Federal Reserve Board, John P. LaWare, was quoted in the Boston Globe "questioning whether the relationship might not be in the best interest of the Federal Reserve." The couple consulted the general counsel for the Federal Reserve Bank, J. Virgil Mattingly and lawyers at Goldman Sachs when their relationship became serious.[18]
They reside in Boston, MA. Minehan has two children by a previous marriage, Melissa and Brian Minehan and Corrigan has children from a former marriage.[1][2]

In 2011 Minehan, Henri Termeer and Chad Gifford— fellow Partners HealthCare Board Members— co-chaired the Massachusetts General Hospital bicentennial. The gala, with 1,000 in attendance, also served as a fundraiser, raising approximately $1 million.[19]

Career[edit]
Federal Reserve System[edit]
According to Samuel O. Thier, MD, a director on the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s board, its former chairman, and Professor of Medicine and Health Care Policy at Harvard Medical School[3]

"Cathy led the Bank during a challenging period characterized by dramatic changes in world events, the economy and technology.
— Samuel Thier 2007

Minehan was considered by economists to be a more of a monetary dove than a hawk[9] in her economic philosophy.[4]

"Hawks tend to view higher interest rates, slower growth and lower levels of employment as a price worth paying for keeping inflation at bay. Doves take a more lenient view of inflation if it means stronger employment growth, or are less liable to generate alarming forecasts for inflation as they estimate future growth and price-pressures."
— Reuters 2007

Former President of Federal Reserve Bank of Boston to Begin August 1
BOSTON, April 12, 2011 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- A recognized business and financial expert who led the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston for 13 years as President and CEO, Cathy E. Minehan has been named the new Dean of the Simmons College School of Management, the nation's first MBA program focused on women. Minehan will begin her tenure at Simmons August 1. 
The appointment was announced to the Simmons community today, by Simmons President Helen Drinan. As Dean, Minehan will serve as chief academic and administrative manager of the School of Management, with responsibilities that will include: working with faculty and administrators to define and articulate distinctive academic programs; serving as a compelling spokesperson for the school, the College, and for the mission of training women for positions of power and principled leadership; recruiting and retaining excellent faculty; and creating strategic partnerships on a local, national, and global scale. Minehan will be one of five academic deans at Simmons College.
"I am very impressed by Cathy's extensive record of leadership and accomplishment," said President Drinan. "I believe that she will serve the School of Management and Simmons well, both in the academic world and beyond." 
Minehan served 39 years with the Federal Reserve System, most recently as the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Boston Bank, and a member of the Federal Open Market Committee. She is an expert in financial and economic policy setting, which comprise some of the key responsibilities of the Federal Reserve System. Since leaving the Federal Reserve, Minehan has been chair of the Massachusetts Governor's Council of Economic Advisors, and on a number of corporate and non-profit boards, which include serving as chair of the Massachusetts General Hospital board; and as a board member of Becton Dickenson and Co., VISA, MITRE, and the MassMutual Life Insurance Company. She also is a member of the board of the investment management company of MIT, Partners Health Care System, and a trustee of the University of Rochester. 
 "Cathy Minehan embodies the very best kind of leadership — wise, calm, decisive and with a vision of service that embraces the whole community. As a pioneering woman leader at the Federal Reserve and in her many other roles, she has directly mentored many young women and inspired many more. Her appointment as Dean of the School of Management of Simmons College is wonderful news for Simmons, for Boston, and for generations of women leaders to come," said Susan Hockfield, President of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where Minehan serves on the investment management company board. 
Minehan received a bachelor of arts degree from the University of Rochester, and an MBA from New York University. She has served on the board of directors of the Boston Municipal Research Bureau, the Massachusetts Business Roundtable, and the national Council on Economic Education. She has received several honorary degrees, and was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2009. In 2002, she was named "New Englander of the Year" by the New England Council, and in 2006 she received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Boston Chamber of Commerce.  
The Simmons School of Management (www.simmons.edu/som) is the only business school in the world designed specifically to educate women for power and principled leadership that is accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB). The program is featured in The Princeton Review's "The Best 301 Business Schools" 2010 edition and ranked the #1 MBA program in the U.S. with the "greatest opportunities for women."

Ms. Cathy E. Minehan



	Board Member 2009-2012, 2016



 


Ms. Cathy E. Minehan, managing director of Arlington Advisory Partners, LLC, in Boston, Mass., has more than four decades of experience in financial and economic policymaking. In 2007, she retired after 13 years as president and chief executive officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, one of 12 regional Reserve Banks that, together with the Board of Governors, form the Federal Reserve System. In total, Ms. Minehan served 39 years in the Federal Reserve System, including positions at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and on the the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C.
After her retirement from the Federal Reserve, Ms. Minehan became dean at Simmons College School of Management in Boston.
During her presidency of the Boston Fed, Ms. Minehan served as a member of the Federal Open Market Committee, the body responsible for U.S. monetary policy. She is a recognized expert in payment systems, a main responsibility of the Federal Reserve System. Ms. Minehan chaired the Financial Services Policy Committee, a body that oversees the provision of Reserve Bank payment services, and played key roles in the System's planning for or response to Y2K, interstate banking legislation, and 9/11.
Ms. Minehan joined the Federal Reserve in 1968 as a bank examiner at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. She served in a variety of roles during her career, including positions in public information and accounting control as well as check processing, accounting, funds, and securities. In 1991, she was appointed first vice president and chief operating officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, the first woman in the Federal Reserve System to be so named. She held that position until 1994, when she became the first woman to be appointed the Bank’s president and CEO.
Dedicated to many charitable causes, Ms. Minehan is chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Massachusetts General Hospital and chairs the Massachusetts Governor’s Council of Economic Advisors. She also serves on a number of other non-profit boards, including Partners Health Care System, where she is a member of the compensation, finance, and executive committees, and the University of Rochester, where she chairs the executive committee. She is an Investment Company board member of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as well as a board member and former board chair of The United Way of Massachusetts Bay. A fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, she holds an MBA with distinction from New York University, where she was designated a Distinguished Alumna in 1995. She obtained her undergraduate degree from the University of Rochester.

   News Release     Print This Page      Share This Page            Friday, September 19, 2008  Cathy E. Minehan elected chair of the MGH Board of Trustees   
Cathy E.
Minehan, managing director of Arlington Advisory Partners, today was named
chair of the Massachusetts General Hospital Board of Trustees. She succeeds
Edward P. Lawrence, Esq., who made the decision to step down as chairman of the
hospital’s governing board after leading the 15-member group since 1999. Minehan,
the former president and chief executive officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of
Boston, has
served as an MGH trustee since 2002. She is the first woman to lead the MGH’s
governing body in the organization’s 200-year history.
 
“We are pleased
that Cathy has accepted this vital MGH leadership role,” says Peter L. Slavin,
MD, MGH president. “She has been an invaluable member of our board for the past
six years, willingly sharing her wisdom, perspectives and ideas. The MGH clearly
has benefited from Cathy’s breadth of experience, enthusiasm and steadfast commitment
to advancing the hospital’s mission for our patients and their families, staff
and friends. And with her expanded role on the board, I know that the governance
of this hospital will continue to be in great hands in the years ahead.”
 
Minehan,
who has served as chair of the MGH Finance Committee, has brought extensive business
insight and strategic guidance to the hospital’s financial operations. With a
keen eye, she worked to foster the integration of business, hospital operations
and strategic growth, helping to lead the Finance Committee through significant
capital decisions, including the approval the Building for the Third Century, a
10-story, 530,000-square-foot clinical facility now under construction, as well
as the purchase of Charles River Plaza office space. In addition to her role as
an MGH trustee, she has served as a member of the boards of Partners HealthCare
and the MGH Institute of Health Professions.
 
Minehan,
along with her husband, E. Gerald Corrigan, are longtime champions of the MGH.
They have provided significant support for the capital needs of the hospital
and for the care of women's cardiac health. 
In recognition of that support, the hospital established the Linda Anne
Barlow Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit and the Elizabeth Anne and Karen
Barlow Corrigan Women’s Heart Health Program at the MGH.
 
“MGH is an
incredible and in many ways unique asset to health care here in Boston and
the world more broadly,” Minehan says. “I am continually awed by the work that
is done there, and I look forward to contributing to that work even more
directly as chair of the MGH board.”
 
Minehan takes
over a board that has benefited from the strong and steady leadership of Ed Lawrence,
a retired partner at Ropes and Gray. During his nine-year tenure as MGH chairman,
Lawrence helped the institution achieve many significant milestones, including creating
and expanding programs aimed at improving community health, building the Yawkey
Center for Outpatient Care and the Richard B. Simches Research Center, and establishing
the Massachusetts General Hospital/Massachusetts General Physicians
Organization Center for Quality and Safety.
 
“We have
been fortunate indeed to have such outstanding leadership of our board,” Slavin
says. “Ed has been active, engaged and truly committed to advancing the MGH as
a health care resource locally, nationally and globally. We are deeply grateful
for his guidance and service, and I look forward to his continued involvement
in the future of this hospital.” 
 
Minehan earned
her bachelor’s degree in political science from the University of Rochester in
1968 and her masters in business degree with distinction from New York
University in 1977. She began her nearly 40-year career at the Federal Reserve Bank
of New York in 1968. In 1991, she moved to the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston,
where she was the first vice president and chief operating officer. In 1994,
she became the bank’s president and chief executive officer and a member of the
Federal Open Market Committee. Her service continued until mid-2007.
 
In addition
to her MGH and Partners relationships, Minehan serves on the board of the
University of Rochester and as chair of the Massachusetts Governor’s Council of
Economic Advisors. She serves on the corporate boards of Becton, Dickinson and
Co. and Visa, Inc.

Career[edit]
Federal Reserve System[edit]
According to Samuel O. Thier, MD, a director on the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s board, its former chairman, and Professor of Medicine and Health Care Policy at Harvard Medical School[3]

"Cathy led the Bank during a challenging period characterized by dramatic changes in world events, the economy and technology.
— Samuel Thier 2007

Minehan was considered by economists to be a more of a monetary dove than a hawk[9] in her economic philosophy.[4]

"Hawks tend to view higher interest rates, slower growth and lower levels of employment as a price worth paying for keeping inflation at bay. Doves take a more lenient view of inflation if it means stronger employment growth, or are less liable to generate alarming forecasts for inflation as they estimate future growth and price-pressures."
— Reuters 2007

Federal Reserve Bank of New York[edit]
From 1968 to 1978 Minehan worked as a bank examiner, analyst, and supervisor at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. She became Assistant Vice President in 1979 and in 1982 she became Vice President. She was promoted to Senior Vice President in 1987 and remained in that position until 1991 when she joined the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.[2]

Personal[edit]
Minehan is married to E. Gerald Corrigan, a partner and Managing Director at Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.. Since 2008 he was chairman of Goldman Sachs Bank USA, the bank holding company of Goldman Sachs.[14] He was the seventh President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (1 January 1985 – 19 July 1993)[15] and Vice-Chairman of the Federal Open Market Committee.[16] Corrigan is also a member of the Group of Thirty, a prestigious and influential international financial advisory body which includes financiers and academics.[14]
Since they became romantically involved in 1995, Minehan and Corrigan were under scrutiny about potential conflicts of interest.[17] In 1996 Corrigan was named a partner at Goldman Sachs and in 1997 Minehan was on the Federal Open Market Committee, a committee within the Federal Reserve System, the central banking system of the United States. In 1997 a former Governor of the Federal Reserve Board, John P. LaWare, was quoted in the Boston Globe "questioning whether the relationship might not be in the best interest of the Federal Reserve." The couple consulted the general counsel for the Federal Reserve Bank, J. Virgil Mattingly and lawyers at Goldman Sachs when their relationship became serious.[18]
They reside in Boston, MA. Minehan has two children by a previous marriage, Melissa and Brian Minehan and Corrigan has children from a former marriage.[1][2]
Philanthropy[edit]
In 2008, when Minehan and Gerry Corrigan donated $20 million to the Women’s Heart Health Program and throughout the Massachusetts General Hospital Heart Center, the Heart Centre was renamed the Corrigan Minehan Heart Center and the Linda Anne Barlow Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit and the Elizabeth Anne and Karen Barlow Corrigan Women’s Heart Health Programs were established at MGH.[10]
In 2011 Minehan, Henri Termeer and Chad Gifford— fellow Partners HealthCare Board Members— co-chaired the Massachusetts General Hospital bicentennial. The gala, with 1,000 in attendance, also served as a fundraiser, raising approximately $1 million.[19]

Career[edit]
Federal Reserve System[edit]
According to Samuel O. Thier, MD, a director on the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s board, its former chairman, and Professor of Medicine and Health Care Policy at Harvard Medical School[3]

"Cathy led the Bank during a challenging period characterized by dramatic changes in world events, the economy and technology.
— Samuel Thier 2007

Minehan was considered by economists to be a more of a monetary dove than a hawk[9] in her economic philosophy.[4]

"Hawks tend to view higher interest rates, slower growth and lower levels of employment as a price worth paying for keeping inflation at bay. Doves take a more lenient view of inflation if it means stronger employment growth, or are less liable to generate alarming forecasts for inflation as they estimate future growth and price-pressures."
— Reuters 2007

Federal Reserve Bank of New York[edit]
From 1968 to 1978 Minehan worked as a bank examiner, analyst, and supervisor at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. She became Assistant Vice President in 1979 and in 1982 she became Vice President. She was promoted to Senior Vice President in 1987 and remained in that position until 1991 when she joined the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.[2]
Federal Reserve Bank of Boston[edit]
Main article: Federal Reserve Bank of Boston
From 1991 to 1994 Minehan was the Vice President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, one of 12 regional Reserve Banks that together with the Board of Governors in Washington D.C. form the Federal Reserve System,[1] which charts "the nation's monetary policy and ensures smooth operation of the banking system."[5] Through the years Minehan "served various roles in Public Information and Accounting Control as well as Check Processing, Accounting, Funds and Securities." In 1991, she was appointed First Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. She was the first female President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.[6]
New England economic development[edit]
Minehan has placed much focus on the structural economic development within New England, including community development, public education, and training.[1]
Board member and trustee[edit]
Minehan is "connected to 63 board members in 6 different organizations across 9 different industries."[7]
Minehan has served on many Boards of Directors including Partners HealthCare, Visa (2007-),[2] Massachusetts General Hospital Trustee,[2] Massachusetts Mutual Life (2009-),[2] Boston Economic Club,[2] She has served on a variety of civic, professional and educational boards, including the School of Social Science Urban Affairs, & Public Policy at Northeastern University, Becton Dickinson (2007-)[2] the Boston Private Industry Council, Massachusetts General Hospital (CEO 2008-), the United Way of Massachusetts Bay and Merrimack Valley,[2] Jobs for Massachusetts, The New England Council, the University of Rochester, and the Carroll School of Management at Boston College.[1][10]
She was Vice Chairman of the Boston Private Industry Council and the National Council on Economic Education.[2] She was an administrator and trustee of the Universities of Rochester[2] and Bentley College.[2]
Minehan was elected to the Board of Directors of BD (Becton, Dickinson and Company) (NYSE:BDX) effective 19 November 2007.[11]
Minehan is on the Board of the The Massachusetts Business Roundtable (MBR) which "applies the strategic perspective of its members" to assist the Massachusett's elected and appointed leaders in "resolving complex public policy issues in ways that strengthen the state's long-term social and economic prosperity."[12]
Minehan is "connected to 63 board members in 6 different organizations across 9 different industries."[7]

Education[edit]
Minehan received her undergraduate degree from the University of Rochester and earned her MBA from New York University, where she was designated a Distinguished Alumna in 1995.[1]
In 2012 Minehan served as Dean of the School of Management at Simmons College [13] and is a partner at Arlington Advisory Partners.
Awards and honors[edit]
She is the recipient of the 2006 Pinnacle Award for Lifetime Achievement from the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce, and was named New Englander of the Year in 2002 by the New England Council. Her other recognitions include the New England Women's Leadership award and the International Women's Forum "Women That Make a Difference" award, the Boy Scouts of America’s Champion of Character Award, leadership awards from the Patriots' Trail Girl Scouts and the Boston YWCA, awards from the Women's Economic Round Table for her distinguished career in banking, from the Boston Partners in Education for her leadership role in supporting educational partnerships, and the Medal of Hope from the Organization for a New Equality. She is the recipient of numerous honorary degrees.[1]
In 2006 she was awarded her the Pinnacle Award for Lifetime Achievement by the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce.[2]
Personal[edit]
Minehan is married to E. Gerald Corrigan, a partner and Managing Director at Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.. Since 2008 he was chairman of Goldman Sachs Bank USA, the bank holding company of Goldman Sachs.[14] He was the seventh President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (1 January 1985 – 19 July 1993)[15] and Vice-Chairman of the Federal Open Market Committee.[16] Corrigan is also a member of the Group of Thirty, a prestigious and influential international financial advisory body which includes financiers and academics.[14]
Since they became romantically involved in 1995, Minehan and Corrigan were under scrutiny about potential conflicts of interest.[17] In 1996 Corrigan was named a partner at Goldman Sachs and in 1997 Minehan was on the Federal Open Market Committee, a committee within the Federal Reserve System, the central banking system of the United States. In 1997 a former Governor of the Federal Reserve Board, John P. LaWare, was quoted in the Boston Globe "questioning whether the relationship might not be in the best interest of the Federal Reserve." The couple consulted the general counsel for the Federal Reserve Bank, J. Virgil Mattingly and lawyers at Goldman Sachs when their relationship became serious.[18]
They reside in Boston, MA. Minehan has two children by a previous marriage, Melissa and Brian Minehan and Corrigan has children from a former marriage.[1][2]
Philanthropy[edit]
In 2008, when Minehan and Gerry Corrigan donated $20 million to the Women’s Heart Health Program and throughout the Massachusetts General Hospital Heart Center, the Heart Centre was renamed the Corrigan Minehan Heart Center and the Linda Anne Barlow Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit and the Elizabeth Anne and Karen Barlow Corrigan Women’s Heart Health Programs were established at MGH.[10]
In 2011 Minehan, Henri Termeer and Chad Gifford— fellow Partners HealthCare Board Members— co-chaired the Massachusetts General Hospital bicentennial. The gala, with 1,000 in attendance, also served as a fundraiser, raising approximately $1 million.[19]

Minehan received her undergraduate degree from the University of Rochester and earned her MBA from New York University, where she was designated a Distinguished Alumna in 1995.[1]
In 2012 Minehan served as Dean of the School of Management at Simmons College [13] and is a partner at Arlington Advisory Partners.
Awards and honors[edit]
She is the recipient of the 2006 Pinnacle Award for Lifetime Achievement from the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce, and was named New Englander of the Year in 2002 by the New England Council. Her other recognitions include the New England Women's Leadership award and the International Women's Forum "Women That Make a Difference" award, the Boy Scouts of America’s Champion of Character Award, leadership awards from the Patriots' Trail Girl Scouts and the Boston YWCA, awards from the Women's Economic Round Table for her distinguished career in banking, from the Boston Partners in Education for her leadership role in supporting educational partnerships, and the Medal of Hope from the Organization for a New Equality. She is the recipient of numerous honorary degrees.[1]
In 2006 she was awarded her the Pinnacle Award for Lifetime Achievement by the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce.[2]
Personal[edit]
Minehan is married to E. Gerald Corrigan, a partner and Managing Director at Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.. Since 2008 he was chairman of Goldman Sachs Bank USA, the bank holding company of Goldman Sachs.[14] He was the seventh President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (1 January 1985 – 19 July 1993)[15] and Vice-Chairman of the Federal Open Market Committee.[16] Corrigan is also a member of the Group of Thirty, a prestigious and influential international financial advisory body which includes financiers and academics.[14]
Since they became romantically involved in 1995, Minehan and Corrigan were under scrutiny about potential conflicts of interest.[17] In 1996 Corrigan was named a partner at Goldman Sachs and in 1997 Minehan was on the Federal Open Market Committee, a committee within the Federal Reserve System, the central banking system of the United States. In 1997 a former Governor of the Federal Reserve Board, John P. LaWare, was quoted in the Boston Globe "questioning whether the relationship might not be in the best interest of the Federal Reserve." The couple consulted the general counsel for the Federal Reserve Bank, J. Virgil Mattingly and lawyers at Goldman Sachs when their relationship became serious.[18]
They reside in Boston, MA. Minehan has two children by a previous marriage, Melissa and Brian Minehan and Corrigan has children from a former marriage.[1][2]
Philanthropy[edit]
In 2008, when Minehan and Gerry Corrigan donated $20 million to the Women’s Heart Health Program and throughout the Massachusetts General Hospital Heart Center, the Heart Centre was renamed the Corrigan Minehan Heart Center and the Linda Anne Barlow Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit and the Elizabeth Anne and Karen Barlow Corrigan Women’s Heart Health Programs were established at MGH.[10]
In 2011 Minehan, Henri Termeer and Chad Gifford— fellow Partners HealthCare Board Members— co-chaired the Massachusetts General Hospital bicentennial. The gala, with 1,000 in attendance, also served as a fundraiser, raising approximately $1 million.[19]

Career[edit]
Federal Reserve System[edit]
According to Samuel O. Thier, MD, a director on the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s board, its former chairman, and Professor of Medicine and Health Care Policy at Harvard Medical School[3]

"Cathy led the Bank during a challenging period characterized by dramatic changes in world events, the economy and technology.
— Samuel Thier 2007

Minehan was considered by economists to be a more of a monetary dove than a hawk[9] in her economic philosophy.[4]

"Hawks tend to view higher interest rates, slower growth and lower levels of employment as a price worth paying for keeping inflation at bay. Doves take a more lenient view of inflation if it means stronger employment growth, or are less liable to generate alarming forecasts for inflation as they estimate future growth and price-pressures."
— Reuters 2007

Federal Reserve Bank of New York[edit]
From 1968 to 1978 Minehan worked as a bank examiner, analyst, and supervisor at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

Since they became romantically involved in 1995, Minehan and Corrigan were under scrutiny about potential conflicts of interest.[17] In 1996 Corrigan was named a partner at Goldman Sachs and in 1997 Minehan was on the Federal Open Market Committee, a committee within the Federal Reserve System, the central banking system of the United States. In 1997 a former Governor of the Federal Reserve Board, John P. LaWare, was quoted in the Boston Globe "questioning whether the relationship might not be in the best interest of the Federal Reserve." The couple consulted the general counsel for the Federal Reserve Bank, J. Virgil Mattingly and lawyers at Goldman Sachs when their relationship became serious.[18]
They reside in Boston, MA. Minehan has two children by a previous marriage, Melissa and Brian Minehan and Corrigan has children from a former marriage.[1][2]

In 2008, when Minehan and Gerry Corrigan donated $20 million to the Women’s Heart Health Program and throughout the Massachusetts General Hospital Heart Center, the Heart Centre was renamed the Corrigan Minehan Heart Center and the Linda Anne Barlow Cardiac Surgical Intensive Care Unit and the Elizabeth Anne and Karen Barlow Corrigan Women’s Heart Health Programs were established at MGH.[10]
In 2011 Minehan, Henri Termeer and Chad Gifford— fellow Partners HealthCare Board Members— co-chaired the Massachusetts General Hospital bicentennial. The gala, with 1,000 in attendance, also served as a fundraiser, raising approximately $1 million.[19]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
