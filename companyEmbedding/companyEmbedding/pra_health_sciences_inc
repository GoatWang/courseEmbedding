      development of new medicines by focusing resources, teams and activities 
      where needed, an important requirement for an industry-leading, highly 
      agile R&D organization focused on meeting patient needs.
    

      “This partnership is an exciting opportunity for PRA and represents a 
      significant milestone and transformational business opportunity for us,” 
      said PRA Chief Executive Officer Colin Shannon. “This is the first time 
      that a pharmaceutical company and a clinical research organization (CRO) 
      have come together to create such a comprehensive business and 
      operational strategy. This partnership model redefines collaboration and 
      is the first of its kind in the CRO industry.”
    

      The partnership will enable PRA to utilize its internal resources and 
      expertise to manage an entire pipeline of studies for Takeda, across 
      Phases I-IV and provide Regulatory, Pharmacovigilance and other 
      operational services for both development and marketed product 
      portfolios. The transformation is expected to result in approximately 
      300 Takeda employees supporting drug development and marketed products 
      to be given the opportunity to transition to PRA in the United States 
      and Europe, subject to appropriate information and consultation with 
      works councils, unions, and employee representatives. Discussion 
      regarding Japan employees is ongoing between Takeda and PRA.

Osaka, Japan, September 13, 2016, and Raleigh, N.C., September 12, 2016 – PRA Health Sciences, Inc.

We believe PRA will be an ideal partner as we focus, deliver and advance our current and future pipeline.”
 
The innovative partnership provides a flexible operating model that combines operational expertise, transferred from Takeda to PRA, with PRA’s wide range of global capabilities.
