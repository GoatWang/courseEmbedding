Riverwood hits a homer with Fund II

Riverwood Capital doesn’t play small ball.
The firm, formed in 2008 by executives from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Citigroup, has closed its second fund on its $1.25 billion hard cap and may have collected a bit above the cap, according to two people with knowledge of the fundraising.
It’s not clear if the final tally is inclusive of the firm’s GP commitment. Riverwood, which focuses on growth equity tech investments, did not return a call for comment.
Fund II has been in market since the fourth quarter, according to one of the sources. Park Hill Group worked on the fundraising.
Riverwood Capital Partners II LP had collected about $1 billion in May and had to wait for some limited partners to close commitments, one of the sources said.
Riverwood, which has offices in Menlo Park, Calif., New York City, Sao Paulo, Brazil, and Beijing, started its life larger than most other first-time funds. The firm’s debut fund closed on $780 million in 2011 after the firm cut back its original target of $1.5 billion in 2009 after the economy collapsed, Buyouts previously reported. Fund I was generating a 22.3 percent internal rate of return and a 1.5x multiple as of March 31, according to performance information from the California Public Employees’ Retirement System. 





One of Riverwood’s big winners is wearable camera company GoPro, which had been marked around a 7x unrealized return in the portfolio, according to an LP familiar with Riverwood, who talked to peHUB in May. GoPro went public at $24 per share in June. It shares were trading above $84 Monday.
In June, Riverwood closed a $45 million financing transaction with Underground Solutions, a water and wastewater infrastructure technology business. The deal was structured to provide an initial investment of $30 million in UGSI’s Series C preferred stock with an option for an additional $15 million investment. It’s not clear if the Underground Solutions investment came from Fund II.
Riverwood also has the ability to invest a portion of its funds in Latin America, though it’s not clear how much of the fund can invest in the region.
The firm’s founding partner group is made up of Michael Marks, a former KKR partner and former CEO of Flextronics International; Christopher Varelas, former co-global head of tech media and telecom investment banking for Citigroup; Tom Smach, former CFO of a multinational tech company; Nicholas Brathwaite, former chief technology officer at Flextronics; Francisco Alvarez-Demalde, former investment professional at Eton Park Capital Management; and Jeff Parks, a former KKR executive.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60)

      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC
      (or the last filing when using a group of funds):

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.
