Evergreen Plastics produces a broad range of RPET resin in flake or  pellet form. Our RPET is created from post-consumer beverage bottles.
Products manufactured from RPET resin are eco-friendly, or green, as  they require fewer natural resources to create, as opposed to virgin resin.  Products that are manufactured out of RPET resin are still recyclable, which contributes  to the cycle of sustainability.
Clear  and Green Flakes
Evergreen's clear and green flakes are manufactured to meet the highest quality  standards. Our clear and green flakes are used in the plastic strapping, sheet,  bottle, and fiber industries. They provide a quality, cost-effective  alternative to higher priced virgin resins — generating more profit for the  producer and more value for their customers.
 Clear,  Green, Black Pellets
We also offer RPET in pellet form in clear, green, and black colors. Our  pellets are used in the manufacturing of hundreds of products, including packaging.
NOL  Clear Pellets
Evergreen offers NOL clear pellets and flakes. NOL (non-objection letter)  pellets and flakes are created through a process which results in resins in FDA  certification (through a letter). The FDA certifies that our NOL pellets and  flakes can be used at levels up to 100% in products intended for direct contact  with food and beverages. PET bottles and containers for food can be  manufactured with our NOL clear pellets.
Benefits of NOL Flake:

High vacuum and temperature ensure effective decontamination,
                            drying, and crystallization of the feed material
Bulk density increase of up to 80% for PET flake and flat film scrap
Food-contact compliant end product according to FDA categories C  through G
Possible to process feed materials with fluctuating residual moisture

Benefits of NOL pellet; Advanced System:

Lowest thermal “heat history” through single energy input
Intrinsic Viscosity (IV) build-up: 4 to 6% through the use of an additional  crystallizer
Stronger decontamination performance through long average dwell times                





Benefits of NOL pellet; Prime System:

Lowest thermal “heat history” through single energy input
Intrinsic Viscosity (IV) build-up: 6 to 10% through the use of two additional  crystallization dryers
Batch operations, adjustable dwell times 

Other  Materials
In addition to our RPET pellets and flakes, Evergreen offers many by-products  generated from our operations. These materials can be recycled into industrial  and consumer packaging and products.
Industrial Usages
Evergreen Plastics are used  in a variety of industrial applications, including:

PET preform manufacturing
Injection  Stretch Blow Molding (ISBM)
Direct food  contact and non-food contact packaging
RPET fiber for  apparel and commercial applications
PET strapping –  Translucent green and opaque
Injection  Molding - engineering resin parts
Extruded film  and sheet
Thermoforming
Any other application utilizing Virgin PET resin

Packaging
Evergreen  carefully packages its high-quality products in either Super Sacks or in large  corrugated boxes. They are properly labeled to ensure a safe and secure  delivery.
Quality Assurance
Evergreen enforces strict quality  control. Every Super Sack or corrugated box of materials is given an ID number,  so that it may be traced. Each package is also sampled and tested before  shipment. The sampling includes two tests. The float / sink test checks for  wood, paper, polypropylene, glass, metal, and other contaminants. The bake test  checks for low melt and other contaminants, including PVC and barriers. 
PH  testing and IV testing is also performed. Pellets and clear pellets are tested  for L, A, and B color. All findings regarding contaminants are reported in  parts per million (PPM) on a certificate of analysis. These certificates are  kept on permanent record at Evergreen. A COA (certificate of analysis) is  available for our customers upon request.
