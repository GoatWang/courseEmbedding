Canyon Country couple enters healthy dog-snack business

A Canyon Country couple’s canine culinary acuity has created a company.
The new venture, Pet Me Happy Treats, is a labor of love for the husband-and-wife team of Stephen K. and Nadine Peeples.
Their first product, available online and at local pet shops, is Artisan Dog Treats with Oregon Blueberries.
“I saw a news report that Americans spend $64 billion a year on their pets,” he said. “That got my attention. While music and journalism were my passions for more than 40 years, animals were my first passion from the time I was a toddler. So in a way, I’m circling back.”
Retired after a 40-year career in journalism and the music business, including several years with The Signal, Stephen K. Peeples was looking for a new opportunity.
As health conscious dog lovers, he and his wife were alarmed by some of the ingredients they found in commercial pet treats, and decided to create something better.
Starting in the summer of 2015 in their Canyon Country kitchen, they started downloading and tweaking all-natural recipes for dog treats.
“We started with peanut butter, but it was a mess production-wise,” he said. Then the baker they work with suggested blueberries.
“Artisan Dog Treats contain real Oregon blueberries, which are loaded with antioxidants and immunity-boosting Vitamin C,” and have the same health benefits for dogs as they do for people, Peeples said.
Artisan Dog Treats with Oregon Blueberries, from Pet Me Happy Treats, based in Canyon Country.
He noted that the treats have all natural ingredients, contain no wheat, corn, soy (which can be inflammatory), no chemical additives, artificial preservatives, or by-products,  and are artisan-baked in Los Angeles County.
“They’re not frozen or freeze-dried, and Oregon blueberries are known to be fatter and sweeter than those from other places.”
Each cookie-shaped treat is about one inch in diameter and a quarter-inch thick with a crunchy texture to promote strong teeth and gums.
Since focus groups don’t work with dogs, the Peepleses found another way to market test the product.
They tested the treats with friends’ dogs, neighbors’ dogs, and at dog-training sessions.
“In the pet business, the term for when a treat is a hit is that ‘it feeds well,’” Peeples said. “That means that when dogs are presented with the treats, 95 percent gobble them up and the other 5 percent circle around them first, then eat them.”
The next step was to follow up with dogs’ humans, to make sure the treats caused no digestive repercussions. The verdict, Peeples said: “No farts, no digestive issues.”
The treats have also won the approval of Lennon, Pet Me Happy’s official mascot.
A corgi-chihuahua-terrier blend with some other breeds also likely in the mix, Lennon is a rescue dog the couple adopted last Oct. 9, the 76th anniversary of John Lennon’s birth.
Proponents of pet adoption, they found Lennon at the 16th Bow-Wows & Meows Pet Fair at Hart Park.
They encourage anyone considering adoption to consider stopping by one of the county’s six animal shelters, because “those animals are the closest to the end.” The nearest shelter is on Charlie Canyon Road in Castaic.
Pet Me Happy’s blueberry-flavored treats (soon to be joined by a cranberry version) are available online and locally at Canyon Pet Center on Soledad Canyon Road, Happy Pets Veterinary Center on Newhall Ranch Road, and Shelter Hope Pet Shop at Valencia Town Center.
Shelter Hope will host a product-launching ribbon-cutting ceremony with the SCV Chamber of Commerce on Tuesday, July 11 at 5:30 p.m.
“The entire industry is starting to move in this direction,” toward healthier pet snacks, Peeples said. “As a small mom-and-pop operation, I think we’re a bit ahead of the curve,” noting that industry giants are launching divisions featuring natural products.
Would the Peepleses entertain an offer from one of those industry giants, should it come along? “If that were to happen, we’d certainly take a close look,” Stephen K. Peeples said. “My mama didn’t raise a fool.”

THE WOODLANDS, Texas, May 18, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- CB&I's (NYSE:   CBI) Supervisory Board of Directors today announced it has approved the retirement of Philip K. Asherman from his role as President and Chief Executive Officer of CB&I and as a member of the company's Board effective July 1, 2017. The Board also announced the appointment of Patrick K. Mullen to President and Chief Executive Officer, effective the same date. Mr. Mullen will stand for election to the company's Board in May 2018.








"CB&I's Supervisory Board is grateful for Phil's service and congratulates him on his nearly 12 years of leadership of what has become one of the premier energy infrastructure companies in the world," said L. Richard Flury, Non-Executive Chairman of CB&I's Supervisory Board. "We especially appreciate Phil's commitment to succession planning by ensuring that we have an outstanding internal candidate in Pat Mullen to assume the position of CEO. I am confident in Pat's ability to successfully lead CB&I into the future."
Mr. Asherman, 66, is widely credited for transforming CB&I from a specialty tank subcontractor to a global technology and energy infrastructure corporation, which at its peak has employed more than 50,000 employees in 85 locations around the world with a backlog of business exceeding $20 billion. He is also regarded as a leader in safety for the industry and in 2015 was a recipient of the National Safety Council's prestigious Green Cross for Safety award, the first ever received by an engineering and construction company. This focus on employees is a hallmark of his leadership at CB&I, which has become one of the largest job creators in the U.S. hiring over 25,000 employees in the past three years. 
In addition, Mr. Asherman's dedication to developing new talent included the creation of a global Women's Leadership Network to provide mentoring and focus on career development for women in the industry; a commitment to Veteran training and hiring resulting in employment opportunities for more than 6,000 returning servicemen and women over the past three years; and continuing support of Historically Black Colleges and Universities through scholarships, internships and recruitment of graduates for professional and technical opportunities. CB&I also has become a leader in the U.S. and around the world in developing a culture of community giving and support for local schools, charities, and emergency response to natural disasters wherever its employees are working.
"It has been a great honor to lead CB&I for almost 12 years, and I am proud of the many significant accomplishments the company and our employees have made in that time," said Mr. Asherman. "Pat has demonstrated tremendous leadership capabilities and has been an active executive partner in maintaining CB&I's standards with our employees and our global energy customers. His technical and business credentials plus over 25 years of industry experience make him the right executive to lead CB&I into the future. I'm confident Pat will bring a fresh perspective on technology and innovation that will drive the company to even greater achievements."
Mr. Mullen, 52, was named Chief Operating Officer of CB&I in 2016. Previously, he served as Executive Vice President and President of CB&I's Engineering & Construction operating group, where he was responsible for all engineering and construction for CB&I's worldwide operations. He joined CB&I in 2007 through the company's acquisition of Lummus Global and has worked in operational and commercial leadership roles throughout the company with global responsibility for corporate strategy, as well as serving as a key interface with CB&I's shareholders. Mr. Mullen currently serves on Vectren Corporation's board of directors. He holds a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from the University of Notre Dame and a master's degree in business administration from Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management.
"Phil's leadership has set a strong foundation for the many opportunities we have ahead," said Mr. Mullen. "I appreciate the Board's confidence as we work through this challenging cycle in our industry, and I am committed to taking action to ensure the successful execution of our significant backlog of projects. I look forward to working with our many talented employees to further build a culture that enables CB&I to be the most collaborative and innovative partner for our customers around the world."
