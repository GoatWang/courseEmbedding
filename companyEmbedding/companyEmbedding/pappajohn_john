    Kelsi Ziemann discusses her experience with the Drake John Pappajohn Entrepreneurial Center and how it helped her acheive her goal of starting her own business: Kelsi Ziemann Artistry.

        CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREAfter graduating from high school in Van Meter, Kelsi Ziemann worked at a department store cosmetic counter, did makeovers and ultimately provided on-location makeup services for magazine photo shoots. Time and time again, she heard her clients express a desire for better-wearing lipstick that was easier to shop for.Years later as a student at Drake University, Ziemann took an entrepreneurship class that required her to create a business model.“I knew I wanted to be an entrepreneur, but I didn’t know what the business would be. I had worked in cosmetics for a long time, so I started thinking about what people were asking for in the lipstick tube and formula,” she says.As a makeup artist, Ziemann had already developed a lipstick application process to make it wear longer. She says, “I took that five-step process and worked it into a one-step formula that’s more practical. I actually researched lipstick ingredients, how to make it and started putting some things together.”She also designed packaging that would make it easier for shoppers to match lipstick and lip liners at the point of sale.After that class, Ziemann used her business plan to enter – and win – the Lorentzen Student Hatchery competition, which is part of Drake’s John Pappajohn Center for Entrepreneurship Outreach. Her award was $5,000 and admission to the Student Hatchery program for the summer of 2014. She spent three intensive months working closely with Drake’s Pappajohn Center staff, professors, mentors and other experts to further develop her plan.Momentum BuildsIn the spring of 2015, Ziemann took her business plan to the regional Pappajohn Student Entrepreneurial Venture Competition. Although she didn’t win, “I got more business advice, which I took and used to go back and rework the plan,” she says.This past spring, she entered the competition again. This time, she won.“The things I learned there and that $5,000 award really helped me finalize the marketing plan and helped with making the lipstick tube mold and fees for the patent application on its design,” Ziemann says. “It is also helping to fund my first order of products.”Networking Provides Critical ConnectionThrough the Pappajohn Center, Ziemann had countless opportunities to network with other entrepreneurs and business leaders – including going to the 2015 EntreFEST convention, which was produced by the University of Northern Iowa in partnership with the University of Iowa and Iowa State University.It was there that Ziemann met the owner of an Iowa-based lip balm company – Eco Lips – who expressed interest in her product.“I’ve been working with their product developer to formulate my products,” Ziemann says. The process has been a meticulous one, involving numerous product iterations. With the final formula for her long-lasting lipstick complete, she has filed a patent application for that as well.Product Launch is This Month! With all testing complete, ingredients procured, patent filings done and product manufactured, a new, long-lasting lipstick line by Kelsi Ziemann Artistry launches this month.According to her well-evolved business plan, sales are starting at the grassroots. “Initially, my line will be available through local hair salons and makeup artists, area boutiques, trade shows and online. When we have proof of concept, sales will go larger-scale, maybe even to big box retailers,” Ziemann says.Ziemann Pays It ForwardLike most entrepreneurs, Ziemann is eager to encourage more Iowans to pursue their passions and start their own businesses. After all, the encouragement she received from John Pappajohn, the staff at Drake’s Pappajohn Center, her professors and many others has allowed her to accomplish something she would have never before imagined possible.“I’m taking it to the streets. I’ve spoken to hundreds of people at places like 1 Million Cups Des Moines, Iowa Women Lead Change, Gravitate, and Drake University College of Business Administration. I also recently spoke to future business leaders and entrepreneurs at Business Horizons in Pella, an event put on by Central College and the Iowa Association of Business and Industry,” she says.To advance her own business, Ziemann also continues to leverage the expertise of others. Ziemann was recently chosen as a fellow in the Entrepreneurs’ Organization (EO), Iowa chapter, which is composed of owners, founders or majority stakeholders of businesses earning at least $1 million annually. “It’s another great mentoring opportunity,” she says.“The main thing is being able to surround yourself by people who support you and encourage you to go after your passion,” she says.“I definitely wanted a better future, but I never imagined having my own business and being a role model for other entrepreneurs and young women.”-- Kelsi Ziemann, CEO & Founder, Kelsi Ziemann ArtistryThis story presented by John Pappajohn Entrepreneurial Centers. John and Mary Pappajohn seeded the five John Pappajohn Entrepreneurial Centers in 1996. The centers are located at five of Iowa’s colleges and universities including Drake University, Iowa State University, the University of Northern Iowa and John’s two alma maters, North Iowa Area Community College and the University of Iowa. The shared purpose of the centers is to strengthen Iowa’s entrepreneurial ecosystem and help make Iowa one of the most entrepreneurial states in the nation. The Pappajohns are committed to helping others pursue their dreams, particularly through the creation and growth of Iowa businesses.  The Pappajohn Centers offer unique educational programs across their respective campuses, work together on specific community-based programs and collaborate with other regional and state partners to foster entrepreneurship across Iowa.  Together, the Centers helped start more than 5,600 new Iowa businesses. Over the past two decades, the Pappajohns have gifted more than $30 million in support to the five Pappajohn Entrepreneurial Centers.  Through their leadership, vision, and generous gifts, John and Mary have established a legacy for the State of Iowa that will continue for years to come.   Members of the editorial and news staff of the USA TODAY Network were not involved in the creation of this content.

John Pappajohn Business Administration Building and Hillenbrand Residence Hall Project Profile



























A variety of plaster systems with a wide selection of finish options
  meet a myriad of abuse-resistance requirements with the appropriate
  combination of surface strength, penetration resistance and cost
  control. Two different systems were chosen for projects on college
  campuses where heavy traffic and abuse resistance were factors.  
Top priority for the John PappaJohn Business Administration Building
  at University of Iowa in Iowa City, Iowa was a system that would look
  good for years with minimal maintenance. A two-coat Imperial veneer
  system was chosen for superior surface hardness and compressive
  strength (3,000 psi). Imperial veneer plaster products were also used
  in detail work on cornices, soffits and projections that created a
  sense of visual continuity with other architectural designs
  on campus. 
The veneer system used for the Hillenbrand Residence Hall at Purdue
  University in West Lafayette, Indiana needed to be rugged enough for
  living accommodations. USG Structo-Base® Gypsum Plaster was chosen for
  scratch and brown coats over metal lath on steel studs. Then, USG Red
  Top® Brand Keenes Cement combined with lime and sand was used for the
  finish coat, providing optimal hardness and workability.  
Both systems delivered the durability as well as cost and low
  maintenance requirements to ensure successful projects that will be
  enjoyed by students for years to come.

Pappajohn Business Building - Wikipedia





















 






Pappajohn Business Building

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

The Pappajohn Business Building houses the Tippie College of Business at the University of Iowa in Iowa City, Iowa. Completed in 1994, it is an 187,000-square-foot (17,400 m2) postmodern facility that houses the Pappajohn Entrepreneurial Center and Small Business Center.
The building embodies the style of the Pentacrest structures with its use of aggregate stone and is a modern twist on the turn-of-the century buildings found at the heart of campus. Its style is also reminiscent of financial institutions such as the New York Stock Exchange and its use of a "money-green" paint scheme reinforces its financial focus.
The building includes 27 classrooms varying in size from a 16-seat conference room to a 387-seat auditorium. Each classroom is equipped with technology including projectors and audio systems. The building also houses one of the largest information technology centers on campus. The open atrium spaces, study corners and outdoor patio provide places for students to study or relax.
The Pappajohn Business Building is named after John Pappajohn, a Des Moines venture capitalist and UI alumnus. His $4 million contribution to the building fund was one of the largest the University had ever received. To commemorate his contribution, the University of Iowa bestowed his name upon the building. This was not the only funding provided for the $34 million building; in 1991 the Iowa General Assembly approved $24 million in state revenue bonds to help offset the cost of the building project. Upon dedication, alumnus John Pappajohn was quoted as saying "Pappa's in the house."[1]
