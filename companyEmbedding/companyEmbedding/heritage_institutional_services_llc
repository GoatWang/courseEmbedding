You can join the movement to reclaim America
For the past six years, America has been in a liberal stranglehold. The government has grown bigger and more intrusive, the economy has struggled under mountains of debt, and America’s national defense and foreign policy have withered from a lack of leadership.
But in November, Americans said “no more.” The people used the ballot box to reject Barack Obama’s vision of our country and elect conservative lawmakers who stand for the principles that have made America great.
You’ve helped prepare for this moment
You and more than 500,000 of your fellow conservatives stood with The Heritage Foundation throughout the liberal upheaval of the past six years because you believe in America’s founding principles.

Your support allowed more than 100 Heritage experts to be ready for this momentwith conservative policy solutions and factual analysis that the new Congress can use to push back the Left.
Your support fueled Heritage’s communications initiative, helping to educate millions of Americans each year on the dangers of liberal policies and enlightening them on the countless benefits of policies that advance liberty.
Your support gave grassroots Americans this same research to hold their Congressmen accountable in collaboration with our sister organization, Heritage Action for America.

You can make 2017 a turning point for conservatives
For the first time in years, conservatives have a real opportunity to restore the principles of free enterprise, limited government, individual liberty, traditional American values, and a strong national defense to our beloved country.
With your renewed membership for 2017, America can

End the nightmare of Obamacare and enact a free-market healthcare solution
Appoint a conservative justice to the Supreme Court to replace Antonin Scalia
Secure America’s borders and reject amnesty for illegal immigrants
End the reckless federal spending that mortgages America’s future

But without your support, this opportunity will pass us by.
With your tax-deductible membership gift, you will be renewing your commitment with hundreds of thousands of conservatives across the nation who are ready to restore an America where freedom, opportunity, prosperity, and civil society flourish.
Your opportunity to reclaim America is here
Renewing your Heritage membership only takes a minute — but the impact lasts for generations to come.

Join the most influential conservative group in America
For the past 42 years, The Heritage Foundation has led the conservative movement…and now you can be part of this exclusive group.







Become Part of a Movement That Can Transform America
Free enterprise, limited government, individual freedom, traditional American values, and a strong national defense—these are the values that we fight for every single day. As the nation’s largest, most broadly-supported think tank, The Heritage Foundation has long been the bastion of the American conservative movement. And with more than 500,000 members, our ranks are growing stronger every day. And now, you can join us and help to ensure that your values are being advanced in Washington, in the Media, and across this great nation.
Ronald Reagan knew something that no one else knew
In 1980, just as Reagan was beginning his first term in office, The Heritage Foundation developed a 1,100 page detailed policy manual on everything from taxes and regulation to trade and national defense. This “Mandate for Leadership” as it was so titled was described by United Press International back then as:
“a blueprint for grabbing the government by its frayed New Deal lapels and shaking out 48 years of liberal policy.”
President Reagan used “Mandate” to help realize his vision of a world free of communism, an economy that didn’t crush people’s dreams with high taxes and regulations, and an America the world could admire once again. He gave copies to every member of his Cabinet. The result: Nearly two-thirds of “Mandate’s” 2,000 recommendations were adopted or attempted by the Reagan administration.
Now is a time for a new Mandate for Leadership
We have come a long way since Reagan—and not in a good way. The liberal policies of the Obama administration have put a stranglehold on free enterprise. New entitlements such as Obamacare have led to the largest expansion of the federal government since the New Deal. As Reagan once said:
“Government is not the solution to the problem, government is the problem.”
As a result of this irresponsible leadership, our freedom as American citizens has never before been so limited. At the same time, our influence in the world as a super power wanes as America’s global military footprint continues to shrink.







Enough is enough—it is time to reverse our course.
The Heritage Foundation has the policy solutions that can make America that “shining city upon a hill” once again. And we are strategically positioned to do just that:

Heritage employs some of the smartest minds in Washington – With over 100 policy experts, Heritage truly has the talent to be able to solve complex policy issues, with simple and effective conservative solutions. As Rush Limbaugh has said, “Some of the finest conservative scholars alive today, live, work, and breathe at The Heritage Foundation.”
Heritage has a media distribution network second to none –Nearly 30 million Americans visit our Daily Signal website each year, bypassing the mainstream media filter to get the facts. Heritage experts appear on television and radio dozens of times each week, publish hundreds of sound policy research reports annually, and host hundreds of meetings a year with grassroots leaders and local and national officials.
Heritage is located right in the belly of the beast – Location is everything. Heritage is the largest single land owner on Capitol Hill, with offices just 1000 steps from the House and 500 steps from the Senate. This strategic location gives us access to lawmakers and public officials that need to be equipped with policy solutions that represent your conservative principles.

	Join the Heritage Foundation – Parallax | The Heritage Foundation	

















































































Join the most influential conservative group in America
For the past 42 years, The Heritage Foundation has led the conservative movement…and now you can be part of this exclusive group.







Become Part of a Movement That Can Transform America
Free enterprise, limited government, individual freedom, traditional American values, and a strong national defense—these are the values that we fight for every single day. As the nation’s largest, most broadly-supported think tank, The Heritage Foundation has long been the bastion of the American conservative movement. And with more than 500,000 members, our ranks are growing stronger every day. And now, you can join us and help to ensure that your values are being advanced in Washington, in the Media, and across this great nation.
Ronald Reagan knew something that no one else knew
In 1980, just as Reagan was beginning his first term in office, The Heritage Foundation developed a 1,100 page detailed policy manual on everything from taxes and regulation to trade and national defense. This “Mandate for Leadership” as it was so titled was described by United Press International back then as:
“a blueprint for grabbing the government by its frayed New Deal lapels and shaking out 48 years of liberal policy.”
President Reagan used “Mandate” to help realize his vision of a world free of communism, an economy that didn’t crush people’s dreams with high taxes and regulations, and an America the world could admire once again. He gave copies to every member of his Cabinet. The result: Nearly two-thirds of “Mandate’s” 2,000 recommendations were adopted or attempted by the Reagan administration.
Now is a time for a new Mandate for Leadership
We have come a long way since Reagan—and not in a good way. The liberal policies of the Obama administration have put a stranglehold on free enterprise. New entitlements such as Obamacare have led to the largest expansion of the federal government since the New Deal. As Reagan once said:
“Government is not the solution to the problem, government is the problem.”
As a result of this irresponsible leadership, our freedom as American citizens has never before been so limited. At the same time, our influence in the world as a super power wanes as America’s global military footprint continues to shrink.







Enough is enough—it is time to reverse our course.
The Heritage Foundation has the policy solutions that can make America that “shining city upon a hill” once again. And we are strategically positioned to do just that:

Heritage employs some of the smartest minds in Washington – With over 100 policy experts, Heritage truly has the talent to be able to solve complex policy issues, with simple and effective conservative solutions. As Rush Limbaugh has said, “Some of the finest conservative scholars alive today, live, work, and breathe at The Heritage Foundation.”
Heritage has a media distribution network second to none –Nearly 30 million Americans visit our Daily Signal website each year, bypassing the mainstream media filter to get the facts. Heritage experts appear on television and radio dozens of times each week, publish hundreds of sound policy research reports annually, and host hundreds of meetings a year with grassroots leaders and local and national officials.
Heritage is located right in the belly of the beast – Location is everything. Heritage is the largest single land owner on Capitol Hill, with offices just 1000 steps from the House and 500 steps from the Senate. This strategic location gives us access to lawmakers and public officials that need to be equipped with policy solutions that represent your conservative principles.

Thank you for your gift!
Your gift allows Heritage to continue to advance your conservative principles every day.
But, as you know, principles without action cannot create the change needed. This is where The Heritage Foundation’s sister organization, Heritage Action for America, comes in.
“Heritage and Heritage Action together are an unstoppable force for liberty.”
— Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX)
Heritage Action for America is able to hold lawmakers accountable to Heritage’s conservative policy solutions through a unique combination of political muscle and a vast grassroots army.
While Heritage wins the broader war of ideas, Heritage Action wins the political battles. Since its founding in 2010, Action has successfully moved Congress in a more conservative direction. Heritage Action’s 450,000 activists and team of Washington lobbyists forced lawmakers to cut spending, limit President Obama’s tax hikes, protect the Second Amendment, and stand up time and again to fight Obamacare.
Heritage Action relies on the support of tens of thousands of conservatives like you to battle the liberal onslaught and advance conservative ideas. Your gift to Heritage Action, will ensure:

Lawmakers continue to feel pressure to vote for conservative legislation in Washington and in their home districts
Strengthen our national infrastructure of more than 450,000 grassroots activists and recruit thousands more elite Sentinel activists
Continue to fight for your conservative principles, no matter what Barack Obama and his liberal allies throw at us
