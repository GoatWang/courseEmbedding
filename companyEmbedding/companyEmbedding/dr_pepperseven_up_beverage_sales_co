Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc. is an American soft drink company, based in Plano, Texas. Formerly called Cadbury Schweppes Americas Beverages, on May 5, 2008, it was spun off from Britain's Cadbury Schweppes, with trading in its shares starting on May 7, 2008. Cadbury Schweppes plc went on to become Cadbury plc on May 5, 2008.[4][5]

History[edit]
Beverage America and Select Beverages bottlers were purchased from the Carlyle Group in February 1998.[6] Snapple, Mistic and Stewart's (formerly Cable Car Beverage) were sold by Triarc Companies, Inc. to Cadbury Schweppes in 2000 for $1.45 billion.[7] In October of that same year, Cadbury Schweppes purchased Royal Crown from Triarc.[8]
In 2006 and 2007, Cadbury Schweppes purchased the Dr Pepper/Seven Up Bottling Group, along with several other regional bottlers. This allowed DPS to bottle many of its own beverages and combat the recent decision by many Pepsi and Coke bottlers who had dropped their Dr Pepper and Snapple products to promote new product additions from Pepsi and Coke. Some of the Dr Pepper/Seven Up brands are still licensed to Pepsi, Coke and independent bottlers in various regions of the United States and Canada.
In November 2007, Cadbury Schweppes announced it would take the beverages unit public. In May 2008, Cadbury Schweppes demerged its beverage holdings forming the Dr Pepper Snapple Group.
Dr Pepper Snapple Group holds naming rights to Dr Pepper Ballpark and the Dallas Stars' practice facility, the Dr Pepper Star Center, both of which are located in Frisco, Texas. It also retains non-alcoholic beverage rights to each facility's concessions as a result of the deals as well as sponsorships with the NHL franchise.
In 2008, Dr Pepper Snapple Group purchased minority interest in Big Red, Inc, makers of Big Red, NuGrape, Nesbitt's and other flavored drinks.[9]
In 2014, the company announced that it accomplished its goal of reducing use of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) in its plastic bottles. Dr Pepper Snapple lowered the amount of PET in its bottles by over 60 million pounds between 2007 and 2014.[10]
On November 22, 2016 it was announced that Dr Pepper/Seven Up Bottling Group had made a cash purchase of Bai Brands for the price of $1.7 billion. It had previously purchased a minority stake in the company for $15 million in 2015.[11]

History[edit]
Beverage America and Select Beverages bottlers were purchased from the Carlyle Group in February 1998.[6] Snapple, Mistic and Stewart's (formerly Cable Car Beverage) were sold by Triarc Companies, Inc. to Cadbury Schweppes in 2000 for $1.45 billion.[7] In October of that same year, Cadbury Schweppes purchased Royal Crown from Triarc.[8]
In 2006 and 2007, Cadbury Schweppes purchased the Dr Pepper/Seven Up Bottling Group, along with several other regional bottlers. This allowed DPS to bottle many of its own beverages and combat the recent decision by many Pepsi and Coke bottlers who had dropped their Dr Pepper and Snapple products to promote new product additions from Pepsi and Coke. Some of the Dr Pepper/Seven Up brands are still licensed to Pepsi, Coke and independent bottlers in various regions of the United States and Canada.
In November 2007, Cadbury Schweppes announced it would take the beverages unit public. In May 2008, Cadbury Schweppes demerged its beverage holdings forming the Dr Pepper Snapple Group.
Dr Pepper Snapple Group holds naming rights to Dr Pepper Ballpark and the Dallas Stars' practice facility, the Dr Pepper Star Center, both of which are located in Frisco, Texas. It also retains non-alcoholic beverage rights to each facility's concessions as a result of the deals as well as sponsorships with the NHL franchise.
In 2008, Dr Pepper Snapple Group purchased minority interest in Big Red, Inc, makers of Big Red, NuGrape, Nesbitt's and other flavored drinks.[9]
In 2014, the company announced that it accomplished its goal of reducing use of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) in its plastic bottles. Dr Pepper Snapple lowered the amount of PET in its bottles by over 60 million pounds between 2007 and 2014.[10]
On November 22, 2016 it was announced that Dr Pepper/Seven Up Bottling Group had made a cash purchase of Bai Brands for the price of $1.7 billion. It had previously purchased a minority stake in the company for $15 million in 2015.[11]

7UP
The Seven-Up Company's roots go back to 1920, when C. L. Grigg set himself to create a distinctive soft drink that would prove irresistible to the nation's consumers.

EARLY ADVERTISING
The earliest 7UP advertising featured a winged 7UP logo and described the soft drink as "a glorified drink in bottles only. Seven natural flavors blended into a savory, flavory drink with a real wallop."







THE UNCOLA
In 1967, 7UP introduced the UNCOLA advertising campaign, which sent 7UP sales rocketing nationwide. The tag immediately joined the nation's vernacular and remained synonymous with 7UP, despite subsequent new slogans.







NO CAFFEINE
The 7UP "No Caffeine" campaign garnered national attention for the company in 1982, as it appealed to growing consumer concern and confusion about caffeine in soft drinks. It launched 7UP sales into an unprecedented period of growth.







SEE SPOT GO
In 1987, 7UP introduced Spot, a character derived from the red dot in the 7UP trademark. Spot rapidly developed into a popular character represented on licensed items throughout the nation.







MAKE 7UP YOURS
New advertising featuring actor/comedian Orlando Jones and the slogan "Make 7UP Yours" was launched in late 1999. The popular campaign continued in 2000, introducing comedian/actor Godfrey as the bumbling 7UP guy.






History
Banking on his 30 years of experience in advertising and merchandising, Grigg formed The Howdy Corporation, named for the Howdy Orange drink he pioneered.

Grigg spent more than two years testing 11 different formulas of lemon-flavored drinks. He settled on one that fulfilled the characteristics he sought: refreshing and thirst-quenching. Grigg introduced his new soft drink two weeks before the stock market crashed in October 1929. It was a caramel-colored lemon-lime soda, which he positioned as a drink with a "flavor wallop" to market alongside the already-successful Howdy Orange drink.

It cost more than its competition. It also carried the burden of an unwieldy name, "Bib-Label Lithiated Lemon-Lime Soda," and it competed against more than 600 lemon-lime soft drinks already in the marketplace. In spite of all the obstacles, the new brand sold well. Shortly afterwards, Grigg changed the brand's name to 7UP.

Acknowledging the success of the 7UP trademark in 1936, Grigg changed the name of The Howdy Corporation to The Seven-Up Company. By the late 1940s, 7UP had become the third best-selling soft drink in the world.

In 1970, The Seven-Up Company introduced sugar-free 7UP, which was an immediate success among the growing number of calorie-conscious Americans. It was named Diet 7UP in 1979.

In June 1978, Philip Morris acquired The Seven-Up Company, then sold the domestic operations to a private investment group in 1986. The company was merged with Dr Pepper Company, and the new management team consolidated administrative functions of The Seven-Up Company at the Dallas headquarters of Dr Pepper Company. Manufacturing of 7UP products remained at the company's St. Louis facility.

In early 1987, Cherry 7UP and Diet Cherry 7UP were introduced. Marketed to young people, the new products were designed as light, refreshing additions to the prestigious family of 7UP brand products and met with instant success across the country.

With the March 1995 acquisition of Dr Pepper/Seven-Up Companies, Inc. by Cadbury Schweppes, 7UP became part of Cadbury Beverages North America.

In 2010, 7UP was reformulated with a crisper, cleaner taste and given a "ridiculously bubbly" new look.

Today, 7UP is part of Dr Pepper Snapple Group, an integrated refreshment beverage business marketing more than 50 beverage brands throughout North America.

                                Report abuseTranscript of Dr. Pepper/ Seven-Up Inc.Industry AnalysisEconomic AnalysisDr. Pepper/Seven-UpInc.(Squirt Brand)History of the CompanyInternal & External Environment AnalysisMinor ProblemsMajor ProblemsDr. Pepper/Seven-Up owns the 7-Up brand in the USA and the Dr. Pepper brand worldwide. Created in 1885, Dr. Pepper is the oldest, nationally distributed soft drink in the US. The 7-Up brand was introduced in 1929. Within the US carbonated soft drinks' market, Dr. Pepper/Seven-Up is one of the fastest growing companies.The soft drink industry in the United States is a highly profitably, but competitive market. In 2000 alone, consumers on average drank 53 gallons of soft drinks per person a year. There are three major companies that hold the majority of sales in the carbonated soft drink industry in the United States. They are the Coca Cola Company with 44.1% market share, followed by The Pepsi-Cola Company with 31.4% market share, and Dr. Pepper/Seven Up, Inc. with 14.7% market share. The origin of Squirt can be traced back to 1938 when a man named Herb Bishop began experimenting with Citrus Club. Bishop created a new carbonated soft drink that required less fruit and sugar to produce compared to other sodas that were being made at the time. The new drink "seemed to squirt onto the tongue," so Bishop named the drink Squirt. Squirt is a caffeine-free, low-sodium carbonated soft drink brand with a distinctive blend of grapefruit juices that gives it a tangy, fresh citrus taste. Squirt is the bestselling carbonated grapefruit soft drink brand in the United States. Squirt's direct competition comes from two Coca-Cola brands. These are Fresca and Citra. Fresca is a caffeine free diet soft drink targeted to adults over age 30. Citra is sugared caffeine free version of Fresca targeted to teens and young adults. Squirt outsells Citra and Fresca combined by case volume. The numbers show that the percent of market share for Squirt has slowly declined in recent years.Squirt's market share is calculated by dividing case volume by total case volume for the entire market. The market share for Squirt for the past years is as follows: 1996   55,800,000/768,400,000= .0726 or 7.26% 1997   55,700,000/900,800,000= .0618 or 6.18% 1998   54,800,000/964,400,000= .0568 or 5.68% 1999   56,000,000/989,100,000= .0566 or 5.66% 2000   54,600,000/981,800,000= .0556 or 5.56% Market Shares1996 - 7.26%1997 - 6.18%1998 - 5.68%1999 - 5.66%2000 - 5.56%The total sales broken down by racial/ethnic groups can be seen below. 12% of 54,600,000(total case volume for Squirt in 2000) =6,552,000 cases were sold to the Hispanic population 15% of 54,600,000(total case volume for Squirt in 2000) =8,190,000 cases were sold to the African American population 73% of 54,600,000(total case volume for Squirt in 2000) =39,858,000 cases were sold to the Caucasian populationSales By Racial GroupsCaucasian73% cases were soldHispanic12% cases soldAfrican American 15% cases soldSquirt has already been exposed to many Hispanics, primarily those of Mexican decent because of the popularity of the beverage in Mexico. This could be a very beneficial for Squirt in the U.S. market considering that there is a very large Mexican population in the United States. In California alone 77% of the Hispanic population is of Mexican ancestry. 77% of 11,000,000 (Hispanic population)=8,470,000 people are of Mexican decent in California. The figure above shows that it may be beneficial for Squirt to focus primarily on the Hispanic market segment in California. Over 8 million people who are of Mexican ancestry reside in this one location. A weakness that has plagued Squirt in the past is its inability to appeal towards an ideal target market. The target market has changed numerous times in previous years as well as its positioning strategy. Squirt's inability to correctly place itself within an ideal market has cost it the opportunity of possible sales in the past. There are opportunities; however, that Squirt can take advantage of. Its immense popularity in Mexico gives Squirt a competitive edge in capturing a larger segment of the growing Hispanic market. Squirt does however have many threats to consider with direct competition from brands distributed by Coca-Cola as well as Pepsi-ColaThe threat of new entrants The market is 90% controlled by DPSU, Coca-Cola, and Pepsi Co. These companies also control the top 10 brands in the United States. This means that entering into the market is not impossible, but gaining a large foothold is not probable. However with a $60 billion dollar per year industry there is also room for a new entrant.The threat of substitute products Squirt has 2 direct competitors in the grapefruit segment, and many other competitors in the citrus category. There are also 900 registered brands of soda in the U.S. Squirt however does not have a product that is positioned and targeted to the same group with the same taste. In the case of the soda market however there are plenty of other soda brands. Squirt also positioned itself as thirst quenching. This places squirt into competition with other beverages including water and sport drinks.However DPSU does not have the market share and resources that are enjoyed by Coca-Cola and Pepsi Co's offerings. This leaves them with a smaller advertising budget.The larger advertising budgets of competitors can be a threat to maintaining market share with a brand with flat sales.The Intensity of Competitive Rivalry Squirt being a non-cola soft drink places it into a different category. The major competition comes from Mellow Yellow and Mountain Dew, and well as Citra and Fresca. The competitors are spending large sums of money on advertising and trying to gain market share over Squirt.Solution to the Problems1. The flat sales of Squirt need to be boosted before competing brands begin to erode the market share enjoyed by Squirt. Squirt maintains a low budget compared to the direct competitors, while keeping double the case volume of all competition combined. They should expand the market by placing a bottler in New York & Texas.2. Considering Squirt's current position they have to large of a target market. They need to target the younger teen demographic, as well as the younger ethnic markets. Squirt's "thirst quenching" attribute is great for the Southwestern U.S. where the year round temperatures are high. Southern California also has an outdoor lifestyle that lends itself to a thirst quenching drink.3. The growing Hispanic population could be a major area of growth for the Squirt brand. Squirt needs to advertise on the major Spanish language television stations, Telemundo and Univision. They also need to revisit their distribution strategies in the emerging Hispanic markets. Since Hispanics like to shop in mom and pop markets they need to have the products available there. They also need to make sure that the advertising message fits in with the Hispanic preference for reality based, real world messages.ConclusionCase Volume For Major Carbonated Grapefruit & Citrus Flavored BrandsEach company respectively has numerous brands that it sales. These top brands account for almost 73% of soft drink sales in the United States. Dr. Pepper/Seven Up, Inc. owns two of the top ten brands sold. Colas are the dominant flavor in the U.S carbonated soft drink industry; however, popularity for flavored soft drinks has grown in recent years. The changing demographics of the U.S population have been an important factor in the growing popularity of these flavored soft drinks.Five Squirt bottlers account for 50% of sales. These bottlers are located in Los Angeles, Chicago, Detroit, San Diego, and Portland. A total of 100 bottlers account for half of the Squirt case volume with these bottlers located predominantly in the Western U.S. California alone is responsible for 38% of the total Squirt Case volume. DPSU Current Targeting Approach18-34 Years OldSquirt is 80%Diet Squirt is 20%Squirt doesn't have any bottlers in the northern states of America. The states with the largest population of Hispanics are California, Texas, & New YorkTARGETINGNarrow the segment age from 18-34 to 18-24People choose their favorite drinks between the ages of 12-24Place a bottler in New York to maximize opportunities in the northern states & a bottler in Texas to lower unnecessary expenses. Advertise strictly to the Hispanic culture instead of being multiculturalThe suggestion by FCB to target a multicultural younger segment was supported by recent information provided by the U.S. Census 2000. According to the Census, the Hispanic population in the United States increased by 57.9% from 22.4 million in 1990 to 35.3 million in 2000. This was compared to an increase of 13.2% for the total U.S. population. Hispanics accounted for 12.5% of the U.S. population, while African Americans accounted for 12.3% of the U.S. population with 34.7 million people. 35% of the Hispanic population is under 18 years old. This means that a possible 65% of this demographic may fall into our target segment that is above 18 years old. 65% * 35,300,000(total Hispanic population)=22,945,000 Hispanics may possibly make up the new target segment *This number is assuming that the rest of the population falls between the ages of 18- 34, which is not likely. 32.4% of African Americans were under the age of 18, while 42.6 % were under 25. From this we can conclude that 10.2% (42.6%-32.4%) falls within the range of 18-25 year olds. 10.2% * 34,700,000(total African American population)=3,539,400 African Americans could possibly fall within Squirt's target market. Assuming that the makeup of each demographic is correct, Squirt stands to have a total possible market of 26,484,400(Hispanic segment+ African American segment) people that are from the Hispanic and African American communities in which to target. Targeting these markets could be very beneficial if they continue to grow in the future. Compared to competitors, Squirt's advertising expenditures are typically lower. Combined expenditures for advertising and promotion amount to 20%-25% of total dollar sales. A breakdown of sales compared to dollar spent on advertising can be seen below. 54,600,000(Total volume sales for 2000) $390,000,000(Squirt Regular/Diet advertising)+ $537,200,000(Squirt Ruby Red advertising) = .0588 units per dollar spent on advertising The above figure shows that for every dollar spent on advertising .0588 units were sold. This means that Squirt had a very low percentage of sales compared to the amount that it spent on advertising.Full transcriptMore presentations by
