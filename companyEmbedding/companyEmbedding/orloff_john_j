CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Nov. 03, 2016 -- Aegerion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:AEGR), a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development and commercialization of innovative therapies for patients with debilitating rare diseases, today announced the appointment of John J. Orloff, M.D., as executive vice president, head of research and development, effective immediately.
Chief Executive Officer of Aegerion Mary Szela said, "John's passion and commitment to patients, his experience across multiple therapeutic areas and his ability to build and lead talented R&D organizations will help Aegerion progress its mission of advancing treatments for patients who suffer from devastating rare diseases. We look forward to benefitting from John's strategic and operational capabilities as we prepare for the planned merger between Aegerion and QLT and the launch of Novelion Therapeutics."
Dr. Orloff brings nearly 20 years of global experience in drug discovery and development. In his role, Dr. Orloff will oversee the effort to build a nimble development organization to advance its portfolio of products for rare diseases, including the design of a clinical program for MYALEPT with the goal of developing it to its full potential. Prior to joining Aegerion, Dr. Orloff served as executive vice president, global head of research and development, and chief scientific officer of Baxalta, Inc., where he was responsible for advancing the company's pipeline across hematology, immunology and oncology. Prior to Baxter International's spinoff of its BioScience business to create Baxalta, Dr. Orloff held a similar role at Baxter. Prior to Baxter, he was senior vice president, global head of clinical development at Merck Serono Pharmaceuticals. Between 2003 and 2013, Dr. Orloff held a series of scientific leadership roles at Novartis Pharma AG, including senior vice president and chief medical officer. Previously, he was a senior director at Merck Research Laboratories, where he began as an associate director in 1997.
Dr. Orloff completed his internal medicine residency at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and his endocrinology and metabolism fellowship at Yale University School of Medicine, where he also spent seven years on the faculty. He holds an M.D. from University of Vermont College of Medicine and a B.A. from Dartmouth College.
Dr. Orloff commented, "We have a unique opportunity to build upon Aegerion's portfolio of transformative therapies treating rare diseases, beginning with evaluating potential new indications for MYALEPT®. I am proud to join a team whose foundation is an unwavering commitment to patient care with a vision to create a leading rare disease-focused biotech company." 
About Aegerion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
Aegerion Pharmaceuticals is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development and commercialization of innovative therapies for patients with debilitating rare diseases.  For more information about the company, please visit www.aegerion.com.
Forward-Looking Statements
This press release contains forward-looking statements, including statements regarding the potential expansion of MYALEPT development and our development programs and portfolio in general; potential in-licensing opportunities; and the closing of the merger with QLT. These forward-looking statements are neither promises nor guarantees of future performance, and are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in these forward-looking statements. In particular, the risks and uncertainties include, among others: the risk that we fail to receive, on a timely basis or otherwise, the required approvals by Aegerion and QLT shareholders and government or regulatory agencies that are necessary to close the merger; the risk that a condition to closing of the merger may not be satisfied; the risk that regulatory authorities in regions or countries where either of our products is not yet approved may refuse to approve such products or additional indications for such products, such approvals are not made on a timely basis or such approvals impose significant restrictions or require additional development; the risks that positive pre-clinical or early stage data does not carry over into late stage data and therefore results in decisions to stop clinical development or the failure to achieve regulatory approvals; and the other risks inherent in the commercialization, drug development and regulatory approval process. For additional disclosure regarding these and other risks we face, see the disclosure contained in the "Risk Factors" section of Aegerion's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed on August 9, 2016, and our other public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, available on the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov.

        9 | US-Russia Scientific Forum | J Orloff | 16 November 2011 | Figure from Krueger and Franz. Pediatr Drugs. 2008;10:299-313, with permission. Tuberous Sclerosis : Rare Autosomal Dominant Genetic Disease  Estimated to be 1 in 6,000 live births  1-2 million worldwide (50,000 US)  All sexes, races, and ethnicities  Benign tumors (hamartomas) interfering with organ function  Common sites are skin, kidney, brain, lung, eyes, and heart  Skin lesions including facial angiofibromas in >90% of patients  Neurologic manifestations are predominant clinical feature  Epilepsy in 70-80% due to cortical tubers  SEGAs (subependymal giant cell astrocytoma) in 5-20%; associated with hydrocephalus and increased intracranial pressure

        12 | US-Russia Scientific Forum | J Orloff | 16 November 2011 | Orphan Drugs: Recent Trends in approvals  During the 2000s, orphan products comprised 22% of all NMEs and 31% of all SBs receiving US marketing approval  The number of orphan product designations increased from 208 in 2000-02 to 425 in 2006-08  Novartis has 39 orphan designations and 18 orphan approvals to date







13

        13 | US-Russia Scientific Forum | J Orloff | 16 November 2011 | Orphan Drug Approvals 2009 BioMarket Trends: Jun 15 2010 (Vol. 30, No. 12)







14

        14 | US-Russia Scientific Forum | J Orloff | 16 November 2011 | Orphan Drug Legislation  The US Orphan Drug Act has been a success in encouraging many new drug approvals for rare diseases  More than 2100 orphan designations  Designations more than doubled during past decade  Over 350 approvals for orphan products  Similar orphan drug legislation (ODL) in other countries (EU, Japan, Australia)  But, only ~200 of > 6000 rare diseases have an approved Rx  Additional “Push” and “pull” incentives could foster greater investment in rare (and neglected) diseases







15

        15 | US-Russia Scientific Forum | J Orloff | 16 November 2011 | Mechanisms to spur innovation for Orphan Diseases  “Push” mechanisms  Increase grant and research funding  Stronger partnership among key stakeholders (HA, industry, academia, advocacy groups), including “de-risking” programs  Increase and expand R&D tax credit to neglected diseases  “Pull” mechanisms  Extend market exclusivity (10 years) and include neglected diseases (clearly defined)  Favorable reimbursement approach – automatic  For NMEs, consider patent extension on the molecule (e.g. 6 mo similar to pediatrics)  Advance market commitments (AMCs) – subsidize purchase of product after development  Priority review voucher system (PRV) – expand and improve







16

        16 | US-Russia Scientific Forum | J Orloff | 16 November 2011 | Opportunities and Incentives for Orphan Drugs and Neglected Diseases: Regulatory Flexibility  Apply existing regulations with greater flexibility to foster development (accelerated approval program)  Reduced requirements for clinical and preclinical program, including smaller trials and safety databases, historical controls, retrospective analyses, observational data, etc. – establish global standards (ICH)  Consider acceptance of biomarkers (e.g. PD endpoints) as surrogates for approval (reduced burden for qualification)  Conditional approval for rare & neglected diseases  Global harmonization of regulatory requirements Partner with WHO and other health authorities – leverage expertise

Maryann, New Jersey
