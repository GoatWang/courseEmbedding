Philosophy
By integrating a number of hedge fund strategies, the objective is to generate capital appreciation over the long term through having a diversified risk profile, with relatively low volatility and a low correlation with traditional equity and fixed-income markets.
JPMAAM operate a thorough and comprehensive operational due diligence process and adopt a sceptical approach to hedge fund investing, focusing on what could go wrong and where the risk lies.
The breadth of choice of multi strategy investments, increased complexity and ‘unproven’ strategies make investing a research intensive process. JPMAAM undertake a high degree of due diligence, research and ongoing monitoring.
JPMAAM’s 31 investment analysts each cover four to six hedge funds. This high coverage ratio allows analysts to dig deeper and engage in thorough analysis and monitoring.
Objective
To exceed the benchmark over a rolling three year period after fees and expenses, before taxes.
Benchmark
Bloomberg NZBond Bank Bill Index plus 2.5% per annum
Hedging policy
JPMAAM is responsible for hedging foreign currency exposures to NZD and has developed a New Zealand dollar share class for MSF II which the Nikko AM Wholesale Multi-Strategy Fund invests in.
