IC Power Pte. Ltd., a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary of Kenon Holdings Ltd., Files a Registration Statement with the SEC in Connection with a Proposed Initial Public Offering of its Ordinary Shares

Aug 31, 2015, 13:01 ET
		  		  					
						 from   Kenon Holdings Ltd. 











 
















































 

 




















 


SINGAPORE, Aug. 31, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- IC Power Pte. Ltd. ("IC Power"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kenon Holdings Ltd. (NYSE:   KEN, TASE: KEN) ("Kenon"), announced today that it has filed a Registration Statement on Form F-1 (the "Registration Statement") with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") relating to the proposed initial public offering ("IPO") of ordinary shares of IC Power (the "Ordinary Shares"). IC Power will be the holding company of I.C. Power Ltd., a leading owner, developer and operator of power facilities across key power generation markets in Latin America, the Caribbean and Israel.   
The number of Ordinary Shares to be offered in the proposed IPO, and the price range of such Ordinary Shares, has yet to be determined. IC Power intends to use the net proceeds of the proposed IPO, along with readily available cash, to develop greenfield projects, acquire companies or assets in the electricity sector, repay an intercompany note payable by IC Power to Kenon of up to $220 million (which note will be issued by IC Power to Kenon prior to the IPO), and for general corporate purposes. 
The proposed IPO represents a key step in Kenon's implementation of its strategy to provide its investors with direct access to its primary businesses, including IC Power. Following the proposed IPO, Kenon will be the majority shareholder of IC Power.
The Registration Statement contains new and updated business, regulatory, operating and financial information relating to IC Power's businesses. See the notes to I.C. Power Ltd.'s financial statements for the three years ended December 31, 2014 included in the Registration Statement for a discussion of subsequent events, including the recent publications by the Israeli power regulator and the related adjustments to I.C. Power Ltd.'s financial statements. 
This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to buy, any securities, nor shall there be any sales of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.
About Kenon
Kenon is a holding company that operates dynamic, primarily growth-oriented businesses. The companies it owns, in whole or in part, are at various stages of development, ranging from established, cash-generating businesses to early stage development companies. Kenon's businesses consist of:

IC Power (100% interest) – which will be the holding company of I.C. Power Ltd., a leading owner, developer and operator of power generation facilities in the Latin American, Caribbean and Israeli power generation markets; 


Qoros Automotive Co., Ltd. (50% interest) – a China-based automotive company; 


ZIM Integrated Shipping Services, Ltd. (32% interest) – an international shipping company; and 


Primus Green Energy, Inc. (91% interest) – an early stage developer of alternative fuel technology.
Kenon's primary focus is to grow and develop its primary businesses, IC Power and Qoros. Following the growth and development of its primary businesses, Kenon intends to provide its shareholders direct access to these businesses, when it believes it is in the best interests of its shareholders for it to do so based on factors specific to each business, market conditions and other relevant information. Kenon intends to support the development of its non-primary businesses, and to act to realize their value for its shareholders by distributing its interests in its non-primary businesses to its shareholders or selling its interests in its non-primary businesses, rationally and expeditiously. For further information on Kenon's businesses and strategy, see Kenon's publicly available filings, which can be found on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. Please also see http://www.kenon-holdings.com for additional information.
Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements 
This press release includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements include, but are not limited to, statements about a proposed initial public offering of the Ordinary Shares, including the expected uses of the proceeds of the offering and references to new information relating to IC Power's businesses in the Registration Statement. These statements are based on  current expectations or beliefs, and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including a failure to launch or complete the proposed IPO,  a failure to use the proceeds of the proposed IPO as set forth in this press release, and other risks and factors, including those risks set forth under the heading "Risk Factors" in the Registration Statement filed with the SEC. Except as required by law, Kenon undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.

Assuming an initial public offering price of $13.50 per share, which is the
midpoint of the offering price range set forth on the cover page of this
prospectus, we estimate that the net proceeds to us from the sale of our
ordinary shares in this offering will be approximately $326 million (or $377
million if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional
ordinary shares from us), after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and
commissions and offering expenses.

We intend to use the net proceeds that we receive in this offering, along with
readily available cash, (1) to develop greenfield projects, (2) to acquire
companies or assets in the electricity sector (e.g., generation, transmission or
distribution companies or assets), (3) to prepay in full all obligations under
our $145 million note payable to Kenon, which was issued to Kenon as part of the
consideration for Kenon’s contribution of ICP to us in connection with the
Reorganization, bears interest at a rate of LIBOR + 6% per annum from March 17,
2016, and will mature, unless otherwise prepaid, on December 31, 2018, (4) to
prepay in full all obligations under the $100 million Overseas Facility, which
facility must be prepaid in the event of our initial public offering, and bears
interest ranging from 90-day LIBOR plus 5.00% to 90-day LIBOR plus 6.50% and
(5) general corporate purposes.

Other than with respect to our prepayment in full of all obligations under our
notes payable to Kenon and the Overseas Facility, the amount and timing of our
actual use of the net proceeds that we will receive from this offering, and the
amount of cash from other sources that we intend to use, if any, in connection
with the uses stated above, will depend upon numerous factors, including the
cash used in or generated by our operations, the level of our expansion efforts,
our ability to identify greenfield development projects or companies or assets
to acquire, the development and / or acquisition expenses related to such
projects, companies, or assets, as well as the results of our existing
development efforts. Our management has discretion over many of these factors.
Except as specified above, we are unable to estimate the amount of the net
proceeds from this offering that will be used for any of the purposes described
above and therefore will have broad discretion in using these proceeds.


Our major competitors in the Latin American and Caribbean countries in which our
generation companies operate are generally the large international power utility
corporations operating in these countries. Local competitors also exist in each
of these countries and account for varying market shares, depending upon the
country of interest.

Set forth below is a discussion of competition among power generation companies
in certain of our markets of operation.

Peru

In Peru, power generation companies compete along a number of dimensions,
including the ability to (1) source and enter into long-term PPAs with power
purchases, (2) source and secure land for the development or expansion of
additional power generation plants, (3) source and secure natural gas to fuel
power generation stations, (4) win tenders by the Peruvian government to build
cold, or other generation supply, reserve plants, and (5) maintain or increase
market share in the growing Peruvian electricity market, particularly in
connection with the balance of energy supply and demand within Peru. In Peru, we
compete with state-owned generation companies (although their relative weight in
the market has been diminishing over time since the privatization process
started in the 1990s), as well as large international and domestic private
generators.

The following table sets forth the quantity of energy generated by each of the
principal generation companies in Peru for the periods presented:

                                                              For the Year Ended December 31,                      
                                                   2015                     2014                     2013

Israel

Within Israel, our major competitors are IEC and private power generators, such
as Dorad Energy Ltd. and Dalia, who, as a result of recent government
initiatives encouraging investments in the Israeli power generation market, have
constructed, and are constructing, power stations with significant capacity.

Until OPC reached COD in July 2013, IEC operated as the sole large-scale
provider of electricity in Israel. In May 2014, Dorad Energy Ltd. became the
second IPP to reach COD in Israel, adding a capacity of 860 MW to the Israeli
electric market. In July 2015, the first of two units of the power plant of
Dalia reached COD. In September 2015, the second unit reached its COD, adding,
together with the first unit, 910 MW to the Israeli electric market. Several
other IPPs are in the process of constructing power plants, and are expected to
reach COD in the coming years. As of the date of this prospectus, IEC has not
published generation and energy and capacity sales information for IPPs.

Bolivia

The electricity market in Bolivia is primarily served by a variety of generation
companies, including COBEE, Guaracachi, Valle Hermoso and Corani. Prior to May
2010, Guaracachi was a subsidiary of Rurelec Plc, Valle Hermoso was a subsidiary
of the Bolivian Generating Group, and Corani was a subsidiary of Engie S.A. In
May 2010, the Bolivian government nationalized each of these generation
companies and began negotiations with the owners of these generation companies
with respect to the compensation to be paid for these assets. In October 2011,
the Bolivian government reached compensation settlements related to the
nationalization of Valle Hermoso and Corani, and in 2014, reached compensation
settlements related to the nationalization of Guaracachi.

The following table sets forth the quantity of energy generated by each of the

Company Description
We are a leading owner, developer and operator of power generation facilities
located in key energy markets in Latin America, the Caribbean and Israel.
Additionally, in January 2016, we completed our acquisition of Energuate
(comprised of two electricity distribution companies in Guatemala (DEORSA


 and
DEOCSA)), marking our initial entry in the electricity distribution sector.

The power generation companies within our portfolio utilize a range of energy
sources, including natural gas, hydroelectric, heavy fuel oil, or HFO, diesel
and wind. We principally focus our generation operations in Latin American
markets, which typically have higher growth rates of gross domestic product, or
GDP, and lower overall and per capita energy consumption, as compared with more
developed markets. We believe that economic growth in Latin American markets
will drive increases in overall and per capita energy consumption and therefore
require significant additional investments in power generation assets in those
markets. As of September 30, 2016, our installed capacity and proportionate
capacity were 3,894 MW and 3,114 MW, respectively, including Kanan’s 92 MW
thermal generation project in Panama, which reached its commercial operation
date, or COD, in April 2016, Samay I’s 616 MW cold-reserve thermoelectric
project in Peru, which reached COD in May 2016, and Cerro del Águila S.A.’s, or
CDA’s, 510 MW hydroelectric plant located in Peru, which plant’s three
generating units reached COD in August 2016.

In addition, in August 2015, we acquired Advanced Integrated Energy, or AIE,
which currently operates an 18 MW plant in Israel and holds a conditional
license for the construction of a cogeneration power station in Israel. AIE
commenced construction of the plant in June 2016, and the AIE plant, which is
expected to have a capacity of 140 MW, is expected to reach its COD by early
2019.

ICP’s activities started in 2007 when Inkia Energy Limited, or Inkia, a
subsidiary of Israel Corporation Ltd., or IC, an Israeli conglomerate, acquired
Globeleq Americas Limited’s, or Globeleq’s, power generation assets in Latin
America, which represented 549 MW of installed capacity. In 2010, IC formed ICP
and contributed both Inkia and O.P.C. Rotem Ltd., or OPC, to ICP. In January
2015, IC transferred ICP to Kenon, our sole shareholder, in connection with IC’s
spin-off of Kenon. In March 2016, Kenon effected an internal reorganization
pursuant to which it transferred all of its equity interests in ICP to us.

Between 2007 and September 30, 2016, we invested approximately $3.1 billion in
the acquisition, development and expansion of our power generation and
distribution assets. Of this amount, investment in power generation assets
represented $2.9 billion, of which 87% represented investments in greenfield
development (including investments made in CDA, Samay I and Kanan) and 13%
represented acquisitions. We have financed our greenfield development using a
combination of cash on hand, debt financing and investments by minority
shareholders at the asset level, and have financed the acquisitions of our power
generation assets using cash on hand. As of September 30, 2016, of the 3,345 MW
that we have added to our installed capacity since Inkia’s formation, 76% was
derived from greenfield development projects, consisting primarily of our
construction of Kallpa Generación S.A.’s, or Kallpa’s, combined cycle plant,
Peru’s largest power generation facility, the construction of OPC’s plant, which
became Israel’s first independent power producer, or IPP, and the construction
of the Samay I project, a cold-reserve thermoelectric plant in Peru. In the same
period, we have acquired businesses with an aggregate installed capacity of 801
MW in Israel and five countries in Latin America. As of September 30, 2016, we
had derived 76% of our installed capacity growth since 2007 from greenfield
development efforts.

By successfully pursuing growth opportunities, primarily through contracted
greenfield development projects in existing markets and acquisitions of anchor
investments in new markets, we have expanded our regional presence, diversified
our generation portfolio through the addition of various facilities which use a
range of energy sources, and significantly increased our cash flows. In 2015,
our Adjusted EBITDA was $326 million, as compared to $41 million in 2008,
representing a compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 34% during this period.
Adjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS measure.

We typically enter into long-term U.S. Dollar-linked power purchase agreements,
or PPAs, to sell capacity and/or energy to customers that we believe have strong
credit profiles, such as large local distribution companies or non-regulated
customers that are subsidiaries of large multinational corporations. As of
December 31, 2015, the weighted average remaining life of our PPAs was 10 years
(including the remaining life of the PPAs for CDA, Samay I and Kanan). In the
year ended December 31, 2015, 89% of our aggregate energy sales (in gigawatt
hours, or GWh) were made pursuant to long-term PPAs. We believe this practice
limits our exposure to fluctuations in energy spot market rates and helps us to
generate strong and predictable margins and cash flows. We seek to enter into
PPAs at prices that are equal to, or higher than, the prevailing spot market
rates in the countries in which we operate. Additionally, the majority of our
PPAs are indexed to the underlying fuel cost of the related long-term supply
agreements. Such indexing generally limits our exposure to fuel price
fluctuations, including the effect of such fluctuations on our margins. We
believe that the stable and predictable margins and cash flows which generally
result from such PPAs helps us to successfully secure significant project and
bank/bond financing, with no or limited recourse, from a diverse international
lender base during the construction of our greenfield projects, which helps us
to successfully develop our project pipeline.

Our power generation portfolio is comprised of facilities located in key power
generation markets in Latin America, the Caribbean and Israel, using a range of
energy sources.

We are a leader in our largest market, Peru, one of the fastest growing
economies in Latin America, with an average GDP growth rate of approximately
4.8% per year from 2010 through 2015 according to the International Monetary
Fund, a mature regulatory framework, and a well-run power system. As of and for
the year ended December 31, 2015, our operating company in Peru, Kallpa, had an
installed capacity of 1,063 MW, representing 11% of Peru’s installed capacity,
and generated 12% of the gross energy generated (in GWh) in Peru. Kallpa 
represented 81% of our net income, 47% of our Adjusted EBITDA, and 40% of our
installed capacity as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015. In May 2016,
Samay I (our cold-reserve thermoelectric project) reached COD, providing an
additional 616 MW of installed capacity to the Peruvian market. In August 2016,
we provided an additional 510 MW of installed capacity to the Peruvian market
with the completion of the three generating units of CDA. As a result of the
completion of this project, our total installed capacity in Peru is 2,189 MW,
making us the principal power producer in Peru in terms of installed capacity.
Although energy and capacity prices in Peru have recently experienced downward
pressure due to oversupply of capacity in the market, we expect demand and spot
prices to increase in the medium term as a result of large mining and industrial
projects in Peru and sustained growth in underlying demand.

We also operate OPC, the first IPP in Israel, which, in 2013 following decades
of state control, opened its electricity market to private power producers. As a
result, the electricity market in Israel is still in the early stages of
development. Israel’s energy consumption levels have also increased in recent
years and are expected to continue to increase in the near-term. As of and for
the year ended December 31, 2015, OPC had an installed capacity of 440 MW,
representing approximately 3% of Israel’s installed capacity and 19% of the
installed capacity of IPPs, and generated 6% of the gross energy generated (in
GWh) in Israel. As of and for the year ended December 31, 2015, OPC represented
38% of our net income, 24% of our Adjusted EBITDA, and 17% of our installed
capacity. We believe that OPC’s plant provides us with a strategic advantage as
an early entrant to the Israeli electricity market. Additionally, given Israel’s
growing economy and the advanced age of its existing state-owned power
generation facilities, we believe OPC provides us with the know-how and 
visibility to pursue additional power project opportunities in Israel, such as
the acquisition of AIE, which opportunities may become increasingly available to
private sector participants such as us.

In addition to our attractive positions in Peru and Israel, we have also
developed an attractive footprint in several markets in Latin America, including
Chile and Colombia, and are in the process of opening a development office in
Mexico. Additionally, in January 2016, we completed our acquisition of Energuate
(comprised of two electricity distribution companies in Guatemala (DEORSA and
DEOCSA)), and two smaller, related companies (Guatemel and RECSA). As of
September 30, 2016, Energuate provided electric service for approximately
1.7 million regulated customers in Guatemala (representing approximately 54% of
Guatemala’s regulated distribution customers) and distributes energy across
101,914 km2 in Guatemala, covering approximately 12 million inhabitants.
Energuate operates approximately 70,000 km of distribution lines within
Guatemala (representing approximately 84% of Guatemala’s distribution lines) as
of December 31, 2015, and holds the non-exclusive right to distribute
electricity within its service area until 2048. In the years ended December 31,
2015 and 2014, Energuate sold 2,315 GWh and 2,184 GWh of energy, respectively.
We believe that our current platform, coupled with our agile and disciplined
decision-making process, enables us to take advantage of opportunities as they
arise.
