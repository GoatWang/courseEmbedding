In the early 1960′s, as small country stores began to dot the Virginia countryside, Davenport Energy developed a substantial business with service stations and convience stores.
In the early 1980′s Davenport Energy recognized the growing need for propane service and supply. Davenport Energy is recognized today as one of the leading suppliers of propane in the region.
Through the lofty goals and work ethic instilled by its founder, and with the current leadership of Ben J. Davenport Jr. , Davenport Energy continues to be an industry leader with 7 regional offices serving over 21,000 customers. Our strong management team is dedicated to putting the customer first 100% of the time, thus providing unsurpassed product quality and consumer commitment.

Ben Davenport Jr. to receive Virginia Tech’s highest honor





May 12, 2016























Ben Davenport Jr.




Ben J. Davenport Jr., of Chatham, will receive Virginia Tech’s highest honor, the William H. Ruffner Medal.
Presented each year at University Commencement, the Ruffner Medal recognizes individuals who have performed notable and distinguished service to Virginia Tech.
Davenport and his wife, Betty, are members of the President’s Circle within the Ut Prosim Society of donors, which is reserved for the university’s most-generous philanthropic supporters. Davenport co-led the effort to honor former university president Charles Steger by renaming the Center for European Studies and Architecture at Riva San Vitale, Switzerland, as the Steger Center for International Scholarship.
Davenport’s service to the university includes terms on the Virginia Tech Board of Visitors, including two years as rector. While he was rector in 2005, the university adopted the Virginia Tech Principles of Community.
Davenport has served on the Virginia Tech Foundation Board, including four years as its chair. He is past chair of the Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine Board of Directors.
Davenport, who graduated from Virginia Tech in 1964 with a bachelor’s in business administration, has also served on the Pamplin College of Business Advisory Board, and has frequently volunteered in support of other university initiatives. He was a leader in establishing the Institute for Advanced Learning and Research. Additionally, he has been a dedicated backer of Virginia Cooperative Extension, and an advocate for budget support from the Commonwealth of Virginia.
Davenport’s service extends beyond Virginia Tech. He has held leadership positions with organizations including the Virginia Early Childhood Foundation, the Future of the Piedmont Foundation, the Danville Regional Foundation, and the Virginia Chamber of Commerce. He serves on the board of American National Bank and Trust Company.
Davenport is chairman of First Piedmont Corporation, a regional waste-management company, as well as Davenport Energy, a supplier of petroleum products in southern Virginia. He and his wife are members of Chatham Baptist Church and have served as deacons of the fellowship.

Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."


Rhonda, Missouri
Caring Mom
"I'm a single mother dating online and I use BeenVerified to help protect my family!"









More Testimonials





From the Press
Gizmodo.com
"It found my photos on Flickr, my Amazon wishlist, my public Foursquare records, Vimeo, Picassa, and Stumbleupon accounts. It grabbed approximately twelve bajillion photos of me (with many, many false positives) and even more web links."


From the Press
U.S. News & World Report
"BeenVerified easily and inexpensively provides access to public records information through its website and several mobile phone applications. No longer are large corporations the only ones who can afford background checks."

The Extras We Include, for FREE


Run criminal background checks on previous owners, their associates, or the neighbors. Get to know the whole story.
