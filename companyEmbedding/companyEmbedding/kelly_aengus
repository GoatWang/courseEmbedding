Aengus Kelly
Thank you, Brian. Good morning, everybody. And thank you for joining us for our 2017 first quarter earnings call. I'm happy to report another quarter of strong earnings and profitability.
During the first quarter, we generated $1.48 of earning per share and net income of $261 million. The strong performance of the AerCap platform drove a fleet utilization rate of 99.7% for the first quarter, reflecting robust demand for aircraft globally.
AerCap's global leasing platform continues to capture the growth in demand for air travel. During the first quarter, we executed 105 transactions, equal to more than one transaction every day. This included 69 lease agreements, 57 of which were narrowbodies and 12 were widebodies.
Our average remaining lease term has now lengthened to 6.5 years. A notable transaction during the quarter was the delivery of the first two A350 aircrafts to Air Caraïbes. The strong demand for aircraft is also evident in the secondary market. And we continue to capitalize on this through the sale of 21 owned aircrafts which had an average age of 15 years and resulted in a gain on sale of 11%. As you are aware, the sale of aircraft is a very deliberate strategy by AerCap.
Most importantly, it is a critical tool in managing our portfolio and improving the overall quality of our fleet. But the sales also generated excess capital that we were able to deploy by repurchasing stock at attractive levels, which creates further value for our shareholders. In the past 12 months alone, we have grown book value per share by 17%. We do recognize that the asset sales program has resulted in a reduction in assets over the past two years and has had an impact on our net interest margin.

However, as noted, it has improved our portfolio via the capital freed up from - and via the capital freed up from sales for share repurchases, has resulted in significant EPS and book value per share accretion. We believe this is the right portfolio management strategy to follow in order to maximize shareholder value over the long term. I expect our assets to begin growing again in the second half of 2017 as our forward order books starts to deliver in earnest.
As you are aware, we have over $24 billion worth of aircraft delivering in the next five years. Given AerCap's industry-leading platform, we have excellent visibility over the health of all the main drivers of the industry. The scale of our platform gives AerCap a unique insight into end-user sentiment and demand for all aircraft types.
From our perspective, industry fundamentals remain robust. IATA reported strong passenger traffic numbers for the start of 2017 and global airline profitability remains healthy. We continue to see strong demand in domestic China. Latin America is beginning to turn and Russia's recovery continues.
In an industry as global as ours, there will always be isolated events that will generate headlines. That is to be expected. But through diversification and effective risk management, these events should always be manageable. Focusing on the liability side of our business, we continue to be very active in the financing markets during the first quarter. Alongside receiving our IG upgrade from Moody's, we executed $7.2 billion of financing transactions.
We continue to maintain $9.5 billion of available liquidity and we closed the quarter with an adjusted debt equity ratio of 2.7 to 1. In the current environment, we believe that effectively purchasing our own fleet through share repurchases generates greater value than purchasing aircraft in the open market. Over the last two years, we have bought back more than 50 million shares, equivalent to more than 23% of the outstanding share count.
To this end, we are announcing a new share repurchase program of $300 million, effective through September 30. To close, I would like to reiterate that AerCap is entering the second quarter of 2017 in a strong position. We have significant earnings visibility, as 95% of all lease rental revenue through 2019 is now contracted. This visibility, along with our disciplined approach to capital allocation will continue to drive value for AerCap's shareholders.
With that, I will hand the call over to Pete, for a detailed review of our financial performance. Peter?
Peter Juhas
Thanks, Gus. Good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 5 of the presentation. Our reported net income for the first quarter was $261.2 million, an increase of 17% over the first quarter of 2016.
The increase was driven primarily by higher gain on sale of assets and lower maintenance rates expense, as well as lower losses from our AeroTurbine subsidiary, as we approach the final stages of our wind-down of AeroTurbine. This is partially offset by lower income as a result of our sales of mid-life and older aircraft, which reduced our average lease assets by around $1.4 billion, year-over-year.
Turning to Slide 6, our diluted earnings per share for the first quarter was $1.48, an increase of 31% over the first quarter of 2016. Earnings per share was impacted by the same factors driving net income, as well as by the repurchase of 31.6 million shares during 2016 and the first quarter of 2017. You can see the impact of these share repurchases coming through, and that while our net income was up 17% year-over-year, our EPS was up 31%. On this slide, we've also provided the after-tax earnings per share impact for the same components as we did for net income.
On Slide 7, our total shareholder's equity as of March 31 was $8.520 billion. And our book value per share at the end of the first quarter was $51.20. We have grown book value per share as Gus mentioned by 17% over the past year through a combination of earnings as well as share repurchases, and by 33% over the past two years. Through last Friday, we've repurchased around 50 million of shares or over 23% of total shares outstanding for over $2 billion.

On Slide 8, our total revenue for the first quarter was $1,236.8 million. The substantial amount of asset sales that we've completed over the past year reduced our average lease assets by about $1.4 billion period over period. This led to lower basic lease rents which were $1.67 billion in the first quarter of 2017, down from $1.139 billion in the prior year period.
Our maintenance revenues for the quarter were $89.9 million, a decrease from $150.4 million in 2016. As you may recall, we had a relatively high number of lease terminations and amendments in the first quarter of 2016, and that resulted in higher maintenance revenues during that quarter.
Our net gain on sales was $47.3 million for the first quarter, compared to $19 million a year ago. As we continue to sell mid-life and older aircraft at attractive prices. The sales margin was higher on the first quarter at around 11%, which indicates a strong demand that we continue to see from investors for older used aircraft.
Our other income was $32.5 million for the quarter, the increase in other income over the prior year period was primarily driven by contractual payments resulting from lease termination.
Turning to Slide 9, our net interest margin was $787.9 million for the quarter, compared to $865.7 million in the prior year period. Again, the decrease was due to the reduction of our average lease assets from $35.5 billion to $34.1 billion due to asset sales. Our annualized net spread for the first quarter was 9.2% compared to 9.8% in the first quarter of 2016.
As we discussed last quarter, the two main drivers of this are reduction in the average age of our fleets and an increase in our average cost of debt. This is consistent with the guidance we gave at our Investor Day in November, where we mentioned that our net spread for 2017 would be lower because of these two factors.
Our average cost of debt increased from 3.7% in the first quarter of 2016 to 4% this past quarter, primarily due to the issuance of new longer-term bonds that replaced shorter-term ILFC notes, which had a lower interest expense due to purchase accounting. The average age of our fleet decreased from 7.7 years to 7.3 years as a result of the asset sales in the delivery of new aircraft. The new aircraft generally have lower yields than older aircraft.
On Slide 10 for the quarter, we had a net gain on sale of $47.3 million, up from $19 million in the prior year. We continue to actively sell older aircraft to improve the quality of our fleet. During the first quarter, we sold 21 aircraft there were 15-years-old on average. We also placed three 737NGs on long-term leases, which led us to reclassify these aircraft from operating to finance leases.
On the purchase side, we took delivery of 11 new aircraft during the first quarter, including seven A320neos, two A350-900s, and two Boeing 787-9s. As Gus mentioned, our CapEx for the year is backend loaded with about two-thirds of our deliveries coming in Q3 and Q4.
Turning to Slide 11, our leasing expenses were $122.4 million for the first quarter, down from $167.4 million in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to lower maintenance rates expense as a result of fewer maintenance events during the quarter. Our SG&A expenses were $83.5 million, down from $87 million in the first quarter of 2016, a decrease in SG&A expenses was primarily due to the downsizing of AeroTurbine.
We had no aircraft asset impairments in the first quarter. As you may recall the asset impairments of $44.6 million in the first quarter of 2016 were more than offset by the release of over $62 million of maintenance reserves.
And finally, we had transaction restructuring expenses of $9.9 million during the quarter. These are all related to the AeroTurbine downsizing. During the first quarter, we amended the lease of AeroTurbine's facility in Miami, and we had some lease termination fees associated with that amendment.

We also repaid AeroTurbine's revolving credit facility during the first quarter, and we have now consigned all of the AeroTurbine's remaining parts inventory to a third-party to be sold down over time.
Slide 12, we continue to maintain a very strong liquidity position. As of March 31, we had available liquidity of $9.5 billion. Together with our estimated operating cash flows, that gives us 1.6 times coverage of our next 12 months cash needs or excess cash coverage of $5 billion.
In the first quarter, we completed $7.2 billion worth of financing transactions. These included the amendment, extension and upsizing of our revolving credit facility from $3 billion to $3.75 billion. The amendment and extension of around $2.4 billion of term loan facilities, the $600 million public bond offering we did in the first quarter and around $450 million of other unsecured deals.
As you can see from this activity, financing market for aircraft remains very strong, and we appreciate all the support we continue to have from our banks and our debt investors.
So to wrap up, for AerCap this is another quarter of strong operating and financial performance for our business. We continue to execute on our placements of aircraft, we completed 105 aircraft transactions, more than one a day. We continue to sell older aircraft to improve our portfolio and bid for those assets remains strong, as you can see from the health margin at which we sold them.
And we use the excess capital we generated to buy back 9.5 million shares so far this year for a total of $427 million. At the same time, we continue to maintain a strong balance sheet and liquidity position, with a strong access to funding as we approach a period of higher deliveries in the latter half of this year.
And of course, with the Moody's upgrade during the first quarter, we are now the only independent aircraft leasing company to be rated investment grade by all three major rating agencies.
With that, we will turn it over for Q&A.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Okay. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will pause now for just a moment to assemble the queue. We will take our first question today from Jason Arnold from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jason Arnold
Hi, guys, good morning. I guess, just two quick questions. One was on the robust gain on sale margin here this quarter. I was just wondering if you could talk a bit more on detail on that, maybe specifically any types in particular that you're seeing higher demand on?
Peter Juhas
It was really across the board, Jason, I mean, if you look at - we try to lay out there on the slides. But if you look at the average age of the aircraft that we sold, it was 15 years in this quarter. Going back to the first quarter of 2016, it was 14 years. So it's really very similar. We are just seeing a lot of demand for these used aircraft.
Jason Arnold
Okay. Great, thanks. And then the other question I had was maybe you just update us on your view on the widebody market. We've heard recently some stories from, I believe it's Malaysia and then a few other airlines using or at least contemplating use of widebodies on high traffic routes that are typically maybe more narrowbody on focus, so maybe just some thoughts on that avenue there as well?
Aengus Kelly
Sure. We are seeing an up-gauging of aircraft. And it's a theme that has been going through the industry for quite a few years now. There are a number of routes, particularly in slot constrained airports like Jakarta, where there is, and I should say Kuala Lumpur as well, where there is definitely traffic being spilled that can be picked up if there are bigger aircraft on the route.
Now, of course, the risk of putting a bigger aircraft on the route is, are you sure the traffic will be there for long enough to justify it. And it seems based on what we've observed, as we work with airlines, that there are a number of hubs in the world that are significantly congested on both sides that justify moving from, in Malaysian's case 737, to a larger gauge airplane.

That is something we are observing, I mean, that the widebody market overall, a good widebody will move. It's worth nothing that this - we moved 300 [boats already] [ph], 300 widebodies in the last 2.5 years. And indeed, we have leased 112 A350s and 787s as well.
Jason Arnold
Excellent, thanks very much for the color, guys.
Operator
Thank you. We will now take our next question from Jamie Baker from JPMorgan.
Nish Mani
Hey, good morning, guys. This is actually Nish Mani on for Jamie. Can you guys remind us of your exposure to Alitalia? And how you guys think about managing counterparty-risk, kind of more broadly speaking?
Aengus Kelly
Sure. We have less than 1% of lease revenue coming from Alitalia. We manage counterparty risk very carefully. As I mentioned in my prepared comments, there are always events that occur. Last year, it was focused more in Turkey, and then before that in Russia and Brazil, so this is nothing unusual. And if you look at our credit costs over the last 10 years, you can see that where they have averaged less than 1% of lease revenue per annum. So we are working with Alitalia now and we will see how that evolves over the coming weeks and months.
Nish Mani
Okay, great. And then just switching gears for one second. Taking a step back and looking at your overall fleet strategy. I mean, you guys sold pretty healthy amount of aircraft in the first quarter. And it sound like, it's a portfolio optimization exercise, if you take advantage of the market and demand for these mid-life assets. But as your order books for new deliveries accelerate in 2018 and 2019, can you help us think about how you want to manage the border portfolio? Are you solving for an average age for example and taking advantage of this period? Or are you kind of content with being in that kind of seven-year bracket so to speak? Thank you so much.
Aengus Kelly
We're quite content where the average age is. We generally feel that at the higher end of the range, you don't want to be much more than eight years of age on average. And at the lower end, you don't want to be too much less than low fives. I think in that area, you provide the right risk and reward return for our shareholders. So that's where we target and that's where we are at the moment.
As the new fleet deliveries on the order book, just by virtue of the value of the new aircraft delivering, you will continue to see a decline in the average life of the fleet. And in terms of asset sales, there are certain assets of course that we do want to dispose of, and if we feel that we received the right bid and we'll continue to sell those assets. But it's a combination of looking at the returns from holding the asset versus are we getting the right price to sell it.
Nish Mani
Okay. That makes sense. I really appreciate the color. Thank you so much.
Aengus Kelly
You're welcome.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
James Ulan
Good morning. This is actually James Ulan on for Moshe. Thanks for taking my question. We see that your coverage ratio is going up, I guess from kind of 1.3 to 1.2 to 1.6. And I was wondering if you guys can expand on your philosophy on how to prepare the company for a downturn, especially on the liability side to protect against risk, and how to potentially prepare the company to go on the office in a downturn scenario?
Peter Juhas
Sure. Thanks, James. So the most important thing, obviously, we want to maintain a high level of financial flexibility. And that's why we carry the liquidity balances that we have today. So when we look at it, we say, it's got $9.5 billion of liquidity, if you look at that plus the operating cash flow that we expect and how does that compare to our needs over that period.

We also - but it's also equally important to make sure that the facilities that we have, have the right - or structured appropriately. So they don't have any max or anything like that that in them that would not be of use when - if a downturn comes.
So we're very cognizant of that. You're right that we're carrying higher levels of liquidity recently. That's really just a function, I'd say, some of it is timing function. So it will move around. We still target 1.2 times, I'd say we tend - as you've seen, we tend to be somewhat above that. But longer term, I expect that that ratio will come down really because the level of CapEx that we have ramps up in the second half of this year.
And so, that ratio itself will come down, but in terms of an absolute amount of liquidity that we're holding that will still remain high.
James Ulan
Okay. That's helpful. And can you kind of talk about the competitive environment for executing more larger sale leaseback transactions? Some of your competitors on their recent conference calls announced bigger transactions and we were just wondering kind of how today's environment compares to the past, and whether we might see something incremental in addition to your order book?
Aengus Kelly
Look, as we said before, our objective is to spend our shareholders money to achieve the maximum return for an appropriate level of risk. Over the course of the last several years, the growth of the company has been fueled by M&A, and from that M&A an attractive order book that came with it. We then used a lot of our surplus capital to delever the business. Over the course of the last 18 months, we've been in the position to allocate capital as we see fit, be it for OEM orders, be it for sale leasebacks, share buybacks or M&A activity.
As we evaluate sale leasebacks every week, we bid on sale leasebacks every single week. We evaluate that versus the attractiveness of buying our own aircraft by the share buybacks. And at the moment, we are yet to seeing a transaction that is superior in a risk and reward balance than buying our own aircraft. So long as that remains the case, we'll continue likely to buy our own stock. However, that can change very quickly too. And when it does change, we will be there and we will do it in large size, as we have in the past.
James Ulan
Great. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from Michael Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst
Hi, this is actually Matt on for Mike. So American has recently deferred A350s. And it has been reported in the press that Delta would like to defer up to 10 A350s, and United has indicated that the A350 may not be right for its fleet. Is it response so the big three have any impact on the A350's desirability and residual values?
Aengus Kelly
Don't think so. I can't say as to exactly why they're deferring the aircraft. I understand from some of the comments, they may be to do to the alleviation of working capital. What you did see with the A350 was the largest airline in Asia just order 20 of them last week, and there is another few unidentified orders that were announced also.
The A350-900 and Boeing 787-9 are the widebody airplanes of the future. And they are both, we believe excellent airplanes and they'll form the backbone likely of our widebody fleet as we go forward.
Unidentified Analyst
Thank you. And can you just discuss any potential delivery delays, due to aircraft manufacturer or supplier bottlenecks? Thank you.
Aengus Kelly
Sure. I mean we had addressed this at our Investor Day in November of last year, when we had given some guidance on what we thought would occur with delays as we are working continuously with all the manufactures, the biggest owner of commercial airplanes in the world. And the information we gave at that point in time is still accurate and they are the delays that we've observed.

And if that changes, we'll make you aware if there's any material change to those delays. But what we envisaged last year is so far, I stress that so far, that what has occurred.
Unidentified Analyst
Thanks for taking my question, guys.
Aengus Kelly
You're welcome.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Helane Becker from Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst
Hey, guys. It's actually Steve on for Helane. Just going off of that, it looks like you guys pulled forward some orders into 2017. And I believe also in A320s, a couple of your customers have - actually had to put those aircrafts on the sideline. Are you guys getting penalized for those aircrafts? Thanks.
Peter Juhas
Sure. Let me answer the first part of your question. So on the A320neos, you're right, move eight. In our schedule on Page 18, we moved eight of those that we had originally expected to be delivered in 2018, back to 2017. And basically, that's because of the discussion that we've had with Airbus and those.
In general, we've assumed about three to four month average delay on the platinum [ph] in the A320neos, and about one month delay or so on the CFM A320neos.
Aengus Kelly
We should note, of course, those eight planes are just pulled forward primarily from the Q1 into Q4. So won't have any big impact on the guidance that we have given to you in any event. And then on your question about airplanes that are out of service at the moment, there are ongoing discussions that we are having with the airlines and the OEMs, and can't comment on those.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. And then, one of your other customers actually - sorry, one of your other competitors started to use their management capabilities to manage aircraft that typically don't - wouldn't fit into their fleet. Have you guys thought of using your management capabilities a little more fully, maybe managing some younger aircraft, maybe below that five years you were talking about, managing some older aircrafts, 15 years or older, that wouldn't typically fit into the aircraft fleet. But you can maybe monetize the aircraft cycle a little more?
Aengus Kelly
Sure. I mean, obviously, we've managed hundreds of airplanes over the years. And if you look at the ABS market, as an instrument, that's often used for that reason. And we invented the ABS market 20 years ago. And did the largest transaction ever done and it's still since. And have issued more ABS deals than anyone in the world for all different reasons and variations.
The reasons for ABS are excellent. They can generate significant amount of leverage at a competitive price. If you don't have access to competitively price on secured aircraft, they can very importantly alleviate balance sheet pressures. That was something why we have primarily done it in the past.
And the other big user of ABS is being GECAS. They've primarily used it for gain on sale to be fair. You would never really use it for management fair revenue streams, because over time it's a big commitment over a long-term period, the cost associated with adequately servicing those vehicles. And while those fees are attractive at the front end, what actually happens over time is you have to produce an excellent standard of reporting and service to those vehicles and rightly so. And that doesn't come cost free.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. Thanks, guys.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Christopher Nolan from FBR.
Christopher Nolan
Hey, Pete. Can you give us an update on your 2017 CapEx estimate?
Peter Juhas
Sure. So, Chris, I'd say for the full-year 2017 it's about $6.5 billion.
Christopher Nolan
Great, and then…
Peter Juhas
So we did about $900 million in the first quarter, so that's $5.7 billion remaining, roughly.
Christopher Nolan
Great. And then, just sort of a housekeeping question, what's the book value of the aircraft sold in the first quarter?

Peter Juhas
I don't think, we've disclosed the actual book value of the aircraft sold. It was roughly - if you look at the cash flow statement, you will see it was around $400 million that's on the cash flow statement. There is another $30 million or so of maintenance related to that. So altogether, I'd say the cost of goods sold will be around $450 million altogether.
Christopher Nolan
Great. Thanks for taking my questions.
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our next question from Arren Cyganovich from D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.
Arren Cyganovich
Hi. Can you talk a little bit about the competitive environment? Now, we have another fairly large player with Avolon acquiring a lot of assets. What are you seeing from competition? Is it relatively rational and has it impacted much in terms of your placements of fleet?
Aengus Kelly
I think it is - consolidation is a relatively positive thing for the industry we believe. And I think it was good that an experienced player acquired a large leasing company such as CIT, and in capable hands, we have seen no evidence of any irrational activity. And we think the consolidation is a positive and we will just have to see if there is further consolidation at the lower levels of the business as well.
Arren Cyganovich
Great. Thanks. And in terms of the CapEx numbers, Peter, that you just laid out the $5.7 billion, what's the cadence of those deliveries throughout the next three quarters?
Peter Juhas
It's backend loaded, so about two-thirds of it is in the third and fourth quarter of the year. It keeps ramping up each quarter basically.
Arren Cyganovich
And those delays for the neos, is that included in that and those assumptions are - is there a risk that some of that would be pushed over to 2018?
Peter Juhas
Well, that's included in those numbers, and this is based on our latest discussions with Airbus. So obviously, there is always a risk that some of them won't deliver on time. But this is our best estimate right now. I mean, just to be clear, if you look at what we said in Investor Day, we were assuming further delays then and we're now are assuming a little bit less than that. So it does factor in to our forecast.
Arren Cyganovich
Okay. And in terms of the 95% placements through to 2019, is that only on an new order deliveries or is that also re-leasing stuff that's coming after books?
Aengus Kelly
And that's all revenue from new aircraft and from the rollover of the existing fleet.
Arren Cyganovich
Okay. And just lastly, the other income line was somewhat elevated this quarter. Was there anything that in particular that was non-recurring or one-time revenue there?
Peter Juhas
It was really due to - primarily due to a termination payment, that we received related to a termination last year.
Arren Cyganovich
Okay, all right, thank you.
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will now take our next question from Scott Valentin from Compass Point.
Scott Valentin
Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just quickly on the net spread. It's running, I think it was 9.2% for the quarter. And I think the guidance for the year from the Investor Day was 8.9%. Just wondering if you expect kind of - if it's going to trend down over the course of the year, or do you think with the changes in rate may be worse we were back in November the forward curve, you think the margin can remain higher than initial guidance?
Peter Juhas
Yes, thanks, Scott. I would stick with the guidance that we got right now. I think 8.9% is probably a good number. And one thing you have to keep in mind is that we're leasing these aircraft well in advance. And so, it's hard for any movement to have an impact really on the 2017 numbers. It has to - it would impact - rise in rates could impact further out. But it will be hard to see much of an impact I would say on 2017.

It could be 9%, 8.9% to 9%, but somewhere in that ballpark.
Scott Valentin
Okay. Thanks. And then, just in terms of kind of the - yes, the relationship between the fleet size and sales and buyback, to the extent that you guys sell more aircrafts over the - roughly $1 billion I think was the guidance at the Investor Day. If you go above that, would we expect you that more in the buyback, I think you guys had guided to about $900 million or roughly $1 billion on return of capital, as gain on sales higher, do you expect to kind of reinvest that into repurchasing shares?
Peter Juhas
Yes, so at Investor Day I have said $900 million roughly of excess capital for the year, which as you've seen, we've been using that excess capital to buy back stock. But we always have valued at that time. I'd say that was based on a $1 billion of sales for the year. As Gus mentioned, we're likely to see more than $1 billion for the year at this point. So I think if conditions were to continue the way they are now, we would likely use that to buy back stock. So, yes, both the larger size of buybacks, as well as gains on sale contributes to excess capital that we can deploy.
Scott Valentin
Great. And just one final question, I think Gus, you said 95% number includes all releasing and new deliveries. How much is left to release in 2017 and 2018 in terms of - I don't know if it's percentage of the fleet? I don't know you want to scrap it, but just the idea of how much is left in 2017 and 2018 to release.
Aengus Kelly
If there's anything - there is not a huge amount left in terms of the percentage of the aircraft. There's virtually nothing left in 2017. There is left in a handful of new aircrafts and then a number of lower value narrowbodies as well, and one or two widebodies in 2018. But as a percentage of the overall revenue base of the business there, not a huge number.
Scott Valentin
Thanks very much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Arnold from RBC Capital Markets.
Jason Arnold
Hey, guys, one other quick follow-up for Gus, just curious if you could comment on the MAX 10 and your thoughts around that particular potential product.
Aengus Kelly
I mean, we will - we continue to look at the aircraft. And we think it's certainly an improvement on the MAX 9. But we will just continue to evaluate it.
Jason Arnold
Okay. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. That will conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Canniffe for any additional or closing remarks.
Brian Canniffe
Thank you, operator. Thank you everybody for listening in today. That's the end of the call. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. That will conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Aengus Kelly
Thank you, Brian. Good morning, everybody. And thank you for joining us for our 2016 fourth quarter and full-year earnings call. I’m delighted to report another quarter of strong earnings and profitability. We had a record fourth quarter with net after-tax income of 365 million and 1.047 billion for the full year net after-tax income. This equates to reported earnings per share of $2.01 for the quarter and $5.52 for the full year. You will have noticed that we are no longer reporting adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share numbers. Keith and Pete will provide more information on this. The strong performance of the AerCap platform which drove a fleet utilization rate of 99.5% for the full year, reflects the continuing resilience of air travel and its ability to withstand the numerous challenges faced by the industry in recent years. In 2016, the breadth and depth of our platform enabled us to capture increasing demand for aircraft by executing a record 458 transactions, which includes the signing of 279 lease agreements. This is almost two aircraft transactions every working day. During the fourth quarter alone, we completed 116 aircraft transactions, including 56 new lease agreements, 19 new aircraft purchases, and 41 aircraft sales.
Notable deliveries included the first Airbus A320neo to Spirit Airlines making the airline the first in the United States to receive this aircraft type. We also delivered the first Boeing 787 Dreamliner to Air France. We now have 78% of new aircraft deliveries to 2019 leased. This level of activity provides the business with a high level of visibility into future earnings. We continue to actively manage our portfolio during the fourth quarter, resulting in over $3 billion of sales for the full year, 44% of which were widebodies. Based on Ascend market data, we estimate this accounts for approximately 23% of all used aircraft traded globally in 2016. This volume of activity demonstrates not only the unequaled reach and scale of the AerCap platform but also the continued demand for aircraft in the secondary market. There has been discussion in the media regarding recent deferral activity by several airlines and what if any impact this has unless or is like AerCap. As I have said before, deferrals are nothing new and they are to be expected. The reason is that the OEMs know several things. Firstly, they know air traffic will grow and every 15 years it will approximately double. Secondly, they know they have a non-investment grade customer base in the airline. And three, they know they have a huge fixed cost phase in cash.

The only way to hedge these risks and meet future demand is to over commit an order. That is why we see that orders are extremely cyclical and always have been, but deliveries are very stable and have been also. Deliveries closely track the growth in air travel. It is to be expected that from time to time, certain regions or carriers become oversupplied and require deferrals. Clearly from our transaction activity, however in 2016, there continues to be solid demand for aircraft on a global basis and we don't see that changing. Like the OEM, but unlike the airline, AerCap is able to sell its product wherever in the world there is demand. We are not constrained by geography. So looking ahead to 2017, we expect to see stable levels of growth in the market and this will be supported by the 8th year in a row of aggregate airline profitability. Our airline client also remain well supported by favorable financing environment with the debt and capital markets looking to participate in the need to finance growth in the sector.
As far as aircraft own financing activities are concerned, we signed financing transactions for 1.7 billion during the fourth quarter and we maintain over $9.5 billion of available liquidity. Our debt to equity ratio remains at 2.7 to 1. You will also have seen last week our upgrade to investment grade by Moody's. We are now the only independent lessor in the world that is investment grade rated by all the three rating agencies. We view this as a further endorsement of the way we are managing the business. During 2016, we continued to demonstrate discipline when deploying shareholder capital, your money. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 5.7 million shares for 241 million. This brings the full-year total of share repurchases to 25 million shares for $966 million equating to 12% of the outstanding share count. The level of visibility we have into future earnings and the substantial excess capital we were able to generate provides us with the confidence to increase our share buyback program by $350 million through June 30. As you’ve heard me say before, we remain true to our mantra, we do not grow for growth sake and we adopt a flexible and nimble approach to generating the greatest long-term value for our shareholders.
With that I will hand the call over to Keith and Pete for a detailed review of our financial performance.
Keith Helming
Thank guys, good morning. I’ll on Slide 5 of the presentation. Our reported net income for the fourth quarter was $364.7 million and was $1.0466 billion for full-year 2016. Our return on equity for the full year was approximately 12.5% on a reported basis. Fourth quarter 2016 reported net income was up 38% over the fourth quarter of 2015, driven in part by higher gains on sales and other non-recurring items as well as lower AeroTurbine losses. The decrease in year-over-year net income was due to a few items including sales of older aircraft during 2015 and ’16, which reduced average lease assets by approximately $1.6 billion. The proceeds from these sales were used to repurchase shares. As you can see, we have just provided reported net income on this slide. Going forward, we have decided to eliminate adjusted net income and earnings per share and focus on our GAAP results only. Instead, we will provide the required information in order to understand our results by showing the key components of net income as we have done on this slide. We believe this will help simplify our financial disclosures and make it easier to understand our financial results. With this transitional period, we have provided the same reconciliation from reported net income and earnings per share, the adjusted numbers on Slides 15 and 16 of this presentation.
The components of net income that we have provided include those that have the most significant impact to the result. Gains on the sale of aircraft and other non-recurring items provided $115.4 million of net income in the fourth quarter of 2016. The non-recurring items in fourth quarter included income from lease terminations and a gain related to the repayment of a note receivable earlier than expected. We incurred a loss of $13.6 million in our AeroTurbine business during fourth quarter, which consisted primarily of operating expenses and further severance related costs. The downsizing of AeroTurbine remains on track with a schedule we discussed previously. The maintenance rights amortization impacted fourth quarter was a reduction to net income of $33.6 million and all other earnings in fourth quarter was $296.5 million. Turning to Slide 6, our earnings per share for the fourth quarter on a reported basis were $2.01; and for the full-year 2016, earnings per share were $5.52. Fourth quarter 2016 earnings per share were up 51% over the fourth quarter of 2015 driven by the same factors as those impacting net income and were also favorably impacted by our share repurchase. Full-year 2016 earnings per share were down slightly versus the full-year of 2015 and were also impacted by the same factors as those driving net income.

Although full year 2016 earnings per share were favorably impacted by our share repurchases. It does not yet reflect the full-year benefits we will receive going forward from this year as we repurchased during 2016. On this slide we have also provided the earnings per share impact to the same component as we did for net income. Slide 7, our book value per share at the end of fourth quarter was $49.33. Over the past year, we have grown book value per share by 17%. And since the end of 2014, book value per share has grown by 33%. This has been accomplished through a combination of earnings as well as share repurchases. Since the beginning of 2015 and through 2016 we have reduced our share count by 40.7 million shares or approximately 19% of our total shares outstanding. Including the shares purchased to-date in 2017 we have repurchased 20% of total shares outstanding. In doing so, we have returned over $1.8 billion to shareholders during this time period.
With that let me pass it over to Pete, who will take through the rest of financial results.
Pete Juhas
Thanks Keith. Good morning everyone. Starting on Slide 8, our total revenue for the fourth quarter was $1.3686 billion, an increase of 30.6 million from the fourth quarter of 2015. As Keith mentioned, our aircraft sales during 2015 and 2016 reduced our average lease assets by about $1.6 billion, this led to a reduction in basic lease rents from $1.1488 billion in the fourth quarter of 2015 to $1.0618 billion in 2016. Our maintenance revenues for the fourth quarter were $159.1 million, an increase of 22.4 million from the prior-year period, primarily due to lease terminations and amendments along with a higher amount of end of lease payments during the fourth quarter of 2016. Our net gain on sales was $58.7 million for the quarter compared to 43.4 million a year ago. The increase was primarily due to the higher volume of sales that closed in the fourth quarter of 2016 as we completed the sales of a number of larger portfolios that were signed earlier in the year. Our other income was $89 million for the quarter which included 73 million of nonrecurring income from a combination of lease terminations and a gain related to the repayment of our note receivable earlier than we had expected.
Turning to Slide 9, the reduction on average lease assets due to asset sales resulted in lower basic lease rents and a net interest margin of $790.5 million in the fourth quarter compared to $874.3 million in the prior-year period. Our annualized net spread for the fourth quarter was 9.3% compared to 9.8% in the fourth quarter of 2015. The two main drivers of this were an increase in our average cost of debt and a reduction in the average age of our fleet. Our average cost of debt increased from 3.7% in the fourth quarter of 2015 to 3.9% this past quarter primarily due to the issuance of new longer term bonds that replaced shorter term ILFC notes that had a lower interest expense as a result of purchase accounting. The average age of our fleet improved from 7.7 years to 7.4 years as a result of asset sales and the delivery of new aircraft which typically have lower yields in older aircraft.
On Slide 10, in the fourth quarter we sold 37 aircraft with an average age of 15 years. We also placed three 737NGs on long-term leases which lead us to reclassify them from operating to finance leases. For the full year we had a net gain of $138.5 million resulting in a sales margin of approximately 5% for the full year. On the purchase side, we took delivery of 19 new aircraft during the fourth quarter including 14 A320neos, three A350s and two Boeing 787s. Turning to Slide 11, our leasing expenses were $143.3 million for the froth quarter versus 126.3 million in 2015. The increase was primarily due to costs associated with the lease terminations during the fourth quarter of 2016. Our SG&A expenses were $96.8 million, down from $103.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The decrease in expenses was primarily due to the downsizing of AeroTurbine. We reported asset impairments of $11.4 million in the fourth quarter which related to the lease terminations of two aircraft. This was more than offset by the release of $13.4 million of maintenance reserves related to these aircraft. And finally we had transaction restructuring expenses of $8.3 million during the quarter which were primarily severance costs related the AeroTurbine downsizing.

Slide 12, we continued to maintain a very strong liquidity position ending the year with available liquidity of $9.5 billion. Together with our estimated operating cash flows that gives us 1.5 times coverage of our next 12 months cash needs or excess cash coverage of $4 billion. So far this year, we've already completed a number of significant financing transactions these include the amendment, extension and upsizing of our revolving credit facility from $3 billion to $3.75 billion. The amendment and extension of over 2 billion of term loan facilities and the $600 million bond offering we did in January that was heavily oversubscribed. So overall for AerCap this was another quarter of strong operating and financial performance for our business to finish a very strong 2016. We leased 279 aircraft during the year, an average of more than one every business day. We sold over $3 billion worth of assets significantly improving the quality of our portfolio. And we use the excess capital we generated to buy back 25 million shares or $966 million worth of stock. At the same time we continued to delever and improve our balance sheet during the course of the year and with the Moody's upgrade announced last week we're now the only independent aircraft leasing company to be rated investment grade by all three major rating agencies.
With that now I will turn it over for Q&A.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Helane Becker of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Conor Cunningham
Hey guys, it's actually Conor Cunningham in for Helane. So it seems like AerCap has been very active with the aircraft sales over the last seven years. Can you talk about like the expected trends in 2017, 2018, so would you expect the sales to slow as we get a new uptick - as you have an uptick in new technology entering the fleet? Thanks.
Aengus Kelly
Conor, as you know we expect to sell at least $1 billion of assets each year. In the last two years, we have significantly exceeded that. Now the key to selling assets is to sell assets that you want to sell. And we tend to target the mid-life assets of 10 to 16 years of age, average age is around 13 years as we want to try and drive the average age of the portfolio down a bit and focus the portfolio more on the newer technology assets. If we still observe a strong bid in the market, I think we'll continue to sell the levels in excess of the billion dollars, and for the assets we want to sell, so far the market this year seems to be reasonably strong and that could change of course, but at the moment I would say it's likely that we will probably exceed the billion dollars by how much though is uncertain.
Conor Cunningham
Great and just a follow up, there's been some airlines that talked about delays of the A320neo , have you incorporated that into your outlook or do you expect them to be a major change to any of your delivery schedules in the near term?
Aengus Kelly
It may lead to a slide of several months for sure on the Pratt & Whitney powered A320neo, I think it's likely that we will see three months but that has been incorporated into the guidance we've given, if there are any further delays we'll update on the next call.
Conor Cunningham
And then I just have one maintenance question, in terms of how you guys calculate your utilization rate, do you include assets held for sale. I assume you do if there's a lease attached to it in the near term.
Keith Helming
Yeah, we do include those in it.
Operator
We will take our next question from Gary Liebowitz of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Gary Liebowitz
Guys, back in November, you talked about the sort of medium term sale leaseback addressable market opportunity. Are you seeing prices in that market get anywhere close to attractive or share buybacks still far more additive?

Aengus Kelly
To-date, share buybacks have been more attractive, we bid every week, in fact we put out three bids yesterday but that's nothing unusual, Gary. We will put out several bids every week. We want to make sure you know where the market is. In November, we did say that we expected the addressable market to increase in size as more of the new technology begins to deliver. Now that is definitely happening that there is more activity. Pricing though I think still remains tilted in a wrong direction for us, we don't feel there's a fair reward for the risk. But we continue to bid at levels that we think do make sense but as we sit here today, the share buyback is a more attractive alternative that may well change though during the year as the addressable market gets bigger.
Gary Liebowitz
And for Keith or Peter, it looks you’ve accelerated some 2018 deliveries into ’17, at least relative to where we were back on September 30. What is the right CapEx number to be using for this year?
Keith Helming
So Gary, that's correct. We’ve moved some forward actually from 2018 based on notifications that we've gotten from Airbus. So just to recall, we had assumed basically a six-month delay in terms of 2017 approximately A320neos and we're still assuming that but when we’ve gotten a notification from Airbus we've moved those up to whatever the notification date was. In terms of CapEx, contracted CapEx for 2017 will be about just over $6 billion.
Gary Liebowitz
Just one last one since you're moving to GAAP instead of adjusted EPS, what should we be assuming for 2017, the MRA adjustment, is it about flat like you thought it might be going or how much should we be adjusting for that?
Keith Helming
The maintenance rights adjustment for 2017 should be around what we talked about $150 million that's what we've given out in the first quarter of last year and that's still probably the best estimate.
Gary Liebowitz
And then going down in 2018?
Pete Juhas
In 2018, I think $30 million number that we gave is still about right.
Operator
We will take our take question from Moshe Orenbuch of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Moshe Orenbuch
I mean most of my questions actually have been asked and answered already, but could you maybe just talk a little bit about the decision to go to eliminate the other forms of reporting and go just to GAAP?
Aengus Kelly
So as Pete just pointed out, 2017 should actually really be the last year where the maintenance rights impact is significant and the other items including AeroTurbine in 2017 is not expected to be significant. So we think that going forward providing just one net income number, the GAAP number, and providing this component analysis would be a better way to kind of explain what's going on with the business result. That way we don't have to sit here and always debate as to what goes into or is excluded from adjusted net income or a non-GAAP measure. So we're going to focus on GAAP results and we'll provide whatever analytical information we need to explain the results.
Moshe Orenbuch
And I guess you know given that you've got the expectation of 6 billion of CapEx and then the 350 million of the buyback over the first half. How does that do you think will that impact the debt to equity ratio. I mean you're kind of a few ticks below your target. How would that likely evolve over that period?
Pete Juhas
So right now we're at 2.7 to 1 that's where we ended the year, we'll continue to stay within the 2.7 to 3 to 1 range during the course of the year and we'll always want to maintain within that level. So I think you should just expect us to be well within that range for the year.
Operator
We will take our met question from Rajeev Lalwani of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, your line is open.

Rajeev Lalwani
Can you walk us through the implications of rising interest rates to borrowing costs and then also how you think that's going to impact yields as we look forward and then a follow up.
Aengus Kelly
The first thing is that we run a hedged book, so we are not exposed to rising rates on the book of business that's written and the vast - and any least that's placed on forward order has an automatic adjustment for any increase in interest rates. Now as we go forward, rises in rates have historically being accompanied by rises in lease rates. On the used aircraft there's generally a lag period, it could be six months give or take. But it only applies to those aircraft that are re-pricing at that point in time as rates are rising. And having said that also a rising rate environment generally correlate to a better global growth environment and what we've always observed in the past, the rising rate environment generally leads to asset insulation. So as long as you’re hedged, right and you’re operating in a decent global economy, rising rates should not be a threat to the business. And as I said this company does run a hedged book. Pete anything you would add?
Pete Juhas
No I think that’s it.
Rajeev Lalwani
What about the debt side as far as borrowing costs?
Aengus Kelly
My point is that if - so obviously if swap rate - the yield curve goes up by 50 points across the curve and your underlying cost of funding has risen by 50 basis points, the lease rate should move with that and certainly our new aircraft they move immediately day by day on the new aircraft with the movement in the swap rates.
Rajeev Lalwani
I got your point now, another question, you previously talked about asset values being marked below market, it is hard to spend on your books. Can you talk about how that takes into account just SG&A and lease expense levels and just thoughts going forward as far as overall SG&A levels and what we should be modeling.
Aengus Kelly
So on the SG&A front, I would expect quarterly average should be around 75 million a quarter that's probably the best run rate to be using for that. After the first half of 2017 we don't expect to have really any [indiscernible] AeroTurbine, so that would be really just core leasing business.
Rajeev Lalwani
When you talk about your asset values, does not take into account SG&A levels or is that just a separate line item?
Aengus Kelly
No, it does not - no it does not take into consideration SG&A, it’s just looking at the aircraft value itself, all components of the aircraft value.
Operator
We will take our next question from Jamie Baker of JP Morgan. Please go ahead, your line is open.
Nish Mani
Hey, good afternoon guys, this is actually Nish Mani on for Jamie Baker. I want to ask you a quick question about how you guys are thinking about potential tax reform in the United States and how that would impact US airline decisions to lease versus own, I mean obviously there are other economic and private considerations there, but have you started to engage your US customers on this topic?
Aengus Kelly
So Nish, at this point it’s a little early to predict how US tax reform will play out. From our standpoint, we're obviously not a US company and we have very few assets in the US so there would be very little direct impact we think. In terms of the impact on our customers and on the OEMs, it's very preliminary at this stage and it's hard to predict how any of the provisions including the border adjustment mechanism could actually -- whether it will actually happen and if so how exactly would that play out. Obviously, we're monitoring developments in this area, but I think it's a little early to tell at this point.
Nish Mani
Yeah. Okay. That's helpful. And a quick question on 787 pricing, just want to see if you guys could provide any color on 787 pricing, specifically by model today relative to maybe a year ago or so and see if any of the market has changed at all?

Aengus Kelly
Well, we have moved, I mean in total, between what we've taken and what we've bought on sale leaseback and still on order. We had over 90 787s, we were over 10% of the market. We’ve sold some of those assets. The 787-9, we think is a tremendous airplane. We see good demand for that. We have only three units left out of our entire position and they're coming in 2019-ish. And we can put them away if we want to. I think, you'll see that the 787 has been fairly durable over the last year. We haven't seen any material move one way or the other in the last 12 months in the lease rates. Obviously, interest rates impacted as interest rates fell significantly last year. The absolute rate went down with that. But overall, it's still a very good airplane and it's the heart of the family. We don't have any 787-10s and on the 787-8, a few years ago, we converted all of our open positions into -9. So I think that gives you a good indication of where we think the heart of the market is and where there's a fair risk and reward for the owners.
Operator
We will take our next question from Jason Arnold of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jason Arnold, please go ahead. Your line is open.
Brian Canniffe
Operator, we’ll take the next question.
Operator
We will take our next question from Justine Fischerof Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Justine Fischer
Good morning. Okay. The first question I have is just on the message for financing your CapEx this year and on the balance sheet. I know that you guys have the secured debt to unsecured debt ratio of 45, 55 right now. And you guys have said that you want to maintain it around that level in order to maintain access to various parts of capital, but with an investment grade rating, I would think that that access should remain more open overtime to various positive capital, even if you didn't use one of them for a couple of years, let's say, if the unsecured market was very good. And also it probably creates more consistent access to the unsecured market. So does the rating change now that [indiscernible] all three agencies change the way you're viewing your secured to unsecured debt ratio?
Keith Helming
Justine, thanks for the question. No. It doesn't really change it in our minds. I mean, as you said, we want to make sure that we maintain access to all types of funding. So we cap our secured debt to total assets ratio at 30%. We’re just below that at this point and that will move around. Right. It will move around somewhat below that 30% from time to time. But we think that being at that level gives us, we have good access to the unsecured markets as we've seen, right. We have good access to the secured markets as well. We're bringing in new lenders and we think that that's an appropriate place to be.
Justine Fischer
Okay. Yeah. So the 45 was the percent of your total debt outstanding. So your target is 30% debt to assets. I was talking about a different number. And then the other question is just on the widebody deferrals for Gus. I know that there are definitely deferrals all the time and we saw that with some Latin American Airlines, the lessor has played a huge role in helping to figure out some of the delivery problems there despite the difficulties in demand that we saw, but I think that what's concerning investors is that with Gulf carriers now, they represent a huge percentage of the widebody backlog. And I think in people's recent memories, we can think of a region that represents such a huge percent of the backlog that is going to see deferrals. So can you tell us your view on how to lay investor concerns, given the size of the Gulf carriers in the order book?
Aengus Kelly
Justine, I would say that we have certainly seen a region having a much bigger share of the backlog having gone through significant stress for a long period of time, which would be the North American market. As you know, most North American airlines have filed multiple times with massive backlogs and massive amounts of airplanes in the system, far greater than what’s in the Gulf. I would go back to what I have said in my prepared comments, the OEMs know that there will be growth in air travel. The OEMs know they've a non-investment grade customer base and they've a massive fixed cost base they have to cover. 

In that regard, I think the OEMs knew when they were taking those orders from several airlines with the same business model that it was likely not all of those aircraft would be delivered in a timeframe order. But they didn't know which one would make it or which one will take more of them in the nearer term. So they needed to take them from all of them, it’s similar to what happened in India, where they overcommitted to everyone and Kingfisher was the one that everyone thought would make it at the start, but didn't. So it's just -- it's nothing really new in the scheme of things and I think we will see the Middle Eastern carriers have revolutionized air travel. 
They've been tremendous for the consumer, absolutely tremendous. You can now fly for less in absolute dollar amounts almost anywhere in the world than you could do 20 years ago. That's inflation -- and that's without adjusting for inflation. So these carriers have been a massive boon for the consumers and I do think that as we go forward, they'll work their way through their issues, but this is nothing that we haven't seen before and the OEMs are not going to put the national carriers of these countries into bankruptcy. That will not happen. They will work with them. They will defer what needs to be done. As always for any airline in the world, it is an expensive discussion to go [indiscernible] and that's how the OEMs make a lot of money, Justine, is by deferrals. They know the day the airlines signs the order, there is a high likelihood that they'll have to come back and look for help. And when they do that, the price goes up significantly. And so it's part of the OEM business model and their profit margin to expect deferrals.

We will take our next question from Michael Linenberg of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Michael Linenberg
Yeah. Hey. Good morning. Good afternoon, everybody. Peter, I think, you had mentioned the sales margin was about 5% for the full year on the assets sold. What was it for the fourth quarter? Did you say that?
Pete Juhas
I didn't say that. It was actually higher for the fourth quarter, it was around 9% for the fourth quarter. And that's really -- that moves around -- it moves around depending on what happens to close during that quarter. As I mentioned before, we had a number of big portfolios that comprised a big percentage of the sales during last year. And so, some of those closed in the second quarter, some in the third, some in the fourth. And so I think it's probably best to look at the full year margin. I think that's more reflective of what we would expect going forward as well.
Michael Linenberg
Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then just my second question, Keith, you had presented this, focusing on this GAAP number. And I get that although there is that element of non-recurring and that is something that is notoriously difficult to forecast. I'm not sure in subsequent quarters, are you going to put out a like an 8-K in advance about what those potential non-recurring numbers are, so that we have a forecast that can sync up with what you’re thinking about on a GAAP basis and then just a follow on what was that non-recurring in that 115 million, just so I have the right numbers here. What was the non-recurring number in the fourth quarter? If you could provide that. Thank you.
Keith Helming
Yeah. Well, the gain on sale, you can see that in the slide, it was about 40% of that total number. The non-recurring items would fall into the other income category and it consisted of primarily lease terminations, so effectively payments we received as a result of lease terminations as well as effectively income on notes receivable that was paid off early. So these are two, as we referred to, non-recurring items and we don't expect to see those significantly in future periods. Now in terms of going forward, I mean whenever we have this thing, we will break out those items and make sure that people understand what's in the numbers, what's recurring, what isn’t recurring? And to the extent obviously that we know in advance what the numbers will be in the forecast, we would provide that as well so even though we're going to a different way of reporting here, the information we will be as transparent with it as we always have been.

Operator
We will take our next question from Andrew Light of Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Andrew Light
Yeah. Hi, there. Got a question on European airlines. You've got fairly significant exposure to the three airlines in Europe. I mean, somewhat distressed situation. Do you expect in general in Europe to see more defaults and/or restructured initiatives to there?
Aengus Kelly
Andrew, Europe is doing fine for us and has done so for the last couple of years actually. We've moved a lot of aircraft in Europe. There's always, Europe is a highly fragmented market. And so that leads itself naturally to some weaker players. But will we have some restructuring defaults, possibly, but I don't see anything out of the ordinary. I think the area where there is obviously concern at the moment is more around Turkey than anywhere else, given the events there during last summer and the decline in traffic in Turkey due to the tragic events recently. But having said that then, we have seen a turn in Russia. Two years ago, Russia was in a really tough spot and we were taking lots of airplanes out of Russia, far greater than anything that's going on in Europe at the moment and those did not have a material impact on the result of this company during that period of time. 
And now with the stronger ruble and people just have -- once people travel, they want to travel again. That's why it's so resilient and people have adjusted their budgets. And we still -- we see tremendous demand from the Russian traveler, again to go abroad. They experienced it for the first time over the last decade and people adjust their budgets so that this is one of the last things that gets caught in a household and we're stressing the resilience of that in the Russian market. But I would say at the moment on a global basis, Turkey is somewhere where there are definite stresses there for sure in parts of Mediterranean Africa. But these are not anything beyond the norm that we experience every year. There's unfortunately some part of the world that always has an issue.
Andrew Light
Thanks. And can I ask a follow-up on your forward order book, you’ve got a fairly healthy pipeline of deliveries through to 20211 and then it drops down quite considerably. At what point will you need to think about an order placement through say 2022 onwards.
Aengus Kelly
Only when we feel that there is a fair risk and reward from the manufacturers, we certainly are not here to fill their backlogs. We're here to make money for our shareholders. And if there is an attractive transaction with the manufacturers, then that's fine. If not, I’ve no problem not buying a single airplane from them ever again. But, it has to be something that makes money for our shareholders and if there are deals are there tomorrow that make that happen, great. And if they never come, I don't care.
Operator
We will take our next question from Arren Cyganovich of D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Arren Cyganovich
Thanks. Gus, how is the strong dollar impacting your customer base? Is there any discussion about changes in US trade policy, et cetera that would make you a little worried about stressing some of your customer base, strengthening dollar?
Aengus Kelly
I think it's too early to tell if there will be protectionism around the world. All I can say is that the benefits of liberalization of air travel have been extraordinary boosts for the consumer globally. As I just mentioned, it is cheaper now to fly anywhere in the world in absolute dollar terms than it was 20 years ago, even without adjusting for inflation. That's a tremendous boon for the customer and that's the result of liberalization. Protectionism will, I can assure you the customer will pay an awful lot more for air travel once there is protectionism. That's what created Southwest, created Ryanair, created Emirates, all of these airlines have changed the face of air travel or Air Asia in Asia. So I think that if that were to happen, it would really hurt the average guy in the street. 

Now, the strong dollar itself that has happened, certainly in some jurisdictions in, particularly in Mexico of course, we have seen the impact there. The airlines are so far coping with it. It may well -- if there's two sides to it, of course, look if an airline is weak, this may push it over the edge. We don't see anything unusual there in that level of activity beyond the norm with airline stress. However, it does of course mean that airlines in those jurisdictions are so much less likely to buy the assets themselves, as the large dollar expenditure may not be as financeable as it was and therefore, the leaseback may be a more attractive alternative.
Arren Cyganovich
Thanks. And then looking at your maintenance rents for the quarter, they were elevated. Were there any defaults or lease terminations that were unexpected that generated this quarter?
Keith Helming
Yeah. We had a higher level of lease terminations that we essentially due to negotiated terminations with the airlines and so that led to what happens in those cases is we tend to sweep the maintenance reserves, because the maintenance didn't perform in the air craft. So the aircrafts returned to us and we recognized those revenues. So that's why you saw both the higher level of maintenance revenues in the quarter and also a higher level of leasing expenses.
Arren Cyganovich
Got it. And then just lastly for modeling purposes, what's the dollar amount of CapEx looking like on a quarterly basis for the next two quarters?
Keith Helming
Well, it moves around quarter-to-quarter, but as I said for the full year, that will be about 6 billion for 2017.
Pete Juhas
Of which probably about 40% is in the first half.
Operator
We will take our next question from Scott Valentin of Compass Point. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Scott Valentin
Thanks for taking my question. Just with regard to the Moody's upgrade. Does that impact your outlook at all for your cost of funds outlook? I know you've given guidance in November for a net spread. I’m just wondering if the upgrade has any positive impact or no impact at all.
Keith Helming
Well, we have factored in a little improvement relative to where we were, back in November when we gave the forecast. So we expected to see some improvements there. I'd say we have seen spreads come in a little, obviously since we did our deal, our bond deal and since we had the Moody's upgrade, in the other hand, we've also seen some higher interest rates -- higher rates in the meantime. So those probably offset each other in terms of where we are. So in terms of our forecast overall, we're pretty much still within the range that we gave you in November. 
Scott Valentin
Okay. Thanks. And then just a follow-up on that point. The decision to move away from the adjusted earnings, just GAAP earnings. How should we think about the previous guidance? I think it was 560 to 580 was a core number before the gain on sale of any aircraft. Just wondering is that a number to use going forward for and add an assumption on gain on sale to get the GAAP number. Is that the way we should think about it?
Keith Helming
Yeah. I would still use that number. So I'd say we're still within the range that we gave you then. If you think about the adjustment items that we had included, those were really two. One was the maintenance rates, amortization impact that we talked about earlier of $150 million. So I'd factor that and the other was AeroTurbine losses of around 25 million. So if you add those back, those would -- or adjust for those, that would give you the core on a reported basis. And then yeah, I would add gains to that whatever your expectation is on gain.
Operator
We will take our next question from Christopher Nolan of FBR and Company. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Christopher Nolan
Hey, thanks. Gus, for your earlier comments, in terms of people travelling one to one ago again, put the exception of anyone have gone a long trip in the back of an MD 80, I think they'll put you off travelling for a little while? Another point, the CapEx for 6 billion, the slide deck on page 12 shows 5 billion for 2017. What’s the difference there?
Keith Helming
5 billion of cash is what we expect in terms of contracted CapEx, it’s a little over 6 billion. You've got the PDPs to be added on.
Christopher Nolan
Got you. And then also the $350 million share repurchase program, is this just a upscale of the 250 that was previously announced to go through 331 or was this a separate announcement?
Keith Helming
This is a new program in addition to that one.
Christopher Nolan
Okay. So we’ve got 250 through 331 and 350 on top of that?
Keith Helming
That's correct.
Christopher Nolan
Finally on the lease sale margins, which are up, are you seeing the value or are these aircraft being sold with leases I presume and that is driving prices now than just the metal?
Pete Juhas
All aircraft that we sell are with leases attached.
Christopher Nolan
And so what's driving up the margins? I think you addressed this earlier, but it wasn’t quite clear?
Keith Helming
Yeah. So we had a higher margin in the fourth quarter, but again, I think it's really due to, we just had some aircraft. Most of these were part of big sales, big portfolio sales and so we had lower margins in the third quarter, higher in the fourth quarter. They tend to even out and so that's why I say I think if you look at -- the reason why we gave or we provided the margin for the full year is I think that's more representative of what you would see rather than any particular quarter.
Christopher Nolan
Okay. Final question on the order book again and I know you answered this a little bit earlier. It seems like the order book is running down by 25% or running off by 17 by value. Is the strategy here, does it start capitalizing on contention deferrals or airlines that might have over ordered, because it looks like the early order slots for the A320Neo and MAX are pretty much taken up?
Keith Helming
Yeah. It's about 20% give or take. I suppose, the total CapEx will go through it in 2017. But that's plan D. Look as I said earlier, if there is a deal there to be done with the OEMs at the track, then that's fine. If there isn't, I couldn't care less. There will be plenty of opportunity for the company. We've always demonstrated that in the past. So I'm not particularly bothered about the OEMs.
Operator
We will take our next question from Jason Arnold of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Jason Arnold
Hi, guys. Sorry for the telecom issue there. Just curious any aircraft types in particular that you're seeing stronger appeal for perhaps lack of interest from your airline customers at present?
Aengus Kelly
I think on the new technology stuff, the A320neo is certainly extremely liquid assets and is proving itself to be a very liquid airplane. We're moving in fact this week just earlier on Sunday of this week, we agreed to do it for another five airplanes in 2021. That's I suppose the most liquid asset out there. Then you have 737 MAX 8 is doing well and we don't have any MAX 9s. We don't have any MAX 7s. We think the MAX 8 is a very good airplane. On the 787s, you heard my commentary earlier, we think that the -9 is a liquid machine. And on the A350 side, we think the 900 is a liquid machine and that's evidence by our own actions in that. All of our 350s are 900s and on the 787 side, everything we could, we put in to -9 and have no -10s.
Jason Arnold
Okay. Super thanks. And then I guess the other one I was curious on is any updated thoughts on Iran as an opportunity set or is complications from geopolitical factor there problematic?

Aengus Kelly
Once we have more clarity on Iran, it is a market that we will carefully look at, but under no circumstances will we violate any sanctions and the issue is that while you could say sanctions are lifted, it's day one risk has been eliminated or we release. However, we are entering into a transaction for a multi-year period. And when we put an airplane in, there are other parties as part of that transaction, there's the financiers and there's the insurers and ourselves, the owners are you guys, the owners. And what we have to look at is what has happened in the event if there were to be a snap back of sanctions, how would that impact your insurance policy or your financing structure and you need to have clarity over that. So it's multiple parties have to get comfortable with that potential and that process is ongoing and once there's clarity around that, we'll know what action to take.
Operator
We will take our next question from Kristine Liwag of Bank of American Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Kristine Liwag
Hi. Good morning, everyone. Can you quantify if any late payments from your airline customers today and how they compared to last year and are there particular regions of the world where that may be in your watch list this year that you didn't have last year?
Aengus Kelly
Well, Kristine, there has been no great movement in receivables and you can see that when we file the quarterly reports one way or the other. The jurisdictions have moved each year. Unfortunately, some part of the world is always in trouble. It's a big world and things happen. So at the moment, Turkey, as I mentioned earlier on, is under pressure. We are starting to see a turn in Brazil. It's a slow turn, but it's coming we feel and we are also seeing a real turn in Russia. And it generally takes these markets a couple of years to turn. But on a global basis, there's no absolute change and in terms of regions, shifted more as I said to Turkey in some parts of the Mediterranean Africa.
Kristine Liwag
And earlier you mentioned how protectionism is a key risk to global airline industry. So when you discuss this with your airline customers, to what degree are they thinking about the risk of possible renegotiations of US Open Skies Agreement and how much flexibility are they building into their fleet planning?
Aengus Kelly
Well, I think, look, no one is willing to change their fleet plan at the moment. It’s too uncertain. Every action has a reaction though I think many of them would hope in their heart of hearts for the status quo, even though some may be tempted by an oligopoly. I think in their heart of hearts, they would be afraid of what would happen if there was to be a return to protectionism across the world. It certainly wouldn't do any favors for the traveling public, that's for sure.
Kristine Liwag
Great. And maybe one last question for me, with the $1 billion placeholder for aircraft sales this year, can you discuss the expected profile of this fleet compared to your existing fleet. And also is that 5% gain on sales still a reasonable expectation in 2017?
Aengus Kelly
Well, the gain on sale is driven by the type of airplanes we sell. I would just look back, Kristine, over the last decade and you can see a consistent gain on sale in the business. In terms of the type of assets we’ll sell, I would expect it to be more of the same of what we sold last year with the focus on the midlife asset between 10 and 16, 17 years of age.
Operator
We will take our final question from Gary Liebowitz of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Gary Liebowitz
Yes. Thanks, operator. Pete, not to beat the dead horse here, but going back to the guidance of 560 to 580 for this year that was on a core EPS basis, are you saying we should reduce that by about $1 of share or the items that are included in GAAP, you had excluded that on top of that and our estimate of trading gains?

Pete Juhas
Yeah. Gary, what I’m saying is, if you were to, we gave that out on kind of an adjusted basis obviously, right. So if you were to convert that to reported, really there are two main items in that. One is the maintenance rates amortization impact, which is $150 million. So depending on your assumption about share count, right, that’s -- you would factor that in. And then the other one is the AeroTurbine results which we gave was 25 million. So if you’re going from adjusted to reported, you would deduct both of those I think. And then obviously you have to think about what you would expect in terms of gains on sale. I think those are the three items.
Gary Liebowitz
Okay. And then just one, Gus, you stopped disclosing the average duration of new leases and re-leases, what kind of trends are you seeing there, especially with respect to widebody aircraft?
Aengus Kelly
Nothing different, Gary. To be fair, we're still seeing the new stuff. As I said, we just signed a handful of them on Sunday for 12 years and the used stuff bounces around four, five year category, nothing different there.
Gary Liebowitz
Were those widebody placements for 12 years?
Aengus Kelly
They were narrow body.
Aengus Kelly
Well, thank you all very much for joining us on the call and we look forward to seeing a number of you tomorrow in New York and on Thursday and speaking again in May. Thank you very much. Thank you, operator.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/25/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

                                                    Business Wire – 
                                                    4:31 PM ET 07/17/2017
                                                


AerCap Holdings N.V. (AER) announced today that AerCap Ireland Capital Designated Activity Company and AerCap Global Aviation Trust, each a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, priced their offering of senior notes, consisting of $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 3.65% Senior Notes due 2027.

















                                                    BULLET: US TSY FLOWS: Treasuries drifted off session high....
                                                


                                                    Market News Intl Fixed Income Bullets – 
                                                    9:50 AM ET 07/17/2017
                                                


US TSY FLOWS: Treasuries drifted off session high prices after early front end bid, amid selling in intermediates, including in Tsy futures, said traders. The 30Y bond also got pushed down lower too amid selling; hit 102-02+/32 high price (2.897% session low yield) at 8:22am ET. Mild foreign bid also reported in Tsys. Earlier, Tsys had followed UK Gilts and German Bunds upward. The 3/10/30Y auctions all settle today, ushering in new supply into the overnight repo market. - Meanwhile it's likely corporate rate locks also provided some early Tsys pressure amid a long list of corporate bonds coming to market today, including Wells Fargo (WFC) 5Y, Citi 3-parter, American Honda 18M FRN and 3Y FXD/FRN, AerCap Ireland 10Y, Kroger (KR) 5/10/30Y, JPM 21Y, 31Y; and Sweden 4Y eyed for Tuesday. "Much of those deals would have been bank deals," said one trader. "So, they should have been swapped. That should support the market when the hedges get unwound."

Aengus Kelly-led AerCap lines up $1bn bond sale
 Irish chief executive holds more than $100m stake in aircraft leasing company

Aircraft leasing giant AerCap, which moved its base from Amsterdam to Dublin this year under its Irish chief executive Aengus Kelly, was poised to sell $1 billion of bonds.
AerCap, which has 1,670 owned, managed or on-order aircraft in its portfolio and almost $44 billion (€39 billion) of assets, said it planned to use the proceeds from the bond sale to buy or refinance aircraft assets and repay some of its existing high-cost debt. 
The company rose from the ruins of the late Irish aviation tycoon Tony Ryan’s GPA to become one of the world’s largest aircraft-leasing companies, following its $7 billion takeover in 2014 of US rival ILFC. 
Mr Kelly made headlines in January when he complained about Ireland’s “massively unattractive” personal tax rates, which, he said, is hindering the movement of overseas corporate executives to the State.
The group’s chief executive of five years, who started his career with GPA in 1998, owns more than $100 million worth of shares and restricted stock in AerCap, equivalent to 1.4 per cent of the group, according to its 2015 annual report.
Net profit Last week, New York-listed the aircraft lessor reported first-quarter adjusted net profit of $301.6 million, which was virtually unchanged from the same period in 2015.  
The company spent more than $300 million buying back its own shares in the market between January and May 9th. It had $29.8 billion of debt on its balance sheet at the end of March.
Standard & Poor’s said yesterday it was assigning a “BBB-” rating on the unsecured bonds AerCap is selling. This is the lowest level of what S&P considers to be investment grade. S&P has a “stable” outlook on AerCap in the expectation AerCap will increase its earnings and cash flow this year, offsetting the company’s assumption of more debt to fund new aircraft deliveries. 



“We could lower our ratings on AerCap if we believe that the company will undertake a larger-than-expected level of share repurchases,” said S&P.
