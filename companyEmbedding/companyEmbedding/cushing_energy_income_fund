Cushing® Energy Income Fund Announces Monthly Distribution









PR Newswire




Jul 3, 2017 9:32 AM EDT













 




























































  DALLAS, July 3, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- The Cushing ® Energy Income Fund (formerly known as the Cushing ® Royalty & Income Fund) (NYSE: SRF) declared a distribution for July 2017 of $0.04 per common share. The Fund's distribution will be payable on July 31, 2017 to shareholders of record on July 18, 2017.  The ex-date for the Fund's distribution is July 14, 2017. It is anticipated but not certain that approximately 82% of the Fund's distribution will be treated as a return of capital. The final determination of such amounts will be made and reported to shareholders in early 2018, after the end of the calendar year when the Fund determines its earnings and profits for the year. The final tax status of the distributions may differ substantially from this preliminary information. The Fund is a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company with an investment objective of seeking a high total return with an emphasis on current income.  The Fund seeks to provide shareholders with a tax-efficient vehicle to invest in a portfolio of public and private securities of energy companies involved in exploring, developing, producing, transporting, gathering and processing, storing, refining, distributing, mining or marketing natural gas, natural gas liquids (including propane), crude oil, refined products or coal.  The Fund will invest no more than 25% of its total assets in securities of energy master limited partnerships ("MLPs") that qualify as publicly traded partnerships under the Internal Revenue Code.  The Fund is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "SRF." The Fund is managed by Cushing ® Asset Management, LP (" Cushing"). No assurance can be given that the Fund's investment objective will be achieved. ABOUT CUSHING ® ASSET MANAGEMENT, LP  Cushing, a subsidiary of Swank Capital, is an SEC-registered investment adviser headquartered in Dallas, Texas. Cushing serves as investment adviser to affiliated funds and managed accounts which invest primarily in securities of MLPs and other natural resource companies.  As of June 30, 2017, Cushing had approximately $3.5 billion of assets under management in closed-end funds, mutual funds, privately offered funds and separately managed accounts.   Contact: Judson Redmond Cushing ® Asset Management, LP214-692-6334 www.cushingasset.com IMPORTANT INFORMATION

This Stock Has A 11.78% Yield, Sells For Less Than Book, and Insiders Have Been Buying
In this series, we look through the most recent Dividend Channel ''DividendRank'' report, and then we cherry pick only those companies that have experienced insider buying within the past six months. The officers and directors of a company tend to have a unique insider's view of the business, and presumably the only reason an insider would choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money — maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both.
