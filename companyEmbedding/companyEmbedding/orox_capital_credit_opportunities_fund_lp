Strategy
Orox Capital was formed to capitalize on a unique opportunity within the middle-market. We fill a void for our investors by targeting a niche area of the marketplace that cannot be efficiently capitalized upon by much larger special situations funds

We arepartners
Sourcing
Complex Distressed Situations
Advantageous Risk/Return Profile

We focus on businesses that will benefit from a helping hand. Throughout our investment process, we partner with management, lead by example and provide liquidity necessary to realize the company’s true potential

The firm’s professionals have substantial experience investing across the capital structure in unique situations, ranging from traditional bankruptcies to complex pre-packaged and pre-arranged restructurings

We target under the radar opportunities, with an emphasis on deep value and long term returns. Ms. Hayes has spent 17+ years navigating the inner-workings of the credit market and has access to a massive network of differentiated investment ideas

We invest in the fulcrum security; that instrument that looks and feels like debt today, but is priced like equity. This type of special situations investing combines inherent downside protection with the upside potential of a well-executed buyout structure
