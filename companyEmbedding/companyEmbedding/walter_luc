Buying a bigger server or refactoring the backend code is no longer the answer for many sites. Over 83% of the load time for Internet users occurs after the backend has generated the demanded content. Download and render times are turning to a dominant congestion.The importance of the frontend congestion has given surge to a new category branded Web Performance Optimization or WPO which is a set of best practices for improving load times and the overall efficiency of the frontend. Despite the large potential performance gains and cost savings, many sites have not adopted WPO techniques. This is mostly due to the upfront and ongoing financial restrictions needed to manually realize WPO on a web site.We make web performance optimization easy. We use cloud-based solutions, virtual appliances and we apply the vast array of WPO best practices: YSlow recommendations by Yahoo! and PageSpeed recommendations by Google.VP of Basketball Performance - Hobby/VolunteeringAguibasket / guineebasket.comJanuary 2013  –  April 2014 (1 year 4 months)Promoting Education through Basketball and sports.
