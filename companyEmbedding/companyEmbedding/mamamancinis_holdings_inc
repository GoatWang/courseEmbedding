Homemade Semolina Pasta
 I love Semolina pasta and the dough is so easy to make. If you don’t have a pasta machine you can roll out the dough and with a knife, cut it into pasta ribbons. As far as what sauce to use, a simple tomato sauce, butter and sage or legit alfredo (no cream 😳) are […]

MamaMancini’s Original Family Recipe

Home style, old world Italian food created from recipes my Grandmother brought with her to America. Never written down, existing only in her heart. At the age of 15 my Grandmother Anna Mancini, taught me all of them. Now stored in my heart. I am so proud to bring Anna’s amazing recipes to your table. My dream come true. From Anna’s heart to my heart to your table.
“Every Sunday I would wake to the amazing aroma of my Grandmother’s frying meatballs. I call this a ‘Scented Memory.’”
I chose my Grandmothers Meatballs and Slow Cooked Italian Sauce as the first recipe we would bring to your table. We prepare this dish the exact way she did so many years ago. The meatballs are made from 100% beef, whole fresh eggs, Romano cheese, onion, parsley, a pinch of salt and pepper and the exact amount of bread crumbs. They are formed by hand just like Anna did and lightly browned. We place them in the Slow Cooked Italian Sauce which is pure Italian plum tomatoes, olive oil, garlic, some salt and pepper and a bay leaf and slowly cook them for three hours. This is the only way to prepare authentic old world meatballs and sauce. Gently stirring every 20 minutes guarantees perfect meatballs every time. There are no shortcuts.
I am very proud to be able to make this amazing family dinner available to everyone. They are sold fully cooked with sauce and all you need to do is heat them up. What was a 4 hour process, takes you just 20 min! MamaMancini’s Meatballs and Slow Cooked Italian Sauce are available in Markets across the country as well as many gourmet catalogs.
Fully cooked with Slow Cooked Italian Sauce, just heat and serve. Add your favorite pasta for the perfect “Family Dinner” in minutes.
