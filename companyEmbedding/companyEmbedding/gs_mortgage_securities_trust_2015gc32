      --$54,451,000 class A-1 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$50,885,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;

      B, and C certificates.
    

      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of July 10, 2015. Fitch does not expect to rate the $17,555,000 class G 
      and the $28,840,074 class H certificates.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 63 loans secured by 222 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $1.003 
      billion as of the cutoff date. The loans were contributed to the trust 
      by Goldman Sachs Mortgage Company, Citigroup Global Markets Realty 
      Corp., Cantor Commercial Real Estate Lending L.P., Starwood Mortgage 
      Funding I LLC, MC-Five Mile Commercial Mortgage Finance LLC.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 72.9% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis of 81.8%, and asset summary reviews on 81.8% of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Fitch Leverage: The transaction has higher leverage than other recent 
      Fitch-rated fixed-rate multiborrower transactions. The pool's Fitch DSCR 
      of 1.14x is lower than both the YTD 2015 average of 1.18x and the 2014 
      average of 1.19x, and the pool's Fitch LTV of 113.1% is higher than both 
      the YTD 2015 average of 110.4% and the 2014 average of 106.2%.
    

      Leverage in Line with 2014 and 2015 Averages: The Fitch DSCR and LTV are 
      1.19x and 106.7%, respectively. The leverage metrics for this 
      transaction are in line with other recent Fitch-rated, fixed-rate 
      multiborrower transactions. The 2014 and 2015 YTD averages have a DSCR 
      and LTV of 1.19x and 106.2% and 1.20x and 110.1%, respectively.
    

      Investment-Grade Credit Opinion Loans: The ninth largest loan, US 
      StorageMart Portfolio, and the 11th largest loan, Alderwood Mall, both 
      have 'AAA' credit opinions within the context of the pool. Together, the 
      two loans represent 4.9% of the pool.
    

      Above-Average Pool Concentration: The top 10 loans comprise 51.6% of the 
      pool, which is slightly worse than recent averages of 50.5% and 46.5% 
      for 2014 and YTD 2015, respectively. Additionally, both the loan 
      concentration index (LCI) and sponsor concentration index (SCI) are 386, 
      both of which are greater than recent respective averages of 328 and 378 
      for YTD 2015.
    

      High Property Type and Hotel Concentrations: Retail properties comprise 
      39.6% of the pool, which is a larger concentration than average. Hotels 
      are the next largest property type at 15.9% of the pool. Hotels have the 
      highest probability of default in Fitch's multiborrower CMBS model.
    

      Better Than Average Amortization: The pool is scheduled to amortize by 
      14.7% of the initial pool balance prior to maturity. This is better than 
      the averages of 12% and 11.8% for 2014 and YTD 2015, respectively. Seven 
      loans (9%) are full-term interest only and 19 loans (40.5%) are partial 
      interest only, with the remaining 37 loans (50.5%) being balloon loans.
    

      Mortgage Coupons: The pool's weighted average coupon is 4.43%, well 
      below historical averages. Fitch accounted for increased refinance risk 
      in a higher interest rate environment by reviewing an interest rate 
      sensitivity that assumes an interest rate floor of 5% for the term risk 
      for most property types, 4.5% for multifamily properties and 6% for 
      hotel properties, in conjunction with Fitch's stressed refinance rates, 
      which were 10.36% on a weighted-average basis.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 12.9% below the 
      most recent net operating income (NOI; for properties for which a recent 
      NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing during this 
      period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level NCF could 
      result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted loans, and 
      could result in potential rating actions on the certificates.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to GSMS 
      2015-GC32 certificates and found that the transaction displays average 
      sensitivity to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF 
      declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the senior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'Asf' could result. In a more severe scenario, 
      in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the 
      senior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB+sf' could result. The presale report 
      includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities 
      on pages 10 - 11.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from Ernst 
      & Young LLP. The third-party due diligence information was provided on 
      Form ABS Due Diligence-15E and focused on a comparison and 
      re-computation of certain characteristics with respect to each of the 63 
      mortgage loans. Fitch considered this information in its analysis and 
      the findings did not have an impact on our analysis. A copy of the ABS 
      Due Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch in connection with this 
      transaction may be obtained through the link contained on the bottom of 
      the related rating action commentary.

Fitch Affirms GS Mortgage Securities Trust 2015-GC32 Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Affirms GS Mortgage Securities Trust 2015-GC32 Commercial Mortgage 
      Pass-Through Certificates
    





May 25, 2016 03:32 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has affirmed 15 classes of GS Mortgage Securities Trust 
      2015-GC32 Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates. A detailed list 
      of rating actions follows at the end of this press release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The affirmations are based on the stable performance of the underlying 
      collateral pool. There have been no delinquent or specially serviced 
      loans since issuance. The stable performance reflects no material 
      changes to pool metrics since issuance, therefore the original rating 
      analysis was considered in affirming the transaction.
    

      The pool's aggregate principal balance has been reduced by 0.69% to $996 
      million from $1.0 billion at issuance. No loans have been designated as 
      Fitch Loans of Concern.
    

      The largest loan in the pool (9.9% of the pool) is secured by 32 
      cross-collateralized and cross defaulted properties consisting of 32 
      manufactured housing communities containing 4,965 pads. One of the 
      communities is age-restricted, and the remaining 31 communities are 
      all-ages. The assets are located across six states, with the largest 
      concentration in Colorado. As of March 2015, the combined occupancy was 
      84%.
    

      The second largest loan in the pool (7.4%) is secured by a 301,501 sf 
      retail and office space across 15 separate buildings and is currently 
      leased to a mix of 88 national and local retail and dining tenants. The 
      property is anchored by Whole Foods and CVS. As of December 2015, 
      occupancy increased to 95% from 93% at issuance.
    

      The third largest loan in the pool (6.6%) is secured by a 595,412 sf 
      power center located in ElPaso, TX. The property is centrally located to 
      the area's three major activity hubs (Bridge of Americas, El Paso 
      International Airport and Fort Bliss) and is a convenient shopping 
      destination for tourists and residents of El Paso. The property was 92% 
      occupied as of December 2015.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      The Outlook for all classes remains Stable. Fitch does not foresee 
      positive or negative ratings migration until a material economic or 
      asset level event changes the transaction's portfolio-level metrics.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      No third-party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action.
    

      Fitch affirms the following classes:
    

      --$74.5 million class A-1 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$50.9 million class A-2 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$180 million class A-3 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$331.9 million class A-4 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$85 million class A-AB at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$70.2 million class A-S at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$60.2 million class B at 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$173 million class PEZ at 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$42.6 million class C at 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$51.4 million class D at 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$20.1 million class E at 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$10 million class F at 'Bsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$772.4 million* class X-A at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$60.2 million* class X-B at 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$51.4 million* class X-D at 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      * Notional amount and interest only.
    

      Class A-S, B and C certificates may be exchanged for class PEZ 
      certificates, and class PEZ certificates may be exchanged for class A-S, 
      B, and C certificates.
    

      Class A-S, class B, and class C certificates may be exchanged for a 
      related amount of class EC certificates, and class EC certificates may 
      be exchanged for class A-S, class B, and class C certificates.
    

      Class E and F are privately placed pursuant to Rule 144A.
    

      Fitch does not rate classes G and H.

Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas acts as trustee of the Kaiser Center Mortgage Loan and the US Storage Mart Portfolio Mortgage Loan. Pursuant to the pooling and servicing agreement for the CGCMT 2015-P1 Transaction and the trust and servicing agreement for the CGBAM 2015-SMRT Transaction, the trustee is required to provide an assessment of compliance with applicable servicing criteria solely with respect to Item 1122(d)(2)(iii) of Regulation AB (regarding advances of funds or guarantees regarding collections, cash flows or distributions, and any interest or other fees charged for such advances, are made, reviewed and approved as specified in the transaction agreements). However, the trustee is not required to deliver such assessment of compliance with applicable servicing criteria with respect to any reporting period during which there were no servicing criteria applicable to the trustee, as was the case during the reporting
period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  As a result, this Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an assessment of compliance with applicable servicing criteria of the trustee. One or more other servicers of the Kaiser Center Mortgage Loan and the US Storage Mart Portfolio Mortgage Loan have delivered one or more assessments of compliance with respect to Item 1122(d)(2)(iii) of Regulation AB.
 


This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes assessments of compliance with applicable servicing criteria and accountants’ attestation reports from CoreLogic Commercial Real Estate Services, Inc. and National Tax Search, LLC. These entities were engaged by the primary servicer of the Kaiser Center Mortgage Loan to remit tax payments received from the escrow accounts of borrowers to local taxing authorities, to report tax amounts due, to verify tax parcel information, and to verify non-escrow tax payments. These services are included within the servicing criteria set forth in Items 1122(d)(4)(xi) and 1122(d)(4)(xii). Therefore, under the principles-based definition of “servicer” set forth in Item 1101(j) that looks to the functions that an entity performs, these vendors are “servicers” for the purposes of Item 1122. See Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations, Section 301.01 (Item 1101(j)).

Item 1117 of Regulation AB, Legal Proceedings. 


The registrant knows of no material pending legal proceeding involving the trust or any party related to the trust, other than routine litigation incidental to the duties of those respective parties, and the following, with respect to CWCapital Asset Management LLC, as special servicer, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee, certificate administrator and custodian, Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as trustee and custodian, Citibank, N.A., as certificate administrator and custodian, and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, certificate administrator and custodian:
On December 17, 2015, U.S. Bank National Association, the trustee under five (5) pooling and servicing agreements for (i) Wachovia Bank Commercial Mortgage Trust 2007-C30, (ii) COBALT CMBS Commercial Trust 2007-C2, (iii) Wachovia Bank Commercial Mortgage Trust 2007-C31, (iv) ML-CFC Commercial Mortgage Trust 2007-5 and (v) ML-CFC Commercial Mortgage Trust 2007-6 commenced a proceeding with the Second Judicial District Court of Ramsey County, Minnesota (“Court”) for a declaratory judgment as to the proper allocation of certain proceeds in the alleged amount of $560 million (“Disputed Proceeds”) received by CWCapital Asset Management LLC (“CWCAM”) in connection with the sale of the Peter Cooper Village and Stuyvesant Town property in New York, New York (the “Property”) securing loans held by those trusts.  CWCAM was the special servicer of the Property. The petition requests
the court to instruct the trustee, the trust beneficiaries, and any other interested parties as to the amount of the Disputed Proceeds, if any, that constitute penalty interest and/or the amount of the Disputed Proceeds, if any, that constitute gain-on-sale proceeds, with respect to each trust. On February 24, 2016, CWCAM made a limited appearance with the Court to file a motion to dismiss this proceeding based on lack of jurisdiction, mootness, standing, and forum non conveniens.  There can be no assurances as to the outcome of this motion or the proceeding or the possible impact on CWCAM. However, CWCAM believes that it has performed its obligations under the related pooling and servicing agreements in good faith, and that the Disputed Proceeds were properly allocated to CWCAM as penalty interest, and it intends to vigorously contest any claim that such Disputed Proceeds were improperly allocated as penalty interest. 
 
On June 18, 2014, a group of institutional investors filed a civil complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., in its capacity as trustee under 276 residential mortgage backed securities (“RMBS”) trusts, which was later amended on July 18, 2014, to increase the number of trusts to 284 RMBS trusts.  On November 24, 2014, the plaintiffs filed a motion to voluntarily dismiss the state court action without prejudice.  That same day, a group of institutional investors filed a civil complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the “District Court”) against Wells Fargo Bank, alleging claims against the bank in its capacity as trustee for 274 RMBS trusts (the “Complaint”). In December 2014,
the plaintiffs’ motion to voluntarily dismiss their original state court action was granted.  As with the prior state court action, the Complaint is one of six similar complaints filed contemporaneously against RMBS trustees (Deutsche Bank, Citibank, HSBC, Bank of New York Mellon and US Bank) by a group of institutional investor plaintiffs.  The Complaint against Wells Fargo Bank alleges that the trustee caused losses to investors and asserts causes of action based upon, among other things, the trustee's alleged failure to (i) enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for purported breaches of representations and warranties, (ii) notify investors of alleged events of default purportedly caused by breaches by mortgage loan servicers, and (iii) abide by appropriate standards of care following alleged events of default. Relief sought includes money damages in an unspecified amount, reimbursement of expenses, and equitable relief.  Other cases (collectively,
the “Additional Complaints”) alleging similar causes of action have been filed against Wells Fargo Bank and other trustees in the same court by RMBS investors in these and other transactions, and these cases have been consolidated before the same judge. On January 19, 2016, an order was entered in connection with the Complaint in which the District Court declined to exercise jurisdiction over 261 trusts at issue in the Complaint; the District Court also allowed Plaintiffs to file amended complaints if they so chose, and three amended complaints have been filed. There can be no assurances as to the outcome of the litigation, or the possible impact of the litigation on the trustee or the RMBS trusts. However, Wells Fargo Bank denies liability and believes that it has performed its obligations under the RMBS trusts in good faith, that its actions were not the cause of any losses to investors, and that it has meritorious
defenses, and it intends to contest the plaintiffs’ claims vigorously.
On June 18, 2014, a group of investors, including funds managed by Blackrock Advisors, LLC, PIMCO-Advisors, L.P., and others, filed a derivative action against Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (“DBTCA”) and Deutsche Bank National Trust Company (“DBNTC”)  in New York State Supreme Court purportedly on behalf of and for the benefit of 544 private-label RMBS trusts asserting claims for alleged violations of the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (TIA), breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty and negligence based on DBNTC and DBTCA’s alleged failure to perform their duties as trustees for the trusts. Plaintiffs subsequently dismissed their state court complaint and filed a derivative and class action complaint
in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of and for the benefit of 564 private-label RMBS trusts, which substantially overlapped with the trusts at issue in the state court action. The complaint alleges that the trusts at issue have suffered total realized collateral losses of U.S. $89.4 billion, but the complaint does not include a demand for money damages in a sum certain. DBNTC and DBTCA filed a motion to dismiss, and on January 19, 2016, the court partially granted the motion on procedural grounds: as to the 500 trusts that are governed by Pooling and Servicing Agreements, the court declined to exercise jurisdiction. The court did not rule on substantive defenses asserted in the motion to dismiss as to the 64 trusts formed under indentures for which it retained jurisdiction.  Instead, the court
ordered plaintiffs to file an amended complaint as to those indenture trusts. On February 23, 2016, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint as to 62 of the 64 indenture trusts included in the original U.S. District Court complaint. DBNTC and DBTCA will have an opportunity to file new defensive motions with respect to this amended complaint. It is anticipated that plaintiffs will, in the near future, file a new state court complaint as to some or all of the 500 trusts governed by Pooling and Servicing Agreements which were dismissed from the U.S. District Court action.  
On December 30, 2015, IKB International, S.A. and IKB Deutsche Industriebank A.G. filed a Summons With Notice in New York state court naming as defendants DBNTC and DBTCA, as trustees of 37 RMBS trusts (the “IKB Action”).  The claims in the IKB Action appear to be substantively similar to the SDNY Action.  The IKB Action is not styled as a putative class action, but may attempt to bring derivative claims on behalf of the named RMBS Trusts.  DBTCA intends to vigorously defend the IKB Action.
DBTCA has no pending legal proceedings (including, based on DBTCA's present evaluation, the litigation disclosed in the foregoing paragraphs) that would materially affect its ability to perform its duties as Trustee under the pooling and servicing agreement for the CGCMT 2015-P1 Transaction and the trust and servicing agreement for the CGBAM 2015-SMRT Transaction and as Trustee and Custodian under the pooling and servicing agreement for the CGCMT 2015-GC29 Transaction.
On June 18, 2014, a civil action was filed against Citibank, N.A. (“Citibank”) in the Supreme Court of the State of New York by a group of investors in 48 private-label RMBS trusts for which Citibank allegedly serves or did serve as trustee, asserting claims for purported violations of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty and negligence based on Citibank’s alleged failure to perform its duties as trustee for the 48 RMBS trusts.  On November 24, 2014, plaintiffs sought leave to withdraw this action.  On the same day, a smaller subset of similar plaintiff investors in 27 private-label RMBS trusts for which Citibank allegedly serves
or did serve as trustee, filed a new civil action against Citibank in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York asserting similar claims as the prior action filed in state court.  In January 2015, the court closed plaintiffs’ original state court action.  Citibank’s motion to dismiss the federal complaint was fully briefed as of May 13, 2015.  On September 8, 2015, the federal court dismissed all claims as to 24 of the 27 trusts and allowed certain of the claims to proceed as to the other three trusts. That case, involving the three remaining trusts, is pending.
On November 24, 2015, the same investors that brought the federal case brought a new civil action in the Supreme Court of the State of New York related to 25 private-label RMBS trusts for which Citibank allegedly serves or did serve as trustee.  This case includes the 24 trusts previously dismissed in the federal action, and one additional trust.  The investors assert claims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of duty to avoid conflicts of interest, and violation of New York’s Streit Act.  Citibank filed a motion to dismiss this case on February 26, 2016.
On August 19, 2015, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) as Receiver for a financial institution filed a civil action against Citibank in the Southern District of New York.  This action relates to one private-label RMBS trust for which Citibank formerly served as trustee.  FDIC asserts claims for breach of contract, violation of the Streit Act, and violation of the Trust Indenture Act. Citibank is jointly briefing a motion to dismiss with The Bank of New York Mellon and U.S. Bank, entities that have also been sued by FDIC in their capacity as trustee, and whose cases are all in front of Judge Carter.
There can be no assurances as to the outcome of litigation or the possible impact of litigation on the trustee or the RMBS trusts.  However, Citibank denies liability and continues to vigorously defend against these litigations.  Furthermore, neither the above-disclosed litigations nor any other pending legal proceeding involving Citibank will materially affect Citibank’s ability to perform its duties as Certificate Administrator under the pooling and servicing agreement for the CGCMT 2015-P1 Transaction and the pooling and servicing agreement for the CGCMT 2015-GC29 Transaction and as Certificate Administrator and Custodian under the trust and servicing agreement for the CGBAM 2015-SMRT Transaction. 
Since 2014 various plaintiffs or groups of plaintiffs, primarily investors, have filed claims against U.S. Bank National Association (“U.S. Bank”), in its capacity as trustee or successor trustee (as the case may be) under certain residential mortgage backed securities (“RMBS”) trusts. The plaintiffs or plaintiff groups have filed substantially similar complaints against other RMBS trustees, including Deutsche Bank, Citibank, HSBC, Bank of New York Mellon and Wells Fargo. The complaints against U.S. Bank allege the trustee caused losses to investors as a result of alleged failures by the sponsors, mortgage loan sellers and servicers for these RMBS trusts and assert causes of action based upon the trustee's purported failure to enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for alleged breaches of representations and warranties concerning loan quality. The complaints also assert that the trustee failed to notify securityholders
of purported events of default allegedly caused by breaches of servicing standards by mortgage loan servicers and that the trustee purportedly failed to abide by a heightened standard of care following alleged events of default.
Currently U.S. Bank is a defendant in multiple actions alleging individual or class action claims against the trustee with respect to multiple trusts as described above with the most substantial case being: BlackRock Balanced Capital Portfolio et al v. U.S. Bank National Association, No. 605204/2015 (N.Y. Sup. Ct.) (class action alleging claims with respect to approximately 794 trusts) and its companion case BlackRock Core Bond Portfolio et al v. U.S Bank National Association, No. 14-cv-9401 (S.D.N.Y.). Some of the trusts implicated in the aforementioned Blackrock cases, as well as other trusts, are involved in actions brought by separate groups of plaintiffs related to no more than 100 trusts per case.
There can be no assurance as to the outcome of any of the litigation, or the possible impact of these litigations on the trustee or the RMBS trusts. However, U.S. Bank denies liability and believes that it has performed its obligations under the RMBS trusts in good faith, that its actions were not the cause of losses to investors and that it has meritorious defenses, and it intends to contest the plaintiffs’ claims vigorously.

For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
