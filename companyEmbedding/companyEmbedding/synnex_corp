Technology Solutions



Distribution Services
  In our Technology Solutions segment, we purchase peripherals, IT systems, system components, software, networking equipment, consumer electronics and complementary products from our primary suppliers and sell them to our reseller and retail customers. We perform a similar function for our distribution of licensed software products. Our reseller customers include value-added resellers, or VARs, corporate resellers, government resellers, system integrators, direct marketers, and national and regional retailers.
In Technology Solutions, we also provide comprehensive IT solutions in key vertical markets such as government and health care, and we provide specialized service offerings that increase efficiencies in the areas of print management, renewals, networking, logistics services, and supply chain management. Additionally, within our Technology Solutions segment, we provide our customers with systems design and integration solutions for data center servers and storage solutions built specifically to our customers’ data center environments. We distribute more than 30,000 technology products (as measured by active SKUs) from more than 300 IT, CE, and OEM suppliers to more than 20,000 resellers, system integrators, and retailers throughout the United States, Canada, Japan, Mexico, and China. We combine our core strengths in distribution with our customer-engagement services to help our customers achieve greater efficiencies in time to market, cost minimization, real-time linkages in the supply chain, and after-market product support.

Welcome to the SYNNEX Integrated Communications Web Community 
          - Your Business Portal
        



What is Integrated Communications? SYNNEX – Integrated Communications Definition  
There are many definitions of Integrated Communications. Much like "Network Security”, Integrated Communications can represent several solutions, either as a subset or as an overall solution for businesses and organizations. 
Integrated Communications is the integration of real-time communication services such as instant messaging (chat), presence information, Telephony (including IP telephony), video conferencing, call control and speech recognition with non real-time communication services such as integrated messaging (integrated voicemail, e-mail, SMS and fax). Integrated Communications is not a single product, but a set of products that provides a consistent integrated user interface and user experience across multiple devices and media types.
Integrated Communications has the power to fundamentally change the way people work. It will transform business in the coming decade in the same way e-mail changed the business landscape in the 1990s. This transformation will clearly blur the line between voice and data forever. SYNNEX’s Integrated Communications Group, along with our extensive list of industry-leading voice and data vendor partners, is structured to uniquely position us to execute a successful and truly integrated communications strategy for your organization.
Core Technologies include: 
Data networking, integrated telephony, voice, video, web conferencing, instant messaging, email, voice mail, business processes, applications and security.

AUSTIN, Texas
– September 1, 2015
 – Xplore Technologies Corp. (NASDAQ: XPLR),
manufacturer of the world’s broadest range of high-quality rugged tablet

“SYNNEX
is very important to Xplore’s business growth and strategic vision,” said Mark
Holleran, president and chief operating officer for Xplore. “Broadening the
product portfolio being sold through SYNNEX enables more businesses and

fully-rugged tablet computers.”
By
offering additional products through SYNNEX, Xplore is expanding its reach in
North America with increased support and services through SYNNEX. In addition
to the Bobcat, Xplore products currently available through SYNNEX include the
Motion CL920, Motion R12, Motion F5m and the Motion C5m.
“We
value our long-standing relationship with Motion, and more recently with Xplore
after they acquired the Motion product line, and are proud to offer more of
their industry-leading products to our customers,” said Peter Larocque,
president, North American Technology Solutions for SYNNEX Corporation. “Adding
the fully rugged Bobcat tablets to our line card allows us to meet the needs of
a key group of resellers seeking more rugged computing options for their
customers.”

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
