The majority of the employees there are great and fun to work with. You get free biscuits on Fridays.ConsThe company is not interested in investing in their employees. There is no clear-cut career path laid out for anyone. You're lucky if you get a review once a year. Upper management (including the President and CEO) acknowledges the lack of structure and organization throughout the company, but never actually fixes the problem. As a result, turnover has sky-rocketed. I'd be hard-pressed to find one person at the company (other than someone in upper management) that will say they are happy with their job. I've never seen so many unhappy employees throughout any place I've ever worked. It's inevitable that any time employees get together to hang out "away" from work, the "I hate SMT" conversations begin.Do not expect to get paid anywhere close to what the average salary is for your position. You will get the absolute lowest pay possible. Raises are rare and extremely small.There is also not a good balance between work and personal life. Management expects you to make yourself available after hours and on weekends. This leads to tons of stressed and burned-out employees. The work emails never stop.Employees are taken for granted and hard work goes unappreciated and unnoticed for the most part. Even if it is noticed and acknowledged, nothing will come of it. If you're interested in finding a long-term career, stay far, far away from this place. It's quite a shame. You look at this company from the outside and expect that it would be quite a fun and satisfying place to work. Sadly, that's just not the case.Advice to ManagementTake the time to show appreciation for your employees. That can go a long way. Give employees an incentive to go above and beyond. Set up a well-defined career path for each position and pay what they are truly worth.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (9) Sportsmedia Technology Corp Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Sportsmedia Technology Corp 2014-05-02 08:27 PDT Jan 27, 2013"Mixed"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Anonymous EmployeeCurrent Employee - Anonymous EmployeeDoesn't RecommendNeutral OutlookI have been working at Sportsmedia Technology Corp full-timeProsAwesome people, positive work environment, very good work/life balance, strong team moral, good leadership.ConsAbysmally low, sub-market pay.

History[edit]
SMT was founded in 1988 by Gerard J. Hall after developing the first real-time scoring and wireless data delivery system for the PGA Tour to replace walkie-talkie communication used at the time. “The scoring over walkie-talkies was just really, really problematic,” Hall recalled in 2012. He developed a way to interface real-time scoring with TV production using personal computers.[3]
Hall provided this interface from 1988 to 1991 for NBC Sports’ coverage of PGA Tour telecasts. In June 1990, he formally incorporated what was then known as SportsMEDIA Technology Corporation with an eye toward offering TV interface technology to other sports television broadcasters. Shortly thereafter, SportsMEDIA Technology signed an exclusive four-year agreement with ESPN to provide interface TV graphics services for many live sporting events.[4] The scoring system used by SportsMEDIA became modified during this period to include compiling statistics based on performance or event data of a sports or performance event or activity. The system received a U.S. patent in 1996.[5]
Following the end of the exclusive ESPN contract, Hall led SportsMEDIA Technology into the design and development of the first clock-and-score graphic on TV, the SportsMEDIA Autograph device. It became known as the Fox Box , as it came to prominence on NFL football telecasts on the FOX network in 1997 as a real-time scoreboard, and it set constant on-air graphic scoreboards as standard operating procedure for all sports telecasts.[6]
By the late 1990s SportsMEDIA Technology began providing statistics for CBS Sports announcers to use every year during broadcasts of the NCAA Final Four basketball tournament, as well as shot clocks, game clocks and scores that appear on screen.[7]
Beginning in 2000, SportsMEDIA Technology began providing graphics, statistics, world feeds and video enhancements to the annual Super Bowl broadcast.[8] For Super Bowl XLVII in 2013, six cameras were calibrated with the first down line by SMT.[9]
In the early 2000s, SportsMEDIA Technology moved into the virtual graphics realm with what it branded as “Sports Media Augmented Reality Technology” (SMART). Its first-down line product, called SMART Virtual Insertion Publisher (VIP), was used first by NBC Sports in 2003 for Notre Dame games to indicate where a football team had to cross on a field in order to score a first down. SMART VIP provided the virtual first-down line for Monday Night Football coverage by ABC Sports in 2004.[10]
In September 2010, SportsMEDIA Technology raised $12.5 million in outside capital to finance its expansion. Vicente Capital Partners, a Los Angeles-based private equity firm, received a minority ownership stake in the business as part of the deal.[11]
SportsMEDIA Technology changed its name to SMT in January 2011. The company said the name change reflected its expansion into other sectors besides sports, such as entertainment, education and medical.[12]
Looking for an acquisition that would add new products and services to its current product mix and help it expand its market reach, SMT acquired Jacksonville, Fla.-based Information and Display Systems, LLC, also known as IDS, in February 2012, in a deal that doubled the size of SMT. IDS's scoring and statistics systems and display boards and systems are used at such events as Wimbledon, the US Open, the French Open and the Australian Open. As part of the deal, SMT operated IDS as a wholly owned business unit of SMT, while Gerard J. Hall became CEO of both companies and remained as president of SMT. [13]
SMT launched a company called (n+1) designstudio in 2013 to focus on motion graphic design and branding solutions. Clients include Revolt TV, Food Network, Fantasy Sports Network, CrossFit Games, NASCAR and the Women’s Tennis Association.[14][15]
In a deal finalized Oct. 4, 2016, SMT acquired Sportvision, a company founded in 1998 with more than 70 patents and best known for popular on-screen graphics like the yellow “1st & Ten” line in football, the “PITCHf/x” virtual strike zone in baseball, and the “RACEf/x” pointer system in NASCAR. The transaction was unanimously approved by SMT’s board of directors and was financed through a minority-round investment by Eldridge Industries, Vicente Capital Partners, and SMT CEO Gerard J. Hall.[16]

Leadership[edit]
Gerard J. Hall serves as the founder, president and CEO of SMT. Upon graduation from Harvard University in 1981, he won the St. Andrew’s Scholarship to attend Scotland’s University of Edinburgh, where he pursued a Master of Science in computer science. Hall continued his graduate studies while teaching computer science at the University of Central Florida before leaving in 1986 to work with the Epson Computer Corporation. He established what would become SMT two years later.[17]
Hall was a 2013 finalist for the EY Entrepreneur Of The Year Award in the Southeast, which includes Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee.[18]
Products[edit]
ISO Track[edit]
SMT's ISO Track software features an on-screen, image-based pointer graphic that identifies and tracks vehicles, horses, cyclists and athletes in real-time for events such as professional motorsports, horse racing, cycling stage races and marathons. The image-recognition tracking software does not require the traditional stationary camera and has been deployed for events including the Indianapolis 500, the Kentucky Derby, the Tour de France and the New York City Marathon.[19][20]
GOTO Board[edit]
SMT’s GOTO Board (Giant On-Air Talent Operated Board) is a large touchscreen monitor and analysis tool that announcers use to stop and pause video and drag-and-drop statistics. It has been used both in sports and entertainment shows, such as MLB Network and the BET channel’s 106 & Park music video show.[21]
SMART and Augmented Reality[edit]
SMT’s SMART system utilizes SMT’s image-stitch technology to display graphics and signage within a live virtual scene. SMART Line produces digital markers on a pitch, such as the first down marker on a football field, and SMART VIP displays on-air graphics including signage, billboards and video displays. SMART Studio produces real-time 3D virtual studios.
For NBC Sunday Night Football, SMT has provided augmented reality products such as Night Vision, which can be used on replays to highlight the on-field action by blacking out the field around the players while retaining the yard markers.[22][23]
Clients[edit]
SMT has provided data and social media for many regional and national TV channels, including:[24]

ABC Sports
NBC Sports
CBS Sports
ESPN
New England Sports Network
Turner Sports
TNT
YES Network

Noteworthy events[edit]
Sporting events that have used SMT’s products include:[25][26]

The Super Bowl
The Indianapolis 500
The Kentucky Derby
Summer and Winter X Games
NBA games
NASCAR races
NHL games

Awards[edit]

Two 2010 Silver Telly awards for video production and supporting virtual graphics[27]
2010 PromaxBDA Sports Marketing Award
2010 Davey Award TV Sports[28]

History[edit]
SMT was founded in 1988 by Gerard J. Hall after developing the first real-time scoring and wireless data delivery system for the PGA Tour to replace walkie-talkie communication used at the time. “The scoring over walkie-talkies was just really, really problematic,” Hall recalled in 2012. He developed a way to interface real-time scoring with TV production using personal computers.[3]
Hall provided this interface from 1988 to 1991 for NBC Sports’ coverage of PGA Tour telecasts. In June 1990, he formally incorporated what was then known as SportsMEDIA Technology Corporation with an eye toward offering TV interface technology to other sports television broadcasters. Shortly thereafter, SportsMEDIA Technology signed an exclusive four-year agreement with ESPN to provide interface TV graphics services for many live sporting events.[4] The scoring system used by SportsMEDIA became modified during this period to include compiling statistics based on performance or event data of a sports or performance event or activity. The system received a U.S. patent in 1996.[5]
Following the end of the exclusive ESPN contract, Hall led SportsMEDIA Technology into the design and development of the first clock-and-score graphic on TV, the SportsMEDIA Autograph device. It became known as the Fox Box , as it came to prominence on NFL football telecasts on the FOX network in 1997 as a real-time scoreboard, and it set constant on-air graphic scoreboards as standard operating procedure for all sports telecasts.[6]
By the late 1990s SportsMEDIA Technology began providing statistics for CBS Sports announcers to use every year during broadcasts of the NCAA Final Four basketball tournament, as well as shot clocks, game clocks and scores that appear on screen.[7]
Beginning in 2000, SportsMEDIA Technology began providing graphics, statistics, world feeds and video enhancements to the annual Super Bowl broadcast.[8] For Super Bowl XLVII in 2013, six cameras were calibrated with the first down line by SMT.[9]
In the early 2000s, SportsMEDIA Technology moved into the virtual graphics realm with what it branded as “Sports Media Augmented Reality Technology” (SMART). Its first-down line product, called SMART Virtual Insertion Publisher (VIP), was used first by NBC Sports in 2003 for Notre Dame games to indicate where a football team had to cross on a field in order to score a first down. SMART VIP provided the virtual first-down line for Monday Night Football coverage by ABC Sports in 2004.[10]
In September 2010, SportsMEDIA Technology raised $12.5 million in outside capital to finance its expansion. Vicente Capital Partners, a Los Angeles-based private equity firm, received a minority ownership stake in the business as part of the deal.[11]
SportsMEDIA Technology changed its name to SMT in January 2011. The company said the name change reflected its expansion into other sectors besides sports, such as entertainment, education and medical.[12]
Looking for an acquisition that would add new products and services to its current product mix and help it expand its market reach, SMT acquired Jacksonville, Fla.-based Information and Display Systems, LLC, also known as IDS, in February 2012, in a deal that doubled the size of SMT. IDS's scoring and statistics systems and display boards and systems are used at such events as Wimbledon, the US Open, the French Open and the Australian Open. As part of the deal, SMT operated IDS as a wholly owned business unit of SMT, while Gerard J. Hall became CEO of both companies and remained as president of SMT. [13]
SMT launched a company called (n+1) designstudio in 2013 to focus on motion graphic design and branding solutions. Clients include Revolt TV, Food Network, Fantasy Sports Network, CrossFit Games, NASCAR and the Women’s Tennis Association.[14][15]
In a deal finalized Oct. 4, 2016, SMT acquired Sportvision, a company founded in 1998 with more than 70 patents and best known for popular on-screen graphics like the yellow “1st & Ten” line in football, the “PITCHf/x” virtual strike zone in baseball, and the “RACEf/x” pointer system in NASCAR. The transaction was unanimously approved by SMT’s board of directors and was financed through a minority-round investment by Eldridge Industries, Vicente Capital Partners, and SMT CEO Gerard J. Hall.[16]

Leadership[edit]
Gerard J. Hall serves as the founder, president and CEO of SMT. Upon graduation from Harvard University in 1981, he won the St. Andrew’s Scholarship to attend Scotland’s University of Edinburgh, where he pursued a Master of Science in computer science. Hall continued his graduate studies while teaching computer science at the University of Central Florida before leaving in 1986 to work with the Epson Computer Corporation. He established what would become SMT two years later.[17]
Hall was a 2013 finalist for the EY Entrepreneur Of The Year Award in the Southeast, which includes Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee.[18]
Products[edit]
ISO Track[edit]
SMT's ISO Track software features an on-screen, image-based pointer graphic that identifies and tracks vehicles, horses, cyclists and athletes in real-time for events such as professional motorsports, horse racing, cycling stage races and marathons. The image-recognition tracking software does not require the traditional stationary camera and has been deployed for events including the Indianapolis 500, the Kentucky Derby, the Tour de France and the New York City Marathon.[19][20]
GOTO Board[edit]
SMT’s GOTO Board (Giant On-Air Talent Operated Board) is a large touchscreen monitor and analysis tool that announcers use to stop and pause video and drag-and-drop statistics. It has been used both in sports and entertainment shows, such as MLB Network and the BET channel’s 106 & Park music video show.[21]
SMART and Augmented Reality[edit]
SMT’s SMART system utilizes SMT’s image-stitch technology to display graphics and signage within a live virtual scene. SMART Line produces digital markers on a pitch, such as the first down marker on a football field, and SMART VIP displays on-air graphics including signage, billboards and video displays. SMART Studio produces real-time 3D virtual studios.
For NBC Sunday Night Football, SMT has provided augmented reality products such as Night Vision, which can be used on replays to highlight the on-field action by blacking out the field around the players while retaining the yard markers.[22][23]
Clients[edit]
SMT has provided data and social media for many regional and national TV channels, including:[24]

ABC Sports
NBC Sports
CBS Sports
ESPN
New England Sports Network
Turner Sports
TNT
YES Network

Noteworthy events[edit]
Sporting events that have used SMT’s products include:[25][26]

The Super Bowl
The Indianapolis 500
The Kentucky Derby
Summer and Winter X Games
NBA games
NASCAR races
NHL games

Awards[edit]

Two 2010 Silver Telly awards for video production and supporting virtual graphics[27]
2010 PromaxBDA Sports Marketing Award
2010 Davey Award TV Sports[28]

History[edit]
SMT was founded in 1988 by Gerard J. Hall after developing the first real-time scoring and wireless data delivery system for the PGA Tour to replace walkie-talkie communication used at the time. “The scoring over walkie-talkies was just really, really problematic,” Hall recalled in 2012. He developed a way to interface real-time scoring with TV production using personal computers.[3]
Hall provided this interface from 1988 to 1991 for NBC Sports’ coverage of PGA Tour telecasts. In June 1990, he formally incorporated what was then known as SportsMEDIA Technology Corporation with an eye toward offering TV interface technology to other sports television broadcasters. Shortly thereafter, SportsMEDIA Technology signed an exclusive four-year agreement with ESPN to provide interface TV graphics services for many live sporting events.[4] The scoring system used by SportsMEDIA became modified during this period to include compiling statistics based on performance or event data of a sports or performance event or activity. The system received a U.S. patent in 1996.[5]
Following the end of the exclusive ESPN contract, Hall led SportsMEDIA Technology into the design and development of the first clock-and-score graphic on TV, the SportsMEDIA Autograph device. It became known as the Fox Box , as it came to prominence on NFL football telecasts on the FOX network in 1997 as a real-time scoreboard, and it set constant on-air graphic scoreboards as standard operating procedure for all sports telecasts.[6]
By the late 1990s SportsMEDIA Technology began providing statistics for CBS Sports announcers to use every year during broadcasts of the NCAA Final Four basketball tournament, as well as shot clocks, game clocks and scores that appear on screen.[7]
Beginning in 2000, SportsMEDIA Technology began providing graphics, statistics, world feeds and video enhancements to the annual Super Bowl broadcast.[8] For Super Bowl XLVII in 2013, six cameras were calibrated with the first down line by SMT.[9]
In the early 2000s, SportsMEDIA Technology moved into the virtual graphics realm with what it branded as “Sports Media Augmented Reality Technology” (SMART). Its first-down line product, called SMART Virtual Insertion Publisher (VIP), was used first by NBC Sports in 2003 for Notre Dame games to indicate where a football team had to cross on a field in order to score a first down. SMART VIP provided the virtual first-down line for Monday Night Football coverage by ABC Sports in 2004.[10]
In September 2010, SportsMEDIA Technology raised $12.5 million in outside capital to finance its expansion. Vicente Capital Partners, a Los Angeles-based private equity firm, received a minority ownership stake in the business as part of the deal.[11]
SportsMEDIA Technology changed its name to SMT in January 2011. The company said the name change reflected its expansion into other sectors besides sports, such as entertainment, education and medical.[12]
Looking for an acquisition that would add new products and services to its current product mix and help it expand its market reach, SMT acquired Jacksonville, Fla.-based Information and Display Systems, LLC, also known as IDS, in February 2012, in a deal that doubled the size of SMT. IDS's scoring and statistics systems and display boards and systems are used at such events as Wimbledon, the US Open, the French Open and the Australian Open. As part of the deal, SMT operated IDS as a wholly owned business unit of SMT, while Gerard J. Hall became CEO of both companies and remained as president of SMT. [13]
SMT launched a company called (n+1) designstudio in 2013 to focus on motion graphic design and branding solutions. Clients include Revolt TV, Food Network, Fantasy Sports Network, CrossFit Games, NASCAR and the Women’s Tennis Association.[14][15]
In a deal finalized Oct. 4, 2016, SMT acquired Sportvision, a company founded in 1998 with more than 70 patents and best known for popular on-screen graphics like the yellow “1st & Ten” line in football, the “PITCHf/x” virtual strike zone in baseball, and the “RACEf/x” pointer system in NASCAR. The transaction was unanimously approved by SMT’s board of directors and was financed through a minority-round investment by Eldridge Industries, Vicente Capital Partners, and SMT CEO Gerard J. Hall.[16]

Leadership[edit]
Gerard J. Hall serves as the founder, president and CEO of SMT. Upon graduation from Harvard University in 1981, he won the St. Andrew’s Scholarship to attend Scotland’s University of Edinburgh, where he pursued a Master of Science in computer science. Hall continued his graduate studies while teaching computer science at the University of Central Florida before leaving in 1986 to work with the Epson Computer Corporation. He established what would become SMT two years later.[17]
Hall was a 2013 finalist for the EY Entrepreneur Of The Year Award in the Southeast, which includes Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee.[18]
Products[edit]
ISO Track[edit]
SMT's ISO Track software features an on-screen, image-based pointer graphic that identifies and tracks vehicles, horses, cyclists and athletes in real-time for events such as professional motorsports, horse racing, cycling stage races and marathons. The image-recognition tracking software does not require the traditional stationary camera and has been deployed for events including the Indianapolis 500, the Kentucky Derby, the Tour de France and the New York City Marathon.[19][20]
GOTO Board[edit]
SMT’s GOTO Board (Giant On-Air Talent Operated Board) is a large touchscreen monitor and analysis tool that announcers use to stop and pause video and drag-and-drop statistics. It has been used both in sports and entertainment shows, such as MLB Network and the BET channel’s 106 & Park music video show.[21]
SMART and Augmented Reality[edit]
SMT’s SMART system utilizes SMT’s image-stitch technology to display graphics and signage within a live virtual scene. SMART Line produces digital markers on a pitch, such as the first down marker on a football field, and SMART VIP displays on-air graphics including signage, billboards and video displays. SMART Studio produces real-time 3D virtual studios.
For NBC Sunday Night Football, SMT has provided augmented reality products such as Night Vision, which can be used on replays to highlight the on-field action by blacking out the field around the players while retaining the yard markers.[22][23]
Clients[edit]
SMT has provided data and social media for many regional and national TV channels, including:[24]

ABC Sports
NBC Sports
CBS Sports
ESPN
New England Sports Network
Turner Sports
TNT
YES Network

Noteworthy events[edit]
Sporting events that have used SMT’s products include:[25][26]

The Super Bowl
The Indianapolis 500
The Kentucky Derby
Summer and Winter X Games
NBA games
NASCAR races
NHL games

Awards[edit]

Two 2010 Silver Telly awards for video production and supporting virtual graphics[27]
2010 PromaxBDA Sports Marketing Award
2010 Davey Award TV Sports[28]

SMT launched a company called (n+1) designstudio in 2013 to focus on motion graphic design and branding solutions. Clients include Revolt TV, Food Network, Fantasy Sports Network, CrossFit Games, NASCAR and the Women’s Tennis Association.[14][15]
In a deal finalized Oct. 4, 2016, SMT acquired Sportvision, a company founded in 1998 with more than 70 patents and best known for popular on-screen graphics like the yellow “1st & Ten” line in football, the “PITCHf/x” virtual strike zone in baseball, and the “RACEf/x” pointer system in NASCAR. The transaction was unanimously approved by SMT’s board of directors and was financed through a minority-round investment by Eldridge Industries, Vicente Capital Partners, and SMT CEO Gerard J. Hall.[16]

Leadership[edit]
Gerard J. Hall serves as the founder, president and CEO of SMT. Upon graduation from Harvard University in 1981, he won the St. Andrew’s Scholarship to attend Scotland’s University of Edinburgh, where he pursued a Master of Science in computer science. Hall continued his graduate studies while teaching computer science at the University of Central Florida before leaving in 1986 to work with the Epson Computer Corporation. He established what would become SMT two years later.[17]
Hall was a 2013 finalist for the EY Entrepreneur Of The Year Award in the Southeast, which includes Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee.[18]
Products[edit]
ISO Track[edit]
SMT's ISO Track software features an on-screen, image-based pointer graphic that identifies and tracks vehicles, horses, cyclists and athletes in real-time for events such as professional motorsports, horse racing, cycling stage races and marathons. The image-recognition tracking software does not require the traditional stationary camera and has been deployed for events including the Indianapolis 500, the Kentucky Derby, the Tour de France and the New York City Marathon.[19][20]
GOTO Board[edit]
SMT’s GOTO Board (Giant On-Air Talent Operated Board) is a large touchscreen monitor and analysis tool that announcers use to stop and pause video and drag-and-drop statistics. It has been used both in sports and entertainment shows, such as MLB Network and the BET channel’s 106 & Park music video show.[21]
SMART and Augmented Reality[edit]
SMT’s SMART system utilizes SMT’s image-stitch technology to display graphics and signage within a live virtual scene. SMART Line produces digital markers on a pitch, such as the first down marker on a football field, and SMART VIP displays on-air graphics including signage, billboards and video displays. SMART Studio produces real-time 3D virtual studios.
For NBC Sunday Night Football, SMT has provided augmented reality products such as Night Vision, which can be used on replays to highlight the on-field action by blacking out the field around the players while retaining the yard markers.[22][23]
Clients[edit]
SMT has provided data and social media for many regional and national TV channels, including:[24]

ABC Sports
NBC Sports
CBS Sports
ESPN
New England Sports Network
Turner Sports
TNT
YES Network

Noteworthy events[edit]
Sporting events that have used SMT’s products include:[25][26]

The Super Bowl
The Indianapolis 500
The Kentucky Derby
Summer and Winter X Games
NBA games
NASCAR races
NHL games

Awards[edit]

Two 2010 Silver Telly awards for video production and supporting virtual graphics[27]
2010 PromaxBDA Sports Marketing Award
2010 Davey Award TV Sports[28]
