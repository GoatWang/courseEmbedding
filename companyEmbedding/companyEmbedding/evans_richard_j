Life[edit]
Evans was born at Woodford, Essex, of Welsh parentage, and educated at Forest School, Jesus College, Oxford (MA), and St Antony's College, Oxford (DPhil). In a 2004 interview, he stated that frequent visits to Wales during his childhood inspired both an interest in history and a sense of "otherness".[2] Evans has said that one reason he was drawn to the study modern German history in the late 1960s was his identification of parallels between the policies of the Vietnam War and German imperialism.[2] He admired the work of Fritz Fischer, whom he credits with inspiring him to study modern German history.[2]
Career as a historian[edit]
Evans first established his academic reputation with his publications on the Second Reich period of German history. In the early 1970s, Evans travelled to Germany to research his dissertation, a study of the feminist movement in Germany in the first half of the twentieth century.[2] It was later published as The Feminist Movement In Germany, 1894–1933 in 1976. Evans followed his study of German feminism by another book, The Feminists (1977) which traced the history of the feminist movement in North America, Australasia and Europe in the period 1840–1920.[2] A theme of both books was the weakness of German middle class culture, and its inordinate stress on such military values as hierarchy, deference, and obedience.[2] For this reason, Evans argued that both liberalism and feminism failed in Germany while flourishing elsewhere in the Western world[2]
Evans' main interest is social history and he is much influenced by the Annales School.[2] He largely agrees with Fischer that nineteenth century German social development paved the way for the rise of Nazi Germany, although Evans takes pains to point out that this outcome was not inevitable but one among many possibilities.[5] For Evans, the values of the 19th-century German middle class contained the already germinating seeds of National Socialism.[2]
Evans studied under Fischer in Hamburg in 1970–71, but he came to disagree with the "Bielefeld School" of historians who argued for the Sonderweg thesis that saw the roots of Germany’s political development in the first half of the 20th century in a "failed bourgeois revolution" in 1848. Following a contemporary trend that opposed the previous "great man" theory of history, Evans was a member of a group of young British historians who in the 1970s sought to examine German history during the Imperial period "from below".[6] These scholars highlighted "the importance of the grass-roots of politics and the everyday life and experience of ordinary people".[7] "History is about people, and their relationships. It’s about the perennial question of ‘how much free will do people have in building their own lives, and making a future," Evans has said.[8] He says he sought the creation of a "new school of people's history", which was a result of a trend that "has taken place across a whole range of historical subjects, political opinions, and methodological approaches and has been expressed in many different ways".[7] In 1978, as editor of a collection of essays by young British historians entitled Society And Politics In Wilhelmine Germany, he launched a critique of the ‘top-down’ approach of the Bielefeld School associated with Hans-Ulrich Wehler and Jürgen Kocka in regards to the Wilhelmine Germany. With the historians Geoff Eley and David Blackbourn, Evans instead emphasized the "self-mobilization from below" of key sociopolitical groups, as well as the modernity of National Socialism. In the 1980s, Evans organized ten international workshops on modern German social history at the University of East Anglia that did a good deal to refine these ideas, to pioneer research in this new historical field and, in six collections of papers, present it to an Anglophone readership.[9]
Among Evans' major research works are Death in Hamburg (1987), a study of class conflict and liberal government in nineteenth-century Germany using the example of Hamburg’s cholera epidemics and applying statistical methods to the exploration of social inequality in an industrializing society, and Rituals of Retribution (1996), a study of capital punishment in German history applying structural anthropological concepts to the rituals of public execution up to the mid-nineteenth century, and exploring the politics of the death penalty until its abolition by the GDR in 1987. In Death in Hamburg, Evans studied the cholera outbreak in Hamburg in 1892, which he concluded was caused by a failure in the medical system to safeguard against such an event.[2] Another study in German social history was Tales from the German Underworld (1998), where Evans traced the life stories of four German criminals in the late 19th century, namely a homeless woman, a forger, a prostitute and a con-man.[2] In Rituals of Retribution, Evans traced the history of capital punishment in Germany, and using the ideas of Michel Foucault, Philippe Ariès and Norbert Elias as his guide argued that opposition to the death penalty was strongest when liberalism was in the ascendancy, and support for capital punishment coincided when the right was in the ascendancy.[2] Thus, in Evans' view, capital punishment in Germany was never a mere matter of law being disinterestedly applied, but was rather a form of state power being exercised.[2] In addition, Evans examined such subjects as belief in witchcraft, torture, the last words of the executed, the psychology of mobs, varying forms of execution from the Thirty Years War to the 1980s, profiles of executioners, cruelty, and changing views towards the death penalty.[2]
In the 1980s, Evans was a conspicuous figure in the Historikerstreit, a controversy surrounding the historical work and theories of German historians Ernst Nolte, Joachim Fest, Andreas Hillgruber, Michael Stürmer, Hagen Schulze, Imanuel Geiss and Klaus Hildebrand, all of whom Evans considered German apologists attempting to white-wash the German past. Evans' views on the Historikerstreit were set forth in his 1989 book, In Hitler's Shadow. In that book Evans took issue with Nolte's acceptance of the Commissar Order as a legitimate military order; with Nolte's argument that the Einsatzgruppen massacres of Ukrainian Jews were a justifiable "preventive security" response to partisan attacks; his description (citing Viktor Suvorov) of Operation Barbarossa as a "preventative war" forced on Hitler by an impending Soviet attack; and his complaints that much scholarship on the Shoah expressed the views of "biased" Jewish historians.[10]
Evans characterized Nolte's statements as crossing the line into Holocaust denial[11] and he singled out Nolte's rationalization that since the victors write history, the only reason why Nazi Germany is seen as evil is because it lost the war.[12] Evans also denounced as an attempt to justify the Holocaust, Nolte's claim that Chaim Weizmann's letter of 3 September 1939, to Neville Chamberlain promising that the Jewish Agency would support the war effort constituted "Jewish declaration of war" on Germany that justified the pre-emptive internment of Jews in concentration camps.[13] In his 1989 book In Hitler's Shadown, Evans also criticised the intentionalist theories of Hillgruber and Hildebrand.[14] and criticized Stürmer's laudatory biography of Otto von Bismarck, with its excessive focus on political history and overlooking of social conditions, as a regression to the outmoded Great man theory of history.[15] For his part Evans praised Ian Kershaw, who wrote that "The road to Auschwitz was built by hate, but paved with indifference", namely that the German people were by and large indifferent towards the Holocaust.[16]
In Hitler's Shadow also criticized the historical writings of Robert Conquest, Hugh Thomas, Gertrude Himmelfarb, and Geoffrey Elton, whom he considered part of a neo-conservative historical trend.[17] In the same book, Evans endorsed Martin Broszat's call for the "historicization" of the Third Reich as a "rational approach to Nazism" and a "gain" to history.[18]
Evans' book In Defence of History defends the discipline of history against postmodernist skepticism of its value. The limitations of our ability to understand and learn from the past notwithstanding, it is still possible, he argues to understand much about past ways of life. Evans suggests that the spread since the mid-1979s of post-modernist theories, which declare that history is a construct and depict the rationalist tradition of the West as a form of oppression, had done much to increase the appeal of Holocaust denial.[19]
Role as an expert witness in Irving v. Lipstadt[edit]
See also: Irving v. Penguin Books and Lipstadt
Evans is probably best known to the general public in the role of an expert witness for the defence in the high-profile libel case of David Irving against the American historian Deborah Lipstadt in 2000, Irving v. Lipstadt. Lipstadt was sued for libel by Irving, after she referred to him as a "Holocaust denier" and "an ardent follower of Adolf Hitler" in her 1993 book Denying the Holocaust. Lipstadt further accused Irving of "distorting evidence and manipulating documents to serve his own purposes...[as well as] skewing documents and misrepresenting data in order to reach historically untenable conclusions, particularly those that exonerate Hitler."[20]
Evans acted as an expert witness for the defence in the case. Starting in the autumn of 1997, Evans, along with Thomas Skelton-Robinson and Nik Wachsmann, two of his PhD students, closely examined Irving's work.[21] They found instances in which he had used forged documents, disregarded contrary evidence, selectively quoted historical documents out of context and mis-cited historical records, thus misrepresenting historical evidence in order to support his prejudices.[22][23] Evans subsequently proved to be a powerful witness in Lipstadt's ultimately successful defence. In his expert witness report he wrote:

"Not one of [Irving's] books, speeches or articles, not one paragraph, not one sentence in any of them, can be taken on trust as an accurate representation of its historical subject. All of them are completely worthless as history, because Irving cannot be trusted anywhere, in any of them, to give a reliable account of what he is talking or writing about. ... if we mean by historian someone who is concerned to discover the truth about the past, and to give as accurate a representation of it as possible, then Irving is not a historian".[24]

The cross-examination of Evans by Irving was noted for the high degree of personal dislike between the two men.[25] Such was the degree of dislike that Irving challenged Evans on very minor points, such as Evans doubting the fairness of a 1938 German plebiscite in which the Nazi regime received 98.8% of the vote.[26] A subject that much engaged Irving and Evans in a debate was a memo by the Chief of the Reich Chancellery Hans Lammers to the Reich Justice Minister Franz Schlegelberger in which Lammers wrote that Hitler ordered him to put the "Jewish Question" on the "back-burner" until after the war.[27] Evans chose to accept the interpretation of the memo put forward by Eberhard Jäckel in the 1970s;[28] Irving chose to interpret the memo literally and taunted Evans by saying, "It is a terrible problem, is it not that we are faced with this tantalizing plate of crumbs and morsels of what should have provided the final smoking gun, and nowhere the whole way through the archives do we find even one item that we do not have to interpret or read between the lines of, but we do have in the same chain of evidence documents which...quite clearly specifically show Hitler intervening in the other sense?"[29] In response, Evans stated "No, I do not accept that at all. It is because you want to interpret euphemisms as being literal, and that is what the whole problem is. Every time there is an euphemism, Mr. Irving ... or a camouflage piece of statement or language about Madagascar, you want to treat it as the literal truth, because it serves your purpose of trying to exculpate Hitler. That is part of ... the way you manipulate and distort the documents."[30]
In a 2001 interview, Evans described to the Canadian columnist Robert Fulford his impression of Irving after being cross-examined by him as: "He [Irving] was a bit like a dim student who didn't listen. If he didn't get the answer he wanted, he just repeated the question."[31] His findings and his account of the trial were published in his 2001 book Lying About Hitler: History, Holocaust, And The David Irving Trial, which was published as Telling Lies About Hitler in the United States in 2002. The High Court rejected Irving’s libel suit and awarded costs to the defence.
Evans' involvement in the trial was included in the 2016 film Denial, in which he was played by British actor John Sessions.[32]
The Third Reich Trilogy[edit]




Richard J. Evans (2016)


Main article: The Third Reich Trilogy
Between 2003 and 2008, Evans published a three-volume history of the Third Reich. Drawing on years of experience as a leading scholar of German history, Evans produced what some historians call the most extensive and comprehensive history of the rise and fall of Hitler’s regime ever produced by a single scholar. Reviewer Peter Mansoor says, "The Third Reich at War is a superb piece of scholarship that is likely to emerge as the definitive account of life and death inside Hitler's blood soaked Third Reich."[33] Robert Citino says, "Read together, the three volumes constitute a remarkably comprehensive treatment of the origins, course, and death of the Hitler regime, and are likely to be standard works for a long time to come."[34] Ed Ericson says:

Evans masterfully interweaves testimony that has come to light in the intervening decades with learned judgments from hundreds of authors to create a balanced and thoughtful narrative. This book, therefore, will assuredly become the definitive work on The Third Reich at War.[35]

The first volume, The Coming of the Third Reich: How the Nazis Destroyed Democracy and Seized Power in Germany (published by Penguin in 2003), shows how a country torn apart by the First World War, the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, hyperinflation and the Great Depression moved towards an increasingly authoritarian solution. The book explains in detail Adolf Hitler's appointment as Chancellor in January 1933 and how the Nazis transformed Germany into a one party dictatorship. The first volume featured highly favorable words of praise from Evans's friend, Ian Kershaw on its cover.[2]
The second volume, The Third Reich in Power, 1933 - 1939: How the Nazis Won Over the Hearts and Minds of a Nation (published by Penguin in 2005), covers the years of Nazi rule between 1933 and 1939. The final chapter examines the road to the Second World War, but the real focus is on life inside Nazi Germany. One of the great strengths of this volume is the way Evans allows small stories of key individuals to illustrate many of the key social, economic and cultural events of the period. Richard Overy described this instalment of the trilogy as "magisterial."[36]
The third volume, The Third Reich at War: How the Nazis Led Germany from Conquest to Disaster (published by Penguin in 2008), looks at major developments from 1939 to 1945, including the key battles of the Second World War, a vivid, moving and detailed account of the mass murder enacted during the Holocaust and Hitler's dramatic downfall in Berlin in 1945. In an October 2008 review of the third volume for The Times, best-selling historian Antony Beevor writes: "With this third volume, Richard Evans has accomplished a masterpiece of historical scholarship ... [He] has produced the best and most up-to-date synthesis of the huge work carried out on the subject over the past decades."[37] Aspects of it, however, were sharply criticised by Tim Snyder.[38]
Walter Reich, former Director of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D. C., states about the third-volume of the trilogy,The Third Reich at War, "If any work of accurate history has a chance to correct the distortions of public memory, this is it.".[39]
Regius Professor of Modern History[edit]
In 2008, Evans was appointed Regius Professor of Modern History at Cambridge University. (In 2010 the word "Modern" was removed from the title by royal decree). The post is a royal appointment in the gift of the Prime Minister of the day and dates back to 1724. Previous holders of the title have included John Dalberg-Acton (1895), Herbert Butterfield (1963), Geoffrey Elton (1983), Patrick Collinson (1988) and Quentin Skinner (1998). Evans is the first historian to have to apply for the post and be interviewed by a Board of Electors, including Cambridge's Vice-Chancellor, Alison Richard, and representatives of the history faculty and the university, as well as external assessors from Yale, Harvard, Oxford and London. The board selected a shortlist of four, each of whom was asked to give a presentation to the entire Cambridge history faculty. The shortlist of four was then reduced to two, whom the board interviewed, resulting in the board's recommendation of Evans to the Prime Minister and in the issue of a Royal Warrant for his appointment.[40] As well as serving as Regius Professor, Evans has served as chairman of the history faculty since October 2008; his term of office ended on 30 September 2010.
Evans is used to combining administration with research. At Birkbeck College, London, where he worked before Cambridge, he acted as Master of the college when Baroness Blackstone left suddenly to become Tony Blair's first higher education minister. On 27 January 2010 he was elected to the position of President of Wolfson College, Cambridge, to take up office on 1 October 2010.
TV and media appearances[edit]
Evans has appeared regularly on a number of TV documentaries related to Adolf Hitler and the Third Reich. He recently appeared on a major TV documentary on the History Channel which examined the Valkyrie bomb plot against Hitler in July 1944, which was the subject of a Hollywood film starring Tom Cruise. As of 2014, he has made 5 appearances on the BBC Radio 4 programme In Our Time.
He also appears regularly on "Start the Week" and often writes reviews of history books on his specialist era in major newspapers and periodicals. He is also a noted lecturer and gives numerous keynote lectures at international conferences around the world and also at student conferences as part of his remit to take history to a wider audience beyond academia. He is known as an excellent public speaker and often appears regularly as a keynote speaker at universities and schools and at conferences for academics and students around the world.
Debate with the British education secretary[edit]
In 2014, Evans was involved in a debate with Michael Gove, the British education secretary, about the content and style of history teaching and the way that the curriculum is structured and how the First World War should be portrayed.[41] Writing in the Daily Mail, Gove accused Evans in particular of distorting history with regard to Britain's role in the war.[42] Evans countered that Gove was engaging in the defamation of academic historians and "narrow, tub-thumping jingoism". Evans stated that he agreed with Gove's statement about "the ruthless Social Darwinism of the German elites, the pitiless approach they took to occupation, their aggressively expansionist war aims and their scorn for the international order all made resistance more than justified."[41] Evans wrote: "He's [Gove] right about the elites, but misses the point that they weren't able to carry the majority of the German people with them; the largest political party, the Social Democrats, was opposed to annexations and had long been critical of the militarism of the elites".[41] He also ridiculed Gove’s suggestion that the First World War was “just” and fought by men "committed to defending the western liberal order," pointing out that Britain's ally Tsar Nicholas II was far more despotic than even the Kaiser and that 40% of British adult males were not allowed to vote.[41] Evans also wrote that Gove was wrong that only left-wing historians believe that Britain was wrong to fight Germany in World War I, noting that such conservative historians as Niall Ferguson and Alan Clark have been quite vocal in expressing the belief that Britain should have remained neutral in 1914.[41]
Criticism[edit]
In 2011, Evans became involved in a polemical exchange of letters with Peter Baldwin after agreeing with Leif Jerram (in Cosmopolitan Islanders [2009]), that students in Britain could find a richer selection of courses on the histories of other countries in British universities than students from other countries could in their own countries.[43]

Life[edit]
Evans was born at Woodford, Essex, of Welsh parentage, and educated at Forest School, Jesus College, Oxford (MA), and St Antony's College, Oxford (DPhil). In a 2004 interview, he stated that frequent visits to Wales during his childhood inspired both an interest in history and a sense of "otherness".[2] Evans has said that one reason he was drawn to the study modern German history in the late 1960s was his identification of parallels between the policies of the Vietnam War and German imperialism.[2] He admired the work of Fritz Fischer, whom he credits with inspiring him to study modern German history.[2]
Career as a historian[edit]
Evans first established his academic reputation with his publications on the Second Reich period of German history. In the early 1970s, Evans travelled to Germany to research his dissertation, a study of the feminist movement in Germany in the first half of the twentieth century.[2] It was later published as The Feminist Movement In Germany, 1894–1933 in 1976. Evans followed his study of German feminism by another book, The Feminists (1977) which traced the history of the feminist movement in North America, Australasia and Europe in the period 1840–1920.[2] A theme of both books was the weakness of German middle class culture, and its inordinate stress on such military values as hierarchy, deference, and obedience.[2] For this reason, Evans argued that both liberalism and feminism failed in Germany while flourishing elsewhere in the Western world[2]
Evans' main interest is social history and he is much influenced by the Annales School.[2] He largely agrees with Fischer that nineteenth century German social development paved the way for the rise of Nazi Germany, although Evans takes pains to point out that this outcome was not inevitable but one among many possibilities.[5] For Evans, the values of the 19th-century German middle class contained the already germinating seeds of National Socialism.[2]
Evans studied under Fischer in Hamburg in 1970–71, but he came to disagree with the "Bielefeld School" of historians who argued for the Sonderweg thesis that saw the roots of Germany’s political development in the first half of the 20th century in a "failed bourgeois revolution" in 1848. Following a contemporary trend that opposed the previous "great man" theory of history, Evans was a member of a group of young British historians who in the 1970s sought to examine German history during the Imperial period "from below".[6] These scholars highlighted "the importance of the grass-roots of politics and the everyday life and experience of ordinary people".[7] "History is about people, and their relationships. It’s about the perennial question of ‘how much free will do people have in building their own lives, and making a future," Evans has said.[8] He says he sought the creation of a "new school of people's history", which was a result of a trend that "has taken place across a whole range of historical subjects, political opinions, and methodological approaches and has been expressed in many different ways".[7] In 1978, as editor of a collection of essays by young British historians entitled Society And Politics In Wilhelmine Germany, he launched a critique of the ‘top-down’ approach of the Bielefeld School associated with Hans-Ulrich Wehler and Jürgen Kocka in regards to the Wilhelmine Germany. With the historians Geoff Eley and David Blackbourn, Evans instead emphasized the "self-mobilization from below" of key sociopolitical groups, as well as the modernity of National Socialism. In the 1980s, Evans organized ten international workshops on modern German social history at the University of East Anglia that did a good deal to refine these ideas, to pioneer research in this new historical field and, in six collections of papers, present it to an Anglophone readership.[9]
Among Evans' major research works are Death in Hamburg (1987), a study of class conflict and liberal government in nineteenth-century Germany using the example of Hamburg’s cholera epidemics and applying statistical methods to the exploration of social inequality in an industrializing society, and Rituals of Retribution (1996), a study of capital punishment in German history applying structural anthropological concepts to the rituals of public execution up to the mid-nineteenth century, and exploring the politics of the death penalty until its abolition by the GDR in 1987. In Death in Hamburg, Evans studied the cholera outbreak in Hamburg in 1892, which he concluded was caused by a failure in the medical system to safeguard against such an event.[2] Another study in German social history was Tales from the German Underworld (1998), where Evans traced the life stories of four German criminals in the late 19th century, namely a homeless woman, a forger, a prostitute and a con-man.[2] In Rituals of Retribution, Evans traced the history of capital punishment in Germany, and using the ideas of Michel Foucault, Philippe Ariès and Norbert Elias as his guide argued that opposition to the death penalty was strongest when liberalism was in the ascendancy, and support for capital punishment coincided when the right was in the ascendancy.[2] Thus, in Evans' view, capital punishment in Germany was never a mere matter of law being disinterestedly applied, but was rather a form of state power being exercised.[2] In addition, Evans examined such subjects as belief in witchcraft, torture, the last words of the executed, the psychology of mobs, varying forms of execution from the Thirty Years War to the 1980s, profiles of executioners, cruelty, and changing views towards the death penalty.[2]
In the 1980s, Evans was a conspicuous figure in the Historikerstreit, a controversy surrounding the historical work and theories of German historians Ernst Nolte, Joachim Fest, Andreas Hillgruber, Michael Stürmer, Hagen Schulze, Imanuel Geiss and Klaus Hildebrand, all of whom Evans considered German apologists attempting to white-wash the German past. Evans' views on the Historikerstreit were set forth in his 1989 book, In Hitler's Shadow. In that book Evans took issue with Nolte's acceptance of the Commissar Order as a legitimate military order; with Nolte's argument that the Einsatzgruppen massacres of Ukrainian Jews were a justifiable "preventive security" response to partisan attacks; his description (citing Viktor Suvorov) of Operation Barbarossa as a "preventative war" forced on Hitler by an impending Soviet attack; and his complaints that much scholarship on the Shoah expressed the views of "biased" Jewish historians.[10]
Evans characterized Nolte's statements as crossing the line into Holocaust denial[11] and he singled out Nolte's rationalization that since the victors write history, the only reason why Nazi Germany is seen as evil is because it lost the war.[12] Evans also denounced as an attempt to justify the Holocaust, Nolte's claim that Chaim Weizmann's letter of 3 September 1939, to Neville Chamberlain promising that the Jewish Agency would support the war effort constituted "Jewish declaration of war" on Germany that justified the pre-emptive internment of Jews in concentration camps.[13] In his 1989 book In Hitler's Shadown, Evans also criticised the intentionalist theories of Hillgruber and Hildebrand.[14] and criticized Stürmer's laudatory biography of Otto von Bismarck, with its excessive focus on political history and overlooking of social conditions, as a regression to the outmoded Great man theory of history.[15] For his part Evans praised Ian Kershaw, who wrote that "The road to Auschwitz was built by hate, but paved with indifference", namely that the German people were by and large indifferent towards the Holocaust.[16]
In Hitler's Shadow also criticized the historical writings of Robert Conquest, Hugh Thomas, Gertrude Himmelfarb, and Geoffrey Elton, whom he considered part of a neo-conservative historical trend.[17] In the same book, Evans endorsed Martin Broszat's call for the "historicization" of the Third Reich as a "rational approach to Nazism" and a "gain" to history.[18]
Evans' book In Defence of History defends the discipline of history against postmodernist skepticism of its value. The limitations of our ability to understand and learn from the past notwithstanding, it is still possible, he argues to understand much about past ways of life. Evans suggests that the spread since the mid-1979s of post-modernist theories, which declare that history is a construct and depict the rationalist tradition of the West as a form of oppression, had done much to increase the appeal of Holocaust denial.[19]
Role as an expert witness in Irving v. Lipstadt[edit]
See also: Irving v. Penguin Books and Lipstadt
Evans is probably best known to the general public in the role of an expert witness for the defence in the high-profile libel case of David Irving against the American historian Deborah Lipstadt in 2000, Irving v. Lipstadt. Lipstadt was sued for libel by Irving, after she referred to him as a "Holocaust denier" and "an ardent follower of Adolf Hitler" in her 1993 book Denying the Holocaust. Lipstadt further accused Irving of "distorting evidence and manipulating documents to serve his own purposes...[as well as] skewing documents and misrepresenting data in order to reach historically untenable conclusions, particularly those that exonerate Hitler."[20]
Evans acted as an expert witness for the defence in the case. Starting in the autumn of 1997, Evans, along with Thomas Skelton-Robinson and Nik Wachsmann, two of his PhD students, closely examined Irving's work.[21] They found instances in which he had used forged documents, disregarded contrary evidence, selectively quoted historical documents out of context and mis-cited historical records, thus misrepresenting historical evidence in order to support his prejudices.[22][23] Evans subsequently proved to be a powerful witness in Lipstadt's ultimately successful defence. In his expert witness report he wrote:

"Not one of [Irving's] books, speeches or articles, not one paragraph, not one sentence in any of them, can be taken on trust as an accurate representation of its historical subject. All of them are completely worthless as history, because Irving cannot be trusted anywhere, in any of them, to give a reliable account of what he is talking or writing about. ... if we mean by historian someone who is concerned to discover the truth about the past, and to give as accurate a representation of it as possible, then Irving is not a historian".[24]

The cross-examination of Evans by Irving was noted for the high degree of personal dislike between the two men.[25] Such was the degree of dislike that Irving challenged Evans on very minor points, such as Evans doubting the fairness of a 1938 German plebiscite in which the Nazi regime received 98.8% of the vote.[26] A subject that much engaged Irving and Evans in a debate was a memo by the Chief of the Reich Chancellery Hans Lammers to the Reich Justice Minister Franz Schlegelberger in which Lammers wrote that Hitler ordered him to put the "Jewish Question" on the "back-burner" until after the war.[27] Evans chose to accept the interpretation of the memo put forward by Eberhard Jäckel in the 1970s;[28] Irving chose to interpret the memo literally and taunted Evans by saying, "It is a terrible problem, is it not that we are faced with this tantalizing plate of crumbs and morsels of what should have provided the final smoking gun, and nowhere the whole way through the archives do we find even one item that we do not have to interpret or read between the lines of, but we do have in the same chain of evidence documents which...quite clearly specifically show Hitler intervening in the other sense?"[29] In response, Evans stated "No, I do not accept that at all. It is because you want to interpret euphemisms as being literal, and that is what the whole problem is. Every time there is an euphemism, Mr. Irving ... or a camouflage piece of statement or language about Madagascar, you want to treat it as the literal truth, because it serves your purpose of trying to exculpate Hitler. That is part of ... the way you manipulate and distort the documents."[30]
In a 2001 interview, Evans described to the Canadian columnist Robert Fulford his impression of Irving after being cross-examined by him as: "He [Irving] was a bit like a dim student who didn't listen. If he didn't get the answer he wanted, he just repeated the question."[31] His findings and his account of the trial were published in his 2001 book Lying About Hitler: History, Holocaust, And The David Irving Trial, which was published as Telling Lies About Hitler in the United States in 2002. The High Court rejected Irving’s libel suit and awarded costs to the defence.
Evans' involvement in the trial was included in the 2016 film Denial, in which he was played by British actor John Sessions.[32]
The Third Reich Trilogy[edit]




Richard J. Evans (2016)


Main article: The Third Reich Trilogy
Between 2003 and 2008, Evans published a three-volume history of the Third Reich. Drawing on years of experience as a leading scholar of German history, Evans produced what some historians call the most extensive and comprehensive history of the rise and fall of Hitler’s regime ever produced by a single scholar. Reviewer Peter Mansoor says, "The Third Reich at War is a superb piece of scholarship that is likely to emerge as the definitive account of life and death inside Hitler's blood soaked Third Reich."[33] Robert Citino says, "Read together, the three volumes constitute a remarkably comprehensive treatment of the origins, course, and death of the Hitler regime, and are likely to be standard works for a long time to come."[34] Ed Ericson says:

Evans masterfully interweaves testimony that has come to light in the intervening decades with learned judgments from hundreds of authors to create a balanced and thoughtful narrative. This book, therefore, will assuredly become the definitive work on The Third Reich at War.[35]

The first volume, The Coming of the Third Reich: How the Nazis Destroyed Democracy and Seized Power in Germany (published by Penguin in 2003), shows how a country torn apart by the First World War, the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, hyperinflation and the Great Depression moved towards an increasingly authoritarian solution. The book explains in detail Adolf Hitler's appointment as Chancellor in January 1933 and how the Nazis transformed Germany into a one party dictatorship. The first volume featured highly favorable words of praise from Evans's friend, Ian Kershaw on its cover.[2]
The second volume, The Third Reich in Power, 1933 - 1939: How the Nazis Won Over the Hearts and Minds of a Nation (published by Penguin in 2005), covers the years of Nazi rule between 1933 and 1939. The final chapter examines the road to the Second World War, but the real focus is on life inside Nazi Germany. One of the great strengths of this volume is the way Evans allows small stories of key individuals to illustrate many of the key social, economic and cultural events of the period. Richard Overy described this instalment of the trilogy as "magisterial."[36]
The third volume, The Third Reich at War: How the Nazis Led Germany from Conquest to Disaster (published by Penguin in 2008), looks at major developments from 1939 to 1945, including the key battles of the Second World War, a vivid, moving and detailed account of the mass murder enacted during the Holocaust and Hitler's dramatic downfall in Berlin in 1945. In an October 2008 review of the third volume for The Times, best-selling historian Antony Beevor writes: "With this third volume, Richard Evans has accomplished a masterpiece of historical scholarship ... [He] has produced the best and most up-to-date synthesis of the huge work carried out on the subject over the past decades."[37] Aspects of it, however, were sharply criticised by Tim Snyder.[38]
Walter Reich, former Director of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D. C., states about the third-volume of the trilogy,The Third Reich at War, "If any work of accurate history has a chance to correct the distortions of public memory, this is it.".[39]
Regius Professor of Modern History[edit]
In 2008, Evans was appointed Regius Professor of Modern History at Cambridge University. (In 2010 the word "Modern" was removed from the title by royal decree). The post is a royal appointment in the gift of the Prime Minister of the day and dates back to 1724. Previous holders of the title have included John Dalberg-Acton (1895), Herbert Butterfield (1963), Geoffrey Elton (1983), Patrick Collinson (1988) and Quentin Skinner (1998). Evans is the first historian to have to apply for the post and be interviewed by a Board of Electors, including Cambridge's Vice-Chancellor, Alison Richard, and representatives of the history faculty and the university, as well as external assessors from Yale, Harvard, Oxford and London. The board selected a shortlist of four, each of whom was asked to give a presentation to the entire Cambridge history faculty. The shortlist of four was then reduced to two, whom the board interviewed, resulting in the board's recommendation of Evans to the Prime Minister and in the issue of a Royal Warrant for his appointment.[40] As well as serving as Regius Professor, Evans has served as chairman of the history faculty since October 2008; his term of office ended on 30 September 2010.
Evans is used to combining administration with research. At Birkbeck College, London, where he worked before Cambridge, he acted as Master of the college when Baroness Blackstone left suddenly to become Tony Blair's first higher education minister. On 27 January 2010 he was elected to the position of President of Wolfson College, Cambridge, to take up office on 1 October 2010.
TV and media appearances[edit]
Evans has appeared regularly on a number of TV documentaries related to Adolf Hitler and the Third Reich. He recently appeared on a major TV documentary on the History Channel which examined the Valkyrie bomb plot against Hitler in July 1944, which was the subject of a Hollywood film starring Tom Cruise. As of 2014, he has made 5 appearances on the BBC Radio 4 programme In Our Time.
He also appears regularly on "Start the Week" and often writes reviews of history books on his specialist era in major newspapers and periodicals. He is also a noted lecturer and gives numerous keynote lectures at international conferences around the world and also at student conferences as part of his remit to take history to a wider audience beyond academia. He is known as an excellent public speaker and often appears regularly as a keynote speaker at universities and schools and at conferences for academics and students around the world.
Debate with the British education secretary[edit]
In 2014, Evans was involved in a debate with Michael Gove, the British education secretary, about the content and style of history teaching and the way that the curriculum is structured and how the First World War should be portrayed.[41] Writing in the Daily Mail, Gove accused Evans in particular of distorting history with regard to Britain's role in the war.[42] Evans countered that Gove was engaging in the defamation of academic historians and "narrow, tub-thumping jingoism". Evans stated that he agreed with Gove's statement about "the ruthless Social Darwinism of the German elites, the pitiless approach they took to occupation, their aggressively expansionist war aims and their scorn for the international order all made resistance more than justified."[41] Evans wrote: "He's [Gove] right about the elites, but misses the point that they weren't able to carry the majority of the German people with them; the largest political party, the Social Democrats, was opposed to annexations and had long been critical of the militarism of the elites".[41] He also ridiculed Gove’s suggestion that the First World War was “just” and fought by men "committed to defending the western liberal order," pointing out that Britain's ally Tsar Nicholas II was far more despotic than even the Kaiser and that 40% of British adult males were not allowed to vote.[41] Evans also wrote that Gove was wrong that only left-wing historians believe that Britain was wrong to fight Germany in World War I, noting that such conservative historians as Niall Ferguson and Alan Clark have been quite vocal in expressing the belief that Britain should have remained neutral in 1914.[41]
Criticism[edit]
In 2011, Evans became involved in a polemical exchange of letters with Peter Baldwin after agreeing with Leif Jerram (in Cosmopolitan Islanders [2009]), that students in Britain could find a richer selection of courses on the histories of other countries in British universities than students from other countries could in their own countries.[43]

Life[edit]
Evans was born at Woodford, Essex, of Welsh parentage, and educated at Forest School, Jesus College, Oxford (MA), and St Antony's College, Oxford (DPhil). In a 2004 interview, he stated that frequent visits to Wales during his childhood inspired both an interest in history and a sense of "otherness".[2] Evans has said that one reason he was drawn to the study modern German history in the late 1960s was his identification of parallels between the policies of the Vietnam War and German imperialism.[2] He admired the work of Fritz Fischer, whom he credits with inspiring him to study modern German history.[2]
Career as a historian[edit]
Evans first established his academic reputation with his publications on the Second Reich period of German history. In the early 1970s, Evans travelled to Germany to research his dissertation, a study of the feminist movement in Germany in the first half of the twentieth century.[2] It was later published as The Feminist Movement In Germany, 1894–1933 in 1976. Evans followed his study of German feminism by another book, The Feminists (1977) which traced the history of the feminist movement in North America, Australasia and Europe in the period 1840–1920.[2] A theme of both books was the weakness of German middle class culture, and its inordinate stress on such military values as hierarchy, deference, and obedience.[2] For this reason, Evans argued that both liberalism and feminism failed in Germany while flourishing elsewhere in the Western world[2]
Evans' main interest is social history and he is much influenced by the Annales School.[2] He largely agrees with Fischer that nineteenth century German social development paved the way for the rise of Nazi Germany, although Evans takes pains to point out that this outcome was not inevitable but one among many possibilities.[5] For Evans, the values of the 19th-century German middle class contained the already germinating seeds of National Socialism.[2]
Evans studied under Fischer in Hamburg in 1970–71, but he came to disagree with the "Bielefeld School" of historians who argued for the Sonderweg thesis that saw the roots of Germany’s political development in the first half of the 20th century in a "failed bourgeois revolution" in 1848. Following a contemporary trend that opposed the previous "great man" theory of history, Evans was a member of a group of young British historians who in the 1970s sought to examine German history during the Imperial period "from below".[6] These scholars highlighted "the importance of the grass-roots of politics and the everyday life and experience of ordinary people".[7] "History is about people, and their relationships. It’s about the perennial question of ‘how much free will do people have in building their own lives, and making a future," Evans has said.[8] He says he sought the creation of a "new school of people's history", which was a result of a trend that "has taken place across a whole range of historical subjects, political opinions, and methodological approaches and has been expressed in many different ways".[7] In 1978, as editor of a collection of essays by young British historians entitled Society And Politics In Wilhelmine Germany, he launched a critique of the ‘top-down’ approach of the Bielefeld School associated with Hans-Ulrich Wehler and Jürgen Kocka in regards to the Wilhelmine Germany. With the historians Geoff Eley and David Blackbourn, Evans instead emphasized the "self-mobilization from below" of key sociopolitical groups, as well as the modernity of National Socialism. In the 1980s, Evans organized ten international workshops on modern German social history at the University of East Anglia that did a good deal to refine these ideas, to pioneer research in this new historical field and, in six collections of papers, present it to an Anglophone readership.[9]
Among Evans' major research works are Death in Hamburg (1987), a study of class conflict and liberal government in nineteenth-century Germany using the example of Hamburg’s cholera epidemics and applying statistical methods to the exploration of social inequality in an industrializing society, and Rituals of Retribution (1996), a study of capital punishment in German history applying structural anthropological concepts to the rituals of public execution up to the mid-nineteenth century, and exploring the politics of the death penalty until its abolition by the GDR in 1987. In Death in Hamburg, Evans studied the cholera outbreak in Hamburg in 1892, which he concluded was caused by a failure in the medical system to safeguard against such an event.[2] Another study in German social history was Tales from the German Underworld (1998), where Evans traced the life stories of four German criminals in the late 19th century, namely a homeless woman, a forger, a prostitute and a con-man.[2] In Rituals of Retribution, Evans traced the history of capital punishment in Germany, and using the ideas of Michel Foucault, Philippe Ariès and Norbert Elias as his guide argued that opposition to the death penalty was strongest when liberalism was in the ascendancy, and support for capital punishment coincided when the right was in the ascendancy.[2] Thus, in Evans' view, capital punishment in Germany was never a mere matter of law being disinterestedly applied, but was rather a form of state power being exercised.[2] In addition, Evans examined such subjects as belief in witchcraft, torture, the last words of the executed, the psychology of mobs, varying forms of execution from the Thirty Years War to the 1980s, profiles of executioners, cruelty, and changing views towards the death penalty.[2]
In the 1980s, Evans was a conspicuous figure in the Historikerstreit, a controversy surrounding the historical work and theories of German historians Ernst Nolte, Joachim Fest, Andreas Hillgruber, Michael Stürmer, Hagen Schulze, Imanuel Geiss and Klaus Hildebrand, all of whom Evans considered German apologists attempting to white-wash the German past. Evans' views on the Historikerstreit were set forth in his 1989 book, In Hitler's Shadow. In that book Evans took issue with Nolte's acceptance of the Commissar Order as a legitimate military order; with Nolte's argument that the Einsatzgruppen massacres of Ukrainian Jews were a justifiable "preventive security" response to partisan attacks; his description (citing Viktor Suvorov) of Operation Barbarossa as a "preventative war" forced on Hitler by an impending Soviet attack; and his complaints that much scholarship on the Shoah expressed the views of "biased" Jewish historians.[10]
Evans characterized Nolte's statements as crossing the line into Holocaust denial[11] and he singled out Nolte's rationalization that since the victors write history, the only reason why Nazi Germany is seen as evil is because it lost the war.[12] Evans also denounced as an attempt to justify the Holocaust, Nolte's claim that Chaim Weizmann's letter of 3 September 1939, to Neville Chamberlain promising that the Jewish Agency would support the war effort constituted "Jewish declaration of war" on Germany that justified the pre-emptive internment of Jews in concentration camps.[13] In his 1989 book In Hitler's Shadown, Evans also criticised the intentionalist theories of Hillgruber and Hildebrand.[14] and criticized Stürmer's laudatory biography of Otto von Bismarck, with its excessive focus on political history and overlooking of social conditions, as a regression to the outmoded Great man theory of history.[15] For his part Evans praised Ian Kershaw, who wrote that "The road to Auschwitz was built by hate, but paved with indifference", namely that the German people were by and large indifferent towards the Holocaust.[16]
In Hitler's Shadow also criticized the historical writings of Robert Conquest, Hugh Thomas, Gertrude Himmelfarb, and Geoffrey Elton, whom he considered part of a neo-conservative historical trend.[17] In the same book, Evans endorsed Martin Broszat's call for the "historicization" of the Third Reich as a "rational approach to Nazism" and a "gain" to history.[18]
Evans' book In Defence of History defends the discipline of history against postmodernist skepticism of its value. The limitations of our ability to understand and learn from the past notwithstanding, it is still possible, he argues to understand much about past ways of life. Evans suggests that the spread since the mid-1979s of post-modernist theories, which declare that history is a construct and depict the rationalist tradition of the West as a form of oppression, had done much to increase the appeal of Holocaust denial.[19]
Role as an expert witness in Irving v. Lipstadt[edit]
See also: Irving v. Penguin Books and Lipstadt
Evans is probably best known to the general public in the role of an expert witness for the defence in the high-profile libel case of David Irving against the American historian Deborah Lipstadt in 2000, Irving v. Lipstadt. Lipstadt was sued for libel by Irving, after she referred to him as a "Holocaust denier" and "an ardent follower of Adolf Hitler" in her 1993 book Denying the Holocaust. Lipstadt further accused Irving of "distorting evidence and manipulating documents to serve his own purposes...[as well as] skewing documents and misrepresenting data in order to reach historically untenable conclusions, particularly those that exonerate Hitler."[20]
Evans acted as an expert witness for the defence in the case. Starting in the autumn of 1997, Evans, along with Thomas Skelton-Robinson and Nik Wachsmann, two of his PhD students, closely examined Irving's work.[21] They found instances in which he had used forged documents, disregarded contrary evidence, selectively quoted historical documents out of context and mis-cited historical records, thus misrepresenting historical evidence in order to support his prejudices.[22][23] Evans subsequently proved to be a powerful witness in Lipstadt's ultimately successful defence. In his expert witness report he wrote:

"Not one of [Irving's] books, speeches or articles, not one paragraph, not one sentence in any of them, can be taken on trust as an accurate representation of its historical subject. All of them are completely worthless as history, because Irving cannot be trusted anywhere, in any of them, to give a reliable account of what he is talking or writing about. ... if we mean by historian someone who is concerned to discover the truth about the past, and to give as accurate a representation of it as possible, then Irving is not a historian".[24]

The cross-examination of Evans by Irving was noted for the high degree of personal dislike between the two men.[25] Such was the degree of dislike that Irving challenged Evans on very minor points, such as Evans doubting the fairness of a 1938 German plebiscite in which the Nazi regime received 98.8% of the vote.[26] A subject that much engaged Irving and Evans in a debate was a memo by the Chief of the Reich Chancellery Hans Lammers to the Reich Justice Minister Franz Schlegelberger in which Lammers wrote that Hitler ordered him to put the "Jewish Question" on the "back-burner" until after the war.[27] Evans chose to accept the interpretation of the memo put forward by Eberhard Jäckel in the 1970s;[28] Irving chose to interpret the memo literally and taunted Evans by saying, "It is a terrible problem, is it not that we are faced with this tantalizing plate of crumbs and morsels of what should have provided the final smoking gun, and nowhere the whole way through the archives do we find even one item that we do not have to interpret or read between the lines of, but we do have in the same chain of evidence documents which...quite clearly specifically show Hitler intervening in the other sense?"[29] In response, Evans stated "No, I do not accept that at all. It is because you want to interpret euphemisms as being literal, and that is what the whole problem is. Every time there is an euphemism, Mr. Irving ... or a camouflage piece of statement or language about Madagascar, you want to treat it as the literal truth, because it serves your purpose of trying to exculpate Hitler. That is part of ... the way you manipulate and distort the documents."[30]
In a 2001 interview, Evans described to the Canadian columnist Robert Fulford his impression of Irving after being cross-examined by him as: "He [Irving] was a bit like a dim student who didn't listen. If he didn't get the answer he wanted, he just repeated the question."[31] His findings and his account of the trial were published in his 2001 book Lying About Hitler: History, Holocaust, And The David Irving Trial, which was published as Telling Lies About Hitler in the United States in 2002. The High Court rejected Irving’s libel suit and awarded costs to the defence.
Evans' involvement in the trial was included in the 2016 film Denial, in which he was played by British actor John Sessions.[32]
The Third Reich Trilogy[edit]




Richard J. Evans (2016)


Main article: The Third Reich Trilogy
Between 2003 and 2008, Evans published a three-volume history of the Third Reich. Drawing on years of experience as a leading scholar of German history, Evans produced what some historians call the most extensive and comprehensive history of the rise and fall of Hitler’s regime ever produced by a single scholar. Reviewer Peter Mansoor says, "The Third Reich at War is a superb piece of scholarship that is likely to emerge as the definitive account of life and death inside Hitler's blood soaked Third Reich."[33] Robert Citino says, "Read together, the three volumes constitute a remarkably comprehensive treatment of the origins, course, and death of the Hitler regime, and are likely to be standard works for a long time to come."[34] Ed Ericson says:

Evans masterfully interweaves testimony that has come to light in the intervening decades with learned judgments from hundreds of authors to create a balanced and thoughtful narrative. This book, therefore, will assuredly become the definitive work on The Third Reich at War.[35]

The first volume, The Coming of the Third Reich: How the Nazis Destroyed Democracy and Seized Power in Germany (published by Penguin in 2003), shows how a country torn apart by the First World War, the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, hyperinflation and the Great Depression moved towards an increasingly authoritarian solution. The book explains in detail Adolf Hitler's appointment as Chancellor in January 1933 and how the Nazis transformed Germany into a one party dictatorship. The first volume featured highly favorable words of praise from Evans's friend, Ian Kershaw on its cover.[2]
The second volume, The Third Reich in Power, 1933 - 1939: How the Nazis Won Over the Hearts and Minds of a Nation (published by Penguin in 2005), covers the years of Nazi rule between 1933 and 1939. The final chapter examines the road to the Second World War, but the real focus is on life inside Nazi Germany. One of the great strengths of this volume is the way Evans allows small stories of key individuals to illustrate many of the key social, economic and cultural events of the period. Richard Overy described this instalment of the trilogy as "magisterial."[36]
The third volume, The Third Reich at War: How the Nazis Led Germany from Conquest to Disaster (published by Penguin in 2008), looks at major developments from 1939 to 1945, including the key battles of the Second World War, a vivid, moving and detailed account of the mass murder enacted during the Holocaust and Hitler's dramatic downfall in Berlin in 1945. In an October 2008 review of the third volume for The Times, best-selling historian Antony Beevor writes: "With this third volume, Richard Evans has accomplished a masterpiece of historical scholarship ... [He] has produced the best and most up-to-date synthesis of the huge work carried out on the subject over the past decades."[37] Aspects of it, however, were sharply criticised by Tim Snyder.[38]
Walter Reich, former Director of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D. C., states about the third-volume of the trilogy,The Third Reich at War, "If any work of accurate history has a chance to correct the distortions of public memory, this is it.".[39]
Regius Professor of Modern History[edit]
In 2008, Evans was appointed Regius Professor of Modern History at Cambridge University. (In 2010 the word "Modern" was removed from the title by royal decree). The post is a royal appointment in the gift of the Prime Minister of the day and dates back to 1724. Previous holders of the title have included John Dalberg-Acton (1895), Herbert Butterfield (1963), Geoffrey Elton (1983), Patrick Collinson (1988) and Quentin Skinner (1998). Evans is the first historian to have to apply for the post and be interviewed by a Board of Electors, including Cambridge's Vice-Chancellor, Alison Richard, and representatives of the history faculty and the university, as well as external assessors from Yale, Harvard, Oxford and London. The board selected a shortlist of four, each of whom was asked to give a presentation to the entire Cambridge history faculty. The shortlist of four was then reduced to two, whom the board interviewed, resulting in the board's recommendation of Evans to the Prime Minister and in the issue of a Royal Warrant for his appointment.[40] As well as serving as Regius Professor, Evans has served as chairman of the history faculty since October 2008; his term of office ended on 30 September 2010.
Evans is used to combining administration with research. At Birkbeck College, London, where he worked before Cambridge, he acted as Master of the college when Baroness Blackstone left suddenly to become Tony Blair's first higher education minister. On 27 January 2010 he was elected to the position of President of Wolfson College, Cambridge, to take up office on 1 October 2010.
TV and media appearances[edit]
Evans has appeared regularly on a number of TV documentaries related to Adolf Hitler and the Third Reich. He recently appeared on a major TV documentary on the History Channel which examined the Valkyrie bomb plot against Hitler in July 1944, which was the subject of a Hollywood film starring Tom Cruise. As of 2014, he has made 5 appearances on the BBC Radio 4 programme In Our Time.
He also appears regularly on "Start the Week" and often writes reviews of history books on his specialist era in major newspapers and periodicals. He is also a noted lecturer and gives numerous keynote lectures at international conferences around the world and also at student conferences as part of his remit to take history to a wider audience beyond academia. He is known as an excellent public speaker and often appears regularly as a keynote speaker at universities and schools and at conferences for academics and students around the world.
Debate with the British education secretary[edit]
In 2014, Evans was involved in a debate with Michael Gove, the British education secretary, about the content and style of history teaching and the way that the curriculum is structured and how the First World War should be portrayed.[41] Writing in the Daily Mail, Gove accused Evans in particular of distorting history with regard to Britain's role in the war.[42] Evans countered that Gove was engaging in the defamation of academic historians and "narrow, tub-thumping jingoism". Evans stated that he agreed with Gove's statement about "the ruthless Social Darwinism of the German elites, the pitiless approach they took to occupation, their aggressively expansionist war aims and their scorn for the international order all made resistance more than justified."[41] Evans wrote: "He's [Gove] right about the elites, but misses the point that they weren't able to carry the majority of the German people with them; the largest political party, the Social Democrats, was opposed to annexations and had long been critical of the militarism of the elites".[41] He also ridiculed Gove’s suggestion that the First World War was “just” and fought by men "committed to defending the western liberal order," pointing out that Britain's ally Tsar Nicholas II was far more despotic than even the Kaiser and that 40% of British adult males were not allowed to vote.[41] Evans also wrote that Gove was wrong that only left-wing historians believe that Britain was wrong to fight Germany in World War I, noting that such conservative historians as Niall Ferguson and Alan Clark have been quite vocal in expressing the belief that Britain should have remained neutral in 1914.[41]
Criticism[edit]
In 2011, Evans became involved in a polemical exchange of letters with Peter Baldwin after agreeing with Leif Jerram (in Cosmopolitan Islanders [2009]), that students in Britain could find a richer selection of courses on the histories of other countries in British universities than students from other countries could in their own countries.[43]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Overview



The final volume in Richard J. Evans's masterly trilogy on the history of Nazi Germany traces the rise and fall of German military might, the mobilization of a 'people's community' to serve a war of conquest, and Hitler's campaign of racial subjugation and genocideAlready hailed as 'a masterpiece' (William Grimes in The New York Times) and 'the most comprehensive history' of the Third Reich? (Ian Kershaw), this epic trilogy reaches its terrifying climax in this volume.Evans interweaves a broad narrative of the war's progress with viscerally affecting personal testimony from a wide range of people-from generals to front-line soldiers, from Hitler Youth activists to middle-class housewives. The Third Reich at War lays bare the dynamics of a nation more deeply immersed in war than any society before or since. Fresh insights into the conflict's great events are here, from the invasion of Poland to the Battle of Stalingrad to Hitler's suicide in the bunker. But just as important is the re-creation of the daily experience of ordinary Germans in wartime, staggering under pressure from Allied bombing and their own government's mounting demands upon them. At the center of the book is the Nazi extermination of Europe's Jews, set in the context of Hitler's genocidal plans for the racial restructuring of Europe.Blending narrative, description and analysis, The Third Reich at War creates an engrossing picture-at once sweeping and precise-of a society rushing headlong to self-destruction and taking much of Europe with it. It is the culmination of a historical masterwork that will remain the most authoritative work on Nazi Germany for years to come.

Editorial Reviews


From the Publisher
"…Masterful….Evans demonstrates a fluent style and a sweeping grasp of the Third Reich's history and of the enormous historical literature….Evans narrates the Reich's end in gripping fashion as the Allies closed in on Germany. Evans's fellow historians as well as a broader public will read this work, not quite with pleasure, for there is little joy in this story, but with admiration for the author's narrative powers."―Publisher's Weekly, starred review

5.0 out of 5 starsAnd much more besidesByMagnitudeon November 3, 2016Evans has written what will probably be the defining history of the Third Reich in the war years for some time. I've read all three of the books in this series, and this was the best of the three. It's difficult to summarize adequately, and it certainly deserves a second read. I know a lot about the military events described here, and this book sort of fills out the German experience built on an outline of those events.Evans casts a wide view at many aspects of German life during the war years, ranging from the careers of musicians to everyday soldiers. Central, though, to the whole thing is the inter-relationship of Nazi crimes against humanity and how antisemitism, especially, touched every aspect of German society.Evans demonstrates solidly how preparation for war was a driving force in German economic measures immediately before the war. The Nazis were aiming to create a racial utopia, and exacted this in a number of murderous policies. Evans tries to be even-handed to all victims (including the disabled, the Gypsies, homosexuals, and others). That said, it becomes clear, from beginning to end, how motivated the Nazis were by antisemitism. In this sense, the Holocaust is part of the wider war, a war against the Jewish "world-enemy." Among his many statements, Hitler's last political manifesto makes this unequivocally clear. It was his parting message to the world, and perhaps best sums up his meaning and legacy.Through it all, I found Evans to be appropriately dispassionate as he related the grim details. Too, he has an eye for the human touch, weaving in diaries from representative, everyday "characters" throughout this journey. Beyond these diaries, he relies a lot on a close reading of the German security reports from the time, which used interviews and overheard conversations to give the higher-ups a picture of what Germans were really thinking. Through these, Evans manages to inject some humor into this narrative. The security officers were careful to record anti-regime jokes, which to someone reading this book provide a bit of much-needed levity.These jokes, diaries, and other accounts show that not all Germans were marching along with the Nazis, especially as the war went on. The Germans, according to Evans, did learn about the mass killings of Jews and others, and they felt guilty about what was being done in their name. As a result, the Allied bombing seemed to some to be a just retribution. In any event, these were two key developments that caused many Germans to look at the regime skeptically. The Nazis were murdering innocent people, and the Nazis couldn't defend their own people in a war they started. Resistance movements were small and weren't very effective, by and large. The Gestapo managed to stop most of these movements. Even the military bomb plotters didn't achieve much, in the end.I can only give you a taste of what awaits you here. I'd say that this is a good book for someone who wants to understand what Nazi Germany was about in the war years. It's less useful as a chronology of the military side of things (Evans relies heavily on Gerhard Weinberg's "A World at Arms"). If you're like me and know a lot about the military aspects, but want to understand what the Nazis were fighting for politically, this is a comprehensive account. I'd also say that this is probably the one volume to read, and that one could start the trilogy here, to see if you like his style and analysis. If not, readers should get a lot out of this one volume; Evans also refers back to earlier events as background.The Kindle version had the standard amount of typos. Words that had diacritical marks (such as any word with an umlaut) got garbled in the Kindle edition. Also, there are plenty of maps, but most are too small in the Kindle format to be helpful. In any event, none of this should impact reading; it didn't mine.

3.0 out of 5 starsWell-written book spoiled by quirky spelling.ByBirckon July 20, 2015This is exactly what it claims-a well-written detailing of the mass murder committed by the German government beginning in 1936 .The roll-call of statistics is relieved by occasional individual diary entries from members of Hitler's inner circle, the OKW, Wehrmacht soldiers,  and German citizens. I was hoping for more of the man-or-woman-in-the-street viewpoint, but the book does give a solid overview of Germans' attitudes toward the horrors happening, secretly, around them.One annoying quirk I found in this book may be a flaw introduced by the Kindle digitizing process: I haven't checked on a hardcopy of the book, but the Kindle text treats proper names weirdly, whether names of places or persons- any name or word that includes an umlaut (ä, ö, ü) over a vowel loses the vowel and the umlaut winds up over the preceding consonant. The German name for Munich, "München", for example, comes out "Mnchen", with the umlaut over the M. The word "Veränderung" would be rendered as "Vernderung". This peculiarity leads occasionally to such absurdities as names which normally begin with an umlauted vowel beginning instead with a blank space with an umlaut over it, because there is no preceding consonant over which to place the umlaut. This is not a normally-accepted practice in the German language. There are no umlauts over consonants, and omitting the vowel is confusing. In many cases, of course, the vowel is obvious to a german-speaker, but if the name is unfamiliar one is left in the dark. Who? What? Huh? True, the book is written in English, but there are enough specific references to people and places in German to make this peculiarity irritating.

    See all 147 reviews5.0 out of 5 starsAnd much more besidesByMagnitudeon November 3, 2016Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseEvans has written what will probably be the defining history of the Third Reich in the war years for some time. I've read all three of the books in this series, and this was the best of the three. It's difficult to summarize adequately, and it certainly deserves a second read. I know a lot about the military events described here, and this book sort of fills out the German experience built on an outline of those events.Evans casts a wide view at many aspects of German life during the war years, ranging from the careers of musicians to everyday soldiers. Central, though, to the whole thing is the inter-relationship of Nazi crimes against humanity and how antisemitism, especially, touched every aspect of German society.Evans demonstrates solidly how preparation for war was a driving force in German economic measures immediately before the war. The Nazis were aiming to create a racial utopia, and exacted this in a number of murderous policies. Evans tries to be even-handed to all victims (including the disabled, the Gypsies, homosexuals, and others). That said, it becomes clear, from beginning to end, how motivated the Nazis were by antisemitism. In this sense, the Holocaust is part of the wider war, a war against the Jewish "world-enemy." Among his many statements, Hitler's last political manifesto makes this unequivocally clear. It was his parting message to the world, and perhaps best sums up his meaning and legacy.Through it all, I found Evans to be appropriately dispassionate as he related the grim details.

The author describes the steps adopted by the Nazi State in war, since the invasion of Poland. Special attention is paid to the eugenic ideology of Nazism. The mass murder of gypsies, jew and mental sickness are referred. The final solution of the Jewish question produced the murder by german troops of 5.5 million jews (6 million with the help of german's allies). The book gave special attention to it. The war economy and the war machine in german are described and confronted with the allies effort in war time. The main battles in the west and east fronts are mentioned by the author, in order to show the german concept of total war. Interesting and useful remarks are given about the morality of the Third Reich as it appears in literature, movies, theater, radio and arts. In the final chapters, contemplating the defeat of Nazism, the author mentioned the suicides of many nazi officials and the judgments of others. The legacy of the Third Reich, so argues Richard Evans, consists in revealing the possibilities of totalitarianism. One must learn with history.0Comment|

Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsThe Third and Final ReichByChristian Schlecton April 25, 2017Format: Hardcover|Verified PurchaseA well-researched, well-written  history of Adolf Hitler's Germany at war. Professor Evans deserves all the honors he has received for this and the preceding two volumes of his magnificent trilogy on the Third Reich.The story here is of Germany from 1939 to 1945; its leadership, its military, its people, its economy, the Holocaust, its final defeat. The "why" of it all.This is not a book covering other combatants or theaters of war, such as the Pacific. It, in other words, is not a full history of World War II.While it took me time to finish all three books, it was well worth the effort. It serves to remind one of terrible events that occurred not that long past, given the grand sweep of history, It also puts into perspective, with all current geopolitical strife, that we live in a much better and safer world than that experienced by Europeans in the last, and most bloody of centuries.0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.4.0 out of 5 starsNot just another book on Hitler and World War IIBywilliam mathewson August 15, 2013Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseEvans puts a unique twist on the German experience in WWII; the military history, if one wants it is there in the foundation of the scholarship of the Freiburg military experts, but the war was in many ways a foregone conclusion as Evans shows; the Third Reich's priority was its drive for a New Order of social and racial cleansing in which it must be said the military effort often played a second fiddle in the orchestration of a 'final solution' to first the Polish question, then the Jewish question, the Serb question, the gypsies and more broadly social alien questions fused together in a Nazi modernist ideology of progressive and positivist social engineering to eliminate what the Nazis and their allies in government saw as social smut. Evans orchestrates a vast amount of scholarship from others into very startling and readable form. One can read this third volume of his trilogy on the Third Reich and come away with a sense of intellectual satisfaction, that he has explained what happened and what mattered. The publishers should, however, be impaled for recurrent screw ups with nearly all (but not all!) foreign accent marks, which somehow wind up blemishing the text.0Comment|

Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsMagnificentByCJAon October 11, 2010Format: Hardcover|Verified PurchaseThis is the last of three volumes that together stand as the definitive history of the Third Reich.  The ultimate question Evans struggles with, and that we all struggle with, is the extent to which ordinary Germans were complicit in the Reich.  Given the extent of the slaughter on the Eastern Front, the network of concentration camps, and the use of 8 to 12 million persons for slave labor, the Nazi's crimes necessarily required the active and enthusiastic participation by hundreds of thousands if not millions of Germans.  There was no problem enlisting the necessary fanatics.  Nor should we be surprised, knowing what we know about human nature, that a significant minority of persons are delighted to do evil once the ordinary constraints of civilization break down during wartime.But what about the majority of Germans?  What about the 63% of Germans who did not vote for the Nazis in 1933?  What about the vast majority of Germans whoe dreaded the coming of the war and who were unenthusiastic when Hitler renewed the fight with the invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941?It is clear that no one opposed the brutal destruction of Poland in 1939. This is hardly to Germany's credit and does indicate the extent to which German's viewed expansion in middle Europe as their birthright -- an authoritarian and imperial consensus that Hitler used to gain support for his regime and to give it legitimacy.Evans argues that at some level of generality, all Germans were aware of the crimes of the regime.  Clearly, people were being enslaved and stories about round ups of Jews and other civilians on the Eastern Front were making the rounds.  At best, Germans could claim "deniability."  They arguably did not know about the worst crimes.  But the slave labor and disappearances of the Jews and the racism of the regime were there for all to see.  The enthusiastic support of such radical policies by a fanatical base minority and the acquiescence of the majority made the whole nation complicit.  Evans argues that by the time the Russians were at the gates in 1945 and Goebbels argued for a last ditch stand, the Germans were resigned to their fate.  Ordinary Germans had a guilt complex by then -- they knew this was payback for what the fanatics had done on the Eastern Front.  This guilt, and the ability of the Germans to succeed economically in the 1950s under a Democracy (in contrast to the Weimar experience), finally solved the "German Problem" that plagued the Twentieth Century and allowed Germany to become a peace-loving nation.Violence was at the core of the Third Reich, Evans argues.  The majority of Germans refused to see this, but were complicit with the regime and were responsible for the consequences.  It is foolish to talk about whether Hitler could have won the war by invading Britain or by invading the Middle East full scale instead of invading Russia.  The latter course would have resolved the resource problem, but it was never an option.  The Nazis took their primitive ideology quite seriously.  There had to be a death struggle with the Russians so that the most superior race (presumably the Germans) would emerge supreme.  To the surprise of the majority of Germans, the Nazis were always quite serious about this ideology.Despite the Nazi's brutal tactics in suppressing subject peoples, and despite wide scale collaboration, effective resitance did emerge.  This was particularly the case in the East where it became very clear to the subject peoples that they had nothing to lose.  This resistance encourages one to think that even had Hitler won militarily, the regime was inherently unstable in the long run and would have been doomed by a deadly and committed insurgency.By the end of the war, the Germans themselves are completely subjugated.  They survived on starvation rations, both sexes worked long hours, and the young and old alike were drafted into the army.  Clearly, Hitler's regime was able to mobilize complete support and sacrifice despite the reservations of a majority of Germans.The lesson I take from all this is that there is nothing particularly unique about the Germans when it comes to being complicit in the worst evil.  The story of the Third Reich is the story of human nature, and not a pretty one.0Comment|

Lindseyon April 19, 2017Format: Hardcover|Verified PurchaseBeautifully detailed and very well written sequence of the internal events of Nazi Germany during WWII. At times, the clear details of the vicious and numbing treatment of the Jews and Gypsies and the Russian Prisoners of War becomes overwhelming but learning about all of it is essential if we are ever to avoid repeating anything of the kind ever again.Very highly recommended.0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

The organization and coverage of all the pieces to this world event is truly amazing.  I looked him up to see how he is received from his peers and sure enough, Evans is highly regarded and considered to be the source on Germany and what happen.  The Holocaust is respectfully and courageously addressed in a very balanced manner, both for facts and insight. All three are a must for serious understanding.0Comment|

Gensbygelon October 16, 2015Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseThis trilogy is amazing, and stands out from the rest of histories of the 3rd Reich: The author gives a clear and convincing account of not only the facts (some of them quite newly discovered), but, most importantly, about the social and psychological foundations of the Nazi dictatorship.Unspoken, but implied is the warning that this might happen, anywhere, at any time, and is chilling when one looks at what is going on in politics in the USA, right now.Only flaw in the trilogy is the amount of printing errors, as well as syntax errors, which make some sentences unintelligible - not good editing....0Comment|

MacCallumon December 25, 2011Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseThere are very few stories as complex and compelling as the rise and fall of the Nazi regime in Germany during World War II.  Richard Evans' final volume in his three-part history of the Third Reich is an absorbing conclusion to the earlier two volumes which told the story of Hitler's rise to power and his rapid remilitarization of Germany in the 1930's.Adolph Hitler, the Leader of the German nation, seemed unclear in the war's aims as it started.  At first, the war seemed to be about expanding the living space for the German people, although the geography of Europe seemed to present no threat or, for that matter, little opportunity to Germany.  Rather quickly, however, the goal of the war transformed into its larger, and more ghastly, form: the eradication of Jews throughout Europe.  How one of the most civilized people on the planet could have been complicit with this hideous program, which ultimately led to the death of more than six million Jews, is beyond comprehension.Evans tells the story of the war in familiar terms.  He deals with the bloody conquest of Poland, dealing death and destruction on an ancient, innocent people, and then he tells the hideous story of the German army as it turns westward, finishing off a crumbling France in a month and a half.  The performance of the French army, superior in many ways to the German forces, was close to inexplicable but the fall of France nevertheless was complete and humiliating.Evans goes far deeper into the German culture and psyche than most traditional accounts of the war.  One is left, at the end of this, with no good rationale as to how a people who had so much economic, cultural and social momentum during the 1930's could have allowed such an enormously disturbed individual lead the country into the darkness of the war.  The history of the German military campaigns is well known and Evans deals with these battles with a broad brush but, even though familiar, his account is absorbing.  The battle with Russia, beginning in the late summer of 1941, culminated in the destruction of the large parts of the German army in its assault on Stalingrad a year later.The German people were, by and large, thrilled by the early military successes but increasingly their regard for Hitler weakened as the costs of the war became evident.  Allied air forces began a relentless campaign of bombing German cities and industrial centers and this took its toll, at first gradually and then more rapidly, as Germans realized that the war was becoming unwinnable.The contribution of Evans' final volume in a three part series that runs close to 2,000 pages is to dig deeper into the German mind as it controlled most of Europe for at least three years.  In the end, one is left with the thought that the reasons for Germans to have conducted such a devastating and cruel war remain inscrutable.  It took a charismatic and deranged leader to start the machine rolling but it required a willing population to support such a disastrous war.Evans writing is direct and relentlessly factual.  The book is long, more than 750 pages, but it is such a superb story, with a different point of view than the many thousands of books on the military aspects of the war.  It is well worth the effort to understand not solely what happened but why it happened.0Comment|

Life[edit]
Evans was born at Woodford, Essex, of Welsh parentage, and educated at Forest School, Jesus College, Oxford (MA), and St Antony's College, Oxford (DPhil). In a 2004 interview, he stated that frequent visits to Wales during his childhood inspired both an interest in history and a sense of "otherness".[2] Evans has said that one reason he was drawn to the study modern German history in the late 1960s was his identification of parallels between the policies of the Vietnam War and German imperialism.[2] He admired the work of Fritz Fischer, whom he credits with inspiring him to study modern German history.[2]
Career as a historian[edit]
Evans first established his academic reputation with his publications on the Second Reich period of German history. In the early 1970s, Evans travelled to Germany to research his dissertation, a study of the feminist movement in Germany in the first half of the twentieth century.[2] It was later published as The Feminist Movement In Germany, 1894–1933 in 1976. Evans followed his study of German feminism by another book, The Feminists (1977) which traced the history of the feminist movement in North America, Australasia and Europe in the period 1840–1920.[2] A theme of both books was the weakness of German middle class culture, and its inordinate stress on such military values as hierarchy, deference, and obedience.[2] For this reason, Evans argued that both liberalism and feminism failed in Germany while flourishing elsewhere in the Western world[2]
Evans' main interest is social history and he is much influenced by the Annales School.[2] He largely agrees with Fischer that nineteenth century German social development paved the way for the rise of Nazi Germany, although Evans takes pains to point out that this outcome was not inevitable but one among many possibilities.[5] For Evans, the values of the 19th-century German middle class contained the already germinating seeds of National Socialism.[2]
Evans studied under Fischer in Hamburg in 1970–71, but he came to disagree with the "Bielefeld School" of historians who argued for the Sonderweg thesis that saw the roots of Germany’s political development in the first half of the 20th century in a "failed bourgeois revolution" in 1848. Following a contemporary trend that opposed the previous "great man" theory of history, Evans was a member of a group of young British historians who in the 1970s sought to examine German history during the Imperial period "from below".[6] These scholars highlighted "the importance of the grass-roots of politics and the everyday life and experience of ordinary people".[7] "History is about people, and their relationships. It’s about the perennial question of ‘how much free will do people have in building their own lives, and making a future," Evans has said.[8] He says he sought the creation of a "new school of people's history", which was a result of a trend that "has taken place across a whole range of historical subjects, political opinions, and methodological approaches and has been expressed in many different ways".[7] In 1978, as editor of a collection of essays by young British historians entitled Society And Politics In Wilhelmine Germany, he launched a critique of the ‘top-down’ approach of the Bielefeld School associated with Hans-Ulrich Wehler and Jürgen Kocka in regards to the Wilhelmine Germany. With the historians Geoff Eley and David Blackbourn, Evans instead emphasized the "self-mobilization from below" of key sociopolitical groups, as well as the modernity of National Socialism. In the 1980s, Evans organized ten international workshops on modern German social history at the University of East Anglia that did a good deal to refine these ideas, to pioneer research in this new historical field and, in six collections of papers, present it to an Anglophone readership.[9]
Among Evans' major research works are Death in Hamburg (1987), a study of class conflict and liberal government in nineteenth-century Germany using the example of Hamburg’s cholera epidemics and applying statistical methods to the exploration of social inequality in an industrializing society, and Rituals of Retribution (1996), a study of capital punishment in German history applying structural anthropological concepts to the rituals of public execution up to the mid-nineteenth century, and exploring the politics of the death penalty until its abolition by the GDR in 1987. In Death in Hamburg, Evans studied the cholera outbreak in Hamburg in 1892, which he concluded was caused by a failure in the medical system to safeguard against such an event.[2] Another study in German social history was Tales from the German Underworld (1998), where Evans traced the life stories of four German criminals in the late 19th century, namely a homeless woman, a forger, a prostitute and a con-man.[2] In Rituals of Retribution, Evans traced the history of capital punishment in Germany, and using the ideas of Michel Foucault, Philippe Ariès and Norbert Elias as his guide argued that opposition to the death penalty was strongest when liberalism was in the ascendancy, and support for capital punishment coincided when the right was in the ascendancy.[2] Thus, in Evans' view, capital punishment in Germany was never a mere matter of law being disinterestedly applied, but was rather a form of state power being exercised.[2] In addition, Evans examined such subjects as belief in witchcraft, torture, the last words of the executed, the psychology of mobs, varying forms of execution from the Thirty Years War to the 1980s, profiles of executioners, cruelty, and changing views towards the death penalty.[2]
In the 1980s, Evans was a conspicuous figure in the Historikerstreit, a controversy surrounding the historical work and theories of German historians Ernst Nolte, Joachim Fest, Andreas Hillgruber, Michael Stürmer, Hagen Schulze, Imanuel Geiss and Klaus Hildebrand, all of whom Evans considered German apologists attempting to white-wash the German past. Evans' views on the Historikerstreit were set forth in his 1989 book, In Hitler's Shadow. In that book Evans took issue with Nolte's acceptance of the Commissar Order as a legitimate military order; with Nolte's argument that the Einsatzgruppen massacres of Ukrainian Jews were a justifiable "preventive security" response to partisan attacks; his description (citing Viktor Suvorov) of Operation Barbarossa as a "preventative war" forced on Hitler by an impending Soviet attack; and his complaints that much scholarship on the Shoah expressed the views of "biased" Jewish historians.[10]
Evans characterized Nolte's statements as crossing the line into Holocaust denial[11] and he singled out Nolte's rationalization that since the victors write history, the only reason why Nazi Germany is seen as evil is because it lost the war.[12] Evans also denounced as an attempt to justify the Holocaust, Nolte's claim that Chaim Weizmann's letter of 3 September 1939, to Neville Chamberlain promising that the Jewish Agency would support the war effort constituted "Jewish declaration of war" on Germany that justified the pre-emptive internment of Jews in concentration camps.[13] In his 1989 book In Hitler's Shadown, Evans also criticised the intentionalist theories of Hillgruber and Hildebrand.[14] and criticized Stürmer's laudatory biography of Otto von Bismarck, with its excessive focus on political history and overlooking of social conditions, as a regression to the outmoded Great man theory of history.[15] For his part Evans praised Ian Kershaw, who wrote that "The road to Auschwitz was built by hate, but paved with indifference", namely that the German people were by and large indifferent towards the Holocaust.[16]
In Hitler's Shadow also criticized the historical writings of Robert Conquest, Hugh Thomas, Gertrude Himmelfarb, and Geoffrey Elton, whom he considered part of a neo-conservative historical trend.[17] In the same book, Evans endorsed Martin Broszat's call for the "historicization" of the Third Reich as a "rational approach to Nazism" and a "gain" to history.[18]
Evans' book In Defence of History defends the discipline of history against postmodernist skepticism of its value. The limitations of our ability to understand and learn from the past notwithstanding, it is still possible, he argues to understand much about past ways of life. Evans suggests that the spread since the mid-1979s of post-modernist theories, which declare that history is a construct and depict the rationalist tradition of the West as a form of oppression, had done much to increase the appeal of Holocaust denial.[19]
Role as an expert witness in Irving v. Lipstadt[edit]
See also: Irving v. Penguin Books and Lipstadt
Evans is probably best known to the general public in the role of an expert witness for the defence in the high-profile libel case of David Irving against the American historian Deborah Lipstadt in 2000, Irving v. Lipstadt. Lipstadt was sued for libel by Irving, after she referred to him as a "Holocaust denier" and "an ardent follower of Adolf Hitler" in her 1993 book Denying the Holocaust. Lipstadt further accused Irving of "distorting evidence and manipulating documents to serve his own purposes...[as well as] skewing documents and misrepresenting data in order to reach historically untenable conclusions, particularly those that exonerate Hitler."[20]
Evans acted as an expert witness for the defence in the case. Starting in the autumn of 1997, Evans, along with Thomas Skelton-Robinson and Nik Wachsmann, two of his PhD students, closely examined Irving's work.[21] They found instances in which he had used forged documents, disregarded contrary evidence, selectively quoted historical documents out of context and mis-cited historical records, thus misrepresenting historical evidence in order to support his prejudices.[22][23] Evans subsequently proved to be a powerful witness in Lipstadt's ultimately successful defence. In his expert witness report he wrote:

"Not one of [Irving's] books, speeches or articles, not one paragraph, not one sentence in any of them, can be taken on trust as an accurate representation of its historical subject. All of them are completely worthless as history, because Irving cannot be trusted anywhere, in any of them, to give a reliable account of what he is talking or writing about. ... if we mean by historian someone who is concerned to discover the truth about the past, and to give as accurate a representation of it as possible, then Irving is not a historian".[24]

The cross-examination of Evans by Irving was noted for the high degree of personal dislike between the two men.[25] Such was the degree of dislike that Irving challenged Evans on very minor points, such as Evans doubting the fairness of a 1938 German plebiscite in which the Nazi regime received 98.8% of the vote.[26] A subject that much engaged Irving and Evans in a debate was a memo by the Chief of the Reich Chancellery Hans Lammers to the Reich Justice Minister Franz Schlegelberger in which Lammers wrote that Hitler ordered him to put the "Jewish Question" on the "back-burner" until after the war.[27] Evans chose to accept the interpretation of the memo put forward by Eberhard Jäckel in the 1970s;[28] Irving chose to interpret the memo literally and taunted Evans by saying, "It is a terrible problem, is it not that we are faced with this tantalizing plate of crumbs and morsels of what should have provided the final smoking gun, and nowhere the whole way through the archives do we find even one item that we do not have to interpret or read between the lines of, but we do have in the same chain of evidence documents which...quite clearly specifically show Hitler intervening in the other sense?"[29] In response, Evans stated "No, I do not accept that at all. It is because you want to interpret euphemisms as being literal, and that is what the whole problem is. Every time there is an euphemism, Mr. Irving ... or a camouflage piece of statement or language about Madagascar, you want to treat it as the literal truth, because it serves your purpose of trying to exculpate Hitler. That is part of ... the way you manipulate and distort the documents."[30]
In a 2001 interview, Evans described to the Canadian columnist Robert Fulford his impression of Irving after being cross-examined by him as: "He [Irving] was a bit like a dim student who didn't listen. If he didn't get the answer he wanted, he just repeated the question."[31] His findings and his account of the trial were published in his 2001 book Lying About Hitler: History, Holocaust, And The David Irving Trial, which was published as Telling Lies About Hitler in the United States in 2002. The High Court rejected Irving’s libel suit and awarded costs to the defence.
Evans' involvement in the trial was included in the 2016 film Denial, in which he was played by British actor John Sessions.[32]
The Third Reich Trilogy[edit]




Richard J. Evans (2016)


Main article: The Third Reich Trilogy
Between 2003 and 2008, Evans published a three-volume history of the Third Reich. Drawing on years of experience as a leading scholar of German history, Evans produced what some historians call the most extensive and comprehensive history of the rise and fall of Hitler’s regime ever produced by a single scholar. Reviewer Peter Mansoor says, "The Third Reich at War is a superb piece of scholarship that is likely to emerge as the definitive account of life and death inside Hitler's blood soaked Third Reich."[33] Robert Citino says, "Read together, the three volumes constitute a remarkably comprehensive treatment of the origins, course, and death of the Hitler regime, and are likely to be standard works for a long time to come."[34] Ed Ericson says:

Evans masterfully interweaves testimony that has come to light in the intervening decades with learned judgments from hundreds of authors to create a balanced and thoughtful narrative. This book, therefore, will assuredly become the definitive work on The Third Reich at War.[35]

The first volume, The Coming of the Third Reich: How the Nazis Destroyed Democracy and Seized Power in Germany (published by Penguin in 2003), shows how a country torn apart by the First World War, the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, hyperinflation and the Great Depression moved towards an increasingly authoritarian solution. The book explains in detail Adolf Hitler's appointment as Chancellor in January 1933 and how the Nazis transformed Germany into a one party dictatorship. The first volume featured highly favorable words of praise from Evans's friend, Ian Kershaw on its cover.[2]
The second volume, The Third Reich in Power, 1933 - 1939: How the Nazis Won Over the Hearts and Minds of a Nation (published by Penguin in 2005), covers the years of Nazi rule between 1933 and 1939. The final chapter examines the road to the Second World War, but the real focus is on life inside Nazi Germany. One of the great strengths of this volume is the way Evans allows small stories of key individuals to illustrate many of the key social, economic and cultural events of the period. Richard Overy described this instalment of the trilogy as "magisterial."[36]
The third volume, The Third Reich at War: How the Nazis Led Germany from Conquest to Disaster (published by Penguin in 2008), looks at major developments from 1939 to 1945, including the key battles of the Second World War, a vivid, moving and detailed account of the mass murder enacted during the Holocaust and Hitler's dramatic downfall in Berlin in 1945. In an October 2008 review of the third volume for The Times, best-selling historian Antony Beevor writes: "With this third volume, Richard Evans has accomplished a masterpiece of historical scholarship ... [He] has produced the best and most up-to-date synthesis of the huge work carried out on the subject over the past decades."[37] Aspects of it, however, were sharply criticised by Tim Snyder.[38]
Walter Reich, former Director of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D. C., states about the third-volume of the trilogy,The Third Reich at War, "If any work of accurate history has a chance to correct the distortions of public memory, this is it.".[39]
Regius Professor of Modern History[edit]
In 2008, Evans was appointed Regius Professor of Modern History at Cambridge University. (In 2010 the word "Modern" was removed from the title by royal decree). The post is a royal appointment in the gift of the Prime Minister of the day and dates back to 1724. Previous holders of the title have included John Dalberg-Acton (1895), Herbert Butterfield (1963), Geoffrey Elton (1983), Patrick Collinson (1988) and Quentin Skinner (1998). Evans is the first historian to have to apply for the post and be interviewed by a Board of Electors, including Cambridge's Vice-Chancellor, Alison Richard, and representatives of the history faculty and the university, as well as external assessors from Yale, Harvard, Oxford and London. The board selected a shortlist of four, each of whom was asked to give a presentation to the entire Cambridge history faculty. The shortlist of four was then reduced to two, whom the board interviewed, resulting in the board's recommendation of Evans to the Prime Minister and in the issue of a Royal Warrant for his appointment.[40] As well as serving as Regius Professor, Evans has served as chairman of the history faculty since October 2008; his term of office ended on 30 September 2010.
Evans is used to combining administration with research. At Birkbeck College, London, where he worked before Cambridge, he acted as Master of the college when Baroness Blackstone left suddenly to become Tony Blair's first higher education minister. On 27 January 2010 he was elected to the position of President of Wolfson College, Cambridge, to take up office on 1 October 2010.
TV and media appearances[edit]
Evans has appeared regularly on a number of TV documentaries related to Adolf Hitler and the Third Reich. He recently appeared on a major TV documentary on the History Channel which examined the Valkyrie bomb plot against Hitler in July 1944, which was the subject of a Hollywood film starring Tom Cruise. As of 2014, he has made 5 appearances on the BBC Radio 4 programme In Our Time.
He also appears regularly on "Start the Week" and often writes reviews of history books on his specialist era in major newspapers and periodicals. He is also a noted lecturer and gives numerous keynote lectures at international conferences around the world and also at student conferences as part of his remit to take history to a wider audience beyond academia. He is known as an excellent public speaker and often appears regularly as a keynote speaker at universities and schools and at conferences for academics and students around the world.
Debate with the British education secretary[edit]
In 2014, Evans was involved in a debate with Michael Gove, the British education secretary, about the content and style of history teaching and the way that the curriculum is structured and how the First World War should be portrayed.[41] Writing in the Daily Mail, Gove accused Evans in particular of distorting history with regard to Britain's role in the war.[42] Evans countered that Gove was engaging in the defamation of academic historians and "narrow, tub-thumping jingoism". Evans stated that he agreed with Gove's statement about "the ruthless Social Darwinism of the German elites, the pitiless approach they took to occupation, their aggressively expansionist war aims and their scorn for the international order all made resistance more than justified."[41] Evans wrote: "He's [Gove] right about the elites, but misses the point that they weren't able to carry the majority of the German people with them; the largest political party, the Social Democrats, was opposed to annexations and had long been critical of the militarism of the elites".[41] He also ridiculed Gove’s suggestion that the First World War was “just” and fought by men "committed to defending the western liberal order," pointing out that Britain's ally Tsar Nicholas II was far more despotic than even the Kaiser and that 40% of British adult males were not allowed to vote.[41] Evans also wrote that Gove was wrong that only left-wing historians believe that Britain was wrong to fight Germany in World War I, noting that such conservative historians as Niall Ferguson and Alan Clark have been quite vocal in expressing the belief that Britain should have remained neutral in 1914.[41]
Criticism[edit]
In 2011, Evans became involved in a polemical exchange of letters with Peter Baldwin after agreeing with Leif Jerram (in Cosmopolitan Islanders [2009]), that students in Britain could find a richer selection of courses on the histories of other countries in British universities than students from other countries could in their own countries.[43]

Life[edit]
Evans was born at Woodford, Essex, of Welsh parentage, and educated at Forest School, Jesus College, Oxford (MA), and St Antony's College, Oxford (DPhil). In a 2004 interview, he stated that frequent visits to Wales during his childhood inspired both an interest in history and a sense of "otherness".[2] Evans has said that one reason he was drawn to the study modern German history in the late 1960s was his identification of parallels between the policies of the Vietnam War and German imperialism.[2] He admired the work of Fritz Fischer, whom he credits with inspiring him to study modern German history.[2]
Career as a historian[edit]
Evans first established his academic reputation with his publications on the Second Reich period of German history. In the early 1970s, Evans travelled to Germany to research his dissertation, a study of the feminist movement in Germany in the first half of the twentieth century.[2] It was later published as The Feminist Movement In Germany, 1894–1933 in 1976. Evans followed his study of German feminism by another book, The Feminists (1977) which traced the history of the feminist movement in North America, Australasia and Europe in the period 1840–1920.[2] A theme of both books was the weakness of German middle class culture, and its inordinate stress on such military values as hierarchy, deference, and obedience.[2] For this reason, Evans argued that both liberalism and feminism failed in Germany while flourishing elsewhere in the Western world[2]
Evans' main interest is social history and he is much influenced by the Annales School.[2] He largely agrees with Fischer that nineteenth century German social development paved the way for the rise of Nazi Germany, although Evans takes pains to point out that this outcome was not inevitable but one among many possibilities.[5] For Evans, the values of the 19th-century German middle class contained the already germinating seeds of National Socialism.[2]
Evans studied under Fischer in Hamburg in 1970–71, but he came to disagree with the "Bielefeld School" of historians who argued for the Sonderweg thesis that saw the roots of Germany’s political development in the first half of the 20th century in a "failed bourgeois revolution" in 1848. Following a contemporary trend that opposed the previous "great man" theory of history, Evans was a member of a group of young British historians who in the 1970s sought to examine German history during the Imperial period "from below".[6] These scholars highlighted "the importance of the grass-roots of politics and the everyday life and experience of ordinary people".[7] "History is about people, and their relationships. It’s about the perennial question of ‘how much free will do people have in building their own lives, and making a future," Evans has said.[8] He says he sought the creation of a "new school of people's history", which was a result of a trend that "has taken place across a whole range of historical subjects, political opinions, and methodological approaches and has been expressed in many different ways".[7] In 1978, as editor of a collection of essays by young British historians entitled Society And Politics In Wilhelmine Germany, he launched a critique of the ‘top-down’ approach of the Bielefeld School associated with Hans-Ulrich Wehler and Jürgen Kocka in regards to the Wilhelmine Germany. With the historians Geoff Eley and David Blackbourn, Evans instead emphasized the "self-mobilization from below" of key sociopolitical groups, as well as the modernity of National Socialism. In the 1980s, Evans organized ten international workshops on modern German social history at the University of East Anglia that did a good deal to refine these ideas, to pioneer research in this new historical field and, in six collections of papers, present it to an Anglophone readership.[9]
Among Evans' major research works are Death in Hamburg (1987), a study of class conflict and liberal government in nineteenth-century Germany using the example of Hamburg’s cholera epidemics and applying statistical methods to the exploration of social inequality in an industrializing society, and Rituals of Retribution (1996), a study of capital punishment in German history applying structural anthropological concepts to the rituals of public execution up to the mid-nineteenth century, and exploring the politics of the death penalty until its abolition by the GDR in 1987. In Death in Hamburg, Evans studied the cholera outbreak in Hamburg in 1892, which he concluded was caused by a failure in the medical system to safeguard against such an event.[2] Another study in German social history was Tales from the German Underworld (1998), where Evans traced the life stories of four German criminals in the late 19th century, namely a homeless woman, a forger, a prostitute and a con-man.[2] In Rituals of Retribution, Evans traced the history of capital punishment in Germany, and using the ideas of Michel Foucault, Philippe Ariès and Norbert Elias as his guide argued that opposition to the death penalty was strongest when liberalism was in the ascendancy, and support for capital punishment coincided when the right was in the ascendancy.[2] Thus, in Evans' view, capital punishment in Germany was never a mere matter of law being disinterestedly applied, but was rather a form of state power being exercised.[2] In addition, Evans examined such subjects as belief in witchcraft, torture, the last words of the executed, the psychology of mobs, varying forms of execution from the Thirty Years War to the 1980s, profiles of executioners, cruelty, and changing views towards the death penalty.[2]
In the 1980s, Evans was a conspicuous figure in the Historikerstreit, a controversy surrounding the historical work and theories of German historians Ernst Nolte, Joachim Fest, Andreas Hillgruber, Michael Stürmer, Hagen Schulze, Imanuel Geiss and Klaus Hildebrand, all of whom Evans considered German apologists attempting to white-wash the German past. Evans' views on the Historikerstreit were set forth in his 1989 book, In Hitler's Shadow. In that book Evans took issue with Nolte's acceptance of the Commissar Order as a legitimate military order; with Nolte's argument that the Einsatzgruppen massacres of Ukrainian Jews were a justifiable "preventive security" response to partisan attacks; his description (citing Viktor Suvorov) of Operation Barbarossa as a "preventative war" forced on Hitler by an impending Soviet attack; and his complaints that much scholarship on the Shoah expressed the views of "biased" Jewish historians.[10]
Evans characterized Nolte's statements as crossing the line into Holocaust denial[11] and he singled out Nolte's rationalization that since the victors write history, the only reason why Nazi Germany is seen as evil is because it lost the war.[12] Evans also denounced as an attempt to justify the Holocaust, Nolte's claim that Chaim Weizmann's letter of 3 September 1939, to Neville Chamberlain promising that the Jewish Agency would support the war effort constituted "Jewish declaration of war" on Germany that justified the pre-emptive internment of Jews in concentration camps.[13] In his 1989 book In Hitler's Shadown, Evans also criticised the intentionalist theories of Hillgruber and Hildebrand.[14] and criticized Stürmer's laudatory biography of Otto von Bismarck, with its excessive focus on political history and overlooking of social conditions, as a regression to the outmoded Great man theory of history.[15] For his part Evans praised Ian Kershaw, who wrote that "The road to Auschwitz was built by hate, but paved with indifference", namely that the German people were by and large indifferent towards the Holocaust.[16]
In Hitler's Shadow also criticized the historical writings of Robert Conquest, Hugh Thomas, Gertrude Himmelfarb, and Geoffrey Elton, whom he considered part of a neo-conservative historical trend.[17] In the same book, Evans endorsed Martin Broszat's call for the "historicization" of the Third Reich as a "rational approach to Nazism" and a "gain" to history.[18]
Evans' book In Defence of History defends the discipline of history against postmodernist skepticism of its value. The limitations of our ability to understand and learn from the past notwithstanding, it is still possible, he argues to understand much about past ways of life. Evans suggests that the spread since the mid-1979s of post-modernist theories, which declare that history is a construct and depict the rationalist tradition of the West as a form of oppression, had done much to increase the appeal of Holocaust denial.[19]
Role as an expert witness in Irving v. Lipstadt[edit]
See also: Irving v. Penguin Books and Lipstadt
Evans is probably best known to the general public in the role of an expert witness for the defence in the high-profile libel case of David Irving against the American historian Deborah Lipstadt in 2000, Irving v. Lipstadt. Lipstadt was sued for libel by Irving, after she referred to him as a "Holocaust denier" and "an ardent follower of Adolf Hitler" in her 1993 book Denying the Holocaust. Lipstadt further accused Irving of "distorting evidence and manipulating documents to serve his own purposes...[as well as] skewing documents and misrepresenting data in order to reach historically untenable conclusions, particularly those that exonerate Hitler."[20]
Evans acted as an expert witness for the defence in the case. Starting in the autumn of 1997, Evans, along with Thomas Skelton-Robinson and Nik Wachsmann, two of his PhD students, closely examined Irving's work.[21] They found instances in which he had used forged documents, disregarded contrary evidence, selectively quoted historical documents out of context and mis-cited historical records, thus misrepresenting historical evidence in order to support his prejudices.[22][23] Evans subsequently proved to be a powerful witness in Lipstadt's ultimately successful defence. In his expert witness report he wrote:

"Not one of [Irving's] books, speeches or articles, not one paragraph, not one sentence in any of them, can be taken on trust as an accurate representation of its historical subject. All of them are completely worthless as history, because Irving cannot be trusted anywhere, in any of them, to give a reliable account of what he is talking or writing about. ... if we mean by historian someone who is concerned to discover the truth about the past, and to give as accurate a representation of it as possible, then Irving is not a historian".[24]

The cross-examination of Evans by Irving was noted for the high degree of personal dislike between the two men.[25] Such was the degree of dislike that Irving challenged Evans on very minor points, such as Evans doubting the fairness of a 1938 German plebiscite in which the Nazi regime received 98.8% of the vote.[26] A subject that much engaged Irving and Evans in a debate was a memo by the Chief of the Reich Chancellery Hans Lammers to the Reich Justice Minister Franz Schlegelberger in which Lammers wrote that Hitler ordered him to put the "Jewish Question" on the "back-burner" until after the war.[27] Evans chose to accept the interpretation of the memo put forward by Eberhard Jäckel in the 1970s;[28] Irving chose to interpret the memo literally and taunted Evans by saying, "It is a terrible problem, is it not that we are faced with this tantalizing plate of crumbs and morsels of what should have provided the final smoking gun, and nowhere the whole way through the archives do we find even one item that we do not have to interpret or read between the lines of, but we do have in the same chain of evidence documents which...quite clearly specifically show Hitler intervening in the other sense?"[29] In response, Evans stated "No, I do not accept that at all. It is because you want to interpret euphemisms as being literal, and that is what the whole problem is. Every time there is an euphemism, Mr. Irving ... or a camouflage piece of statement or language about Madagascar, you want to treat it as the literal truth, because it serves your purpose of trying to exculpate Hitler. That is part of ... the way you manipulate and distort the documents."[30]
In a 2001 interview, Evans described to the Canadian columnist Robert Fulford his impression of Irving after being cross-examined by him as: "He [Irving] was a bit like a dim student who didn't listen. If he didn't get the answer he wanted, he just repeated the question."[31] His findings and his account of the trial were published in his 2001 book Lying About Hitler: History, Holocaust, And The David Irving Trial, which was published as Telling Lies About Hitler in the United States in 2002. The High Court rejected Irving’s libel suit and awarded costs to the defence.
Evans' involvement in the trial was included in the 2016 film Denial, in which he was played by British actor John Sessions.[32]
The Third Reich Trilogy[edit]




Richard J. Evans (2016)


Main article: The Third Reich Trilogy
Between 2003 and 2008, Evans published a three-volume history of the Third Reich. Drawing on years of experience as a leading scholar of German history, Evans produced what some historians call the most extensive and comprehensive history of the rise and fall of Hitler’s regime ever produced by a single scholar. Reviewer Peter Mansoor says, "The Third Reich at War is a superb piece of scholarship that is likely to emerge as the definitive account of life and death inside Hitler's blood soaked Third Reich."[33] Robert Citino says, "Read together, the three volumes constitute a remarkably comprehensive treatment of the origins, course, and death of the Hitler regime, and are likely to be standard works for a long time to come."[34] Ed Ericson says:

Evans masterfully interweaves testimony that has come to light in the intervening decades with learned judgments from hundreds of authors to create a balanced and thoughtful narrative. This book, therefore, will assuredly become the definitive work on The Third Reich at War.[35]

The first volume, The Coming of the Third Reich: How the Nazis Destroyed Democracy and Seized Power in Germany (published by Penguin in 2003), shows how a country torn apart by the First World War, the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, hyperinflation and the Great Depression moved towards an increasingly authoritarian solution. The book explains in detail Adolf Hitler's appointment as Chancellor in January 1933 and how the Nazis transformed Germany into a one party dictatorship. The first volume featured highly favorable words of praise from Evans's friend, Ian Kershaw on its cover.[2]
The second volume, The Third Reich in Power, 1933 - 1939: How the Nazis Won Over the Hearts and Minds of a Nation (published by Penguin in 2005), covers the years of Nazi rule between 1933 and 1939. The final chapter examines the road to the Second World War, but the real focus is on life inside Nazi Germany. One of the great strengths of this volume is the way Evans allows small stories of key individuals to illustrate many of the key social, economic and cultural events of the period. Richard Overy described this instalment of the trilogy as "magisterial."[36]
The third volume, The Third Reich at War: How the Nazis Led Germany from Conquest to Disaster (published by Penguin in 2008), looks at major developments from 1939 to 1945, including the key battles of the Second World War, a vivid, moving and detailed account of the mass murder enacted during the Holocaust and Hitler's dramatic downfall in Berlin in 1945. In an October 2008 review of the third volume for The Times, best-selling historian Antony Beevor writes: "With this third volume, Richard Evans has accomplished a masterpiece of historical scholarship ... [He] has produced the best and most up-to-date synthesis of the huge work carried out on the subject over the past decades."[37] Aspects of it, however, were sharply criticised by Tim Snyder.[38]
Walter Reich, former Director of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D. C., states about the third-volume of the trilogy,The Third Reich at War, "If any work of accurate history has a chance to correct the distortions of public memory, this is it.".[39]
Regius Professor of Modern History[edit]
In 2008, Evans was appointed Regius Professor of Modern History at Cambridge University. (In 2010 the word "Modern" was removed from the title by royal decree). The post is a royal appointment in the gift of the Prime Minister of the day and dates back to 1724. Previous holders of the title have included John Dalberg-Acton (1895), Herbert Butterfield (1963), Geoffrey Elton (1983), Patrick Collinson (1988) and Quentin Skinner (1998). Evans is the first historian to have to apply for the post and be interviewed by a Board of Electors, including Cambridge's Vice-Chancellor, Alison Richard, and representatives of the history faculty and the university, as well as external assessors from Yale, Harvard, Oxford and London. The board selected a shortlist of four, each of whom was asked to give a presentation to the entire Cambridge history faculty. The shortlist of four was then reduced to two, whom the board interviewed, resulting in the board's recommendation of Evans to the Prime Minister and in the issue of a Royal Warrant for his appointment.[40] As well as serving as Regius Professor, Evans has served as chairman of the history faculty since October 2008; his term of office ended on 30 September 2010.
Evans is used to combining administration with research. At Birkbeck College, London, where he worked before Cambridge, he acted as Master of the college when Baroness Blackstone left suddenly to become Tony Blair's first higher education minister. On 27 January 2010 he was elected to the position of President of Wolfson College, Cambridge, to take up office on 1 October 2010.
TV and media appearances[edit]
Evans has appeared regularly on a number of TV documentaries related to Adolf Hitler and the Third Reich. He recently appeared on a major TV documentary on the History Channel which examined the Valkyrie bomb plot against Hitler in July 1944, which was the subject of a Hollywood film starring Tom Cruise. As of 2014, he has made 5 appearances on the BBC Radio 4 programme In Our Time.
He also appears regularly on "Start the Week" and often writes reviews of history books on his specialist era in major newspapers and periodicals. He is also a noted lecturer and gives numerous keynote lectures at international conferences around the world and also at student conferences as part of his remit to take history to a wider audience beyond academia. He is known as an excellent public speaker and often appears regularly as a keynote speaker at universities and schools and at conferences for academics and students around the world.
Debate with the British education secretary[edit]
In 2014, Evans was involved in a debate with Michael Gove, the British education secretary, about the content and style of history teaching and the way that the curriculum is structured and how the First World War should be portrayed.[41] Writing in the Daily Mail, Gove accused Evans in particular of distorting history with regard to Britain's role in the war.[42] Evans countered that Gove was engaging in the defamation of academic historians and "narrow, tub-thumping jingoism". Evans stated that he agreed with Gove's statement about "the ruthless Social Darwinism of the German elites, the pitiless approach they took to occupation, their aggressively expansionist war aims and their scorn for the international order all made resistance more than justified."[41] Evans wrote: "He's [Gove] right about the elites, but misses the point that they weren't able to carry the majority of the German people with them; the largest political party, the Social Democrats, was opposed to annexations and had long been critical of the militarism of the elites".[41] He also ridiculed Gove’s suggestion that the First World War was “just” and fought by men "committed to defending the western liberal order," pointing out that Britain's ally Tsar Nicholas II was far more despotic than even the Kaiser and that 40% of British adult males were not allowed to vote.[41] Evans also wrote that Gove was wrong that only left-wing historians believe that Britain was wrong to fight Germany in World War I, noting that such conservative historians as Niall Ferguson and Alan Clark have been quite vocal in expressing the belief that Britain should have remained neutral in 1914.[41]
Criticism[edit]
In 2011, Evans became involved in a polemical exchange of letters with Peter Baldwin after agreeing with Leif Jerram (in Cosmopolitan Islanders [2009]), that students in Britain could find a richer selection of courses on the histories of other countries in British universities than students from other countries could in their own countries.[43]

The Third and Final Reich, April 25, 2017


By Christian Schlect


Verified Purchase(What's this?)


This review is from: The Third Reich at War (Hardcover)

A well-researched, well-written  history of Adolf Hitler's Germany at war. Professor Evans deserves all the honors he has received for this and the preceding two volumes of his magnificent trilogy on the Third Reich.The story here is of Germany from 1939 to 1945; its leadership, its military, its people, its economy, the Holocaust, its final defeat. The "why" of it all.This is not a book covering other combatants or theaters of war, such as the Pacific. It, in other words, is not a full history of World War II.While it took me time to finish all three books, it was well worth the effort. It serves to remind one of terrible events that occurred not that long past, given the grand sweep of history, It also puts into perspective, with all current geopolitical strife, that we live in a much better and safer world than that experienced by Europeans in the last, and most bloody of centuries.

Overview



The final volume in Richard J. Evans's masterly trilogy on the history of Nazi Germany traces the rise and fall of German military might, the mobilization of a 'people's community' to serve a war of conquest, and Hitler's campaign of racial subjugation and genocideAlready hailed as 'a masterpiece' (William Grimes in The New York Times) and 'the most comprehensive history' of the Third Reich? (Ian Kershaw), this epic trilogy reaches its terrifying climax in this volume.Evans interweaves a broad narrative of the war's progress with viscerally affecting personal testimony from a wide range of people-from generals to front-line soldiers, from Hitler Youth activists to middle-class housewives. The Third Reich at War lays bare the dynamics of a nation more deeply immersed in war than any society before or since. Fresh insights into the conflict's great events are here, from the invasion of Poland to the Battle of Stalingrad to Hitler's suicide in the bunker. But just as important is the re-creation of the daily experience of ordinary Germans in wartime, staggering under pressure from Allied bombing and their own government's mounting demands upon them. At the center of the book is the Nazi extermination of Europe's Jews, set in the context of Hitler's genocidal plans for the racial restructuring of Europe.Blending narrative, description and analysis, The Third Reich at War creates an engrossing picture-at once sweeping and precise-of a society rushing headlong to self-destruction and taking much of Europe with it. It is the culmination of a historical masterwork that will remain the most authoritative work on Nazi Germany for years to come.

Editorial Reviews


From the Publisher
"…Masterful….Evans demonstrates a fluent style and a sweeping grasp of the Third Reich's history and of the enormous historical literature….Evans narrates the Reich's end in gripping fashion as the Allies closed in on Germany. Evans's fellow historians as well as a broader public will read this work, not quite with pleasure, for there is little joy in this story, but with admiration for the author's narrative powers."―Publisher's Weekly, starred review

Overview



The final volume in Richard J. Evans's masterly trilogy on the history of Nazi Germany traces the rise and fall of German military might, the mobilization of a 'people's community' to serve a war of conquest, and Hitler's campaign of racial subjugation and genocideAlready hailed as 'a masterpiece' (William Grimes in The New York Times) and 'the most comprehensive history' of the Third Reich? (Ian Kershaw), this epic trilogy reaches its terrifying climax in this volume.Evans interweaves a broad narrative of the war's progress with viscerally affecting personal testimony from a wide range of people-from generals to front-line soldiers, from Hitler Youth activists to middle-class housewives. The Third Reich at War lays bare the dynamics of a nation more deeply immersed in war than any society before or since. Fresh insights into the conflict's great events are here, from the invasion of Poland to the Battle of Stalingrad to Hitler's suicide in the bunker. But just as important is the re-creation of the daily experience of ordinary Germans in wartime, staggering under pressure from Allied bombing and their own government's mounting demands upon them. At the center of the book is the Nazi extermination of Europe's Jews, set in the context of Hitler's genocidal plans for the racial restructuring of Europe.Blending narrative, description and analysis, The Third Reich at War creates an engrossing picture-at once sweeping and precise-of a society rushing headlong to self-destruction and taking much of Europe with it. It is the culmination of a historical masterwork that will remain the most authoritative work on Nazi Germany for years to come.

Editorial Reviews


From the Publisher
"…Masterful….Evans demonstrates a fluent style and a sweeping grasp of the Third Reich's history and of the enormous historical literature….Evans narrates the Reich's end in gripping fashion as the Allies closed in on Germany. Evans's fellow historians as well as a broader public will read this work, not quite with pleasure, for there is little joy in this story, but with admiration for the author's narrative powers."―Publisher's Weekly, starred review

Item Description: ReInk Books, 2017. Softcover. Book Condition: NEW. Reprinted from edition. Language: eng. NO changes have been made to the original text. This is NOT a retyped or an ocr'd reprint. Illustrations, Index, if any, are included in black and white. Each page is checked manually before printing. As this reprint is from very old book, there could be some missing or flawed pages, but we always try to make the book as complete as possible. Fold-outs, if any, are not part of the book. If the original book was published in multiple volumes then this reprint is of only one volume, not the whole set. This paperback book is SEWN, where the book block is actually sewn (smythe sewn/section sewn) with thread before binding which results in a more durable type of paperback binding. It can also be open wide. The pages will not fall out and will be around for a lot longer than normal paperbacks. This print on demand book is printed on high quality acid-free paper. Original Publisher: Lamoni, Iowa, Herald Pub. House 20 pages.  Bookseller Inventory # 457217296

Overview



A master practitioner gives us an entertaining tour of the historian's workshop and a spirited defense of the search for historical truth.E. H. Carr's What Is History?, a classic introduction to the field, may now give way to a worthy successor. In his compact, intriguing survey, Richard J. Evans shows us how historians manage to extract meaning from the recalcitrant past. To materials that are frustratingly meager, or overwhelmingly profuse, they bring an array of tools that range from agreed-upon rules of documentation and powerful computer models to the skilled investigator's sudden insight, all employed with the aim of reconstructing a verifiable, usable past. Evans defends this commitment to historical knowledge from the attacks of postmodernist critics who see all judgments as subjective. Evans brings "a remarkable range, a nose for the archives, a taste for controversy, and a fluent pen" (The New Republic) to this splendid work. "Essential reading for coming generations."-Keith Thomas

About The Pursuit of Power
An Economist Best Book of the Year“Sweeping . . . an ambitious synthesis . . . [Evans] writes with admirable narrative power and possesses a wonderful eye for local color . . . Fascinating.”—Stephen Schuker, The Wall Street JournalFrom the bestselling author of The Third Reich at War, a masterly account of Europe in the age of its global hegemony; the latest volume in the Penguin History of Europe series  Richard J. Evans, bestselling historian of Nazi Germany, returns with a monumental new addition to the acclaimed Penguin History of Europe series, covering the period from the fall of Napoleon to the outbreak of World War I. Evans’s gripping narrative ranges across a century of social and national conflicts, from the revolutions of 1830 and 1848 to the unification of both Germany and Italy, from the Russo-Turkish wars to the Balkan upheavals that brought this era of relative peace and growing prosperity to an end. Among the great themes it discusses are the decline of religious belief and the rise of secular science and medicine, the journey of art, music, and literature from Romanticism to Modernism, the replacement of old-regime punishments by the modern prison, the end of aristocratic domination and the emergence of industrial society, and the dramatic struggle of feminists for women’s equality and emancipation. Uniting the era’s broad-ranging transformations was the pursuit of power in all segments of life, from the banker striving for economic power to the serf seeking to escape the power of his landlord, from the engineer asserting society’s power over the environment to the psychiatrist attempting to exert science’s power over human nature itself.       The first single-volume history of the century, this comprehensive and sweeping account gives the reader a magnificently human picture of Europe in the age when it dominated the rest of the globe.

Praise

    “The Pursuit of Power…unpacks the fascinatingly complex and interconnected range of historical forces at work between 1815 and 1914. . . [A] skillful  interweave of political conflict and transition, economic transformation social upheaval and cultural change.”—The New York Times Book Review“An outstanding volume that leaves no stone unturned in providing a taut  narrative of this important era of modern European history. Using dense  and well written narrative and cogent analysis of cause and effect,  Professor Evans has provided another excellent contribution to [the  Penguin History of Europe] series.”—New York Journal of Books   “Wonderfully researched, highly readable, engrossing . . . The Pursuit of Power is required reading for anyone looking to understand what is at the  foundation of today’s global economy, the difficulties between nations,  or for those simply wondering how Europe as a whole came to its current  form.”—Portland Book Review“A massive and masterful account . . . This is a beautifully written,  wide-ranging study that explores in depth the political, social, and  economic factors that shaped and continue to shape modern Europe and the  wider world.”—Booklist, (starred review)“An impressive and richly documented new book . . . A distinguished  scholar of Germany, Mr. Evans is just as sure-footed across the  continent . . . The book is particularly illuminating on how social  trends after 1848—the spread of education, the standardization of  languages, railway development and the mass production of newspapers—led  to the rise of political forces like nationalism and democracy . . .  Mr. Evans is a skilled synthesizer with a strong eye for narrative . . .  the book’s real success lies with its timeliness. Europe is rendered  not as a geographical space—its eastern borders have always been hard to  define—but as a collective entity with a shared history. European  leaders invited ruin upon themselves when they forgot that in 1914. They  should never do it again.”—The Economist“Sweeping, panoramic history . . . Splendid . . . Evans wants above all, as he puts it, to convey ‘the flavor of the period, in its mixture of strangeness and familiarity, and as far as possible to allow contemporaries to speak for themselves.’ This he does beautifully, enlivening his straightforward narratives with short sketches of little-known but fascinating personalities . . . fine scholarship.”—Financial Times  “Magnificent . . . masterly . . . This outstanding and authoritative synthesis, weaving social, political, diplomatic, cultural, engineering, scientific and economic history, is eminently readable and so carefully crafted that I was always reluctant to put it down. It will help readers appreciate the period of Europe’s growing dominance in the world as seen from variety of perspectives and better understand some of the roots of World War I.”—BookPage “Transnational history at its finest . . . social, political and cultural themes swirl together in one great canvas of immense detail and beauty.”—The Times“Dazzlingly erudite and entertaining.”—Dominic Sandbrook, The Sunday Times

                      The definitive account of Germany's malign transformation under Hitler's total rule and the implacable march to war. This magnificent second volume of Richard J. Evans's three-volume history of Nazi Germany was hailed by Benjamin Schwartz of The Atlantic Monthly as "the definitive English-language account... gripping and precise." It chronicles the incredible story of Germany's radical reshaping under Nazi rule.

With The Coming of the Third Reich, Richard Evans, one of the world’s most distinguished historians, has written the definitive account for our time.

                      From the preeminent Hitler biographer, a fascinating and original exploration of how the Third Reich was willing and able to fight to the bitter end of World War II. Countless books have been written about why Nazi Germany lost World War II, yet remarkably little attention has been paid to the equally vital question of how and why it was able to hold out as long as it did.

The Arms of Krupp brings to life Europe's wealthiest, most powerful family, a 400-year German dynasty that developed the world's most technologically advanced weapons, from cannons to submarines to antiaircraft guns; provided arms to generations of German leaders, including the Kaiser and Hitler; operated private concentration camps during the Nazi era; survived conviction at Nuremberg; and wielded enormous influence on the course of world events.

                      Richard J. Evans's gripping narrative ranges across a century of social and national conflicts, from the revolutions of 1830 and 1848 to the unification of both Germany and Italy, from the Russo-Turkish wars to the Balkan upheavals that brought this era of relative peace and growing prosperity to an end. The first single-volume history of the century, this comprehensive and sweeping account gives the listener a magnificently human picture of Europe in the age when it dominated the rest of the globe.

                      When Guy Sajer joins the infantry full of ideals in the summer of 1942, the German army is enjoying unparalleled success in Russia. However, he quickly finds that for the foot soldier the glory of military success hides a much harsher reality of hunger, fatigue, and constant deprivation. Posted to the elite Grosse Deutschland division, he enters a violent and remorseless world where all youthful hope is gradually ground down, and all that matters is the brute will to survive.

                      Like many Germans, Berlin schoolboy Erwin Bartmann fell under the spell of the Zeitgeist cultivated by the Nazis. Convinced he was growing up in the best country in the world, he dreamt of joining the Leibstandarte, Hitler's elite Waffen SS unit. Tall, blond, blue-eyed, and just 17-years-old, Erwin fulfilled his dream on Mayday 1941, when he gave up his apprenticeship at the Glaser bakery in Memeler Strasse and walked into the Lichterfelde barracks in Berlin as a raw, volunteer recruit.

                      As early as 1941, Allied victory in World War II seemed all but assured. How and why, then, did the Germans prolong the barbaric conflict for three and a half more years? In The German War, acclaimed historian Nicholas Stargardt draws on an extraordinary range of primary source materials - personal diaries, court records, and military correspondence - to answer this question. He offers an unprecedented portrait of wartime Germany, bringing the hopes and expectations of the German people to vivid life.

                      Reinhard Heydrich is widely recognized as one of the great iconic villains of the 20th century, an appalling figure even within the context of the Nazi leadership. Chief of the Nazi Criminal Police, the SS Security Service, and the Gestapo, ruthless overlord of Nazi-occupied Bohemia and Moravia, and leading planner of the "Final Solution," Heydrich played a central role in Hitler's Germany.

In his memoir, he shares his impressions of countless Russian POWs seen at the outset of his service, of peasants struggling to survive the hostilities while caught between two ruthless antagonists, and of corpses littering the landscape.

                      Over the past two decades, Antony Beevor has established himself as one of the world's premier historians of World War II. His multi-award winning books have included Stalingrad and The Fall of Berlin 1945. Now, in his newest and most ambitious book, he turns his focus to one of the bloodiest and most tragic events of the twentieth century, The Second World War. Thrillingly written and brilliantly researched, Beevor's provocative account is destined to become the definitive work on World War II.

                      In Berlin at War, acclaimed historian Roger Moorhouse provides a magnificent and detailed portrait of everyday life at the epicenter of the Third Reich. Berlin was the stage upon which the rise and fall of the Third Reich was most visibly played out. It was the backdrop for the most lavish Nazi ceremonies, the site of Albert Speer's grandiose plans for a new "world metropolis", and the scene of the final climactic battle to defeat Nazism.

                      In the aftermath of World War II, Prussia - a centuries-old state pivotal to Europe's development - ceased to exist. In their eagerness to erase all traces of the Third Reich from the earth, the Allies believed that Prussia, the very embodiment of German militarism, had to be abolished. But as Christopher Clark reveals in this pioneering history, Prussia's legacy is far more complex.

                      The Red Army had much to avenge when it finally reached the frontiers of the Third Reich in January 1945. Frenzied by their terrible experiences with Wehrmacht and SS brutality, they wreaked havoc - tanks crushing refugee columns, mass rape, pillage, and unimaginable destruction. Hundreds of thousands of women and children froze to death or were massacred; more than seven million fled westward from the fury of the Red Army. It was the most terrifying example of fire and sword ever known.

                      In life and in his grisly family suicide, Goebbels was one of Hitler's most loyal acolytes. Though powerful in the party and in wartime Germany, Longerich's Goebbels is a man dogged by insecurities and consumed by his fierce adherence to the Nazi cause. Longerich engages and challenges the careful self-portrait that Goebbels left behind in his diaries, and, as he delves deep into the mind of Hitler's master propagandist, Longerich discovers firsthand how the Nazi message was conceived. This complete portrait of the man behind the message is sure to become a standard for historians and students of the Holocaust for years to come.

                      World War II began with a metallic roar as the German Blitzkrieg raced across Europe, spearheaded by the most dreaded weapon of the 20th century: the Panzer. No German tank better represents that thundering power than the infamous Tiger, and Otto Carius was one of the most successful commanders to ever take a Tiger into battle, destroying well over 150 enemy tanks during his incredible career.

                      From one of our finest military historians comes a monumental work that shows us at once the truly global reach of World War II and its deeply personal consequences. Remarkably informed and wide-ranging, Inferno is both elegantly written and cogently argued. Above all, it is a new and essential understanding of one of the greatest and bloodiest events of the 20th century.

The Nuremberg Trial brilliantly recreates the trial proceedings and offers a reasoned, often profound examination of the processes that created international law. From the whimpering of Kaltenbrunner and Ribbentrop on the stand to the icy coolness of Goering, each participant is vividly drawn.

Publisher's Summary

The final volume in Richard J. Evans’s masterly trilogy on the history of Nazi Germany traces the rise and fall of German military might, the mobilization of a “people’s community” to serve a war of conquest, and Hitler’s campaign of racial subjugation and genocide. Already hailed as “a masterpiece” (William Grimes in The New York Times) and “the most comprehensive history… of the Third Reich” (Ian Kershaw), this epic trilogy reaches its terrifying climax in this volume.Evans interweaves a broad narrative of the war’s progress with viscerally affecting personal testimony from a wide range of people - from generals to front-line soldiers, from Hitler Youth activists to middle-class housewives. The Third Reich at War lays bare the dynamics of a nation more deeply immersed in war than any society before or since.Fresh insights into the conflict’s great events are here, from the invasion of Poland to the Battle of Stalingrad to Hitler’s suicide in the bunker. But just as important is the re-creation of the daily experience of ordinary Germans in wartime, staggering under pressure from Allied bombing and their own government’s mounting demands upon them. At the center of the book is the Nazi extermination of Europe’s Jews, set in the context of Hitler’s genocidal plans for the racial restructuring of Europe.Blending narrative, description, and analysis, The Third Reich at War creates an engrossing picture - at once sweeping and precise - of a society rushing headlong to self-destruction and taking much of Europe with it. It is the culmination of a historical masterwork that will remain the most authoritative work on Nazi Germany for years to come.

What the Critics Say
"Masterful….Evans demonstrates a fluent style and a sweeping grasp of the Third Reich’s history and of the enormous historical literature….Evans narrates the Reich’s end in gripping fashion as the Allies closed in on Germany. Evans’s fellow historians as well as a broader public will listen to this work, not quite with pleasure, for there is little joy in this story, but with admiration for the author’s narrative powers.” (Publisher’s Weekly)

"Masterful"



The series, taken as a whole, sets the standard for WWII history. These cannot be overlooked, or diminished. Indeed, it is difficult to adequately describe how well researched and written are each of these three volumes. I have read or listened to every history of WWII I have been able to find (well over 50) in English, Russian and French, and up until now Shirer's "Rise and Fall of the Third Reich" was, I felt, the definitive historical account of Nazi Germany (if you haven't read/listened to it, you should) even though it was published over 50 years ago. This series surpasses that exceptional work.This volume is superlative. If you enjoy World War Two history you CANNOT skip this volume, in particular!

"Excellent history"



Well written, well narrated. Most WWII histories dwell on the military aspect, this comes from the other side defining (as well as is possible with such a subject) the thought processes and actions that led to the horrors of the war. The author tells a good story, entertaining, as well as informative while weaving in first person accounts to reinforce his narrative. A long book but you'll be sorry when it ends.

"Simply wonderful"



The first thing to say about this entire series is that all 3 books form a wonderful history of the Third Reich. It also seems important to mention that this volume is a history of the Third Reich during the war, not the Luftwaffe, Kriegsmarine or Wehrmacht, so there is only limited coverage of the actual battles. Rather this book concerns itself mostly with government policy concerning those living inside Germany itself and the occupied territories. It is very detailed and I found some sections on the extermination camps very emotionally painful to get through. The book also does not cover some areas that I would like to have heard about. For example, how were Allied soldiers who were minorities treated in prison camps? Did the Wehrmacht follow the Geneva Convention rules or not? What was the relationship between the Wehrmacht and the SS? Since the book is about government policy these areas were not covered in any detail. Regardless this book, as well as the preceding two volumes, form an invaluable history and should be required reading for anyone who wants to know about the Second World War in Europe. I also agree with another reviewer who suggested that these books, along with Shirer's Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, should both be read since they are complimentary.  Highly recommended.

"Just do it."



This review is for the entire series.  My contribution to the pile of reviews starts with the observation that the work cannot be compared to any other book about WWII or, really, any other history.  I'm tolerably well read in the area, and this set of books is unique.At the outset, I found the narrator troublesome.  But, just as I have found on long walks, as I progressed, I realized that his delivery fit the material.  Nothing hurried, nothing emotional, nothing dramatic.  If you've been to the Viet Nam memorial in DC, you'll know what I mean. It isn't the individual names, but the total list; it isn't the granduer of the monument,  it is the monumental display of horror.  You, too, will get over it and then take comfort in the methodical recitation of what happened to all the unwanted,  particularly the Jewish people.Some of the reviews complained about the relatively short shrift given to military history and some technological flaws.  There are excellent military histories that cover this ground; readers of this book only need that material for contextual reference. For  instance, the history of the period we're just passing through isn't about the individual money scams, the individual mortgages and speculations or the indivdual stories of growing disparities in income and assets; rather, it is about the how these individual events came about to overwhelm the financial system as a whole.  So it is with Nazi Germany.For as long as this book is around, it will be difficult for people to deny the Holocaust and it will be difficult to repeat what Hitler and his followers were able to do.  Just read it.

"Finishing the trilogy"



Personally, I was more interested in the time periods covered in the first two volumes than I am in the war period, but I found "The Third Reich At War" to be as well-written, meaningful, and interesting as the previous books. Once again, I am grateful for Evans' resourceful use of primary research materials. I enjoy his writing style and way of presenting a complicated series of events. I found the entire series to be profoundly depressing, but how could it be otherwise considering the content? Still, I feel Evans dealt with the subjects in a fair, even-handed way, without resorting to hyperbole or underplaying the horror. Sean Pratt's narration got on my last nerve this time. I could barely tolerate him in the first two volumes. Anyone less suited to pronouncing the German language, I cannot imagine unless it's Betty Boop. He cannot manage even basic German place names. To someone who speaks German, listening to him is like fingernails on a chalkboard. His pacing is atrocious. I will never, no matter how interesting the book might be, listen to anything he reads again. But I have no regrets. The trilogy was fantastic and I plan to get copies in hardcover.

"Best of the Series"



What do you say about a book as finely researched, as meticulously executed, as solidly paced, as informative and horrifying and shocking as the Third Reich at War? It is a masterpiece and all I can say to Richard J. Evans is, "Thank You." This is an exceptional book that begins with the invasion of Poland and ends with the Nuremburg Trials. You can read it alone or as part of the larger series: The Coming of the Third Reich and the Third Reich in Power. It is a fantastic series and this book is its pinnacle.It is not a history of WWII, as that has been done many times. Instead, this is a story of the Third Reich, their leadership at home, their policies, and their wartime strategies. There is, of course, military history here and there is a history of the Holocaust. Both of these sections are told in finite and powerful detail. But this is also the story of Germany and its fall into absolute ruin. Read these books, they are researched, written, paced, and read with perfection.

"Excellent series of books -- HORRIBLE reader"



The series of books by Richard Evans is great, and you really should read them in order - however that is not required. I will say The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich is a much easier to follow and more entertaining book and it's reader is on a level that this book reader could never hope to obtain. I would highly recommend that book over this series if you could only have one. However I think you'd be best served to listen to both. This series gives more of an in-depth at the day to day lives of Germans and helps you have a better understanding of the war in general and how Germany became the place it did.I give it a high recommend which would be much higher if it wasn't read by such an amateur. The reader is extremely poor and does a great disservice to this book. After about 50 hours (between the 3 books) I think I finally started to get used to him so I wasn't as annoyed by the readers inability to know when to pause in a sentence and his extremely monotone voice. Overall however the reader is awful and has no business doing so much as reading a 2-line power point presentation.

"The Third Reich at War...fine work!"



This series (please consider the other "Third Reich" titles) is positively perfect for the audiobook format. Richly detailed yet very well paced. From the origins of the Nazi's political power through their ascendancy to their final flameout, Richard Evans must be commended for the polish of this excellent work. Sean Pratt's narration is flawless. Five Stars!

"Great history well spoken but..."



I cannot understand why a history of this quality would have such affectations both from the writer and the narrator. The author in his preface says he's going to Anglicize certain German words for ease of understanding. Mein Kampf becomes "my struggle" and Der Fuehrer becomes "the leader". These two German terms are so well known that it's hard to listen to their being spoken this way. "The leader" is often confusing. Which leader are we talking about now?  The narrator has done a great job with German and other language terms. But there are glaring mistakes. For example the Reichstag is not pronounced as tag as in license tag but as tahg with a soft g, almost a ch sound. Other such gaffs should have been caught in the editing.  All this makes for a feeling of amateurishness, marring an otherwise superb history.  All three volumes are topical and sequential but not a narrative history with in depth treatments of many important topics like the origins of racial policy and the economics of the Reich. How did Hitler pay for rearmament?  It's easy engrossing listening that explains a great deal about how a well educated population could be psychically captured by a lunatic. It's a lesson that will endure.

"Now, the rest of the story..."



Would you recommend this audiobook to a friend? If so, why?  
Definitely.  This book does a masterful job describing not only the blow by blow accounts of the war, but also the home front of Nazi Germany.  The most interesting aspect was the accounts of life in Germany immediately after the war.<br/><br/>People like me who have an interest in this area of history were brought up believing that the Nazis were a small minority who did not enjoy the support of the German people.  Furthermore, the German people had no idea about what was happening in the death camps.  This book shatters that myth, and destroys the long professed alibi of the German people that it was all the SS and Nazis who committed atrocities.  <br/><br/>The accounts of the Wehrmacht's interaction with the civilian population in Eastern Europe and Russia strips away any pretense that the SS were the only bad guys in the war.<br/><br/>One criticism I have of the book is that the author is a too kind to Soviet Russia, and discounts many atrocities that they committed.  Keeping that in mind, it was a good read.

"Good book. Dreadful reader"

What did you like best about The Third Reich at War? What did you like least?
I appreciated the effort and research required to portray the reality of the horror people suffered during the post World War I up to the end of world War II experienced. At worst it was sometimes too graphic for too long.  That tends to dull the senses.

What did you like best about this story?
The horror of war is not to be liked.  At best we can learn and remember not to repeat it.  

How did the narrator detract from the book?
In every possible way.  I have never listened to three books - read successively by the same reader - that were read with such sad neglect of proper pausing, intonation and whatever other crimes a narrator can be guilty of.  One would have thought  or hoped that there had been an overseer of sorts who might have been able to guide the narrator.  If it had been my books -I listened to the series of three -  i might have torn my heart out.  I often had to rewind to get the correct meaning when a sentence ended in mid-air, so to speak.  I hardly think the author inserted all those unappropriated commas and full-stops.

Did The Third Reich at War inspire you to do anything?
Yes, to avoid the narrator at all cost.

Any additional comments?
This book and its twi predecessors were done an insult.

"Excellent"

Loved this and the 2 previous books in the series.I learnt a little bit more about the Nazis when I thought there was nothing new.These 3 books should be made into a documentary series akin to the old World at War but in 3 parts covering each book.I will listen again to all 3 aometime soon

"Promising title"

A good broad sweep of the history. OK for a basic introduction to the subject. Not always as objective as one would like.

"Superb"

The best history of the third reich I've read. Slightly annoyed by some poor pronunciation by the narrator at times!

"This is not a military history of WW2"

Is there anything you would change about this book?
This book is about the Germans at War rather than about Germany at war. Its a social account primarily rather than a military one. 

 Have you listened to any of Sean Pratt’s other performances? How does this one compare? 
Performance was very good. 

Was The Third Reich at War worth the listening time?
Yes, but not as a military history. There are many more complete books out there which cover it in greater depth and detail.

"Very interesting and complete history"

I always wanted to understand more about the Nazis and how they went about coming to power and then going to war, so this was a very good way to get some insight into what really went on. It is long but well worth the listen.

"...at war"

What did you like most about The Third Reich at War?
As with previous two books in this trilogy, the writting was perfect- easy to follow and narration without any faults. Perfect combination of great book and great reader.

What other book might you compare The Third Reich at War to, and why?
There are so many books one could compare this book with on the market, but hands down- this one best for me as I rather like story of the "little people". Here on audible there is a bit outdated, but still great book, by american correspondent William L. Shirer, one of the best books written by somebody who actually was there. It is called "The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich" and while not completely up to date on quite a few facts and with some obvious onesided beliefs which are now known to be incorrect, it is also a great listen. It is also worth to read Albert Speer's memoirs as while now known to be full of half truths and complete lies, it does portray the era pretty well. There are many of the diaries and letters which were later published by themselves and which Evans uses in this trilogy and they are all great background read.
