The Yieldco Comeback: NextEra Energy Partners LP Jumps 24% in January
A big adjustment to how NextEra Energy Partners deals with its parent company has led to a big increase in the stock. 











                Travis Hoium
            

                (TMFFlushDraw)



            
            Feb 7, 2017 at 4:21PM
            
            





What happened 
Shares of NextEra Energy Partners LP (NYSE:NEP) screamed 23.5% higher in January according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence after the company reported earnings, giving a positive outlook on dividend guidance and modifying its incentive distribution rights (IDR) agreement. 
So what 
NextEra Energy Partners reported $639 million in EBITDA for 2016 and $222 million in CAFD, resulting in a dividend per share of $1.41. At the same time, management said it expects to have the runway to generate dividend growth of 12% to 15% through 2022 and also lowered its IDRs to NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) by half to 25% of future dividend increases.

IDRs are set up to give sponsors an incentive to help yieldcos grow by compensating them with a percentage of any dividend increase. At the current dividend level, half of the dividend increase would go to NextEra Energy and half would go to NextEra Energy Partners shareholders. Now, shareholders will get 75% of the increase, which will allow the company to grow more easily in the future. 





Now what 
High dividend yields have made it difficult for yieldcos to grow because they need to be able to buy projects with a higher rate of return than their own cost of capital. A lower dividend leads to a lower cost of capital, which will help NextEra Energy Partners grow in the future. It's a virtuous cycle, and right now this is one of the lowest dividend yield yieldcos out there, which will be an advantage for the company long-term.

NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE) is a Fortune 200 energy company with about 44,900 megawatts of generating capacity, revenues of approximately $17 billion, and about 13,800 employees in 27 states and Canada. NEE is listed as #191 in the 2014.[2][3] Its subsidiaries include Florida Power & Light (FPL), NextEra Energy Resources (NEER), and FPL FiberNet.

FPL, the largest of the subsidiaries, delivers rate-regulated electricity to 4.8 million customers in Florida and is the US's third largest utility company.[citation needed]
NEER, together with its affiliated entities, is the world's largest generator of renewable energy from the wind and sun.{{Citation}} In addition to wind and solar, NextEra Energy Resources owns and operates generating plants powered by natural gas, nuclear fuel, and oil.

Gexa Energy is a retail energy provider in Texas


FPL FiberNet is a provider of fiber-optic solutions in Florida and Texas. FPL FiberNet begin in the 1980s, selling excess capacity on the company's fiber-optic infrastructure; the company was established in 2000.[citation needed]

In 2011, NEE was listed by Fortune Magazine as the most admired company in the industry of electric and gas utilities.[4]
On December 4, 2014, NEE announced its plans to purchase Hawaiian Electric Industries for $4.3 billion[5] "in a bet it can reduce the nation’s highest rates by using more renewable energy."
In the news[edit]
In April 2009, BusinessWeek magazine reported the company (at the time FPL Group) was one of 25 US companies that paid the least US taxes. FPL Group paid a 1.3 percent annual tax rate, far less than the standard 35 percent corporate rate, based on an analysis of the company's financial figures for 2005–2008. On more than $7 billion in company earnings during this four-year period, FPL Group paid $88 million in taxes. The company was able to take advantage of certain tax breaks for developing alternative energy. A company spokesperson said the company is merely taking advantage of incentives to develop renewable resources.[6]
In 2015, NextEra donated $1 million to a Super PAC supporting Jeb Bush's presidential candidacy.[7]

NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE) is a Fortune 200 energy company with about 44,900 megawatts of generating capacity, revenues of approximately $17 billion, and about 13,800 employees in 27 states and Canada. NEE is listed as #191 in the 2014.[2][3] Its subsidiaries include Florida Power & Light (FPL), NextEra Energy Resources (NEER), and FPL FiberNet.

FPL, the largest of the subsidiaries, delivers rate-regulated electricity to 4.8 million customers in Florida and is the US's third largest utility company.[citation needed]
NEER, together with its affiliated entities, is the world's largest generator of renewable energy from the wind and sun.{{Citation}} In addition to wind and solar, NextEra Energy Resources owns and operates generating plants powered by natural gas, nuclear fuel, and oil.

Gexa Energy is a retail energy provider in Texas


FPL FiberNet is a provider of fiber-optic solutions in Florida and Texas. FPL FiberNet begin in the 1980s, selling excess capacity on the company's fiber-optic infrastructure; the company was established in 2000.[citation needed]

In 2011, NEE was listed by Fortune Magazine as the most admired company in the industry of electric and gas utilities.[4]
On December 4, 2014, NEE announced its plans to purchase Hawaiian Electric Industries for $4.3 billion[5] "in a bet it can reduce the nation’s highest rates by using more renewable energy."
In the news[edit]
In April 2009, BusinessWeek magazine reported the company (at the time FPL Group) was one of 25 US companies that paid the least US taxes. FPL Group paid a 1.3 percent annual tax rate, far less than the standard 35 percent corporate rate, based on an analysis of the company's financial figures for 2005–2008. On more than $7 billion in company earnings during this four-year period, FPL Group paid $88 million in taxes. The company was able to take advantage of certain tax breaks for developing alternative energy. A company spokesperson said the company is merely taking advantage of incentives to develop renewable resources.[6]
In 2015, NextEra donated $1 million to a Super PAC supporting Jeb Bush's presidential candidacy.[7]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
