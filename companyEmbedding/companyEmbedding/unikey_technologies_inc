History[edit]
UniKey was founded in 2010 in Florida by Phil Dumas, who serves as president and chief executive officer.[1][2] He has an electrical engineering degree from the University of Central Florida and a background in biometric security. Dumas was part of the team that launched SmartScan, the first mass-market biometric residential deadbolt lock. He started UniKey in an effort to create a more dependable and convenient way to access everything.[1][2][3]
UniKey first came to the public's attention in May 2012, when Dumas appeared on ABC's reality series Shark Tank.[4][5] UniKey received investment offers from all five judges on the show,[5] including an offer of $500,000 for a 40% equity stake from Mark Cuban and Kevin O'Leary.[1] Dumas accepted the offer, but they ultimately were unable to come to terms after the show.[1][2] By 2013, UniKey had raised approximately $2.6 million in funding, led by ff Venture Capital.[5] That year, UniKey announced a licensing deal with Kwikset, the largest residential lock manufacturer in the United States and one of the largest in the world, to manufacture and distribute Kēvo, a residential smart lock using UniKey's technology.[2][5]
Products[edit]
Launched in 2013, Kēvo is the first Bluetooth-enabled touch-to-open smart lock.[6][7] Kēvo has the ability to detect a user's compatible smartphone or tablet via an app, to lock and unlock the door. The deadbolt lock senses when the user's phone is nearby and when it's outside; the phone emits a low-energy Bluetooth signal, allowing the door to be unlocked when the lock face is touched, making it unnecessary to interact with the phone in order to open the door. Users can grant unrestricted or temporary access to other phones as well. Kēvo also comes with a keychain fob that provides the same touch-to-open function as an authorized smart phone.[1][5][8][9] In July, 2014 Kevo added Unlimited Guest eKeys and Scheduled eKeys, which lets you set a day and time constraints for eKeys from your phone.[10] A prime security feature of the product is UniKey's Inside/Outside Intelligence, which detects whether a verified device is currently inside or outside the home. If an authorized device is known to be inside the house, unauthorized users are unable to activate Kēvo from outside. The system acts as a one-way filter that lets only authorized users pass through the entryway.[11]
Partnerships[edit]
In June 2014, UniKey and MIWA Lock Company announced a partnership to offer keyless entry to hotels. UniKey has developed a touch-to-open passive keyless entry system to be integrated into MIWA's existing radio-frequency identification hospitality locks. The keys are activated through smartphone apps. When guests check in through the app, they are sent their room number and the phone is enabled to act as a virtual key.[12][13]

History[edit]
UniKey was founded in 2010 in Florida by Phil Dumas, who serves as president and chief executive officer.[1][2] He has an electrical engineering degree from the University of Central Florida and a background in biometric security. Dumas was part of the team that launched SmartScan, the first mass-market biometric residential deadbolt lock. He started UniKey in an effort to create a more dependable and convenient way to access everything.[1][2][3]
UniKey first came to the public's attention in May 2012, when Dumas appeared on ABC's reality series Shark Tank.[4][5] UniKey received investment offers from all five judges on the show,[5] including an offer of $500,000 for a 40% equity stake from Mark Cuban and Kevin O'Leary.[1] Dumas accepted the offer, but they ultimately were unable to come to terms after the show.[1][2] By 2013, UniKey had raised approximately $2.6 million in funding, led by ff Venture Capital.[5] That year, UniKey announced a licensing deal with Kwikset, the largest residential lock manufacturer in the United States and one of the largest in the world, to manufacture and distribute Kēvo, a residential smart lock using UniKey's technology.[2][5]
Products[edit]
Launched in 2013, Kēvo is the first Bluetooth-enabled touch-to-open smart lock.[6][7] Kēvo has the ability to detect a user's compatible smartphone or tablet via an app, to lock and unlock the door. The deadbolt lock senses when the user's phone is nearby and when it's outside; the phone emits a low-energy Bluetooth signal, allowing the door to be unlocked when the lock face is touched, making it unnecessary to interact with the phone in order to open the door. Users can grant unrestricted or temporary access to other phones as well. Kēvo also comes with a keychain fob that provides the same touch-to-open function as an authorized smart phone.[1][5][8][9] In July, 2014 Kevo added Unlimited Guest eKeys and Scheduled eKeys, which lets you set a day and time constraints for eKeys from your phone.[10] A prime security feature of the product is UniKey's Inside/Outside Intelligence, which detects whether a verified device is currently inside or outside the home. If an authorized device is known to be inside the house, unauthorized users are unable to activate Kēvo from outside. The system acts as a one-way filter that lets only authorized users pass through the entryway.[11]
Partnerships[edit]
In June 2014, UniKey and MIWA Lock Company announced a partnership to offer keyless entry to hotels. UniKey has developed a touch-to-open passive keyless entry system to be integrated into MIWA's existing radio-frequency identification hospitality locks. The keys are activated through smartphone apps. When guests check in through the app, they are sent their room number and the phone is enabled to act as a virtual key.[12][13]

History[edit]
UniKey was founded in 2010 in Florida by Phil Dumas, who serves as president and chief executive officer.[1][2] He has an electrical engineering degree from the University of Central Florida and a background in biometric security. Dumas was part of the team that launched SmartScan, the first mass-market biometric residential deadbolt lock. He started UniKey in an effort to create a more dependable and convenient way to access everything.[1][2][3]
UniKey first came to the public's attention in May 2012, when Dumas appeared on ABC's reality series Shark Tank.[4][5] UniKey received investment offers from all five judges on the show,[5] including an offer of $500,000 for a 40% equity stake from Mark Cuban and Kevin O'Leary.[1] Dumas accepted the offer, but they ultimately were unable to come to terms after the show.[1][2] By 2013, UniKey had raised approximately $2.6 million in funding, led by ff Venture Capital.[5] That year, UniKey announced a licensing deal with Kwikset, the largest residential lock manufacturer in the United States and one of the largest in the world, to manufacture and distribute Kēvo, a residential smart lock using UniKey's technology.[2][5]
Products[edit]
Launched in 2013, Kēvo is the first Bluetooth-enabled touch-to-open smart lock.[6][7] Kēvo has the ability to detect a user's compatible smartphone or tablet via an app, to lock and unlock the door. The deadbolt lock senses when the user's phone is nearby and when it's outside; the phone emits a low-energy Bluetooth signal, allowing the door to be unlocked when the lock face is touched, making it unnecessary to interact with the phone in order to open the door. Users can grant unrestricted or temporary access to other phones as well. Kēvo also comes with a keychain fob that provides the same touch-to-open function as an authorized smart phone.[1][5][8][9] In July, 2014 Kevo added Unlimited Guest eKeys and Scheduled eKeys, which lets you set a day and time constraints for eKeys from your phone.[10] A prime security feature of the product is UniKey's Inside/Outside Intelligence, which detects whether a verified device is currently inside or outside the home. If an authorized device is known to be inside the house, unauthorized users are unable to activate Kēvo from outside. The system acts as a one-way filter that lets only authorized users pass through the entryway.[11]
Partnerships[edit]
In June 2014, UniKey and MIWA Lock Company announced a partnership to offer keyless entry to hotels. UniKey has developed a touch-to-open passive keyless entry system to be integrated into MIWA's existing radio-frequency identification hospitality locks. The keys are activated through smartphone apps. When guests check in through the app, they are sent their room number and the phone is enabled to act as a virtual key.[12][13]

History[edit]
UniKey was founded in 2010 in Florida by Phil Dumas, who serves as president and chief executive officer.[1][2] He has an electrical engineering degree from the University of Central Florida and a background in biometric security. Dumas was part of the team that launched SmartScan, the first mass-market biometric residential deadbolt lock. He started UniKey in an effort to create a more dependable and convenient way to access everything.[1][2][3]
UniKey first came to the public's attention in May 2012, when Dumas appeared on ABC's reality series Shark Tank.[4][5] UniKey received investment offers from all five judges on the show,[5] including an offer of $500,000 for a 40% equity stake from Mark Cuban and Kevin O'Leary.[1] Dumas accepted the offer, but they ultimately were unable to come to terms after the show.[1][2] By 2013, UniKey had raised approximately $2.6 million in funding, led by ff Venture Capital.[5] That year, UniKey announced a licensing deal with Kwikset, the largest residential lock manufacturer in the United States and one of the largest in the world, to manufacture and distribute Kēvo, a residential smart lock using UniKey's technology.[2][5]
Products[edit]
Launched in 2013, Kēvo is the first Bluetooth-enabled touch-to-open smart lock.[6][7] Kēvo has the ability to detect a user's compatible smartphone or tablet via an app, to lock and unlock the door. The deadbolt lock senses when the user's phone is nearby and when it's outside; the phone emits a low-energy Bluetooth signal, allowing the door to be unlocked when the lock face is touched, making it unnecessary to interact with the phone in order to open the door. Users can grant unrestricted or temporary access to other phones as well. Kēvo also comes with a keychain fob that provides the same touch-to-open function as an authorized smart phone.[1][5][8][9] In July, 2014 Kevo added Unlimited Guest eKeys and Scheduled eKeys, which lets you set a day and time constraints for eKeys from your phone.[10] A prime security feature of the product is UniKey's Inside/Outside Intelligence, which detects whether a verified device is currently inside or outside the home. If an authorized device is known to be inside the house, unauthorized users are unable to activate Kēvo from outside. The system acts as a one-way filter that lets only authorized users pass through the entryway.[11]
Partnerships[edit]
In June 2014, UniKey and MIWA Lock Company announced a partnership to offer keyless entry to hotels. UniKey has developed a touch-to-open passive keyless entry system to be integrated into MIWA's existing radio-frequency identification hospitality locks. The keys are activated through smartphone apps. When guests check in through the app, they are sent their room number and the phone is enabled to act as a virtual key.[12][13]

History[edit]
UniKey was founded in 2010 in Florida by Phil Dumas, who serves as president and chief executive officer.[1][2] He has an electrical engineering degree from the University of Central Florida and a background in biometric security. Dumas was part of the team that launched SmartScan, the first mass-market biometric residential deadbolt lock. He started UniKey in an effort to create a more dependable and convenient way to access everything.[1][2][3]
UniKey first came to the public's attention in May 2012, when Dumas appeared on ABC's reality series Shark Tank.[4][5] UniKey received investment offers from all five judges on the show,[5] including an offer of $500,000 for a 40% equity stake from Mark Cuban and Kevin O'Leary.[1] Dumas accepted the offer, but they ultimately were unable to come to terms after the show.[1][2] By 2013, UniKey had raised approximately $2.6 million in funding, led by ff Venture Capital.[5] That year, UniKey announced a licensing deal with Kwikset, the largest residential lock manufacturer in the United States and one of the largest in the world, to manufacture and distribute Kēvo, a residential smart lock using UniKey's technology.[2][5]
Products[edit]
Launched in 2013, Kēvo is the first Bluetooth-enabled touch-to-open smart lock.[6][7] Kēvo has the ability to detect a user's compatible smartphone or tablet via an app, to lock and unlock the door. The deadbolt lock senses when the user's phone is nearby and when it's outside; the phone emits a low-energy Bluetooth signal, allowing the door to be unlocked when the lock face is touched, making it unnecessary to interact with the phone in order to open the door. Users can grant unrestricted or temporary access to other phones as well. Kēvo also comes with a keychain fob that provides the same touch-to-open function as an authorized smart phone.[1][5][8][9] In July, 2014 Kevo added Unlimited Guest eKeys and Scheduled eKeys, which lets you set a day and time constraints for eKeys from your phone.[10] A prime security feature of the product is UniKey's Inside/Outside Intelligence, which detects whether a verified device is currently inside or outside the home. If an authorized device is known to be inside the house, unauthorized users are unable to activate Kēvo from outside. The system acts as a one-way filter that lets only authorized users pass through the entryway.[11]
Partnerships[edit]
In June 2014, UniKey and MIWA Lock Company announced a partnership to offer keyless entry to hotels. UniKey has developed a touch-to-open passive keyless entry system to be integrated into MIWA's existing radio-frequency identification hospitality locks. The keys are activated through smartphone apps. When guests check in through the app, they are sent their room number and the phone is enabled to act as a virtual key.[12][13]

UniKey first came to the public's attention in May 2012, when Dumas appeared on ABC's reality series Shark Tank.[4][5] UniKey received investment offers from all five judges on the show,[5] including an offer of $500,000 for a 40% equity stake from Mark Cuban and Kevin O'Leary.[1] Dumas accepted the offer, but they ultimately were unable to come to terms after the show.[1][2] By 2013, UniKey had raised approximately $2.6 million in funding, led by ff Venture Capital.[5] That year, UniKey announced a licensing deal with Kwikset, the largest residential lock manufacturer in the United States and one of the largest in the world, to manufacture and distribute Kēvo, a residential smart lock using UniKey's technology.[2][5]
Products[edit]
Launched in 2013, Kēvo is the first Bluetooth-enabled touch-to-open smart lock.[6][7] Kēvo has the ability to detect a user's compatible smartphone or tablet via an app, to lock and unlock the door. The deadbolt lock senses when the user's phone is nearby and when it's outside; the phone emits a low-energy Bluetooth signal, allowing the door to be unlocked when the lock face is touched, making it unnecessary to interact with the phone in order to open the door. Users can grant unrestricted or temporary access to other phones as well. Kēvo also comes with a keychain fob that provides the same touch-to-open function as an authorized smart phone.[1][5][8][9] In July, 2014 Kevo added Unlimited Guest eKeys and Scheduled eKeys, which lets you set a day and time constraints for eKeys from your phone.[10] A prime security feature of the product is UniKey's Inside/Outside Intelligence, which detects whether a verified device is currently inside or outside the home. If an authorized device is known to be inside the house, unauthorized users are unable to activate Kēvo from outside. The system acts as a one-way filter that lets only authorized users pass through the entryway.[11]
Partnerships[edit]
In June 2014, UniKey and MIWA Lock Company announced a partnership to offer keyless entry to hotels. UniKey has developed a touch-to-open passive keyless entry system to be integrated into MIWA's existing radio-frequency identification hospitality locks. The keys are activated through smartphone apps. When guests check in through the app, they are sent their room number and the phone is enabled to act as a virtual key.[12][13]

ERA — UniKey



























































Case StudiesERA














 With a legacy of selling locks for more than 175 years, ERA trusted UniKey to design their first smart lock for the UK market, responding to British homeowners’ calls to revolutionize the lock.The ChallengeERA has been selling state-of-the-art locks in the UK since 1838.  In 2016, “state-of-the-art” means connected, and British homeowners are ready to bring smart technology into their locks.  ERA has a legacy of excellence to protect as they strive to meet the changing demands of their customers.  In order to incorporate a best-in-class tech experience to their locks, they needed a partner who understood the unique challenges of the UK market.While smart locks have gained popularity in the US following the release of the UniKey-powered Kwikset Kevo in 2013, the UK hasn’t seen the same level of adoption.  Deadbolts, which are commonly used in the US, are rare in the UK where nightlatches are the most used style of lock. The engineering and regulatory challenges to adapting smart technology to a nightlatch lock form factor were substantial.  ERA had to find an established firm to help them tackle these challenges and uphold their legacy by bringing the first smart nightlatch lock to market in the UK.  "We have been a trusted provider of state-of-the-art locks for homeowners in the UK since 1838, but the time has come to throw away the key. By working with a great partner like UniKey, the ERA TouchKey will help revolutionize the lock industry for British homeowners, making home entry easier and more convenient without sacrificing security." - ERA CEO Darren Waters 







The SolutionERA chose to partner with UniKey, the technology company powering the first smart lock in the US, to bring their vision to the UK.  UniKey was selected based on their history of being pioneers in the industry, and their record for delivering best-in-class products.  The result of this partnership, the ERA TouchKey was first demoed at CES in 2015.The ERA TouchKey will be the first Bluetooth smart lock in the nightlatch design to reach consumers in the UK.  The engineering challenges were tackled by a team from UniKey working closely with ERA to make sure the product would meet and exceed the needs of British homeowners.UniKey has since worked with ERA to create a new industrial design concept for the lock so the leading-edge technology on the inside is reflected by a striking case on the outside.  ERA also relied on UniKey for management of the manufacturing process to get all of the pieces in place for a launch by the end of 2016.When the ERA TouchKey reaches consumers this year, they will be greeted with a distinctive, and distinctly British, lock that brings ERA’s state-of-the-art dramatically forward. Technologies UsedCORE Platform

History[edit]
UniKey was founded in 2010 in Florida by Phil Dumas, who serves as president and chief executive officer.[1][2] He has an electrical engineering degree from the University of Central Florida and a background in biometric security. Dumas was part of the team that launched SmartScan, the first mass-market biometric residential deadbolt lock. He started UniKey in an effort to create a more dependable and convenient way to access everything.[1][2][3]

UniKey was one of the first companies to release a residential smart lock to market. Our years of experience and history as pioneers of the industry make us the perfect partner to bring smart connectivity to your lock portfolio.  We’ll work with you to integrate the advanced feature set of our CORE platform with the lock design your customers already love.

With commercial access control or what’s also known as physical access control systems (PACS) you normally sacrifice convenience for security and do it at a price. It doesn’t need to be so complicated and costly. Remove the technical hurdles of keycard management by bringing credentials into the mobile space. The same and new advanced technologies that allowed us to create our first residential smart lock can make your commercial reader or lock a painless enterprise experience. With UniKey's CORE platform you can create a secure connected product with proven cloud scalability.

According to McKinsey & Company, the Internet of Things is expected to reach more than 20 billion connected devices by 2020.  As the number of devices and shared connections expands, so does the demand for interoperability and machine-to-machine communication.  The UniKey's CORE platform can integrate your IoT devices with smart locks already powered by UniKey in more than 65 countries.

If you are located outside of the United States, please be aware that information we collect, including Personal Information, will be transferred to, and processed, stored and used in the United States. The data protection laws in the United States may differ from those of the country in which you are located, and your Personal Information may be subject to access requests from governments, courts or law enforcement in the United States according to laws of the United States. By using the Site or providing us with any information, you consent to the transfer to, and processing, usage, sharing and storage of your information, including Personal Information, in the United States as set forth in this Privacy Policy. Changes to the PolicyWe reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time. If we change this Policy, we will post the revised Policy on the Sites, so you should review it each time you access the Sites. All amended terms automatically take effect 30 days after they are posted. Questions or ComplaintsIf you have any questions or suggestions regarding this Policy, please contact us at: Privacy Officer, UniKey Technologies, Inc., 111 West Jefferson St., Suite 100, Orlando, FL 32801, or by e-mail: privacy@unikey.com.Updated as of September 22, 2016[1] "Personal information" In this Policy means information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. An identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to his physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social identity. UniKey does not consider personal information to include information that has been de-identified and aggregated or otherwise made anonymous so that it can no longer be used to identify a specific person, whether in combination with other information or otherwise.
[2] A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Sites. Cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools that are available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some but not all instances can be blocked in the future by selecting certain settings. Each browser you use will need to be set separately and different browsers offer different functionality and options in this regard. Please be aware that if you disable or remove cookies on your Device, some parts of our Sites may not function properly, and that when you revisit our Sites your ability to limit cookies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.
[3] Web Beacon is a small graphic image or other web programming code (also known as "1x1 GIFs" or "clear GIFs") which may be included in our Sites pages and messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a page or e-mail can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Sites, to monitor how users navigate the Sites, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened, or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.
[4] Embedded Scripts and ETags. An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Sites, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Site, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter. An ETag is a feature of the cache in browsers. It is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL. If the resource content at that URL ever changes, a new and different ETag is assigned. Used in this manner, ETags are a form of Device Identifier. ETag tracking may generate unique tracking values even where the consumer blocks cookies.

A Central Florida businessman recently got a leg up on promoting his product through an ABC television show.
Phil Dumas, president and founder of UniKey Technologies Inc., recently starred on the fourth Season of the ABC television show “Shark Tank” in May, walking away with a $500,000 deal for his company, which manufactures keyless entry systems for smartphones.

As a graduate from the University of Central Florida with a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering, Dumas first started developing phone-controlled locks while working on his senior design project in college, which involved an access system for a car door.
Fresh out of college, Dumas worked for biometric access control company Sequiam Corp. After working his way up to vice president of product development, Dumas left the company and spent a few years in the private equity field before founding UniKey Technologies Inc., continuing to pursue an easy-to-use access system, but using different technology.





Seeking exposure for his new company, Dumas submitted applications for his UniKey product to be featured on “Shark Tank,” a television show where wealthy entrepreneurs seek out new products to finance.
After being invited on the show, Dumas impressed the Sharks with the cutting-edge UniKey lock system. During the season finale, which aired on May 18, Dumas chose to accept a joint deal between Kevin O’Leary and Mark Cuban, who offered $500,000 for 40 percent of the company and two seats on the board of directors.
Currently, Dumas is enjoying the publicity his company has gained from appearing on the show and is working to get the product to market. Here's what he had to say about the show:
How did you come to be on “Shark Tank? UniKey was in a position where we needed some publicity and it was actually my father who pushed me to apply and I just sent a ton of emails to them. When somebody actually read the email, they called me and we talked about the next steps in the process to be on the show.

What were your thoughts on having your product featured on “Shark Tank? It’s been the best thing that’s ever happened to our company. The publicity, we’re still sifting through. The potential sales are great and the potential partnerships are even greater, with other access control companies wanting to work with us now, all the way up to giant companies that would never give a company of our size the time of day are now calling us and wanting to meet with us.
What do you think of shows like “Shark Tank” promoting products and helping entrepreneurs? I think its TV first and foremost and people need to remember that because there are companies that go on there for entertainment value. I don’t know if they’ll admit it, but it’s quite obvious. I do think there are some real companies on there and I think it does help them get some exposure, which is great for them.




 


You received offers from each Shark. Why did you pass on Robert Herjavec’s proposed $1 million for 75 percent equity? To be honest, it was nice to get offered $1 million, but it was not a reasonable deal. It wasn’t even something that I considered. I appreciate that someone would make an offer like that, but it wasn’t a fair offer.
Why did you decide to go with Mark Cuban and Kevin O’Leary’s $500,000 offer for 40 percent equity? Just the potential relationships. I felt the company could hold a higher evaluation, but the potential partnerships weighed in on the decision for sure.
What was going through your head during the negotiations? How did you keep cool? I was very aware that I had five people interested in the deal, so, at the very end there, I went a little bit quick to try to make a decision and close the deal, because if you hesitate and counter too much, somebody is gonna get offended and jump out on you and I just didn’t want to hear it.
What’s the next step now that you received an offer? From the company standpoint, it’s just to get the product to market is our main focus right now, which we’re working on and pursuing.
