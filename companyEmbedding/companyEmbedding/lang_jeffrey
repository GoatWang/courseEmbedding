 Crucial to the vitality of any religious community is its ability to attract and engage descendants and converts. By this measure, notwithstanding the proliferation of mosques and Islamic organizations, the Muslim community in America is not doing at all well." This rather sober assessment motivates Dr. Lang to address, in this book, the alienation from the Mosque of the great majority of America's homegrown Muslims.   In Losing My Religion: A Call For Help, the author comes to terms with many of the queries put to him by Americans of Muslim parentage and converts to Islam since the publication of his book Even Angels Ask in 1997. Lang asserts that to effectively respond to the general malaise of American-born Muslims, the Islamic establishment in America needs to be willing to listen to the doubts and complaints of the disaffected. This entails engaging in open discussions on issues with which many in the Muslim community will be uncomfortable, but Lang avers that such open dialogue will be of more benefit to young American Muslims struggling with their faiths than the covert and uniformed discussions that often take place or no discussion at all. For this reason, Lang feels it is important and beneficial "to be candid and objective and not evade controversy, for to inadequately state the case for or against a specific position, especially when it challenges convention, only serves to fur! ther alienate the sceptical." In addition to examining questions of theodicy, hadith authenticity, and moot practices within the American Muslim community, the author includes many testimonials and inquiries that make this book informative.

As a "Qurancentric" Muslim (rejecting hadith as ...BySharia Mayfieldon June 13, 2017Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseFantastic book. As a "Qurancentric" Muslim (rejecting hadith as a source of religious authority), I found Lang's approach to be methodical, genuine, deep, and common-sensical. He has obviously thought these matters through and researched them in depth. What I liked most was how he fairly described the differing viewpoints, voiced his preference, but ultimately let the reader decide which argument was most convincing. Despite not caring for hadith to expound on the Quran, I appreciated his approach to hadith and his effort to reconcile (or explain away) some of them with the Quran. I also enjoyed very much his discussion of wife-beating and was pleasantly surprised (for once) to not see the regular "beat with a toothpick" inane apologetics I am used to (which still leaves much to be desired in the way of combating male domination). Overall, superb read. I just got the book today and can't take my eyes off of it.Read more0Comment|

His discussion of the issues and challenges facing the Islamic community today, and his responses to the detractors of Islam are fascinating. His thought process changed my outlook on religion and it showed the weekness of our the American Islamic society due to it's ingulfment in traditions that are unrelated to Islam.Personally, I disagree with Dr.Lang on some issues but this doesn't mean that I don't have the greatest respect for him and his struggle to help other Muslims. I absolutely recommend this book to anyone, Muslim or not, who is looking for an rational and religous outlook on our World.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsIslam is not a ReligionByAlon July 16, 2013Format: PaperbackDr. Lang, being a mathematician correctly uses logic and reason in his criticism of unquestioning acceptance of Hadith. If a Hadith does not make sense or is taken out of context, it is very likely inaccurate, misconstrued or misinterpreted to conform to usually, Middle Eastern or South Asian cultural traditions and prejudices. Most of us have heard of the psychological game scenario when several well intentioned persons sit in a circle around a table, and a statement is whispered to one person, who passes it on to his neighbor, until it has come full circle. More likely than not, the end statement varies completely from the initial statement. This also applies to Hadith, no matter the probity of the transmitters. One Hadith that makes sense owing to its axiomatic simplicity is "Verily, the greatest gift that God has bestowed upon mankind is that of Aql,(meaning mind,intelligence, logic and reason). It is appropriate, and yes, mindful as in mindfulness, to use this Hadith as a benchmark. From the first line of the Quran, God is Rabb-ul-Alameen: the Rabb or Creator, Loving Father and Cherisher of an infinite number of Universes. Therefore every entity or collective in any universe, animate or inanimate, is ultimately subject to God's will, and by definition, Muslim. For an intelligent being, the realization of this is enlightenment or Deen, an "aha experience", or "getting conscious", culminating in the Shahadat or "Bearing Witness". In contrast, Religion is promulgated by MCPs (Mullahs, Clergy, and Priests), as a system of controls: "You follow exactly a set of rituals that we, in our superior religious status prescribe; one false step and you Go To Hell." Many young persons find it unappealing that they are expected to follow an exclusivist Fiqh or a set of rituals based on Hadith collected by four Imams in the Sunni tradition, and one Imam in the Shiite tradition. This is treating Islam as a religious cult instead of a state of joyous enlightenment, as in "Come all ye faithful.." It is my impression that Dr. Lang addresses this core issue in this book.Read more0Comment|

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
