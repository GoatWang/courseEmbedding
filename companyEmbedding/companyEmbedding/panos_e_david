 Educational Background



B.A. in Political Science 


Furman University

                  Furman University is one of the nation's premier undergraduate liberal arts colleges. The university offers outstanding academics, opportunities for a broad range of talented students with a passion for learning, a robust visual and performing arts program and NCAA Division I athletics.  Our campus is nationally acclaimed for its beauty and the residential student body is the ideal size to enhance scholarly activity, personal growth and leadership development.  With its more realistic approach to college admissions, the college has made the standardized test optional and instead relies on interviews with hopeful applicants.

Founded in 1826, the private university is located in Greenville, South Carolina.  Modern, sophisticated academic buildings are complemented by comprehensive athletics, recreational and social facilities.  Student housing ranges from traditional dormitory residences to apartments.  The James B. Duke Library includes more than 500,000 volumes.  The 750-acre campus features an Asian garden, a replica of Henry David Thoreau's cabin, the David E. Shi Center for Sustainability, a Florentine bell tower, a spring-fed lake, 13 miles of paved trails through the woodlands for hiking and biking and an 18-hole golf course.

Greenville has experienced a cultural and economic renaissance and its downtown is a major destination for business and tourism.  With direct flights by major airlines, Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport is located just 35 minutes from the Furman campus
