Under normal market conditions, the Fund will pursue its investment objectives by investing primarily in a diversified portfolio of common and/or preferred stocks of U.S. and non-U.S. companies and other equity securities that Crow Point Partners, LLC (the Sub-Advisor) believes should, in the aggregate, offer above average potential for current and/or future dividends. In selecting equity securities for the Fund, the Sub-Advisor will seek to emphasize securities that pay dividends that qualify for favorable federal income tax treatment. The Fund may invest in stocks of any market capitalization in any industry sector and style. The Fund expects normally to invest at least 80% of its total assets (plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes) in equity securities (including securities convertible into equity securities) of U.S. and non-U.S. companies that pay attractive dividends. The fund will employ an option strategy in an attempt to generate gains from the premiums on call options written by it on selected U.S. and non-U.S.-based securities indices, on exchange-traded funds providing returns based on certain indices, countries, or market sectors, and, to a lesser extent, on futures contracts and individual securities. The Fund may write call options with an aggregate net notional amount of up to 50% of the value of the Funds total assets, and the Advisor currently expects that the Fund will initially write options with an aggregate net notional amount of approximately 35% of the value of the Funds total assets. The Advisor expects that the Fund will pursue a Dividend Capture program in an attempt to increase current income.

What Are Closed-End Funds?- Wells Fargo Funds

Beginning of content 


What Are Closed-End Funds?
A closed-end fund (CEF) is a publicly traded mutual fund that has similarities with its open-end counterpart but also significant differences.
A CEF collects money from investors through an IPO and uses this money to invest in securities. The shares trade on secondary market exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq.
CEFs are like open-end mutual funds in many respects. Both are investment companies that initially pool money from investors to buy securities. They offer the benefits of diversification and professional management; investors buy into a fund by purchasing shares of the fund.
However, open-end mutual funds are continually offered for sale, while CEFs offer a limited number of shares. While both open-end mutual fund share prices and CEF prices are set at the net asset value (NAV), the price at which CEFs trade is called the market price, which may fluctuate based on supply and demand.
CEFs may trade at a discount or premium to their NAV. (If the market price of a CEF is greater than its NAV, it is trading at a premium. If the market price is less than its NAV, it is trading at a discount.) A CEF is not required to buy back its shares from investors upon request.
Diversification does not assure or guarantee better performance and cannot eliminate the risk of investment losses.

Closed-End Funds
Unlike an open-end mutual fund, a closed-end fund (CEF) offers a fixed number of shares for sale. After the IPO, shares are bought and sold in the secondary marketplace and the market price of the shares is determined by supply and demand, not by net asset value.

                The final determination of the source of all dividend distributions in the current year will be made after year-end. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax-reporting purposes will depend upon a fund's investment experience during the remainder of the fiscal year and may be subject to change based on tax regulations. Each fund will send shareholders a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell shareholders how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes. 








Figures quoted represent past performance, which is no guarantee of future results, and do not reflect taxes that a shareholder may pay on a fund. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted and assumes the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. Current month-end performance is available by calling 1-800-343-2898. Performance figures of the fund do not reflect fees charged pursuant to the terms of any brokerage account agreements. If sales charges had been reflected, performance would have been lower.


                The closed-end funds (CEFs) are no longer offered as initial public offerings. Investors who wish to buy or sell fund shares of a CEF need to place orders through an intermediary, or broker, who will buy or sell fund shares on the stock exchange in a process identical to the purchase or sale of any other listed stock.

                The quoted distribution yield is a figure that uses the fund’s previous distribution to calculate an annualized figure. The distribution yield is calculated by annualizing the last distribution and then dividing by the period-ending NAV or market price. Special distributions, including special capital gains distributions, are not included in the calculation.

The 30-day SEC yield is calculated with a standardized formula mandated by the SEC. The formula is based on maximum offering price per share and includes the effect of any fee waivers. Without waivers, yields would be reduced. The 30-day unsubsidized SEC yield does not reflect waivers in effect. A fund's actual distribution rate will differ from the SEC yield and any income distributions from the fund may be higher or lower than the SEC yield.


                The fund is leveraged through a revolving credit facility and also may incur leverage by issuing preferred shares in the future. The use of leverage results in certain risks, including, among others, the likelihood of greater volatility of net asset value and the market value of common shares. Foreign investments are especially volatile and can rise or fall dramatically due to differences in the political and economic conditions of the host country. These risks are generally intensified in emerging markets. Derivatives involve additional risks, including interest-rate risk, credit risk, the risk of improper valuation, and the risk of noncorrelation to the relevant instruments that they are designed to hedge or closely track. Bond values fluctuate in response to the financial condition of individual issuers, general market and economic conditions, and changes in interest rates. Changes in market conditions and government policies may lead to periods of heightened volatility in the bond market and reduced liquidity for certain bonds held by the fund. In general, when interest rates rise, bond values fall and investors may lose principal value. Interest-rate changes and their impact on the fund and its share price can be sudden and unpredictable. High-yield securities have a greater risk of default and tend to be more volatile than higher-rated debt securities. This fund is exposed to mortgage- and asset-backed securities risk. This closed-end fund is no longer available as an initial public offering and is only offered through broker/dealers on the secondary market.

Objective


                        The fund seeks a high level of current income and moderate capital growth, with an emphasis on providing tax-advantaged dividend income.
                    
Philosophy


                        The fund will invest at least 80% of its net assets in securities of utilities companies (water, gas, electric and telecommunications companies) and in U.S. non-investment grade debt securities. The sub-advisor may employ dividend capture in an attempt to increase current income.

                The final determination of the source of all dividend distributions in the current year will be made after year-end. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax-reporting purposes will depend upon a fund's investment experience during the remainder of the fiscal year and may be subject to change based on tax regulations. Each fund will send shareholders a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell shareholders how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes. 








Figures quoted represent past performance, which is no guarantee of future results, and do not reflect taxes that a shareholder may pay on a fund. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted and assumes the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. Current month-end performance is available by calling 1-800-343-2898. Performance figures of the fund do not reflect fees charged pursuant to the terms of any brokerage account agreements. If sales charges had been reflected, performance would have been lower.


                The closed-end funds (CEFs) are no longer offered as initial public offerings. Investors who wish to buy or sell fund shares of a CEF need to place orders through an intermediary, or broker, who will buy or sell fund shares on the stock exchange in a process identical to the purchase or sale of any other listed stock.

                The quoted distribution yield is a figure that uses the fund’s previous distribution to calculate an annualized figure. The distribution yield is calculated by annualizing the last distribution and then dividing by the period-ending NAV or market price. Special distributions, including special capital gains distributions, are not included in the calculation.

The 30-day SEC yield is calculated with a standardized formula mandated by the SEC. The formula is based on maximum offering price per share and includes the effect of any fee waivers. Without waivers, yields would be reduced. The 30-day unsubsidized SEC yield does not reflect waivers in effect. A fund's actual distribution rate will differ from the SEC yield and any income distributions from the fund may be higher or lower than the SEC yield.


                High-yield, lower-rated bonds may contain more risk due to the increased possibility of default. Foreign investments may contain more risk due to the inherent risks associated with changing political climates, foreign market instability, and foreign currency fluctuations. Risks of international investing are magnified in emerging or developing markets. Funds that concentrate their investments in a single industry or sector may face increased risk of price fluctuation due to adverse developments within that industry or sector. Small- and mid-cap securities may be subject to special risks associated with narrower product lines and limited financial resources compared with their large-cap counterparts. The use of leverage results in certain risks, including, among others, the likelihood of greater volatility of net asset value and the market price of common shares. Derivatives involve additional risks, including interest-rate risk, credit risk, the risk of improper valuation, and the risk of noncorrelation to the relevant instruments they are designed to hedge or closely track. There are numerous risks associated with transactions in options on securities. Illiquid securities may be subject to wide fluctuations in market value and may be difficult to sell. This closed-end fund is no longer available as an initial public offering and is only offered through broker/dealers on the secondary market.

Objective


                        The fund seeks a high level of current income. As a secondary objective, the fund may also seek capital appreciation consistent with its investment objective.
                    
Philosophy


                        The Fund will invest at least 80% of its assets in below investment-grade (high yield) debt securities, loans and preferred stocks, under normal market conditions. These securities are rated Ba or lower by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or BB or lower by Standard & Poor's Ratings Group, or are unrated securities of comparable quality as determined by the fund's investment advisor.

                The final determination of the source of all dividend distributions in the current year will be made after year-end. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax-reporting purposes will depend upon a fund's investment experience during the remainder of the fiscal year and may be subject to change based on tax regulations. Each fund will send shareholders a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell shareholders how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes. 








Figures quoted represent past performance, which is no guarantee of future results, and do not reflect taxes that a shareholder may pay on a fund. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted and assumes the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. Current month-end performance is available by calling 1-800-343-2898. Performance figures of the fund do not reflect fees charged pursuant to the terms of any brokerage account agreements. If sales charges had been reflected, performance would have been lower.


                The closed-end funds (CEFs) are no longer offered as initial public offerings. Investors who wish to buy or sell fund shares of a CEF need to place orders through an intermediary, or broker, who will buy or sell fund shares on the stock exchange in a process identical to the purchase or sale of any other listed stock.

                The quoted distribution yield is a figure that uses the fund’s previous distribution to calculate an annualized figure. The distribution yield is calculated by annualizing the last distribution and then dividing by the period-ending NAV or market price. Special distributions, including special capital gains distributions, are not included in the calculation.

The 30-day SEC yield is calculated with a standardized formula mandated by the SEC. The formula is based on maximum offering price per share and includes the effect of any fee waivers. Without waivers, yields would be reduced. The 30-day unsubsidized SEC yield does not reflect waivers in effect. A fund's actual distribution rate will differ from the SEC yield and any income distributions from the fund may be higher or lower than the SEC yield.


                The fund is leveraged through a revolving credit facility and also may incur leverage by issuing preferred shares in the future. The use of leverage results in certain risks, including, among others, the likelihood of greater volatility of net asset value and the market value of common shares. Derivatives involve additional risks, including interest-rate risk, credit risk, the risk of improper valuation, and the risk of noncorrelation to the relevant instruments that they are designed to hedge or closely track. Bond values fluctuate in response to the financial condition of individual issuers, general market and economic conditions, and changes in interest rates. Changes in market conditions and government policies may lead to periods of heightened volatility in the bond market and reduced liquidity for certain bonds held by the fund. In general, when interest rates rise, bond values fall and investors may lose principal value. Interest-rate changes and their impact on the fund and its share price can be sudden and unpredictable. High-yield securities have a greater risk of default and tend to be more volatile than higher-rated debt securities. This closed-end fund is no longer offered as an initial public offering and is only offered through broker/dealers on the secondary market. A closed-end fund is not required to buy its shares back from investors upon request.
