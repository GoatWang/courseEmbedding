Sullivan























































Thomas Patrick Sullivan passed away Thursday, Feb. 2, 2017, in La Crosse.Tom was born April 24, 1969, to Jennifer (Lenser) and Thomas Sullivan. Tom attended school in La Crosse and later joined the Navy. He worked in the construction business for many years. Tom loved the football season and was an avid Green Bay Packers fan. He enjoyed the outdoors including fishing, boating on the Mississippi, camping, and hunting. Tom was well-known for his intelligence and great sense of humor. He always had a funny joke to tell or a great story to make everyone laugh. Tom took part in many competitive games of Trivia played on holidays with his family, and along with his good buddy and Uncle, Dave Lenser, the two usually came out the winners. Tom was extremely proud of his Irish heritage and always enjoyed taking part in any related festivities or celebrations such as St. Patrick’s Day and Irish Fest. Tom will be sorely missed by his family and many great friends.
Tom is survived by his daughter, Megan Sullivan (Zach); and grandson, Silas, of Streetsboro, Ohio; his son, Matthew Sullivan, of La Crosse; his mother, Jennifer (Bob) Hanifl of La Crosse; his father, Thomas (Barb) Sullivan of La Crosse; his sister, Jacqueline (Justin) Ceason of La Crosse; brothers, Glenn Hanifl, of La Crosse, Mark (Samantha) Sullivan of Milwaukee, Joe (Lee) Sullivan of Little Canada, Minn.; his dear family friend, Aunt Linda Hanifl; some very special friends, Deb Blowers and Ron Atkisson, John Dohlin, and Eric Stevens. Tom is further survived by aunts, uncles, cousins and other relatives and friends that he thought the world of.A memorial gathering will be held from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. Wednesday, Feb. 8, at Schumacher-Kish Funeral and Cremation Services, 200 West Ave. S., La Crosse. A private burial service will take place at a later date.

THOMAS PATRICK


1933 - 2017
Obituary
Condolences

































 O'SULLIVAN III Thomas Patrick O'Sullivan III, 86, of Kansas City, MO, passed away Monday, June 19, 2017, 55 years to the date of his own father's death. His heart, damaged by disease and heartbreak, wore out in an instant. We are saddened but rejoice in him reaching his final goal - being with God and a reunion with his wife Kathleen, his "Kate", who passed last October, and his sons Tim and Tom. Visitation at 1:30 p.m. Monday, June 26 at St. Peter's Catholic Church, rosary at 3 p.m. and Mass of Christian Burial at 3:30 p.m. An early dinner in the church hall will be held after Mass with an Irish parade around Calvary Cemetery to his burial with military honors following. Wear your green! Memorial donations may be made to St. Peter's Church, the Serra Club of Kansas City/St. Joseph or Thomas P. O'Sullivan Foundation for the prevention of colon cancer. Born Nov. 30, 1933, Dad was the first-born child of Thomas Patrick, Jr. and Anna Marie O'Sullivan. He lived his entire life in Brookside, graduating from St. Peter's in '44, Hogan High in '48 and, after four years as a Staff Sergeant in the Air Force during the Korean Conflict, earning a BA from Rockhurst College. Dad's sister was in Mom's class and Mom's brother was in Dad's class. They knew each other's families but not each other. That changed when a confident Tom, newly home from the service, swept her off her feet at a party, even though she was on a date. They married a year later on Nov. 5, 1955, at St. Peter's and brought home three girls and three boys in eight years. Dad worked as a stockbroker for 40 years. He had a knack for the business and was a man of integrity in his dealings with clients. Somehow, he managed to handle the stress of a commissioned based salary while raising six kids in Catholic schools, with braces and college educations. Dad was a mushy hearted Irishman with a larger-than-life personality. He certainly did not need to kiss the Blarney Stone to have the gift of gab. There were common themes to his repetitive and perhaps embellished tales. He wanted to make sure we really understood the sacrifices men of war make. That we understood how valuable volunteer endeavors are. That we got it through our thick skulls that Kansas City is the best place to live, specifically Brookside. Dad was a legend in his own mind and often called himself John Wayne. As his mind altered we were humored by his insistence that he knew him and thought he was a great guy. Our dad had a zest for life which kept him going well past what any medical book would have predicted. He was, indeed, tough as the 'ol Duke. McGilley State Line Chapel, Dignity Memorial
