A QUICK OVERVIEW OF WHY IT MATTERS
You are expected to observe the requirements of the Code, so it’s important that you understand what it is and why we have it. The Code:

Contains our basic standards of ethical and legal behavior
Emphasizes our commitment to ethics and compliance with the law
Informs you about critical issues that require consideration and caution
Is designed to educate you about the company’s policies, the laws that we must follow and our expectations when it comes to ethics
Supports our other sources of guidance, including
								The Compliance and Ethics Program, policy-specific compliance program documents, and procedures and other guidelines
							

Many of the matters addressed in the Code are complex, subject to changes, and vary from country to country. For this reason, we encourage you to
							utilize these resources and to seek appropriate advice if you have any doubt regarding the lawfulness or appropriateness of any action.

IT SECURITY WHEN USING EMAIL
We receive many kinds of unwanted email: spam and malicious email often accompanied by Phishing or Spear-phishing.



WHAT IS PHISHING?


Phishing is a form of unwanted email that's not just a nuisance; it can be malicious and dangerous. It is a method of identity theft using deceptive emails.
If you receive a highly targeted email, possibly containing company, functional or program specific information or references, you may be confronting a Spear-phishing attack. Spear-phishing should be reported to your supervisor, the Legal Department or
										Noble Energy's Information Security Team.





COMMON PHISHING TACTICS



Requests for information concerning recent financial transactions
Requests for personal information
Questions regarding shipping / package delivery
Claims that you have won money or requests for money
Conference registration or publication renewal notices






WHAT SHOULD YOU DO WITH
										THESE UNWANTED EMAILS?


DO:

Report as spam to the Information Security Team
Delete the email
Remember legitimate companies never request personal information through email and keep close tabs on your personal account information

DON'T:

Forward the suspicious email to other users
Reply to the sender
Click on any links or open any attachments in the suspect email
Enter sensitive, personal or company information in unsecured webpages or within the suspect email.

CELL PHONE & TEXTING
Use your Noble Energy provided cell phone in accordance with our
								acceptable use policy. Remember, even on your cell phone, you should not have any expectation of privacy with respect to its information, including emails, texting, voicemails and installation of apps.
If personal calls are considered excessive, employees may be required to pay the amount in excess and may lose the privilege of expensing personal calls or lose their company phone.  Expenses for airplane phone charges are not permitted.  Consider these options when deciding how to make a call:

Use company office phones whenever possible
Frequently, a cellular phone is the lowest cost method to make calls outside the office
Consider calling cards when making frequent and lengthy calls
Use toll-free numbers when available
Minimize the length of international calls

REQUESTS FROM THE MEDIA










CONDUCTING BUSINESS FAIRLY:
								UNDERSTANDING CONFLICTS OF INTEREST



CONDUCTING
								BUSINESS FAIRLY
UNDERSTANDING CONFLICTS OF INTEREST, ANTITRUST/COMPETITION COMPLIANCE AND WORKING WITH COMPETITORS AND SUPPLIERS
Doing what’s right for Noble Energy is important. You have a duty of loyalty to the company and that means avoiding any personal interest, influence, or relationship that might conflict – or appears to conflict – with the interests of the company.  Disclose the details of any potential conflict pursuant our
								conflicts of interest program.




ANTITRUST AND COMPETITION COMPLIANCE


ANTITRUST AND
									COMPETITION COMPLIANCE
We’re committed to supporting free enterprise and complying with
									antitrust and competition laws where we operate. These laws protect the integrity of a free market enterprise and allow society to benefit from competition. You may not enter into an agreement or understanding that unreasonably restrains competition in any manner.





SELECTION AND USE OF THIRD PARTIES


SELECTION AND USE OF
									THIRD PARTIES
Our third party relationships are important to us, underpinning our ability to do business and meet our customers’ expectations.  That is why we choose them carefully, using a transparent selection process.  All third parties must operate according to principles that are similar to those in the Code.  Noble Energy has adopted a risk based
									due diligence and monitoring process to ensure it does business with ethical parties that share our values.
It is crucial for all applicable third parties to be pre-screened according to our
									anti-corruption program.





A GUIDE TO JOINT VENTURE AND
									COMPETITOR COLLABORATION


A GUIDE TO JOINT VENTURE
									AND COMPETITOR COLLABORATION
Discussions of joint ventures or other forms of collaboration between actual or potential competitors can create antitrust risks, even if the parties never agree on a transaction.  All proposed joint ventures or collaborations with competitors must be submitted to the Legal Department before initiation of any negotiations or due diligence.








SO WHEN MIGHT A CONFLICT OF INTEREST ARISE?





SOME COMMON EXAMPLES ARE WHEN YOU:

Have a financial or beneficial interest in a competitor or supplier where there is opportunity for preferential treatment
Purchase leasehold or mineral interests in a geological area where the company is or plans to be involved
Have an interest in a business transaction in which the company is involved
Having other business interests that interfere with your ability to perform your duties at Noble Energy









WHAT RESTRICTIONS DO ANTITRUST LAWS REQUIRE US TO FOLLOW AND KNOW HOW TO ENGAGE IN?





ANTITRUST AND COMPETITION LAWS IMPOSE RESTRICTIONS ON HOW WE CARRY OUT VARIOUS ACTIVITIES AND REQUIRE US TO KNOW HOW TO COMMUNICATE AND INTERACT WITH:

Competitors
Partnerships
Acquisitions
Trade associations









WE SHOULD ADHERE TO THE FOLLOWING GUIDELINES TO MINIMIZE RISKS:






Limit discussions to issues directly related to the proposed arrangement or collaboration, such as its proposed form, the specific cost savings or efficiencies targeted, and how it might benefit customers.
Keep discussions preliminary and conditional.  No actual agreement, written or unwritten, should be concluded until first reviewed by the Legal Department.
Until a transaction is completed, the company remains a competitor of its proposed joint venture partner(s) and each party must continue to make independent business decisions on all market-related matters, such as prices and other terms and conditions of sale, and whether and how to deal with particular suppliers or customers.
During discussions, the company must restrict and limit the exchange of competitively sensitive information.
If you are responsible for negotiating and implementing a proposed joint venture should prepare a written Confidentiality Agreement in a form approved by the Legal Department.











DOING BUSINESS

WHAT’S BEHIND OUR BUSINESS CONDUCT?
Business Law and Business Conduct
We expect honesty, integrity and fair dealing. Being a good corporate citizen includes complying with all applicable laws and regulations wherever we do business.  It is crucial to familiarize yourself with
							company policies, programs and guidelines to perform your job effectively.
The Code reinforces our commitment to doing business legally and ethically.

CORPORATE POLITICAL ACTIVITIES



Participation in the political process is essential to our long-term success. That’s why Noble Energy is an active participant in the public policy process.
We approach this involvement as an opportunity to provide input, offer solutions, and advocate positions that mutually benefit the company, our shareholders, and other stakeholders.
We advance our public policy agenda through direct lobbying, involvement in various trade associations, the Noble Energy Political Action Committee and corporate political contributions.
Because lobbying activities are highly regulated, you must contact the Communications and Government Relations Department prior to engaging in such activity.






CORPORATE POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS


When evaluating potential recipients of the company’s political spending, we support candidates and entities that advance our interests and are aligned with our core values.  In the spirit of promoting transparency, we disclose our political contributions pursuant to our
									political activity guidelines.
You may not make or promise political contributions from Noble Energy resources, except where permitted by law and approved pursuant to our
									political law and trade association compliance program.





PERSONAL POLITICAL ACTIVITIES


We encourage you to exercise your rights of citizenship by voting, making political contributions with your own funds and being otherwise politically active.
Under no circumstance will the company reimburse an individual for its political contribution.





THE SALE OF GAS AND CRUDE OIL


We transact the scheduling, purchase, sale, transmission and transportation of crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids and other commodities in compliance with the law.









A NOTE
							ON AGENCY
							INVESTIGATION







A NOTE ON AGENCY INVESTIGATION
As enforcement activities increase around the world, the likelihood increases that a government inquiry or investigation could take place in any country.  A government agency may conduct an informal inquiry into our practices because it is trying to collect information about industry practices or about an ongoing investigation of an affiliate or business partner.  In other cases, a government agency may launch a formal investigation into our company.  In general, it is a criminal offense to avoid or obstruct a government investigation.
GOVERNMENT AGENCIES MAY REACH OUT IN SEVERAL WAYS TO OUR COMPANY INCLUDING BY:

Telephone
E-mail
Facsimile


Letter
A scheduled or unscheduled visit
Subpoena or summons

In addition to government inquiries and investigations, the company may conduct an investigation from time to time.  The investigation may be conducted by representatives from the company’s legal department or by outside counsel retained by the company.  You are expected to cooperate fully with any investigation initiated by the company or its counsel.



DO



DON'T









Immediately report any subpoena, summons, complaint, or other legal process to the Legal Department.
Comply with all notices concerning the retention and preservation of relevant documents.







Answer any questions (beyond routine inquiries) or provide any documents if you are contacted by law enforcement or another party regarding an investigation or lawsuit without prior approval from the Legal Department.
Destroy documents relevant to an investigation.












WORKING
							ACROSS BORDERS

We are committed to compliance with all laws and regulations regarding the transmission of goods, services and technology across the borders of the countries where we operate.  These laws and regulations touch many aspects of our business, not just our non-U.S. operations.  Many of these countries also have strict guidelines directed at enforcing revenue collection, national trade policy, and supply chain security goals.  Additionally, we do not cooperate with any boycott or restrictive trade practice that is prohibited or penalized under applicable laws.  We must abide by these laws, regulations and our
							compliance programs in order to ensure we promote company-wide compliance.

							CORRUPTION CAN OCCUR
Below are some examples of activities that have potential corruption risk and, as a result, require rigorous review:

WORKING ACROSS BORDERS



INTRODUCTION TO COMMERCIAL BRIBERY



STANDING UP
								FOR WHAT’S RIGHT
THE CASE AGAINST COMMERCIAL BRIBERY
								AND MONEY LAUNDERING
At Noble Energy, we encourage successful working relationships and goodwill between employees and suppliers, clients, business partners, and anyone else working on the company’s behalf. Depending on the circumstances, it may not be appropriate to offer or accept a gift, hospitality or travel. When it comes to these situations, be sure you know what’s acceptable and what’s not.
Noble Energy’s
								policy, as well as many international anti-corruption laws, prohibits commercial bribery.  You cannot offer, promise, give or accept anything of value for an improper purpose or business advantage.




PREVENT MONEY LAUNDERING


PREVENT MONEY LAUNDERING
Money Laundering is when illicit money or assets are hidden in legitimate business dealings or when legitimate funds or assets are used to support criminal activities (e.g., terrorism, bribery, narcotics, or fraud).
Noble Energy is committed to complying fully with all applicable anti-money laundering laws and regulations. That’s why we carefully choose our business partners and only do business with those that meet our ethical expectations.
IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO REPORT:

Suspicious transactions
Situations where the counterparty is not transparent about its ownership
Unusual requests or ways for payment






GIFTS, HOSPITALITY AND TRAVEL


GIFTS, HOSPITALITY
									AND TRAVEL
Most anti-corruption laws allow for reasonable and legitimate expenses that are directly related to the promotion of products, services or the execution of a contract. However, these expenditures can still present risks. That’s why we’ve developed processes for approving
									gifts, travel, and hospitality expenditures for both government officials and commercial entities.
GIFTS
HOSPITALITY
TRAVEL






GIFTS
In many places around the globe, customary business practices allow for the exchange of gifts for a variety of cultural, religious and social reasons. You are allowed to give and receive gifts as long as the gift meets certain criteria.
THE GIFT

SHOULD:

Comply with applicable laws and business policies
Be customary under the circumstances
Be exchanged in an open and transparent manner, avoiding any appearance of impropriety



SHOULD NOT:

Be cash or cash equivalent, such as a gift card
Be extravagant or lavish
Be too frequently exchanged with the same third party, as it may take on the appearance of a bribe


The gift must be pre-approved by our Chief Compliance Officer, if above a certain threshold, in accordance with our
								compliance program, and it must be properly recorded in Noble Energy's books and records.


HOSPITALITY
As with gifts, Noble Energy has developed detailed
								guidance and processes for approving hospitality expenditures, such as meals and entertainment, exchanged with both government officials and commercial entities.
HOSPITALITY

SHOULD:

Comply with applicable laws and business policies
Be customary under the circumstances
Be exchanged in an open and transparent manner, avoiding any appearance of impropriety
Be paid directly to the service provider and not to the hospitality recipient



SHOULD NOT:

Impose a sense of obligation on the recipient
Be extravagant or lavish
Be too frequently exchanged with the same third party, as it may take on the appearance of a bribe


The hospitality must be pre-approved by our Chief Compliance Officer, if above a certain threshold, in accordance with our
								compliance program, and it must be properly recorded in Noble Energy's books and records.


TRAVEL
Noble Energy has detailed guidance and processes for approval of travel expenditures (air, ground, and other modes of transportation, per diem, lodging, etc.) to be paid for or reimbursed by the company. All travel expenditures must be properly recorded in Noble Energy’s books and records.
TRAVEL

SHOULD:

Be for business purposes
Be paid directly to the service provider whenever possible



SHOULD NOT:

Give the appearance of impropriety
Include family members or side trips

Energy ETF drops toward 9-month low as oil prices slide
The energy sector was the biggest loser Thursday, as the sharp selloff in oil prices sent the SPDR Energy Select Sector ETF  tumbling 2.1% toward a nine-month closing low. Of the sector tracker's (XLE) 34 equity components, only one edged higher, with Noble Energy Inc.'s stock  up 0.7%. Among the sector tracker's most-active components, shares of Chesapeake Energy Corp.  plunged 8.5%, Transocean Ltd.  dropped 4.7%, Marathon Oil Corp.  shed 4.8%, Kinder Morgan Inc.  gave up 2.5% and Exxon Mobil Corp.  slid 1.3%. The XLE had rallied as much as 12% in the month after the election to a 1 1/2-year closing high of $77.83 on Dec. 13, amid optimism over President Donald Trump's promise to reinvigorate the fossil fuel industry, but has since tumbled 15% as optimism faded given the White House's inability to implement policy promises. On Thursday, crude oil futures  tumbled 5% toward the lowest close since Nov. 30, after data showing U.S. production increased while inventories declined less than expected. The XLE has dropped 13% year to date, while the S&P 500  has gained 6.7%.

Energy ETF drops toward 9-month low as oil prices slide
The energy sector was the biggest loser Thursday, as the sharp selloff in oil prices sent the SPDR Energy Select Sector ETF  tumbling 2.1% toward a nine-month closing low. Of the sector tracker's (XLE) 34 equity components, only one edged higher, with Noble Energy Inc.'s stock  up 0.7%. Among the sector tracker's most-active components, shares of Chesapeake Energy Corp.  plunged 8.5%, Transocean Ltd.  dropped 4.7%, Marathon Oil Corp.  shed 4.8%, Kinder Morgan Inc.  gave up 2.5% and Exxon Mobil Corp.  slid 1.3%. The XLE had rallied as much as 12% in the month after the election to a 1 1/2-year closing high of $77.83 on Dec. 13, amid optimism over President Donald Trump's promise to reinvigorate the fossil fuel industry, but has since tumbled 15% as optimism faded given the White House's inability to implement policy promises. On Thursday, crude oil futures  tumbled 5% toward the lowest close since Nov. 30, after data showing U.S. production increased while inventories declined less than expected. The XLE has dropped 13% year to date, while the S&P 500  has gained 6.7%.

					 Manufacturing's intelligent makeover
				





Software, sensors, data analytics and network technologies are the new "hammers" of American manufacturing The entire production lifecycle can be transformed with intelligent tools, and early adopters are forging their way to competitive advantage.
























					
                                        Ushering in the age of the digital enterprise              
				








The impetus for becoming a digital enterprise is not about who has the coolest technology - but who can best achieve advantage without disruption. The case for adopting innovation is often made as companies plateau in mastering perennial challenges such as efficiency and time to market. Discrete and process industries at all levels of maturity, and companies of all sizes are forging a path to digitalization using Siemens ingenuity:

 Integrating islands of data to gain systemic visibility and enhance production control.
 Enhancing design and engineering through software that enables virtual design and rapid prototyping.
 Performing remote diagnostics and running simulations to predict and plan for maintenance.

The future of manufacturing is digital. Are you ready?

					 Rethinking operating costs from end to end
				





Today's challenging oil price environment is forcing major change and difficult decisions within the Oil & Gas industry. Existing operating models are being challenged and new approaches are required to overcome the technical and economic transformations at hand. Across the entire value chain Siemens is helping customers transform their business with solutions that blend operational technology with software and data.

					  America's express pass to mobility
				





City light rail and metros together with inter-city passenger rail is giving a boost to regional economies, making it easier for people to move around, expand access to opportunity and improve quality of life. Rail and road solutions are also helping to reduce traffic congestion on roads and highways.












					
                    Siemens is working with cities and people to help move America forward
				








To modernize and revitalize cities, we make transportation more efficient, intelligent, and safe - while lowering environmental impact and creating a better traveler experience. We deliver cloud-based traffic management systems, locomotives, light rail and metros, rail signaling and electrification solutions. One in every 3 light rail cars operating in the U.S. was built by Siemens. Along with our rail electrification and rail signaling systems in the U.S., we bring advanced technologies that improve operator performance and passenger quality of life. For example:
 

 Communications-Based Train Control systems for New York’s Metropolitan Transit Authority
 Light rail vehicles for the Twin Cities that reduce gas emissions by more than 70% vs. cars
 Traffic management systems that shorten commute times by 20% along routes in San Antonio, Texas

 
We live and work in the communities where we create Ingenuity for life, with 2,000 employees across North America and full-scale transportation manufacturing facilities in five U.S. locations.

					  America's express pass to mobility
				





City light rail and metros together with inter-city passenger rail is giving a boost to regional economies, making it easier for people to move around, expand access to opportunity and improve quality of life. Rail and road solutions are also helping to reduce traffic congestion on roads and highways.












					
                    Siemens is working with cities and people to help move America forward
				








To modernize and revitalize cities, we make transportation more efficient, intelligent, and safe - while lowering environmental impact and creating a better traveler experience. We deliver cloud-based traffic management systems, locomotives, light rail and metros, rail signaling and electrification solutions. One in every 3 light rail cars operating in the U.S. was built by Siemens. Along with our rail electrification and rail signaling systems in the U.S., we bring advanced technologies that improve operator performance and passenger quality of life. For example:
 

 Communications-Based Train Control systems for New York’s Metropolitan Transit Authority
 Light rail vehicles for the Twin Cities that reduce gas emissions by more than 70% vs. cars
 Traffic management systems that shorten commute times by 20% along routes in San Antonio, Texas

 
We live and work in the communities where we create Ingenuity for life, with 2,000 employees across North America and full-scale transportation manufacturing facilities in five U.S. locations.

Our story




Gu-ru / ‘goroō /
Noun:
1. A mentor, a teacher, one who helps you move forward.
2. A source of inspiration and good energy.


GURU
A Story of Organic Growth
Ever since the early days, GURU has always been driven by this idea of crafting the best natural energy drink out there. Founded in Montreal during the summer of 1999 by four college friends, the company marketed the world's first all-natural energy drink.
More than 15 years later, this vision is not only fulfilled but is also thriving and expanding worldwide. GURU has become the #1 Organic Energy Drink in Canada and the US in the Health Channel thanks to a strong network of distribution partnerships and a passionate sales team. 
With research & development at the forefront of our expansion, GURU now tackles a new market and adventure with the recent introduction of our Energy Waters. This new line of product arrives just in time to satisfy a growing demand for organic sugar and calorie-free energy beverages.
In short, GURU has and will always believe that energy should not come at the expense of health. That is what has brought our company a steady and organic growth.
Our Philosophy
Through its corporate philosophy and its beverages, GURU gives good energy for people to make great things, reminding that, with the right dose of will, inspiration and energy, achieving great results is within everyone's reach. 
People today define themselves less by what they have and more by what they do and contribute to the world. Resourcefulness, imagination, inventiveness is today’s new currency. Whether using technology, natural ingredients or just plain common sense, people who Make it Good are the ones who seek to make everything better. We call them Makers.
They are pioneers that never settle. Makers, not followers. Crafters not manufacturers. Some may call them obsessed, exceptional or extraordinary people. But these are men and women who are true innovators, thought leaders and doers in their respective communities. They make the impossible possible.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
