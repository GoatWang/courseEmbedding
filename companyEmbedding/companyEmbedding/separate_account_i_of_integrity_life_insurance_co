These include one linked to the S&P 500® Index, three linked to a custom-designed GS Momentum Builder® Multi-Asset Class Index sponsored by Goldman Sachs and a fixed interest option. Indextra also offers protection in the form of a Guaranteed Minimum Account Value and an optional Guaranteed Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit available for an additional charge.

Separate Accounts

Last Updated 7/11/17
A “separate account” is a fund held by a life insurance  company that   is maintained separately from the insurer's general assets.  Separate   accounts were originally established in response to federal securities    laws for investment-linked variable annuities.   Although it took many years, the  application of separate accounts has   dramatically expanded beyond this simple  product design. Product   development has resulted with an array of “hybrid”  products—products   that overlay traditional insurance company guarantees (e.g.,  mortality,   morbidity, etc.) being allocated to the separate account investment    portfolio.
The use of separate accounts by insurers has evolved rapidly  over the   past 20 years. In response to recommendations to clarify information    pertaining to separate account products, and related separate account   assets,  detailed information is available in the statutory financial   statements:

Distinct filings for       separate products that are   “insulated” or “not insulated” from the general       account creditors.   When completing the insulated separate account filing,       the   reporting entity is only to include those assets that are legally         insulated by state law or statute, in which the state law provides legal         protection to the separate account contract holder from the   general       account liabilities. 
Detailed information on       the characteristics of   separate account assets, specifically categorizing       separate   account assets in accordance with the following characteristics: 
          
Identification of        separate account assets   legally insulated and those which are not legally        insulated.   Identification is also required for all separate account        assets   not reported at fair value, and the measurement basis used for          those separate account assets. 
Amount of separate        account assets that   represent seed money, other fees and expenses due to        the general   account and additional required surplus amounts. (Additional          required surplus is defined as additional or permanent surplus that is          required to be retained in the separate account in accordance with   state        law or regulations.) Information is reported on any   current year        transfers to the separate account for seed money, as   well as the duration        in which seed money, other fees and   expenses, and additional required        surplus amounts due to the   general account have been held in the separate        account. 
Identification of        separate account assets in   which the investment directive is not        determined by the contract   holder. Situations in which the investment        directive is not   determined by the contract holder also require        disclosure on   whether the investments, if included in the general        account,   would have resulted with the reporting entity exceeding any          general account investment limitations. 
Identification of        separate account assets in   which less than 100% of investment proceeds        are attributed to the   contract holder. This also includes identification        of the   separate account investment income attributed to the reporting          entity during the reporting period, and whether the income was          transferred to the general account or reinvested within the separate          account. 
Identification of all        products reported as a   separate account product under statutory        accounting principles,   and whether the product was classified differently        under U.S.   GAAP. For products with different classifications between          statutory accounting and U.S. GAAP, identification of the   characteristics        that resulted with a different classification   under U.S. GAAP.


Information on separate account products with general    accounting guarantees, including the amount of guarantees paid by the   general  account for the current reporting year, and for the previous   four reporting  years. This information also details the risk charges   paid from the separate  account to the general account related to these   guarantees, and whether the  risk charges are reviewed and opined upon.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

	set forth in this application. 
	Registration statement 033-51126 contains all three contracts; the

	THE CONTRACTS





	 






	A.



	                                   


	Available Portfolios





	 





	Each Contract permits allocations of value to available fixed
	and variable subaccounts; each variable subaccount invests in a specific
	investment portfolio of an underlying mutual fund.  Of the 24 Contracts affected by this
	application, 18 Contracts offer the same 56 portfolios (Subset 1), four
	Contracts offer the same 54 portfolios (Subset 2)(5) and two Contracts
	offer the same 43 portfolios (Subset 3).(6)  All of the portfolios
	currently offered under all Contracts are listed in Exhibit A-1 to this
	application.  The portfolios not
	available in the Contracts in Subset 2 are indicated by one asterisk and
	portfolios not available in the Contracts in Subset 3 are indicated by two
	asterisks on Exhibit A-1.




	 





	B.



	                                   


	Transfers





	 





	Each Contract permits transfers from one subaccount to
	another subaccount at any time prior to annuitization, subject to certain
	restrictions and charges described below. 
	No sales charge applies to such a transfer of value among
	subaccounts.  The Contracts permit up to
	twelve free transfers during any contract year. 
	A fee of $20 is imposed on transfers in excess of twelve transfers in a
	contract year.  Transfers must be at
	least $100, or, if less, the entire amount in the subaccount from which value
	is to be transferred.  A variety of
	automatically scheduled transfers are permitted without charge and are not
	counted against the twelve free transfers in a contract




	 








	(5) Contracts in Subset 2 contain the same portfolios
	as the Contracts in Subset 1, except the two portfolios of the Columbia fund
	family.





	(6) Contracts in Subset
	3 contain the same portfolios as the Contracts in Subset 1, except the two
	portfolios of the Columbia fund family, the four portfolios of the Rydex fund
	family,  the five portfolios of the PIMCO
	fund family, the UIF U.S. Mid Cap Value portfolio and the Fidelity VIP Value
	Strategies portfolio (of these portfolios, only the last is a subject of this
	application.)

	year.  The Applicants have policies and procedures
	limiting transfers to and from certain subaccounts that are intended to
	discourage frequent trading activity.




	 





	C.



	                                   


	Reservation of Right to Substitute Subaccounts





	 






	Each
	Contract reserves the right, upon notice to Contract owners and compliance with
	applicable law, to add, combine or remove subaccounts, or to withdraw assets
	from one subaccount and put them into another subaccount.  Each Contracts prospectus provides that
	Applicants may add, remove or combine subaccounts or withdraw assets relating
	to a Contract from one subaccount and put them into another.






	 






	III.



	                              


	THE PORTFOLIOS





	 





	The Integrity Companies propose the Substitution of four Portfolios (two of which
	include three classes each) of Variable Insurance Products Fund III (the
	Existing Portfolios).  As replacements, the Integrity Companies
	propose offering three Portfolios (two of which include three classes) of
	Variable Insurance Products Fund III and Variable Insurance Products Fund II
	(the Replacement Portfolios)(7).  All of the Replacement Portfolios are
	currently available in the Contracts. 
	Neither Variable Insurance Products Fund III, Variable Insurance
	Products Fund II, nor Fidelity Management and Research Company,
	(collectively referred to as Fidelity)




	are affiliated with the Applicants.




	 




	The investment objective, strategies and
	risks of each Replacement Portfolio are the same as, or similar to, the
	investment objective, strategies and risks of the corresponding Existing
	Portfolio.  For each Existing Portfolio
	and each Replacement Portfolio, the investment objective, principal investment
	strategies and principal risks are shown in the table that follows.




	 







	(7) The registration statement containing
	all Existing and Replacement Portfolios, except Fidelity VIP Contrafund, is
	File Nos. 811-07205 and 033-54837 (Variable Insurance Products Fund III).  The registration statement containing
	Fidelity VIP Contrafund, which is one of the Replacement Portfolios, is File
	Nos. 811-05511 and 033-20773 (Variable Insurance Products Fund II).  Both registration statements are hereby
	incorporated by reference to the extent necessary to support and supplement the
	descriptions and representations set forth in this application.

	: Applicants believe that no
	material differences exist between the Fidelity VIP Dynamic Capital
	Appreciation portfolio and the Fidelity VIP Contrafund portfolio.  All investment strategies stated in the
	Dynamic Capital Appreciation prospectus also appear in the Contrafund
	prospectus.  The Contrafund prospectus
	describes additional strategies used by the funds manager, including its
	strategy of selecting securities of companies whose value it believes is not
	fully recognized by the public and its allocation of assets across market
	sectors.  Nothing stated in the Dynamic

	fund(10) by the Contrafund portfolio looks through to the holdings of the
	central fund, whereas an investment in a Fidelity central fund by the Dynamic
	Capital Appreciation portfolio does not look through.  Of the nine non-fundamental investment
	policies and limitations set forth in the portfolios SAI, one differs between
	these two portfolios:  the Contrafund
	portfolio does not currently intend to invest in oil, gas or other mineral
	exploration or development programs or leases, whereas the Dynamic Capital
	Appreciation portfolio does not include this non-fundamental limitation.  These portfolios share a great deal of
	commonality, including virtually all of their investment strategies, policies
	and limitations.  Further, each fund uses
	the S&P 500 as its benchmark.




	 





	Replacements 2, 3 and 4



	: The only differences in investment
	strategy between the Fidelity VIP Growth & Income portfolio and the
	Fidelity VIP Balanced portfolio include a permitted investment of 40% of the
	Balanced funds assets in bonds and other debt instruments when the outlook is
	neutral, with a minimum investment of 25% in bonds at any time.  The Growth and Income portfolio has no
	minimum investment in bonds, though it is permitted to invest in bonds.  The Balanced portfolios prospectus states
	that it may also engage in transactions that have a leveraging effect on the
	fund, including investment in derivatives and that it uses Fidelity central
	funds to help invest the portfolios assets. 
	The Growth and Income portfolio manager is not prohibited from this
	strategy.  The Growth and Income

	investment disciplines, or for cash management. Central funds incur certain
	costs related to their investment activity (such as custodial fees and
	expenses), but do not pay additional management fees to Fidelity. The
	investment results of the portions of the funds assets invested in the central
	funds will be based upon the investment results of those funds.

	include buying and selling futures contracts and exchange traded funds to
	increase or decrease the funds exposure to changing security prices; the
	Balanced portfolio is not prohibited from this strategy.  Of the nine fundamental investment policies
	and limitations set forth in the portfolios SAI, one differs between these two
	portfolios: the Balanced portfolio may invest all of its assets in the
	securities of a single open-end management investment company with
	substantially the same fundamental investment objective, policies and
	limitations.  This investment policy does
	not apply to the Growth and Income portfolio. 
	Applicants note, however, that in the non-fundamental investment
	policies and limitations set forth in the portfolios SAI, it is indicated that
	the Balanced portfolio does not currently intend to invest all of its assets in
	the securities of a single open-end management investment company with
	substantially the same fundamental investment objective, policies and

	Replacements 5, 6 and 7



	: The only difference in investment
	strategy between the Fidelity VIP Growth Opportunities portfolio and the
	Fidelity VIP Contrafund portfolio is the Growth Opportunities portfolios
	strategy of investing in companies the manager believes have above-average
	growth potential.  The Contrafund
	prospectus indicates that the manager may invest in growth or value
	stocks.  All other investment strategies
	outlined in the Growth Opportunities prospectus also appear in the Contrafund
	prospectus, except for a statement that although the fund focuses on securities
	of larger-sized companies, it may make a substantial investment in medium and
	smaller companies.  The Contrafund
	prospectus describes additional strategies used by the funds manager,
	including its strategy of selecting securities of companies whose value it
	believes is not fully recognized by the public and its allocation of assets
	across market sectors.  Nothing stated in
	either funds prospectus or SAI prohibits the fund from using the strategies
	disclosed in the corresponding funds prospectus.  Of the nine fundamental investment policies

	and limitations set forth in the portfolios SAI, two differ slightly
	between these two portfolios: (1) in the measurement of investment
	concentration, an investment in a Fidelity central fund by Contrafund looks
	through to the holdings of the central fund, whereas an investment in a
	Fidelity central fund by the Growth Opportunities portfolio does not look
	through; and (2)  the Growth Opportunities portfolio may invest all of its
	assets in the securities of a single open-end management investment company
	with substantially the same fundamental investment objective, policies and
	limitations; this investment policy does not apply to Contrafund.  Applicant note, however, that in the
	non-fundamental investment limitations set forth in the portfolios SAI, it is
	indicated that the Growth Opportunities portfolio does not currently intend to
	invest all of its assets in the securities of a single open-end management

	Replacement 8



	: The only differences in
	investment strategy between the Fidelity VIP Value Strategies portfolio and the
	Fidelity VIP Mid Cap portfolio are: (1) the Value Strategies portfolio
	focuses on investing in companies the manager believes are undervalued, whereas
	the Mid Cap prospectus indicates that the manager may invest in growth or value
	stocks; and (2) although the managers of both funds focus on investing in
	securities issued by medium sized companies, the Mid Cap prospectus indicates
	that the fund normally invests 80% of the funds assets in securities of medium
	sized companies, generally defined as similar to the market capitalization of
	companies in the Russell Midcap Index or the S&P MidCap 400; whereas the
	Value Strategies prospectus does not mandate a percentage normally invested in
	medium-sized companies.  Notably, though,
	approximately 70% of assets of the Value Strategies fund were invested in mid
	cap companies as of September 31, 2009, as measured by the Russell Midcap
	Index.  Of the nine fundamental
	investment policies and limitations set forth in the portfolios




	 




	11














	 




	SAI, only three differ slightly between these two portfolios: (1) the
	Value Strategies portfolio may not issue senior securities except in connection
	with an exemptive order  or as permitted
	under the 1940 Act, whereas the Mid Cap portfolio may only issue senior
	securities as permitted under the 1940 Act; (2) in the measurement of
	investment concentration, an investment in a Fidelity central fund by Value
	Strategies looks through to the holdings of the central fund, whereas an
	investment in a Fidelity central fund by the Mid Cap portfolio does not look
	through; and (3) the Mid Cap portfolio may invest all of its assets in the
	securities of a single open-end management investment company managed by


	Fidelity Management and Research Company (FMR) with substantially the same fundamental
	investment objective, policies and limitations. 
	This investment policy does not apply to the Value Strategies
	portfolio.  Applicants note, however,
	that in the non-fundamental investment policies and limitations set forth in
	the portfolios SAI, it is indicated that the Mid Cap Portfolio does not intend
	to invest all of its assets in the securities of a single open-end management
	investment company managed by FMR with substantially the same fundamental
	investment objective, policies and limitations.




	 




	Applicants submit that the
	foregoing demonstrates that no material difference exists between each Existing
	Portfolio and the corresponding Replacement Portfolio, and that the Contract
	owners have a reasonable continuity in their investment expectation.




	 




	The assets in each of the Existing
	Portfolios and the corresponding Replacement Portfolios for all classes as of October 31,
	2009 are as follows:




	 





	Replacement 1



	: Fidelity VIP Dynamic Capital
	Appreciation portfolio with assets of $43,564,343.81 will be replaced by
	Fidelity VIP Contrafund portfolio with assets of $16,093,188,611.11.

	Replacements 5, 6 and 7



	: Fidelity VIP Growth Opportunities

	Contrafund portfolio with assets of $16,093,188,611.11.




	 





	Replacement 8:



	Fidelity VIP Value Strategies
	portfolio with assets of $281,070,479.31 will be replaced with Fidelity VIP Mid
	Cap portfolio with assets of $6,371,130,432.10.




	 




	Each of the Existing and Replacement
	Portfolios hold sufficient assets such that the Substitution will be immaterial
	to portfolio management.




	 





	IV.



	                               


	REASONS FOR THE SUBSTITUTION





	 






	A.



	                                   


	Efficiency





	 





	The proposed Substitution will strengthen and streamline the
	Fidelity fund offerings within the Contracts fund lineup.  The Applicants expect the proposed
	Substitution to provide benefits to the Contract owners, including better
	performing funds and simplification of fund offerings through the elimination
	of overlapping and duplicative portfolios in certain asset categories,
	particularly the large growth category. 
	Fidelity has been consulted and has raised no objection to the
	Substitution.




	 




	The proposed Substitution involves substituting a Replacement
	Portfolio for an Existing Portfolio with very similar, and in most cases
	substantially similar, investment objectives, strategies, policies and
	limitations.  After the Substitution,
	Contract owners will continue to be able to select among funds with a full
	range of investment objectives, investment strategies and risks.  Of the 24 Contracts affected by the
	Substitution, Contract owners in Subset 1 (18 Contracts) will be able to select
	among 52 portfolios, Contract owners in Subset 2 (four




	 




	13














	 




	Contracts)
	will be able to select among 50 portfolios, and Contract owners in Subset 3
	(two Contracts) will be able to select among 40 portfolios.




	 




	Following is Chart A, which contains the portfolios offered
	in the Contracts by Morningstar asset category, comparing before and after the
	proposed Substitution.  The portfolios
	not available in the Contracts in Subset 2 are indicated by one asterisk and
	portfolios not available in the Contracts in Subset 3 are indicated by two
	asterisks.  Chart A depicts the
	consolidation of the large growth category and illustrates that after the
	proposed Substitution, all Contract owners will continue to have three choices
	from two different fund companies in the large growth category.  Applicants have selected what they believe
	are superior large growth funds and winnowed the lesser offerings to provide a
	more streamlined selection of lower cost funds with better historical
	performance.  Chart A similarly
	illustrates that after the Substitution, all Contract owners will continue to
	have three choices from two different fund companies in the mid blend category.




	 




	With regard to the proposed replacement of Fidelity VIP Value
	Strategies, a mid blend fund, with Fidelity VIP Mid Cap, a mid growth fund, the
	Applicants believe Contract owners will experience a positive result and have
	reasonable continuity in investment expectations.  Both funds are primarily invested in medium
	capitalization companies; the Mid Cap fund manager has greater flexibility in
	selecting the better opportunities among available growth and value
	stocks.  Further, the Mid Cap portfolio
	has a better performance record (average annual return of 11.82% over the life
	of the fund (10 years), compared to 0.41% for the Value Strategies portfolio
	over the life of the fund (7 years))




	and

	A relatively small number of

	strategies.  The Contract owner may
	transfer 100% of the account value from one strategy to another at any time
	(subject to a 90 day waiting period between transfers); however, the account
	value must be fully invested in only one strategy at any one time.  Of the four available strategies, only one is
	affected by the Substitution, the self style strategy.  The self style strategy

	requires

	the owner to invest 30-60% of account value in one
	or more of three specific fixed income portfolios and 40-70% of account value
	in one or more of 18 core equity portfolios and

	allows

	the owner to invest 0-20% in one or more of 17 non-core equity portfolios and
	0-10% in one or more of 13 other portfolios. 
	After the Substitution, the number of core equity portfolios available
	for investment of 40-70% will be reduced from 18 to 16 and the number of
	non-core equity portfolios available for investment of 0-20% will be reduced
	from 17 to 15.  A complete chart of the
	second generation GLWB investment strategies is provided on Exhibit A-2.




	 




	The first generation GLWB, which
	was available with four Contracts(13) from May 2007 to February 2008,
	offered three investment strategies.  The
	Contract owner may transfer 100% of the account value from one strategy to
	another at any time (subject to a 90 day waiting period between transfers);
	however, the account value must be fully invested in only one strategy at any
	one time.  Of the three available
	strategies, only one is affected by the Substitution, the self style
	strategy.  The self style strategy

	requires

	the owner to invest 35-100% of account value in one
	of two specific fixed income portfolios and

	allows

	the owner
	to invest 0-10% of account value in a money market portfolio, 0-65% of account
	value in one or more of 14 core equity portfolios and 0-10% in one or more of
	18 other portfolios.  After the
	Substitution, the number of core equity portfolios available for investment of
	0-65% will be reduced from 14 to 13 and the

	number of other portfolios available for investment of 0-10% will be
	reduced from 18 to 16.  A complete chart
	of the first generation GLWB investment strategies is provided on Exhibit A-3.




	 




	In each of the GLWB riders,
	Contract owners continue to have a substantial number of options to choose from
	in every category in determining their self style investments and the
	Substitution will not materially affect their investment choices.  In the GLWB riders, and in the prospectuses
	offering both generations of GLWB riders, Applicants


	reserve the right to add, close, eliminate or substitute the GLWB investment
	strategies, the subaccount or the underlying portfolios at any time.

	Replacement Portfolios in each class. 
	In each of the Existing and Replacement Portfolio prospectuses, Fidelity
	has the following identical information:




	 




	Service Class has
	adopted a Distribution and Service Plan pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the
	1940 Act.  Under the plan, Service Class is
	authorized to pay FDC(18) a 12b-1 (service) fee as compensation for providing
	support services that benefit variable product owners.  Service Class may pay this 12b-1
	(service) fee at an annual rate of 0.25% of its average net assets, or such
	lesser amount as the Trustees may determine from time to time.  Service Class currently pays FDC a 12b-1
	(service) fee at an annual rate of 0.10% of its average net assets throughout
	the month.  Service Classs 12b-1
	(service) fee rate may be increased only when the Trustees believe that it is
	in the best interests of variable product owners to do so.




	 




	Service Class 2 has
	adopted a Distribution and Service Plan pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the
	1940 Act.  Under the plan, Service Class 2
	is authorized to pay FDC a 12b-1 (service) fee as compensation for providing
	support services that benefit variable product owners.  Service Class 2 currently pays FDC a
	12b-1 (service) fee at an annual rate of 0.25% of its average net assets
	throughout the month.




	 




	There is no difference in the current or maximum service fees between each
	Existing Portfolio and each corresponding Replacement Portfolio.




	 




	With regard to management fees, the
	portfolios SAI indicates that for the services of FMR, each fund pays FMR a monthly management fee that has two
	components: a group fee rate and an individual fund fee rate.  The group fee rate is based on the monthly
	average net assets of all the registered investment companies with which FMR
	has management contracts.  Therefore the
	breakpoints are calculated on the total assets under FMR management, not on a
	per fund basis.  The second component is
	the individual fund fee rate, which for each Existing Portfolio (except one) is
	the same as the rate for the Replacement Portfolio, 0.30%.  In the one instance, the rate paid on the
	Fidelity VIP Balanced Portfolio (Replacement Portfolio) is 0.15%, which is
	lower than is paid on the Fidelity VIP Growth and Income Portfolio (Existing
	Portfolio) of 0.20%.

	THE SUBSTITUTION




	 




	The Substitution will take place at the portfolios relative
	net asset values determined on the date of the Substitution in accordance with Section 22
	of the Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder with no change in the amount of any
	Contract owners cash value, death benefit, living benefit or in the dollar
	value of his or her investment in any of the subaccounts.  Accordingly, there will be




	 




	21














	 




	no
	financial impact on any Contract owner. 
	The Substitution will be effected by having each of the subaccounts that
	invests in the Existing Portfolios redeem its shares at the net asset value
	calculated on the date of the Substitution and purchase shares of the
	respective Replacement Portfolios at the net asset value calculated on the same
	date.




	 




	The Substitution will be described
	in detail in a written notice mailed to Contract owners.  The notice will inform Contract owners of the
	Integrity Companies intent to implement the Substitution and describe the Substitution,
	the reasons for engaging in the Substitution and how the Substitution will be
	implemented.  Details regarding the
	effect on any investment in a GLWB will also be provided.  The notice will be mailed to all Contract
	owners at least 30 days prior to the Substitution and will inform affected
	Contract owners that they may transfer assets from the subaccounts investing in
	the Existing Portfolios at anytime after receipt of the notice, and from the
	subaccounts investing in the Replacement Portfolios for 30 days after the
	Substitution, to subaccounts investing in other portfolios available under the
	respective Contracts, without the imposition of any transfer charge or
	limitation and without diminishing the number of free transfers that may be
	made in a given contract year.  A
	supplement will be filed with the Commission for all current prospectuses
	containing the information to be included in the notice.




	 




	Each Contract owner will be provided with a prospectus for
	the Replacement Portfolios applicable to them. 
	Within five days after the Substitution, the Integrity Companies will
	send each affected Contract owner written confirmation that the Substitution
	has occurred.




	 




	The Integrity Companies will pay all expenses and transaction
	costs of the Substitution, including all legal, accounting and allocated
	brokerage expenses relating to the Substitution.  No costs will be borne by Contract
	owners.  Affected Contract owners will not
	incur any fees or charges as a result of the Substitution, nor will their rights
	or the obligations of the Integrity Companies under the Contracts be altered in
	any way.  The Substitution will not cause
	the fees




	 




	22














	 




	and charges
	under the Contracts currently being paid by Contract owners to be greater after
	the Substitution than before the Substitution. 
	The Substitution will have no adverse tax consequences to Contract
	owners and will in no way alter the tax benefits to Contract owners.




	 





	VI.



	                                                                               


	APPLICABLE LAW




	 





	A.



	                                   


	Requirements of Section 26(c)





	 





	Section 26(c) of the Act makes it unlawful for any
	depositor or trustee of a registered unit investment trust holding the security
	of a single issuer to substitute another security for such security unless the
	Commission approves the substitution.(19) 
	The Commission will approve such a substitution if the evidence
	establishes that it is consistent with the protection of investors and the
	purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act.




	 




	Section 26(c) of the Act was enacted as part of the
	Investment Company Act Amendments of 1970 (1970 Amendments).  Prior to the enactment of the 1970
	Amendments, Section 26(a)(4)(B) of the Act only required that the
	trust instrument of a unit investment trust provide that the sponsor or trustee
	notify the trusts shareholders within five days after a substitution of the
	underlying securities.  The legislative
	history of Section 26(c) describes the underlying purpose of the
	amendment to the section:




	 




	The
	proposed amendment recognizes that in the case of a unit investment trust
	holding the securities of a single issuer notification to shareholders does not
	provide adequate protection since the only relief available to the
	shareholders, if dissatisfied, would be to redeem their shares.  A shareholder who redeems and reinvests the
	proceeds in another unit investment trust or in an open-end company would under
	most circumstances be subject to a new sales load.  The proposed amendment




	 







	(19)  The Commission
	has interpreted Section 26(c) of the Act to apply to a substitution
	of securities in any sub-account of a registered separate account.  Investment Company Act Rel. No. 12678
	(Sept. 21, 1982) (adopting Rule 6c-6). 
	The proscription of Section 26(c) is addressed to the
	depositors (Integrity and National Integrity), and not the unit investment
	trusts (the Separate Accounts) for which the depositors serve.  Nevertheless, the Commission generally grants
	orders under Section 26(c) in the name of the depositor and unit
	investment trust. 

	See, e.g.,
	Keystone Provident Life Insurance Company,

	Investment Company Act
	Rel. Nos. 17891 (Nov. 30, 1990) (Notice) and 17923 (Dec. 28, 1990)
	(Order).  In accordance with this
	precedent, Applicants here include the Separate Accounts.




	 




	23














	 




	would
	close this gap in shareholder protection by providing for Commission approval
	of the substitution.  The Commission
	would be required to issue an order approving the substitution if it finds the
	substitution consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes
	fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act.(20)




	 




	The legislative history makes clear that the purpose of Section 26(c) is
	to protect the expectation of investors in a unit investment trust that the
	unit investment trust will accumulate shares of a particular issuer by
	preventing unscrutinized substitutions that might, in effect, force
	shareholders dissatisfied with the substituted security to redeem their shares,
	thereby possibly incurring either a loss of the sales load deducted from
	initial premium payments, an additional sales load upon reinvestment of the
	redemption proceeds, or both.(21) 
	Moreover, in the insurance product context, a Contract owner forced to
	redeem may suffer adverse tax consequences. 
	Section 26(c) affords this protection to investors by
	preventing a depositor or trustee of a unit investment trust that holds shares
	of one issuer from substituting for those shares, the shares of another issuer,
	unless the Commission approves that substitution.

	Each Contract and its prospectus expressly disclose the
	reservation of the Applicants right, subject to applicable law, to substitute
	shares of another portfolio for shares of the portfolio in which a subaccount
	is invested.




	 




	Substitutions have been common where the substituted
	portfolio has investment objectives and policies that are similar to those of
	the eliminated portfolio, current expenses that

	are similar
	to those of the eliminated portfolio, and performance that is similar to or
	better than that of the eliminated portfolio.(22)




	 




	The investment objectives and policies of the Replacement
	Portfolios are similar to those of the corresponding Existing Portfolios such
	that Contract owners will have reasonable continuity in investment
	expectations.  Accordingly, the
	Replacement Portfolios are appropriate investment vehicles for those Contract
	owners who have Contract values allocated to the Existing Portfolios.  Further, the Replacement Portfolios have
	lower expenses and significantly superior performance to that of the Existing
	Portfolios.




	 




	In connection with assets held under Contracts affected by
	the Substitution, the Integrity Companies will not receive, for three years
	from the date of the Substitution, any direct or indirect benefits from the
	Replacement Portfolios, their advisors or underwriters (or their affiliates) at
	a rate higher than that which they had received from the Existing Portfolios,
	their advisors or underwriters (or their affiliates), including without
	limitation 12b-1 Fees, shareholder service, administration or other service
	fees, revenue sharing or other arrangements in connection with such
	assets.  Indeed, it is worth noting that
	under the proposed Substitution, each portfolio will be replaced by a portfolio
	within the same unaffiliated fund family (Fidelity), and so there is no incentive
	or reason to contemplate such benefits. Applicants represent that the
	Substitution and the selection of the Replacement Portfolios were not motivated
	by any financial

	underwriters, or their respective affiliates.




	 




	The Substitution will not
	result in the type of costly forced redemption that Section 26(c) was
	intended to guard against because the Contract owner will continue to have the
	same type of investment choices, with better potential returns and the same or
	lower expenses and will not otherwise have any incentive to redeem their shares
	or terminate their Contracts.




	 




	The purposes, terms and conditions of the proposed
	Substitution are consistent with the protection of investors, and the
	principles and purposes of Section 26(c), and do not entail any of the
	abuses that Section 26(c) is designed to prevent.




	 




	(1)


	                                 


	Each
	Replacement Portfolio has significantly superior performance to that of the
	corresponding Existing Portfolio.




	 




	(2)


	                                 


	Current gross and net annual expenses in each
	Replacement Portfolio are lower than those of the corresponding Existing
	Portfolios.




	 




	(3)


	                                 


	Each
	Replacement Portfolio is an appropriate portfolio to move Contract owners
	values currently allocated to the Existing Portfolios because the portfolios
	have similar investment objectives, strategies and risks.




	 




	(4)


	                                 


	All costs of
	the Substitution, including any allocated brokerage costs, will be borne by the
	Integrity Companies and will not be borne by Contract owners.  No charges will be assessed to effect the
	Substitution.




	 




	(5)


	                                 


	The
	Substitution will be at the net asset values of the respective portfolio shares
	without the imposition of any transfer or similar charge and with no change in
	the amount of any Contract owners values.




	 




	(6)


	                                 


	The
	Substitution will not cause the fees and charges under the Contracts currently
	being paid by Contract owners to be greater after the Substitution than




	 




	26














	 




	before the Substitution and will result in Contract
	owners Contract values being moved to portfolios with the lower current total
	net annual expenses.




	 




	(7)


	                                 


	Notice of the
	proposed Substitution will be mailed to all Contract owners at least 30 days
	prior to the Substitution.  All Contract
	owners will have an opportunity at anytime after receipt of the notice of the
	Substitution and for 30 days after the Substitution to transfer Contract
	account value affected by the Substitution to other available subaccounts
	without


	the imposition of any transfer charge
	or limitation and without being counted as one of the Contract owners free
	transfers in a contract year.




	 




	(8)


	                                 


	Within five
	days after the Substitution, the Integrity Companies will send to its affected
	Contract owners a written confirmation that the Substitution has occurred.




	 




	(9)


	                                 


	The
	Substitution will in no way alter the insurance benefits to Contract owners or
	the contractual obligations of the Integrity Companies.




	 




	(10)


	                           


	The
	Substitution will have no adverse tax consequences to Contract owners and will
	in no way alter the tax benefits to Contract owners.

	REQUEST FOR ORDER




	 




	Applicants request an order of the Commission pursuant to Section 26(c) of
	the Act approving the Substitution.  Section 26(c),
	in pertinent part, provides that the Commission shall issue an order approving
	a substitution of securities if the evidence establishes that it is consistent
	with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy
	and provisions of the Act.  For the
	reasons and upon the facts set forth above, the requested order meets the
	standards set forth in Section 26(c) and should, therefore, be
	granted.

Title of Securities Being Registered:  VAROOM® II Flexible Premium Variable Annuity
 

 

 



 
VAROOM® II Variable Annuity
May 1, 2016
 
Integrity Life Insurance Company
Separate Account I of Integrity Life Insurance Company
 
This prospectus describes a flexible premium deferred variable annuity contract.  This prospectus contains information about Separate Account I of Integrity Life Insurance Company (Separate Account I) and the contract that you should know before investing.  You should read this prospectus and any supplements, and retain them for future reference.
 
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has not approved or disapproved these securities or determined that this prospectus is adequate.  Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.
 
A registration statement containing additional information about Separate Account I and this contract, which includes a Statement of Additional Information (SAI) dated May 1, 2016, has been filed with the SEC (file numbers 811-04844 and 333-178438).  The SAI is incorporated by reference into this prospectus.  A free copy of the SAI is available by sending in the form on the last page of this prospectus, or by writing or calling our Administrative Office listed in the Glossary.  The table of contents for the SAI is at the end of Part 9 of this prospectus.
 
You can review and copy information about this annuity contract at the SEC’s Public Reference Room in Washington, D.C.  For hours of operation of this Public Reference Room, please call 202-551-8090.  Copies of that information are also available, after paying a duplicating fee by writing the SEC’s Public Reference Section, 100 F. Street NE, Washington, D.C. 20549-0102.  You may also obtain information about this annuity contract on the SEC’s Internet site at http://www.sec.gov using the file numbers referenced above.
 
The contract must be issued as a traditional IRA, Roth IRA, or SEP IRA (collectively referred to as IRAs).  This contract does not provide the tax advantages typically provided by an annuity contract.  The tax advantages of this contract exist solely through its qualification as an IRA.
 
Except for the Vanguard Variable Insurance Fund Money Market Portfolio, the Funds available for investment under this contract are also available for direct purchase by the general public.
 
Two of the reasons Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) are attractive to direct purchasers are tax efficiency and cost-effectiveness.  Tax efficiency associated with ETFs will not be realized by purchasing this contract because this contract is an IRA.  The ETFs in which the subaccounts invest are cost-effective, but that cost-effectiveness will be reduced by the expenses of this contract.  These expenses include the administration expenses that are used, in part, to reimburse us for the cost and commissions associated with investing in the underlying ETFs.
 
If you purchase shares of these Funds directly from a broker-dealer, you will not pay separate account expenses, but may pay commissions.  You will also not have access to an annuity benefit, a guaranteed Death Benefit and an optional guaranteed living benefit.  Because of these additional separate account expenses, which affect your contract values and the returns on your investment, you should refer only to information about returns on the Subaccount Units available through this contract, and should not refer to information about returns on these Funds that may be available through other sources.
 
This annuity is not a bank product and is not an obligation of, nor guaranteed by, the financial institution where it is offered.  It is not insured by the FDIC, NCUSIF or other federal entity.  It is subject to investment risks, including possible loss of the principal amount invested.

Summary of Contract
 
This Contract is an IRA
 
This contract is a variable annuity that must be issued as an Individual Retirement Annuity (IRA) as defined by section 408(b), 408(k) or 408A of the Tax Code.  The contract itself does not provide the tax advantages typically provided by a variable annuity.  The tax advantages available with this contract exist solely through the contract’s qualification as an IRA.
 
You should read Part 8, “Tax Aspects of the Contract” for more information and consult a tax advisor about your particular circumstances.  Most of the withdrawals you make before you are 59½ years old are subject to a 10% federal tax penalty on the amounts withdrawn.
 
You may want to purchase ETFs through a variable annuity issued as an IRA vs. directly though the IRA for several reasons, including, but not limited to, that this annuity provides a guaranteed minimum death benefit, access to guaranteed annuitization that can provide income for life and offers an optional living benefit that can provide income for life.
 
Parties to the Contract
 
·                  Integrity Life Insurance Company - “We,” “our,” “us,” “the Company” and “Integrity” mean Integrity Life Insurance Company.
·                  Owner - “You” and “your” mean the owner.  This variable annuity contract is a contract between you and us.  You, as the owner, have certain rights under the contract.  Because this contract is an IRA, joint owners are not allowed and you may not transfer ownership.
·                  Annuitant - You are the Annuitant, the person whose life is used to determine the Maturity Date of the contract and the amount of the annuity benefit, when elected.  The Annuitant must be a natural person, and cannot be changed after the Contract Date.  Joint Annuitants are not allowed until an Annuity Option is elected and will have no effect until the Annuity Date.
·                  Beneficiary - The beneficiary is the person or persons who will receive the Death Benefit upon your death prior to the Annuity Date and upon election of Annuity Benefit, to receive any remaining payments.  See Part 5, sections titled “Death Benefit,” “Selecting and Changing Your Beneficiary,” and “Maturity Date and Annuity Options.”
·                  Custodial Account - If the contract is purchased through an established IRA custodial account, the contract owner will be considered the account, the Annuitant will generally be you as the account owner, and the account must be the beneficiary.
·                  Covered Person - A person covered under one of the GLWB Riders.  See Part 6.
 
Your Rights and Benefits
 
As the owner of the contract, you have the following rights:
 
·                  To contribute, transfer and withdraw money.  See Part 5.
·                  To invest your premiums in the Investment Options.  See Part 3.
·                  To elect the optional benefits available at the time you purchase the annuity contract (for an additional cost).  See Part 6.
·                  To elect an Annuity Option.  See Part 5, section titled “Maturity Date and Annuity Option.”
·                  To name one or more beneficiaries to receive the Death Benefit.  See Part 5, sections titled “Death Benefit” and “Selecting and Changing Your Beneficiary.” If the owner is a custodian, the owner must name itself as the sole beneficiary.
 
Your rights are subject to the rules and significant limitations stated in your contract, in this prospectus and under the Tax Code.
 
V2I-10



 
Investment Goals and Risks
 
This contract allows you to accumulate money for retirement or other long-term goals.  This contract is intended for long-term investing only and is not intended as a vehicle for frequent trading.  Transfers among Subaccounts are strictly limited under the terms of this contract.  See Part 5, section titled “Allocations and Transfers.”
 
An investment in any of the Subaccounts carries with it certain risks, including the risk that the value of your investment will decline and you could lose money.  The Subaccounts invest in ETFs (except the Vanguard Variable Insurance Fund Money Market Portfolio), many of which invest in common stocks.  You could lose money if one of the issuers of the stocks becomes financially impaired or if the market as a whole declines.  There is also the inherent risk that holders of common stock generally are behind creditors and holders of preferred stock for payments in the event of the bankruptcy of a stock issuer.  Some of the Subaccounts invest in Funds that invest in high yield securities that are rated below investment grade, commonly referred to as “junk bonds.”  High yield securities may be subject to greater levels of credit or default risk than higher-rated securities.  Some of
the Subaccounts also invest in securities issued by companies in foreign countries, which means that world events, such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters, will adversely affect the value of these securities.  Foreign investments are also subject to currency risk, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates.
 
Shares of ETFs may trade at a discount from their net asset value in the secondary market.  This risk is separate and distinct from the risk that the net asset value of the ETF shares may decrease.  The amount of such discount from net asset value is subject to change from time to time in response to various factors.
 
The services of Mid Atlantic Trust Company (MATC) and third-party broker-dealers underlie the process supporting this variable annuity and the subaccounts’ investments.  If either MATC or the third-party broker-dealers terminate or significantly modify the services provided to us, we will seek to replace those services through other providers or through other methods.  If suitable replacement services are not available, we will take such other actions or make changes in how we operate as allowed by law and your annuity contract to mitigate any adverse effects on the Separate Accounts, you and us, to the greatest extent reasonably possible.  These actions could include working directly with broker-dealers to purchase ETFs; bringing in-house the services being provided by MATC; and/or making available index mutual funds as underlying investment options.  While we believe it is highly unlikely, it is
possible that under a worst-case scenario we would be required to disallow additional premiums into the contract, and that transfers could only be made into the money market subaccount (although your then-current allocations would not be affected).  See more about Mid Atlantic Trust Company in Part 2, section titled “ETF Custodian.”
 
For a complete discussion of the risks associated with investing in any particular Subaccount, see the prospectus of the corresponding Fund.
 
Account Value and Surrender Value
 
Your Account Value consists of the values of your Investment Options added together.  Any amount allocated to a Subaccount will go up or down in value depending on the investment experience of the Fund.  The value of premiums allocated to the Subaccounts is not guaranteed.  Your Account Value also is subject to charges.  See Part 4.
 
Your Surrender Value is equal to your Account Value, minus any withdrawal charge and applicable premium tax.  See Part 4.
 
Your minimum Account Value is $2,000.  If the Account Value goes below the minimum Account Value and we have received no premiums from you for two years, we may terminate the contract and pay you 
 
V2I-11



 
the Account Value.  We will notify you in advance and will give you at least 60 days to contribute additional premium to bring the Account Value above the minimum if you wish to keep your contract in force.  The minimum Account Value does not apply if you have a GLWB Rider. 
 
If you take withdrawals (other than the Free Withdrawal Amount or RMD), this contract also requires that you have a minimum Account Value of $20,000 remaining after the withdrawal.  (Please note that you may fully surrender your contract at any time.)  This rule does not apply if you have a GLWB Rider.  See Part 5, section titled “Withdrawals.”
 
Your Right to Revoke (Free Look Period)
 
You may cancel your contract within 10 days after you receive it by returning it to our Administrative Office by mail, postmarked within the 10-day period.  We will extend the 10-day period if required by state law.  If you cancel your contract, we will return your Account Value, which may be more or less than your original premium depending upon the investment experience of the Subaccounts you selected and any applicable charges.  You bear the investment risk, as well as any fees and charges incurred, during the free look period.  See Part 4 for more discussion of the fees and charges.  Some states require that we return your premium, or some amount other than your Account Value.  In that case, we will return the greater of the amount required by state law and your Account Value.
 
Part 2 — Integrity and the Separate Account
 
Integrity Life Insurance Company
 
Integrity is a stock life insurance company organized under the laws of Arizona on May 3, 1966, and redomesticated to Ohio on January 3, 1995.  Our principal executive office is located at 400 Broadway, Cincinnati, Ohio 45202.  We are authorized to sell life insurance and annuities in 46 states and the District of Columbia.  Integrity is a subsidiary of The Western and Southern Life Insurance Company, a life insurance company organized under the laws of the State of Ohio on February 23, 1888.
 
Integrity guarantees certain amounts under the contract.  We refer to these guaranteed amounts as “insurance obligations,” such as income payments under the GLWB Rider after your Account Value is exhausted.  In this case, we will pay you the income payments from our General Account.  Benefit amounts paid from the General Account are subject to our financial strength and claims paying ability and our long-term ability to make such payments.  There are risks to purchasing any insurance product.
 
The Western and Southern Life Insurance Company, Integrity’s parent company, has guaranteed the insurance obligations of Integrity to its contract owners, including the owners of this contract (the Guarantee).   Amounts covered by the Guarantee are subject to the financial strength and claims paying ability of The Western and Southern Life Insurance Company.  The Guarantee does not guarantee investment performance on the portion of your Account Value invested in the Subaccounts.  The Guarantee provides that contract owners can enforce the Guarantee directly.
 
Separate Account I
 
Separate Account I of Integrity Life Insurance Company was established in 1986, and is maintained under the insurance laws of the State of Ohio.  The Separate Account is a unit investment trust, which is a type of investment company governed by the Investment Company Act of 1940 (1940 Act).
 
Under Ohio law, we own the assets of our Separate Account and use them to support the Subaccounts of your contract and other variable annuity contracts.  You participate in the Separate Account in proportion to the amounts in your contract.  Integrity Life Insurance Company is responsible for all obligations under the contract.
 
Income, gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized, from assets allocated to the Separate Account
 
V2I-12



 
are credited to or charged against the Separate Account without regard to our other income, gains or losses.  The assets of the Separate Account may not be charged with the liabilities arising out of our other businesses.  We may allow fees that are owed to us to stay in the Separate Account, and, in that way, we can participate proportionately in the Separate Account.  We may also periodically withdraw amounts that are earned and owed to us from the Separate Account.
 
Subaccounts
 
The Separate Account is divided into Subaccounts.  Each Subaccount invests in shares of a Fund with the same name.  The Subaccounts available in this contract are listed in Part 3.  We may add, substitute or close Subaccounts from time to time, and we may limit the amount of your investment in one or more of the Subaccounts on a nondiscriminatory basis.
 
Each Subaccount available in this contract (except for the Vanguard Variable Insurance Fund Money Market Portfolio) invests in the shares of a distinct ETF.  Each ETF available through a Subaccount is a registered investment company.  ETF shares are traded throughout the day on exchanges, such as the NYSE Arca, Inc.  ETF shares may trade at, above or below their net asset value; however, for purposes of valuing the Subaccount Units, we will use the daily closing price of each ETF on its primary exchange.
 
Each ETF available through a Subaccount in this contract seeks investment results that correspond to an index.  The returns on the ETF shares will not precisely correlate with the performance of the index.  You cannot invest directly in an index.  You may want to purchase this variable annuity instead of one that does not invest in passively managed ETFs for several reasons, including, but not limited to, that the underlying fund costs are substantially lower than those of most variable annuities on the market today.
 
Distribution of Variable Annuity Contracts
 
Touchstone Securities, Inc., an affiliate of Integrity, serves as the principal underwriter for our variable annuity contracts.  The principal business address of Touchstone Securities is 303 Broadway, Suite 1100, Cincinnati, Ohio 45202.  The contracts are sold by individuals who are licensed insurance agents and registered representatives of broker-dealers or financial institutions that have entered into distribution agreements with us.
 
ETF Custodian
 
Mid Atlantic Trust Company (MATC), a South Dakota registered non-depository trust company, is the custodian for the ETFs held by the Subaccounts.  MATC provides certain services to the Separate Account, including custody of and accounting services for the ETFs owned by the Separate Account.  MATC also facilitates execution of the purchase and sale of the ETFs through third-party broker-dealers.  These third-party broker-dealers, working with MATC, provide the ETFs to the Separate Account at the daily closing price of each ETF on its primary exchange.  Fees for the services of the third-party broker-dealers are paid by MATC. We pay for these services under agreements with MATC.
 
The services of MATC and the third-party broker-dealers underlie the process supporting this variable annuity and the subaccounts’ investments.  If either MATC or the third-party broker-dealers terminate or significantly modify the services provided to us, we will seek to replace those services through other providers or through other methods.  If suitable replacement services are not available, we will take such other actions or make changes in how we operate as allowed by law and your annuity contract to mitigate any adverse effects on the Separate Accounts, you and us to the greatest extent reasonably possible.   These actions could include working directly with broker-dealers to purchase ETFs; bringing in-house the services being provided by MATC; and/or making available index mutual funds as underlying investment options.  While we believe it is highly unlikely, it is possible that under a worst-case
scenario we would be required to disallow additional premiums into the contract, and that transfers could only be made into the money market subaccount (although your then-current allocations would not be affected).

·                  make any changes required by the 1940 Act or other federal securities laws;
·                  make any changes necessary to maintain the status of the contracts as annuities and/or IRAs under the Tax Code; or
·                  make other changes required under federal or state law relating to annuities.

iShares® Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF
 
The Fund seeks to track investment results of the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index, which measures the performance of the total U.S. investment-grade bond market.  As of December 31, 2014, there were 9,079 issues in the index.  The index includes investment-grade U.S. Treasury bonds, government-related bonds, corporate bonds, mortgage-backed pass-through securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities that are publicly offered for sale in the United States.  The index may include large-, mid-, or small-capitalization companies, and components primarily include mortgage-backed pass-through and treasury securities, and financials and industrials companies.  The components of the index, and the degree to which these components represent certain industries, may change over time.

iShares® Intermediate Credit Bond ETF

iShares® TIPS Bond ETF
 
The Fund seeks to track investment results of the Barclays Capital U.S. Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) Index (Series-L), which measures the performance of the inflation-protected public obligations of the U.S. Treasury, commonly known as “TIPS.”  TIPS are securities issued by the U.S. Treasury that are designed to provide inflation protection to investors.  TIPS are income-generating instruments whose interest and principal payments are adjusted for inflation—a sustained increase in prices that erodes the purchasing power of money.  The inflation adjustment, which is typically applied monthly to the principal of the bond, follows a designated inflation index, the consumer price index (“CPI”), and TIPS’ principal payments are adjusted according to changes in the CPI.  A fixed coupon rate is applied to the inflation-adjusted principal so that as inflation rises, both the principal
value and the interest payments increase.  This can provide investors with a hedge against inflation, as it helps preserve the purchasing power of an investment.  Because of this inflation adjustment feature, inflation-protected bonds typically have lower yields than conventional fixed-rate bonds.  The index includes all publicly issued U.S. Treasury inflation-protected securities that have at least one year remaining to maturity, are rated investment-grade and have $250 million or more of outstanding face value.  In addition, the securities in the index must be denominated in U.S. dollars and must be fixed-rate and non-convertible.

The Fund seeks to track the performance of a market-weighted corporate bond index with an intermediate-term dollar-weighted average maturity.  The Fund employs an indexing investment approach designed to track the performance of the Barclays Capital U.S. 5-10 Year Corporate Bond Index.  This index includes U.S. dollar-denominated, investment-grade, fixed-rate, taxable securities issued by industrial, utility, and financial companies, with maturities between 5 and 10 years.  The Fund invests by sampling the index, meaning that it holds a range of securities that, in the aggregate, approximates the full index in terms of key risk factors and other characteristics.  All of the Fund’s investments will be selected through the sampling process, and under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the Fund’s assets will be invested in bonds included in the index.  The Fund maintains a dollar-weighted average maturity consistent
with that of the index, which was 7.3 years as of August 31, 2015.
 
Vanguard Short-Term Bond Index Fund, ETF Shares
 
The Fund seeks to track the performance of a market-weighted bond index with a short-term dollar-weighted average maturity.  The Fund employs an indexing investment approach designed to track the performance of the Barclays Capital U.S. 1-5 Year Government/Credit Float Adjusted Index.  This index includes all medium and larger issues of U.S. government, investment-grade corporate, and investment-

grade international dollar-denominated bonds that have maturities between 1 and 5 years and are publically issued.  The Fund invests by sampling the index, meaning that it holds a range of securities that, in the aggregate, approximates the full index in terms of key risk factors and other characteristics.  All of the Fund’s investments will be selected through the sampling process, and at least 80% of the Fund’s assets will be invested in bonds held in the index.  The Fund maintains a dollar-weighted average maturity consistent with that of the index, which generally does not exceed 3 years.
 
Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund, ETF Shares

average maturity consistent with that of the index, which generally ranges between 5 and 10 years.
 
Vanguard Variable Insurance Fund Money Market Portfolio
 
The portfolio (Fund) seeks to provide current income while maintaining liquidity and a stable share price of $1, although there is no guarantee that it will do so.  The portfolio invests primarily in high-quality, short-term money market instruments, including certificates of deposit, banker’s acceptances, commercial paper, Eurodollar and Yankee obligations, and other money market securities.  To be considered high quality, a security generally must be rated in one of the two highest credit-quality categories for short-term securities by at least two nationally recognized rating services (or by one, if only one rating service has rated the security).  If unrated, the security must be determined by Vanguard to be of quality equivalent to securities in the two highest credit-quality categories.  The Portfolio invests more than 25% of its assets in securities issued by companies in the financial services industry. 
The Portfolio maintains a dollar-weighted average maturity of 60 days or less and a dollar-weighted average life of 120 days or less.
 
International and Alternative Funds:
 
iShares® International Treasury Bond ETF
 
The Fund seeks to track investment results of the S&P/Citigroup International Treasury Bond Index Ex-US, which is a broad, diverse, market value-weighted index designed to measure the performance of bonds denominated in local currencies and issued by foreign governments in developed market countries outside the United States.  The index methodology is designed to balance the weighting of each country within the index by limiting the weightings of countries with higher debt outstanding and reallocating this excess to countries with lower debt outstanding.  To be eligible for inclusion in the index, the issuing country must be a “Developed Country” as classified by the Bank for International Settlements.  As of September 30, 2015, the index included securities issued by the governments in the following 18 countries: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada,
Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.  The index includes bonds having a remaining maturity greater than one year.

V2I-18



 
Vanguard Emerging Markets Stock Index Fund, ETF Shares

The Fund seeks to provide a high level of income and moderate long-term capital appreciation by tracking the performance of a benchmark index that measures the performance of publicly traded equity real estate investment trusts (REITs).  The Fund employs an indexing investment approach designed to track the performance of the MSCI US REIT Index.  The index is composed of stocks of publicly traded equity REITs.  The Fund attempts to replicate the index by investing all, or substantially all, of its assets in the stocks that make up the index, holding each stock in approximately the same proportion as its weighting in the index.
 
Static Asset Allocation Models
 
We are not currently offering asset allocation models.  We have previously offered asset allocation models in connection with your variable annuity at no extra charge, and may do so in the future.  Asset allocation is the process of investing in different asset classes — such as equity funds, fixed income funds, and alternative funds — depending on your personal investment goals, tolerance for risk, and investment time horizon.  By spreading your money among a variety of asset classes, you may be able to reduce the risk and volatility of investing, although there are no guarantees.
 
We have no discretionary authority or control over your choice of Subaccounts or your other investment decisions.  We may make available educational information and materials, such as a risk tolerance questionnaire, that may help you select an asset allocation model, but we do not recommend asset allocation models or otherwise provide advice about whether an asset allocation model may be appropriate for you.
 
Our asset allocation models are “static.”  Although we may change or terminate asset allocation models we are offering to new contract purchasers, we will not change your allocations unless you advise us to do so.  You will not be notified if the models are terminated or changed.  You will not be provided with information regarding any terminations or changes to the asset allocation models.  If you elect to invest using an asset allocation model, and if you elect automatic rebalancing, we will continue to rebalance your percentage allocations among the Funds in your existing model.
 
You should consult your investment professional periodically to consider whether any model you have selected is still appropriate for you.  You may choose to invest in an asset allocation model or change your asset allocation at any time, subject to the limitations stated in your contract and this prospectus.  See Part 5, section titled “Allocations and Transfers.”
 
Asset allocation does not ensure a profit, guarantee that your Account Value will increase or protect against a decline if market prices fall.  An asset allocation model may not perform as intended.  Any asset allocation models offered are based on then-available Funds in this annuity.  We may discontinue, add, eliminate or change the models at any time.
 
The Fixed Account
 
Our Fixed Account is offered through our General Account, which also supports any portion of the Death Benefit, the annuity benefit, and any guarantees under a Rider that are in excess of Account Value.  The General Account is not registered under the Securities Act of 1933 or the 1940 Act.  Disclosures regarding the Fixed Account and the General Account are subject to certain provisions of the federal securities laws relating to the accuracy and completeness of statements made in prospectuses.
 
V2I-19
 



 
Systematic Transfer Option (STO)
 
We offer a STO (a Fixed Account) that provides a fixed interest rate on each premium allocated to the STO.  That interest rate is guaranteed for that premium while in the STO period selected.  Available STO periods are six months or one year.  All STO premiums will be automatically transferred into the Subaccounts within either six months or one year of your premium payment into the STO, depending on which STO period you select.  You can invest in either the six-month or one-year STO at any one time, but not both.  We require a minimum premium to the STO of $6,000 to fund the six-month STO or $12,000 to fund the one-year STO.  We will automatically transfer equal amounts monthly for the six-month STO and either monthly or quarterly for the one-year STO.  Once you have invested premium in a STO, it cannot be transferred from the STO except as the automatic transfers described above.
 
The STO is available for new premiums only.  You cannot transfer from the Subaccounts into the STO.  See “Systematic Transfer Program” in Part 9 for more details on this program.  If you elect a GLWB Rider, the STO is only available for your initial premium received by us on or before the Contract Date.
 
Part 4 — Deductions and Charges
 
Separate Account Charges
 
We deduct a daily charge equal to an annual effective rate of 1.90% of your Account Value in each of the Subaccounts to cover our separate account charges, which include:
 
·                  mortality and expense risk charge of 0.75%;
·                  administration charge of 0.35%; and
·                  distribution charge of 0.80%.
 
The mortality and expense risk charge pays us for assuming the mortality risk and the expense risk under the contract.  The mortality risk, as used here, refers to our risk that Death Benefits are greater than anticipated, or that annuitants, as a class of persons, will live longer than estimated and we will be required to pay out more annuity benefits than anticipated.  The expense risk is our risk that the expenses of administering the contract will exceed the reimbursement for administrative expenses.
 
The administration charge is used to reimburse us for administrative expenses, including, but not limited to, processing applications, issuing contracts, processing customer orders and other requests, making investments, providing regular reports and confirmations to customers, providing reports and updates to regulators, maintaining accounting records for each contract owner, administering income payments, furnishing accounting and valuation services (including the calculation and monitoring of the daily Unit Values), reconciling and depositing cash receipts, and providing forms.
 
The administration charge also reimburses us for the cost and commissions associated with investing in the underlying ETFs, including brokerage commissions.  The brokerage commissions associated with the ETF trades will be paid directly by MATC to the executing broker, and indirectly by us under an arrangement with MATC.  See Part 2, section titled “ETF Custodian.”  This arrangement is a proprietary fee arrangement based on a percentage of assets invested in the ETFs.  Ultimately, this cost is passed along to you as part of this administrative expense.
 
The distribution charge reimburses us for the costs of distribution of this variable annuity, including commissions paid to our distributors.
 
We expect to make a profit from the separate account charges.
 
Fund Expenses
 
The net asset value of the Fund shares reflects investment management fees and other expenses that have already been deducted from the assets of the Funds.  Please refer to Part 1, section titled “Total
 
V2I-20



 
Annual Fund Operating Expenses,” and the individual Fund’s prospectus for details on Fund expenses.
 
Withdrawal Charge
 
If you withdraw your premiums, you may be charged a withdrawal charge of up to 7% of the premium.  The amount of the withdrawal charge is a percentage of each premium withdrawn and not of the Account Value.  The charge varies, depending upon the “age” of the premiums included in the withdrawal.  The “age” of a premium is the number of years that have passed since each premium was paid.

When you take a withdrawal, the oldest premium is treated as the first withdrawn, then next oldest and so on.  Any gain or earnings in your contract come out only after an amount equal to all your premiums, and any applicable charges on those premiums, is withdrawn.  Please note, however, that for tax purposes, withdrawals are generally considered to be gain first.  See Part 8.
 
Because the withdrawal charge applies to each premium, if your Account Value has declined due to poor performance of your selected Subaccounts or you have taken previous withdrawals, including the Free Withdrawal Amount, the withdrawal charge may be greater than the amount available for withdrawal.  In some instances, your Account Value may be positive, but you will not have money available to withdraw due to the amount of the withdrawal charge still applicable to your premiums.  A withdrawal charge applies to the withdrawal charge amount itself since this amount is part of the premium withdrawn.
 
You may take your Free Withdrawal Amount each Contract Year without paying a withdrawal charge.  More details on the Free Withdrawal Amount are in Part 5, in the section titled “Free Withdrawal Amount.”
 
We will not deduct a withdrawal charge from:
 
·                  the Death Benefit; or
·                  a withdrawal used to buy an immediate annuity from us after the first Contract Anniversary with either: (i) life contingencies; or (ii) a period certain that provides for fixed payments over 10 or more years.
 
If you take withdrawals (other than the Free Withdrawal Amount or RMD), this contract also requires that you have a minimum Account Value of $20,000 remaining after the withdrawal.  (Please note that you may fully surrender your contract at any time.)  This rule does not apply if you have a GLWB Rider.  See Part 5, section titled “Withdrawals.”
 
For more information and examples of application of the withdrawal charge, see Appendix B.
 
Reduction or Elimination of the Withdrawal Charge
 
We can reduce or eliminate the withdrawal charge for individuals or a group of individuals if we anticipate expense savings.  We may do this based on the size and type of the group, the amount of the premium, or whether there is some relationship with us.  Examples of these relationships would include being an employee of Integrity or an affiliate, receiving distributions or making internal transfers from other contracts we issued, or transferring amounts held under qualified plans that we, or our affiliates, sponsored.  We will not unlawfully discriminate against any person or group if we reduce or eliminate the withdrawal charge.
 
V2I-21



 
Commission Allowance and Additional Payments to Distributors
 
We generally pay a commission to the sales representative up to a maximum of 6% of premiums, and up to a 0.80% trail commission paid on Account Value starting in the second Contract Year.  Commissions may vary due to differences between states, sales channels, sales firms and special sales initiatives.
 
A broker-dealer or financial institution that distributes our variable annuity contracts may receive additional compensation from us for training, marketing or other services provided.  These services may include special access to sales staff and advantageous placement of our products.  We do not make an independent assessment of the cost to the broker-dealer or financial institution of providing such services.
 
Integrity has agreements with some broker-dealer firms under which we pay varying amounts, but no more than 0.25% of Account Value, for enhanced access to their registered representatives.  The broker-dealer firms are BB&T Investment Services, Inc., Comerica Securities, Inc., Cuso Financial Services, L.P., Fifth Third Securities, Inc., Frost Brokerage Services, Inc., Hancock Investment Services, Inc., LPL Financial Corporation, and M&T Securities, Inc.
 
Depending on the arrangements in place at any particular time, a broker-dealer, and the registered representatives associated with it, may have a financial incentive to recommend a particular variable annuity contract.  This could create a conflict of interest between the broker-dealer or the registered representative and the customer.  These payments could provide incentive to a broker-dealer or registered representative to recommend a Contract that is not in your best interest.  You can find more about compensation in the SAI. 
 
Optional Benefit Charges
 
You may purchase one of the GLWB Riders offered with this contract, which provide optional benefits for an additional cost.  The additional cost of the Riders, along with complete details about their benefits, is provided in Part 6.
 
Tax Reserve
 
In the future, we may charge for taxes or set aside reserves for taxes, which will reduce the investment performance of the Subaccounts.
 
State Premium Tax
 
We will not deduct state premium taxes from your premiums before investing them in the Investment Options, unless required by your state law.  If you elect an Annuity Option, we will deduct any applicable state premium taxes from the amount available for the Annuity Option.  State premium taxes currently range from 0 to 1.0% for IRAs.
 
Part 5 — Terms of Your Variable Annuity
 
Purchasing the Contract
 
If you wish to purchase a contract, you must apply for it through an authorized sales representative.  The sales representative will send your completed application to us, and we will decide whether to accept or reject it.  If we accept your application, we will issue a contract and send it to you either directly or through your sales representative.
 
To apply for a contract, you must be of legal age to enter into a contractual relationship under applicable state law, generally 18 years old.  You must be no older than 80 at the time of application.
 
V2I-22



 
This contract must be issued as an IRA.  Subject to various rules and limitations, the Tax Code permits you to transfer or roll over money tax-free from one IRA to another IRA or from certain other qualified plans, such as a 401(k) plan, to an IRA.  See Part 8.
 
If you are transferring money from another annuity contract that is an IRA to acquire this contract, you should carefully compare this contract to your current contract.  You may have to pay a withdrawal charge under your current contract to transfer to this contract, and this contract has its own withdrawal charges that would apply to you.  The other fees and charges under this contract may be higher (or lower), and the benefits may be different, than those of your current contract.  In addition, you may have to pay federal income and penalty taxes on the transfer if it does not qualify for tax-free transfer or rollover treatment.  You should not transfer from another annuity contract unless you determine that the transfer is right for you.  Please note that the person who sells you this contract generally will earn a commission on the sale.  You should also consult a tax advisor before requesting a tax-free
transfer or rollover.
 
Premium Payments
 



Minimum initial  premium(6) 

  

$    25,000  


Minimum additional premium 

  

$      1,000  


Maximum total premium without prior approval 

  

$1,000,000  


Maximum additional premium 

  

up to applicable IRA limits each calendar year plus  permissible transfers and rollovers   
 
Because the initial premium must be $25,000 or more, the contract can only be purchased by transfer or rollover from an existing IRA or from certain other qualified plans, such as a 401(k) or a 403(b) plan.  You can make additional premium payments at any time before age 81, or earlier if limited by the Tax Code.  For example, you cannot contribute new premiums other than transfers and rollovers to a traditional IRA for the calendar year in which you reach age 70½, and thereafter.
 
You must determine whether any premium qualifies as a permissible contribution subject to favorable tax treatment under the Tax Code.  You must also determine whether such amount qualifies as a permissible transfer or rollover contribution under the Tax Code. For example, you cannot roll over from a SIMPLE IRA during the first two years of participation in the SIMPLE IRA and you cannot roll over after-tax contributions that are included in the other plans.  You cannot roll over distributions that are part of a series of substantially equal payments made over your life expectancy, distributions made for a specified period of 10 years or more, RMD distributions or hardship distribution.  For more information about limitations, see Part 8, section titled “Rollovers and Transfers.”
 
If you transfer or roll over money into this contract in the calendar year on or after you reach age 70½, you must take your RMD for the current calendar year before you purchase this contract.
 
We may refuse additional premiums if: (1) you have allocated some or all of the premium to an Investment Option, to which we are no longer accepting additional premiums; (2) the additional premium does not meet our minimum additional premium amount or exceeds our maximum premium amount for the annuity contract or for a specific Investment Option; (3) the total premiums paid under all annuity contracts issued by us, or our affiliates, on your life exceed $1,000,000; (4) we believe that the additional premium is being made by or on behalf of an institutional investor; or (5) for any reason allowed by law.  You cannot purchase this contract with a rollover or transfer of death benefits from another annuity.
 
Your premiums are invested in the Investment Options you select.  Each premium is credited as of the date we receive the premium in Good Order at our Administrative Office, except that additional time is allowed for the application of the initial premium under Rule 22c-1 of the 1940 Act.  Good Order means complete information we require to process your application or any request.
 

(6)  The minimum initial premium is $15,000 if the annuity is purchased in certain distribution outlets, currently at distribution outlets affiliated with U.S. Bancorp.
 
V2I-23



 
Initial premium allocated to the subaccounts will be priced at the unit value determined no later than two business days after receipt of a completed application (including all necessary related information).  If the application is not complete, we may retain the initial premium for up to five business days while attempting to complete it.  If the application is not completed within five business days, you will be informed of the reason for the delay.  The initial premium will be returned unless you specifically allow us to hold the premium until the application is completed.
 
Once received in Good Order, premiums allocated to Subaccounts are used to purchase Units at the Unit Value as of the next close of the New York Stock Exchange.
 
Each additional premium will be credited to your Subaccount under your stated allocation as of the date we have received the premium in Good Order at our Administrative Office.  If you submit a different allocation, a 60-day waiting period will start before you can make a subsequent transfer or allocation change.  See Part 5, section titled “Allocations and Transfers.”
 
All premiums are deemed received when they are received in Good Order at our Administrative Office.
 
Units in Our Separate Account
 
Your investment in the Subaccounts is used to purchase Units.  On any given day, the value you have in a Subaccount is the number of Units you own in that Subaccount multiplied by the Unit Value.  The Units of each Subaccount have a different Unit Value.
 
Units are purchased when you contribute new premium to your contract or transfer amounts to a Subaccount.  Units are redeemed (sold) when you make withdrawals or transfer amounts out of a Subaccount into a different Subaccount.  We also redeem Units to pay the Death Benefit or if you elect an Annuity Option, or as permitted or required by law.  The number of Units purchased or redeemed in any Subaccount is calculated by dividing the dollar amount of the transaction by the next computed Unit Value for that Subaccount, calculated as of the next close of business of the New York Stock Exchange.
 
Each Unit represents a fractional undivided interest in the assets held in the related Subaccount.  If Units of any Subaccount are redeemed, the fractional undivided interest represented by each remaining Unit will be increased.  If additional Units are issued by any Subaccount, the fractional undivided interest represented by each remaining Unit will be decreased.  Units will remain outstanding until redeemed by a contract owner.
 
If we make a mistake in executing any purchase or redemption, we will reprocess any trades made in error and ensure that you receive the correct Unit Values.  We will put you in the same position you otherwise would have been in.  Depending on the change in Unit Values between the error and correction, we may experience a gain or loss as a result of the reprocessing.
 
The Unit Value of each Subaccount will fluctuate with the investment performance of the corresponding Fund, which reflects the investment income, realized and unrealized capital gains and losses of the Fund, and the Fund’s expenses.
 
How We Determine Unit Value
 
We determine the Unit Value for each Subaccount after the close of business of the New York Stock Exchange, which is normally 4 p.m. Eastern Time on each Business Day.  To value your Subaccount Units invested in ETFs, we use the daily closing price of each ETF on its primary exchange.  Note that the ETF shares may trade at a discount from the net asset value of the ETF.  To value your Subaccount Units invested in the Vanguard Variable Insurance Fund Money Market Portfolio, we use the daily net asset value provided by Vanguard for the Money Market Portfolio.  In addition to the Fund shares, the Subaccounts that invest in the ETFs also hold an accrual for any dividends or other distributions declared by the ETF, which will be reinvested in the ETF on the next Business Day after payment.
 
V2I-24



 
The Unit Value of each Subaccount for any Business Day is equal to the Unit Value for the previous Business Day, multiplied by the net investment factor for that Subaccount on the current Business Day.  The net investment factor measures the investment performance of a Subaccount from one Business Day to the next.
 
We determine the net investment factor by dividing the net asset value of the Subaccount for that valuation period by the net asset value of the Subaccount for the preceding valuation period.  We subtract from that result the daily equivalent of the annual separate account charges for each calendar day since the last day that a Unit Value was determined (for example, a Monday calculation will include charges for Saturday and Sunday).
 
Generally, this means that we adjust Unit Values to reflect the change in value of the Fund shares, for the separate account charges and, if elected, the GLWB Rider charge.
 
Allocations and Transfers
 
Only one investment allocation to the Subaccounts may be in place at any time on your contract.  This allocation applies to your current investment, future premiums, and rebalancing.  In addition to your one allocation to the Subaccounts, you may allocate some or all of your initial premium and additional new premium to the STO.  Transfers from the STO to the Subaccounts must be according to your one investment allocation to the Subaccounts.
 
You may reallocate all or part of your Account Value among the Subaccounts; however, each reallocation triggers a 60-day waiting period before you can make another allocation change.  A transfer between or among Subaccounts is an “allocation change.”  Here are the details:
 
·                  A 60-day waiting period applies after your initial allocation on the Contract Date.  This means you must wait 60 days after the contract is issued before you make an allocation change.
·                  A 60-day waiting period applies after any voluntary allocation change.  This means you must wait 60 days after the date you make an allocation change before you make another allocation change.
·                  The following allocation changes will not trigger the 60-day waiting period:
 
·                  automatic rebalancing;
·                  automatic transfers from the STO;
·                  reallocation as a result of any material change in a Fund or a Subaccount (see Part 2, section titled “Changes in How We Operate”);
·                  automatic transfers that take place upon cancellation of a GLWB Rider, unless you make additional voluntary allocation changes in connection with the GLWB Rider cancellation.
 
Allocations and transfers are restricted further if you have a GLWB Rider.  See Part 6.
 
To request a reallocation, you may write to our Administrative Office at the address in the Glossary.  Mail sent to any other address may not be in Good Order.  You may also contact your sales representative to request a reallocation.  Each request for a reallocation or transfer must specify:
 
·              the contract number; and
·              the Subaccounts and allocation percentages stated in whole percentages.
 
If one portion of a reallocation request involving multiple Subaccounts violates our policies or is not in Good Order, the entire request will not be processed.  You will need to resubmit a request that is in Good Order for your reallocation to be processed.
 
You may also request a reallocation through our telephone transfer service using your personal identifiers.  We will honor telephone instructions from any person who provides correct identifying information.  We are not responsible for fraudulent telephone requests we believe to be genuine according to these procedures.  Accordingly, you bear the risk of loss if unauthorized persons make
 
V2I-25



 
reallocations on your behalf.  Telephone reallocations may be requested from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time, on any day we are open for business.
 
If we receive your request in Good Order at our Administrative Office before 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time (or the close of the New York Stock Exchange, if earlier) on a Business Day, you will receive the Unit Values for the Subaccounts as of the close of business on the day you call.
 
Requests received at our Administrative Office at or after 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time (or the close of the New York Stock Exchange, if earlier) on a Business Day, or received on a day other than a Business Day, will be processed using Unit Values as of the close of business on the next Business Day.  We will confirm all reallocations in writing.
 
Detrimental Effect of Trading on Unit Values
 
This contract is intended for long-term investing only and is not intended as a vehicle for frequent trading.  Reallocations (transfers) among Subaccounts are strictly limited under the terms of this contract.  See Part 5, section titled “Allocations and Transfers.”  We may refuse any reallocation request for an owner or certain owners if we believe, in our sole discretion, that a specific request or group of requests may have a detrimental effect on Unit Values.  We will notify you or your designated representative if your requested reallocation is not made.
 
Specific Notice Regarding the Use of this Annuity for Market Timing or Frequent Trading
 
This contract is not designed to serve as a vehicle for trading in response to short-term fluctuations in the market.  You cannot engage in intra-day trading of the ETFs available through the Subaccounts.  Any person that intends to engage in stale price arbitrage, utilize market timing practices or make frequent transfers for any reason should not purchase this contract.
 
If we determine, in our sole discretion, that a contract owner is attempting to engage in improper trading, we may revoke their same-day reallocation/transfer privileges and require their trades to be submitted via U.S. Mail or overnight delivery service.  We may reverse transactions made in violation of our market timing policies.  We may modify these restrictions at any time in our sole discretion.
 
Withdrawals
 
You may make withdrawals as often as you wish, subject to following rules:
 
·                  Each withdrawal must be at least $250.
·                  Your Account Value remaining after a partial withdrawal, including any withdrawal charge, must be at least $20,000.  (Please note that you may fully surrender your contract at any time.)  This rule does not apply to a withdrawal of your Free Withdrawal Amount, your RMD, or if you have a GLWB Rider.
 
Unless you request a withdrawal from a specific Investment Option, we will take the withdrawal from your Investment Options, pro rata, in the same proportion their value bears to your total Account Value.  For example, if your Account Value is divided in equal 25% portions among four Subaccounts, when you make a withdrawal, 25% of the Account Value will come from each of your four Subaccounts.
 
Withdrawals are processed when a request is received in Good Order at our Administrative Office.  When you take a withdrawal from a Subaccount, Units are redeemed at the Unit Value as of the next close of the New York Stock Exchange.
 
The total amount deducted from your Account Value will be the withdrawal amount requested, plus any withdrawal charge that applies (see Part 4, section titled “Withdrawal Charge”).  The amount you receive will be the amount you requested, less any applicable tax withholding.  Withdrawals are handled differently if you elect a GLWB Rider.  See Part 6.
 
V2I-26



 
Withdrawals are attributed to your Account Value in the following order:  (1) any remaining Free Withdrawal Amount; (2) premiums that are no longer subject to a withdrawal charge and have not yet been withdrawn; (3) premiums subject to a withdrawal charge; and (4) any gain, interest, or other amount that is not considered a premium.  Your investment comes out first, beginning with the oldest premium first, then next oldest and so on.  Any gain or earnings in your contract come out only after an amount equal to all premiums, and any applicable charges on those premiums, are withdrawn.  Please note, however, that for tax purposes, withdrawals are considered to be gain first.  See Part 8.
 
Examples of withdrawals and the application of a withdrawal charge are located in Appendix B.
 
Additional restrictions apply to withdrawals if you have a GLWB Rider.  See Part 6.
 
Your Death Benefit is reduced by withdrawals on a proportional basis.  See Part 5, section titled “Death Benefit.”
 
Most of the withdrawals you make before you are 59½ years old are subject to a 10% federal tax penalty.  See Part 8.
 
Free Withdrawal Amount
 
You may take your Free Withdrawal Amount each Contract Year without paying a withdrawal charge.  The Free Withdrawal Amount is the greater of:
 
·                  10% of your Account Value on the date of the withdrawal, minus any partial withdrawals taken during the current Contract Year; or
·                  10% of your Account Value at your most recent Contract Anniversary, minus any partial withdrawals taken during the current Contract Year.  (During your first Contract Year, this amount is 10% of your initial premium received on the Contract Date.)
 
If your RMD (based on the fair market value of this contract only as calculated by us) is greater than your Free Withdrawal Amount, we will allow you to take the RMD as your Free Withdrawal Amount, but only once each Contract Year.  Because your RMD is based on a calendar year, you should plan in advance to coordinate your RMD with your available Free Withdrawal Amount.
 
If you do not take the Free Withdrawal Amount in any one Contract Year, you cannot add it, or any unused portion of it, to the next year’s Free Withdrawal Amount.
 
The Free Withdrawal Amount does not apply to a full surrender.  Taking your Free Withdrawal Amount will not reduce the total withdrawal charge applicable to your premium.  If you take a subsequent withdrawal for more than the Free Withdrawal Amount or if you surrender the contract, we will assess any applicable withdrawal charge on the amount of your premiums withdrawn, which are not reduced for any Free Withdrawal Amount you have taken.
 
The Free Withdrawal Amount is available for withdrawal only.  The Free Withdrawal Amount is not available for transfer to another IRA or other qualified contract or account.
 
Timing of Payment of a Withdrawal or Surrender
 
We normally send you partial or full withdrawals (or apply your Account Value to the purchase of an Annuity Option) within seven days after receipt of the required form at our Administrative Office.  However, we can defer our action for any period during which:
 
(1)         the New York Stock Exchange has been closed, other than a weekend or holiday, or trading on it is restricted;
 
(2)         an emergency exists as determined by the SEC so that disposal of securities is not reasonably practicable or it is not reasonably practicable for the Separate Account fairly to determine the value
 
V2I-27



 
of its net assets; or
 
(3)         the SEC, by order, permits us to defer action in order to protect persons with interests in the Separate Account.
 
Assignments
 
This contract is an IRA and you are not legally permitted to assign, pledge or otherwise transfer the contract.  Pledging or assigning an IRA can cause loss of qualified status and result in some or all of the Account Value being included in your income.  A 10% federal tax penalty also may apply.
 
Death Benefit
 
We will pay the Death Benefit to your properly designated beneficiary if you die before the Annuity Date.
 
The Death Benefit amount will be the greater of:
 
1.              the Account Value on the Death Benefit Date; and
2.              your total premiums minus proportionate adjustments for partial withdrawals, including any withdrawal charge.  A proportional adjustment means that your Death Benefit will be reduced by the same percentage as your withdrawal bears to your Account Value at the time of withdrawal.
 
Example of the effect of withdrawals on the Death Benefit:
 
·                  if your Death Benefit is $100,000 and your current Account Value is $80,000,
·                  and you take a withdrawal of $10,000,
·                  we will reduce your Death Benefit by 12.5% because that is the same percentage that your withdrawal bears to the Account Value at the time of the withdrawal ($10,000 / $80,000);
·                  therefore, your Death Benefit is reduced by $12,500.
 
Because the Account Value at the time of the withdrawal in this example is less than the Death Benefit, the Death Benefit is decreased by a larger dollar amount than the partial withdrawal amount.
 
This example is for illustrative purposes only and does not predict results.
 
Your beneficiary generally has a choice of how to receive the Death Benefit.
 
1.              The beneficiary may take a lump sum.  If the beneficiary elects this option, we will pay the Death Benefit to the beneficiary.
 
2.              The beneficiary may defer for up to five years.  If the beneficiary elects this option, we will allow the beneficiary to keep the Death Benefit invested in the available Subaccounts for a period of up to five years.  Separate account charges will continue to apply.  At the end of five years, the entire amount must be paid to the beneficiary.
 
3.              The beneficiary may treat the contract as an inherited IRA.  If the beneficiary elects this option, we will allow the beneficiary to keep the Death Benefit amount invested in the available Subaccounts.  Separate account charges will continue to apply.  The beneficiary must choose to receive the Death Benefit as either:
 
a)             an immediate annuity with a life contingency; or
b)             substantially equal payments over his or her life expectancy as defined by the Tax Code.  The beneficiary may choose the longer of his or her life expectancy or the deceased owner’s life expectancy (both as defined by the Tax Code) if the owner dies after the Required Beginning Date.  (For Roth IRAs, the owner is presumed to have died before the Required Beginning Date.)
 
V2I-28



 
Distributions must begin by December 31 of the calendar year after the owner’s death; however if the beneficiary is your spouse and has elected this option, distributions may begin at the end of the calendar year in which the owner would have reached age 70½, if later.  A spouse also may elect to continue the contract as described below in the section titled “Spousal Continuation.”  If the beneficiary fails to make an election within a reasonable time, we may automatically process the claim as if option two were elected.
 
The following restrictions apply to the inherited IRA contract: (i) the inherited IRA owner may not add premium to the contract; (ii) the Death Benefit available to the beneficiary of the inherited IRA owner is the Account Value on the Death Benefit Date after the death of the inherited IRA owner; and (iii) the beneficiary of the inherited IRA owner will be required to receive the remaining Account Value either in a lump sum, over five years or over the life expectancy of the inherited IRA owner as determined by the Tax Code.
 
For more information on inherited IRAs, see Part 8, section titled “Inherited IRAs” and IRS Publication 590.  You should seek independent tax advice.
 
If your beneficiary is not a human being, the beneficiary must elect either a lump sum or deferral for up to five years.  If the owner is a trust, custodian or other entity, the owner must name itself as the sole beneficiary.
 
Spousal Continuation
 
If your sole primary beneficiary is your spouse, the contract may be continued in your spouse’s name as the owner.  If spousal continuation is elected, we will increase the continued contract’s Account Value to the same amount that would have been paid to your surviving spouse had he or she taken the Death Benefit as a lump sum distribution.  This increase will be added to the Subaccounts you have selected on a pro rata basis.  For example, if the Account Value at death was $100,000, but we would have paid out a Death Benefit of $115,000, the surviving spouse’s contract will continue with $115,000 as the Account Value.
 
All terms and conditions of the contract continue to apply including the withdrawal charge.  When the surviving spouse dies, the Death Benefit will be paid to the beneficiary named by the surviving spouse.
 
A same-sex surviving spouse is recognized as your spouse under the Tax Code and will qualify for the federal tax advantages of spousal continuation.
 
The survivor of a civil union or domestic partnership is not recognized as your spouse under the Tax Code and the federal tax advantages of spousal continuation are not available.  The survivor of a civil union or domestic partnership may elect to continue the contract under its terms.  The continuation of the contract by such surviving civil union or domestic partner, however, is treated as an ordinary transfer of ownership and will be a taxable event.
 
Selecting and Changing Your Beneficiary
 
You may name one or more beneficiaries as primary or contingent beneficiaries.  The Death Benefit will be paid to your primary beneficiaries who are alive at the time of your death.  If no primary beneficiary survives your death, then the Death Benefit will be paid to your contingent beneficiaries, if any.  If no beneficiary survives your death (primary or contingent) or none has been named, the Death Benefit will be paid to your estate.
 
If multiple beneficiaries in either category (primary or contingent) are named, the Death Benefit will be split into equal shares among the beneficiaries in that category who are alive at the time of your death, unless you specify otherwise in your beneficiary designation.
 
V2I-29
 



 
If you die on or after the Annuity Date and before the entire interest in the contract has been distributed, then the rest of the annuity must be distributed to the beneficiary at least as quickly as the method in effect when you died.
 
You may change any beneficiary by sending the appropriate form in Good Order to the Administrative Office.  We may limit the number of beneficiaries you can have at one time.  Please consult your financial professional and tax advisor to properly identify your beneficiaries so that the Death Benefit is paid as you intend.  Please be sure to name your spouse as your sole primary beneficiary so that spousal continuation of the contract can occur, if that is your intention.  You may wish to name a contingent beneficiary in case your spouse dies before you. If the owner is a custodian, the owner must name itself as the sole beneficiary.
 
Filing Death Claims
 
To file a death claim, the beneficiary must promptly submit an original certified death certificate and company death claim paperwork that is in Good Order, including the beneficiary’s election of how they wish to receive the Death Benefit proceeds.  On the date we first receive notice of the owner’s death, we will stop all pending automatic transactions, including rebalancing and systematic withdrawals; however, any money in the STO will be transferred to the Subaccounts according to the owner’s allocation.
 
During the period from the date of death until we receive all required paperwork in Good Order, the Account Value will remain invested in the Subaccounts as allocated by you at the time of your death.  As a result, the Account Value continues to reflect the investment performance of the Subaccounts during this period and will be subject to market fluctuations.  Separate account charges will continue to apply.
 
If there are multiple beneficiaries, after one beneficiary submits death claim paperwork, the Death Benefit will be calculated and the first beneficiary will receive payment according to his or her election.  The remaining beneficiaries’ share of the Death Benefit will be invested in the Subaccounts as allocated by you at the time of your death and subject to market fluctuations.
 
Maturity Date and Annuity Option
 
Your Annuity Option is available anytime on or after your first Contract Anniversary until the Maturity Date.  You may elect your Annuity Option by writing to the Administrative Office any time on or after your first Contract Anniversary and before the Maturity Date.  Upon the Maturity Date, you may elect to receive a lump sum of your Account Value, or you may elect an Annuity Option.
 
An Annuity Option can provide for fixed payments, which may be made monthly, quarterly, semi-annually or annually.  For any annuity, the minimum payment must be at least $100.  If the minimum monthly payment under a guaranteed Annuity Option would be less than $20, we will pay you a lump sum of your Account Value instead.  All Annuity Options are funded through our General Account.
 
The amount applied toward the purchase of a guaranteed Annuity Option under the contract will be the Account Value less any premium tax.  The guaranteed Annuity Options are single life and ten years certain or joint life and ten years certain.  These options provide a fixed life income annuity with 10 years of payments guaranteed.
 
We will also use the Account Value less any premium tax to determine your annuity payments if you select a non-guaranteed Annuity Option with either (i) life contingencies, or (ii) a period certain that provides for fixed payments over ten or more years.
 
We currently offer the additional Annuity Options listed below; however, we may eliminate or change the non-guaranteed options available at any time:
 
·                  period-certain annuity, which provides for fixed payments for a fixed period.  The fixed periods available may vary from time to time and the fixed period selected may not extend past your life
 
V2I-30



 
expectancy.  The amount is determined by the period you select.  If the Annuitant dies before the end of the period selected, the beneficiary will receive the remaining periodic payments.
·                  period-certain life annuity, which provides for fixed payments for at least the period selected and after that for the life of the Annuitant or the lives of the Annuitant and any joint Annuitant under a joint and survivor annuity.  The fixed periods available may vary from time to time.  If the Annuitant (or the Annuitant and the joint Annuitant under a joint and survivor annuity) dies before the fixed period selected ends, the remaining payments in the fixed period will go to the beneficiary.
·                  life only annuity, which provides fixed payments for the life of the Annuitant, or until the Annuitant and joint Annuitant both die under a joint and survivor annuity.  Once the Annuitant (or last joint Annuitant) dies, no further payments will be made and no value remains for any beneficiaries.
 
If you have not already selected a form of Annuity Option, we will contact you prior to your Maturity Date.  You can tell us at that time if you would like a lump sum payment, or select the type of annuity you want.  If we do not receive your election on or before your Maturity Date, you will automatically receive the single life and ten-year certain Annuity Option guaranteed under the contract.
 
Annuity Payments
 
Once payments begin under an Annuity Option, payments will not change.  The size of payments will depend on the amount applied to the Annuity Option, the form of Annuity Option you chose and, in the case of an Annuity Option with life contingencies, on the Annuitant’s age and sex (where permissible).
 
If the age or sex of an Annuitant has been misstated, you will receive the benefits that would have been purchased at the correct age and gender.  Any overpayments or underpayments made by us will not be charged or credited with interest, unless required by your state.  If we have made overpayments because of incorrect information about age or gender, we will deduct the overpayment from the next payment or payments due.  We add underpayments to the next payment.
 
How You Make Requests and Give Instructions
 
When you write to our Administrative Office, use the address listed in the Glossary of this prospectus.  We cannot honor your requests unless they are in proper and complete form.  Whenever possible, use one of our printed forms, which may be obtained from our Administrative Office.
 
Abandoned or Unclaimed Property
 
Every state has laws that generally provide for payment to the state of unclaimed property, including proceeds of annuity contracts, under various circumstances.  This is called escheatment.  In addition to the state unclaimed property laws, we may be required to escheat property pursuant to regulatory demand, finding, agreement or settlement. To help prevent escheatment, it is important that you keep your contact information on file with us up to date, including the names, addresses, phone numbers, social security numbers and dates of birth for owners, annuitants, beneficiaries and other payees.  Such updates must be communicated in Good Order to our Administrative Office.
 
Part 6 — Optional Benefits
 
You may purchase one of the optional GLWB Riders offered with this contract, which provides additional benefits for an additional charge.  You may only elect a Rider at the time of application.  Benefits under a Rider will replace or supplement the standard contract benefits.  Charges for an optional benefit Rider are in addition to the standard contract charges.  Be sure you understand the charges.  Carefully consider whether you need the benefit and whether it is appropriate for your particular circumstances.  Also consider whether you can buy the benefit more cheaply as part of the variable annuity or with a separate contract.
 
V2I-31



 
Guaranteed Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit
 
Each Guaranteed Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit (GLWB) is an optional Rider you may purchase for an additional charge.  You may select the Individual GLWB Rider or the Spousal GLWB Rider.
 
The GLWB Rider guarantees lifetime payments for you (or you and your covered spouse if you elect the Spousal GLWB Rider) regardless of how your investments perform, as long as the Rider is in effect.  You are the covered person under the Individual GLWB Rider.  You and your spouse are the covered persons under the Spousal GLWB Rider.  If you take Nonguaranteed Withdrawals, as explained below, your Benefit Base will decrease immediately, your lifetime payments may decrease and the Rider may terminate.
 
Lifetime Payout Amount (LPA)
 
The LPA is the amount we guarantee you can receive each calendar year for your lifetime (or for as long as either you or your covered spouse is alive if you elect the Spousal GLWB Rider).  You are eligible to begin receiving your LPA on the LPA Eligibility Date.
 
For the Individual GLWB Rider, the LPA Eligibility Date is the earlier of the following:
 
·                  January 1st after the calendar year in which you turn age 60 (if you turn age 60 on January 1st, your LPA will be available beginning on that day); or
·                  the Contract Date, if you are age 60 or older at the time you purchase your contract.  The LPA available during the calendar year in which you purchase your contract will be prorated for the portion of the calendar year remaining.
 
For the Spousal GLWB Rider, the LPA Eligibility Date is the earlier of the following:
 
·                  January 1st after the calendar year in which the younger of you or your spouse turns age 60 (if the younger of you or your spouse turns age 60 on January 1st, your LPA will be available beginning on that day); or
·                  the Contract Date, if the younger of you or your spouse is age 60 or older at the time you purchase your contract.  The LPA available during the calendar year in which you purchase your contract will be prorated for the portion of the calendar year remaining.
 
The LPA is equal to the applicable Withdrawal Percentage multiplied by the Benefit Base on January 1st each year on or after the LPA Eligibility Date.  For the Spousal GLWB Rider, that amount is then multiplied by 90% (this 90% is called the Spousal Factor).
 
Withdrawal Percentage - The applicable Withdrawal Percentage is determined by the following formula:
 
A + B + C, where:
 
(A)       is the Age Based Percentage stated on the chart below:
 



Age* 

  

Age Based Percentage

4.50 

%  


70-74 

  

5.00 

%  


75 + 

  

5.50 

%   
 

*The Age Based Percentage is determined by your age (or the age of the younger of you or your spouse if you have elected the Spousal GLWB Rider).  The Age Based Percentage is locked in on the date of the first withdrawal from the contract on or after the LPA Eligibility Date.
 
(B)       is the cumulative Deferral Percentage.  The cumulative Deferral Percentage begins at zero and increases by 0.10% for each complete calendar year that you do not take a withdrawal.
 
V2I-32



 
(C)       is a First Year Deferral Percentage stated on the chart below:
 



Contract Date 

  

First Year Deferral Percentage

July 1-September 30 

  

0.025 

%  


October 1-December 31

%   
 
The First Year Deferral Percentage is a one-time addition to your Withdrawal Percentage that varies based on your Contract Date, provided you do not take a withdrawal in the calendar year containing the Contract Date.
 
Benefit Base - Your initial Benefit Base is equal to your initial premium received by us on the Contract Date.  Your Benefit Base will be adjusted as follows:
 
1.              On each Contract Anniversary, your Benefit Base will be compared to your Account Value and if the Account Value is greater than the Benefit Base, we will step up your Benefit Base to equal the Account Value.
2.              If you take a Nonguaranteed Withdrawal, we will immediately decrease your Benefit Base as described in the section titled “Nonguaranteed Withdrawal” below.
3.              On the date we receive an additional premium during the first Contract Year, we will immediately increase your Benefit Base by the amount of the additional premium.  Additional premiums received after the first Contract Year will not increase your Benefit Base.  They will, however, increase the Account Value, which is used to determine if a step up applies on the next Contract Anniversary.
 
The Benefit Base is used only to measure the LPA and is not available for withdrawal or payable as a death benefit.
 
If you (or the younger of you and your spouse if you have elected the Spousal GLWB Rider) have reached the LPA Eligibility Date on the Contract Date, your LPA for the calendar year that contains the Contract Date will be prorated for the portion of the calendar year remaining.  The factor used to prorate the LPA is the number of days remaining in the calendar year (not including the Contract Date) divided by the number of days in the calendar year.
 
If you withdraw less than the LPA in any calendar year, you cannot carry over or add the remaining LPA to withdrawals made in future years.
 
If your RMD is greater than the LPA for any calendar year, the RMD will be the LPA for that calendar year.
 
Nonguaranteed Withdrawal
 
Before your LPA Eligibility Date, a Nonguaranteed Withdrawal is the total amount of any withdrawal, including any withdrawal charge.
 
On or After your LPA Eligibility Date, a Nonguaranteed Withdrawal is all or a portion of any withdrawal, including any withdrawal charge, that, when combined with your total withdrawals for that calendar year, exceeds your LPA.
 
If you take a Nonguaranteed Withdrawal, your Benefit Base will immediately decrease by the adjusted Nonguaranteed Withdrawal amount.  The adjusted Nonguaranteed Withdrawal amount is defined as the Nonguaranteed Withdrawal amount multiplied by the greater of 1.0 and the ratio of Benefit Base to Account Value (Benefit Base divided by Account Value), where both values are determined immediately before the Nonguaranteed Withdrawal.  The Account Value immediately before the Nonguaranteed Withdrawal means that the Account Value will be reduced by any remaining LPA prior to the calculation.
 
V2I-33



 
Taking Nonguaranteed Withdrawals could reduce your future benefits by more than the dollar amount of the Nonguaranteed Withdrawals.
 
The example below demonstrates how a Nonguaranteed Withdrawal affects the Benefit Base, using the following assumptions:
 
·                  Individual GLWB in effect
·                  Benefit Base = $100,000
·                  Account Value = $85,000
·                  LPA = $5,000
·                  One withdrawal is taken during the calendar year = $7,000
·                  Withdrawal taken after LPA Eligibility Date
·                  No withdrawal charge applies.
 
The Nonguaranteed Withdrawal amount is $2,000, which is equal to your total calendar year withdrawals ($7,000) minus your LPA ($5,000).  The adjusted Nonguaranteed Withdrawal is $2,500:
 
$2,500 = $2,000 (Nonguaranteed Withdrawal amount) x the greater of 1.0 or [$100,000 (Benefit Base immediately before the Nonguaranteed Withdrawal) / $80,000 (Account Value immediately before the Nonguaranteed Withdrawal)]
 
Your Benefit Base will be reduced by $2,500 to $97,500.
 
This example is for illustrative purposes only and does not predict results.
 
Other Important Facts about Withdrawals
 
·                  You will not receive the intended benefit of this Rider if you take Nonguaranteed Withdrawals.  Nonguaranteed Withdrawals can have a significant negative effect on your Benefit Base and your LPA.
 
·                  A withdrawal charge may apply.  If you withdraw more than your Free Withdrawal Amount (10% of the Account Value in any Contract Year) but the withdrawal does not exceed your LPA, any applicable withdrawal charge will be waived.  If you withdraw more than the Free Withdrawal Amount and any portion of the withdrawal is a Nonguaranteed Withdrawal, a withdrawal charge, if any, will be applied on the entire amount that is greater than the Free Withdrawal Amount.  See Part 4, “Withdrawal Charge” and Part 5, “Withdrawals.”  Following is an example of how a withdrawal charge may apply:
 
Assume:
 



Individual GLWB  in effect 

  

  

   


Premium: 

  

$ 

40,000 

   


Account Value  before withdrawal: 

  

$ 

18,000 

   


Withdrawal  charge percentage applicable to premium: 

  

6 

%  


Lifetime Payment  Amount: 

  

$ 

2,000 

    
 
Case 1: Owner requests withdrawal of $2,000 (LPA)
 
The Free Withdrawal Amount is calculated as $18,000 x 10% = $1,800.  The $2,000 requested withdrawal is greater than the remaining Free Withdrawal Amount; however, it does not exceed the LPA.  No withdrawal charge will apply.
 
V2I-34



 
Case 2: Owner requests withdrawal of $2,500
 
The Free Withdrawal Amount is $1,800.  Since the requested withdrawal exceeds the LPA, withdrawal charges will apply.  After applying the withdrawal first to the Free Withdrawal Amount, this leaves $700 ($2,500 - $1,800), which will be subject to a withdrawal charge of $42 ($700 x 6%).
 
·                  Withdrawals must be taken pro rata from your Investment Options.  You cannot make a withdrawal from specific Investment Options.
 
·                  You may not take a withdrawal on your Contract Date.
 
·                  If you request a withdrawal, we will withdraw the total amount you requested from your Account Value, however the amount you receive will be net of tax withholding and withdrawal charge, if applicable.
 
·                  You must use our withdrawal form to request withdrawals.  Contact our Administrative Office to obtain the form.
 
GLWB Rider Charge
 
The GLWB Rider charge is a daily charge taken from the Account Value in your Subaccounts.  The charge is in addition to the separate account charges for the contract and reduces your Unit Values.  The charge varies depending on which GLWB Investment Strategy you choose.  The following table shows the effective annual rates for the Rider charge:
 



GLWB Investment Strategy 

  

Current GLWB Charge 

  

Current GLWB Charge with Total  Separate Account Expenses

0.65 

% 

2.55 

%  


Strategy 2 —  Self Style Allocation 

  

0.85 

% 

2.75 

%   
 
We may increase the annual charge for the GLWB Rider up to the maximum of 1.50%.  The maximum GLWB charge plus total separate account charges would be 3.40% for either GLWB Investment Strategy.
 
If we do increase the charge, we will give you prior written notice of each increase.  If you do not wish to accept an increase, you may elect to either
 
·                        cancel the Rider; or
·                        continue the Rider with a reduction in the Withdrawal Percentage as determined by us, effective at the time of the Rider charge increase (may not be available in CA and CT).  The maximum reduction in the Withdrawal Percentage is 1.00%, regardless of the number of Rider charge increases.
 
We do not deduct the Rider charge during the Guaranteed Payment Phase.
 
The GLWB Rider charge is the same for the Individual GLWB Rider and the Spousal GLWB Rider.  The LPA is adjusted downward — by the Spousal Factor of 90% — for the Spousal GLWB Rider instead of an additional charge.
 
GLWB Investment Strategies
 
If you purchase the GLWB Rider, you must allocate your premium to only one of the two GLWB Investment Strategies described below.  Once you select a GLWB Investment Strategy, you cannot switch to another GLWB Investment Strategy.  As a result of the GLWB Rider investment restrictions, you will always have some degree of exposure to the market.  You cannot eliminate this exposure even during periods of market volatility.  These GLWB Investment Strategies are designed for long-term investors seeking withdrawal guarantees.  (Note that the Subaccounts available in the GLWB Investment Strategies are also available without the Rider.)
 
V2I-35



 
The GLWB Investment Strategies are intended in part to reduce the risk of investment losses that could require us to use our own assets to make payments under the GLWB Rider. The GLWB Investment Strategies are designed to lower the volatility of returns from your Subaccounts. Subaccounts that are available without limitation (if the GLWB Rider is not selected) may offer the potential for higher returns. Before you select the GLWB Rider, you and your financial representative should carefully consider whether the GLWB Investment Strategies available with the Rider meet your investment objectives and risk tolerance.
 
GLWB Investment Strategy 1 — Basic Allocation
 
You must allocate your premium according to one of the three models: Blend, Growth or Value.  You may reallocate from one model to another, as discussed below.

For more information about these Subaccounts, including information relating to their investment objectives and policies, and the risks of investing, see Part 3, as well as the Fund prospectuses.  You can obtain a copy of the Fund prospectuses by contacting our Administrative Office listed in the Glossary.  You should read the Fund prospectuses carefully before investing.
 
In addition to your allocation to one of the two GLWB Investment Strategies, you may invest some or all of your initial premium received by us on the Contract Date in the STO.  Transfers from the STO to the Subaccounts must be according to GLWB Investment Strategy and allocation you have selected.  See Part 3, section titled “The Fixed Account” for more information about the STO.
 
Subject to required approvals by federal and state authorities, we may add, remove, change, close, substitute or limit investment in the GLWB Investment Strategies or the Subaccounts at any time.
 
Allocations and Transfers for the GLWB
 
In addition to the allocation and transfer rules under the contract (See Part 5, section titled “Allocations and Transfers”), the following additional rules and limitations apply to your allocations and transfers:
 
·                  Your one allocation allowed on the contract must meet the requirements of one of the two GLWB Investment Strategies.
·                  Your Account Value will be automatically rebalanced to your allocation percentages each contract quarter.
·                  You cannot move from one GLWB Investment Strategy to another.
·                  In GLWB Investment Strategy 1, you can reallocate your Account Value invested in one model to another model.  The reallocation will reset your Account Value to the required percentages for the new model.  Each reallocation triggers the 60-day waiting period before you can make another reallocation.
·                  In GLWB Investment Strategy 2, you can reallocate your Account Value invested in Strategy 2 as long as your new allocation is within the minimum and maximum allocation percentages for each group.  Each reallocation triggers the 60-day waiting period before you can make another reallocation.
 
Your financial professional or a third party may offer you asset allocation or investment advisory services related to this annuity contract or Rider for an additional fee to be deducted from your contract.  Such fees are considered withdrawals and could cause a Nonguaranteed Withdrawal.  Therefore, if you purchase a GLWB Rider, we do not recommend using this annuity contract to pay for such services.
 
Withdrawal Protection for Required Minimum Distributions
 
If your contract is a traditional IRA or a SEP IRA, you may be required to withdraw money in order to satisfy IRS minimum distribution requirements after you reach age 70½.
 
We will calculate the RMD for this annuity contract based on its prior calendar year-end fair market value.  We do not consider your other assets or distributions in making this calculation.  This is the RMD protected under the GLWB Riders, except if you elect the spousal Rider and your spouse is more than 10 years younger than you.  In that case, due to your age difference, you will be required to take your RMD for this annuity contract before the LPA Eligibility Date; if you take your RMD from this contract’s Account Value, each withdrawal will be a Nonguaranteed Withdrawal until the LPA Eligibility Date is reached.  You are solely responsible for meeting all requirements of the Tax Code.
 
After the LPA Eligibility Date, you may take the greater of your LPA or your RMD each calendar year.  In the year you turn 70½ the Tax Code provides that you may take your first RMD prior to April 1st of the following calendar year; however, with a GLWB Rider, you must take your first annual RMD in the calendar year you turn age 70½ in order to avoid a potential Nonguaranteed Withdrawal.
 
V2I-37



 
We may make any changes we deem necessary to comply with the tax laws.  We are not liable for any tax consequences you incur arising from this contract or your obligations under the Tax Code.  You should discuss these matters with your tax advisor prior to electing a GLWB Rider.
 
Continuation of the Spousal GLWB at Owner’s Death
 
Married spouses — If your covered spouse is recognized under the Tax Code, including same-sex spouses, he or she will have the option to continue the contract and the GLWB Rider at the time of your death.  Your covered spouse will become the owner and annuitant of the contract and all terms and conditions of the contract continue to apply.  See Part 5, section titled “Spousal Continuation.”
 
Civil Union or Domestic Partners — for civil union or domestic partners as defined by state law, the covered partner may continue to receive the LPA under the terms of the Rider.  Due to federal tax laws, however, not all terms of the contract can be applied.  If the covered partner wishes to continue receiving the LPA, he or she must elect to treat the contract as an inherited IRA.  See Part 5, section titled “Death Benefit.”  All provisions of the contract and the GLWB Rider still apply, except (i) the covered partner must take at least the RMD each calendar year (caution: this may cause a Nonguaranteed Withdrawal if the LPA Eligibility Date has not been reached); (ii) the covered partner cannot add premium to the contract; (iii) the Death Benefit available to the beneficiary of the covered partner is limited to the Account Value on the Death Benefit Date; and (iv) the beneficiary
of the covered partner will be required to receive the remaining Account Value either in a lump sum, over five years or over the life expectancy of the covered partner as determined by the Tax Code.  These restrictions are required by the Tax Code.
 
Guaranteed Payment Phase
 
The Guaranteed Payment Phase begins on or after the LPA Eligibility Date if either:
 
·                  Before the Maturity Date, the Account Value reduces to zero (other than as a result of a Nonguaranteed Withdrawal or the voluntary election of an Annuity Option).
·                  On the Maturity Date, you elect to continue to receive annual payments equal to the then current LPA through a life only Annuity Option (or joint life if you have elected the Spousal GLWB Rider and both you and your covered spouse are still living.)  If you do not elect the LPA Annuity Option, you will automatically receive a single life and 10-year certain Annuity Option under your Contract. 
 
When the contract begins the Guaranteed Payment Phase, we will send you a written notice and any remaining LPA that you have not taken during the current calendar year.  (If your contract enters the Guaranteed Payment Phase on the Maturity Date, we will set your Account Value to zero.)  Beginning the next calendar year, and in each calendar year during the Guaranteed Payment Phase, you will receive your LPA.  The Guaranteed Payment Phase will continue until the death of the owner (or owner and covered spouse if the Spousal GLWB is elected).
 
Once the Guaranteed Payment Phase begins, all other rights, benefits, values and charges under the contract and the GLWB Rider will terminate, except those described in this section and in the “Cancellation and Termination of Rider” section below.  The Guaranteed Payment Phase will end if the Rider terminates.  See “Cancellation and Termination of Rider” section below.  We should be notified immediately upon the death of the owner (or covered spouse if the Spousal GLWB is elected).
 
Cancellation and Termination of Rider
 
You may cancel the Rider during the first 45 days of each Contract Year beginning on the fifth Contract Anniversary.  Upon termination of the Rider, the Rider charge will no longer be assessed.  All other charges will remain in effect.
 
This Rider will terminate automatically on the earliest of the following dates:
 
1.              for the Individual GLWB Rider, the date you die, and for the Spousal GLWB Rider, the date the later of you or your covered spouse dies;
2.              the date the Account Value equals zero due to a Nonguaranteed Withdrawal;
3.              the date that ownership of the contract or Rider is transferred or the contract, Rider or any benefits under the contract or Rider are assigned unless the new owner assumes full ownership of the contract and is essentially the same person as the current owner (e.g. a change to a court
 
V2I-38



 
appointed guardian representing the owner during the owner’s lifetime) or the new owner is a covered person;
4.              on the Maturity Date, unless you elect to receive your LPA through a life only Annuity Option, or joint life only Annuity Option if you have elected the Spousal GLWB Rider and your covered spouse is still living;
5.              the date you voluntarily elect an Annuity Option under the contract;
6.              the date you cancel the GLWB Rider; or
7.              the date you surrender the contract.
 
Once cancelled or terminated, this Rider may not be reinstated.
 
Additional Rules
 
The following additional rules apply if you elect a GLWB Rider:
 
·                  You must be between 45 and 80 years old on the Contract Date in order to elect the Individual GLWB Rider.  In order to elect the Spousal GLWB Rider, both you and your spouse must be between 45 and 80 years old on the Contract Date.
·                  The Company may refuse to accept additional premiums on a nondiscriminatory basis at any time.
·                  We may require proof that you (or your covered spouse) are living at any time.
·                  You cannot switch from an Individual GLWB Rider to a Spousal GLWB Rider or vice versa.
·                  Income Plus Withdrawal Program is not available.
·                  Choices Plus Required Minimum Distribution Program is not available.
·                  Customized Asset Rebalancing Program is not available.
·                  Systematic withdrawal of RMD only is not available.
 
Additional Rules that Apply to the Spousal GLWB Rider
 
1.              Only your legal spouse (as defined by applicable state law) on the Contract Date may be named as a covered person under the Spousal GLWB Rider.
2.              You must name your spouse as your sole primary beneficiary.
3.              You cannot add or change a spouse as a covered person.
4.              If your marriage is terminated (such as by divorce or dissolution) or your spouse dies, your spouse is automatically removed as a covered person.  If you subsequently remarry, you cannot add the new spouse.
5.              You must provide us with notice of the divorce or termination of marriage.
6.              Once the spouse is removed as a covered person, lifetime withdrawals under the Spousal GLWB Rider are no longer guaranteed for the lives of both you and your spouse.  (If a spouse is removed, you can name a new beneficiary to receive the Death Benefit.)
7.              If a spouse is removed and is no longer a covered person, the LPA Eligibility Date and the Age Based Percentage are still based on the younger of you or your (now removed) spouse.
8.              If a spouse is removed and is no longer a covered person, the Spousal Factor of 90% will continue to apply to your LPA calculation.
 
Should You Purchase the GLWB Rider?
 
The addition of a GLWB Rider to your annuity contract may not be right for you.  For example:
 
·                  if you are purchasing the GLWB Rider to meet income needs, you should consider whether an immediate annuity is better suited to your situation;
·                  if you do not expect to take withdrawals while this Rider is in effect, you do not need a GLWB Rider because the benefit is accessed through withdrawals; or
·                  if you are likely to need to take withdrawals prior to your LPA Eligibility Date or in an amount that is greater than the LPA or RMD for this contract only, you should carefully evaluate whether a GLWB Rider is appropriate, due to the negative effect of Nonguaranteed Withdrawals on your Benefit Base.
·                  If your spouse is 10 or more years younger than you, the Spousal GLWB Rider may not be suitable for you.
 
At older ages, benefits paid may not exceed the charges associated with the Rider depending on how long the covered person lives.
 
V2I-39



 
You should consult with your tax advisor and financial representative and carefully consider your alternatives before deciding if a GLWB Rider is suitable for your needs.
 
Examples
 
Please see Appendix C for hypothetical examples that illustrate how the GLWB Riders work.
 
Part 7 — Voting Rights
 
How Fund Shares Are Voted
 
Integrity is the legal owner of the Fund shares held by the Separate Account.  As a shareholder, we have the right to vote on certain matters with respect to the Funds.  Among other things, we may vote to elect the Fund’s Board of Directors, to ratify the selection of independent auditors, and on any other matters described in a current prospectus or statement of additional information for each Fund, or any matter requiring a vote by shareholders under the 1940 Act.
 
Whenever a shareholder vote is taken, we will give you the opportunity to tell us how to vote the number of shares attributable to the Units in your contract.  We will send you proxy materials and a form for giving us voting instructions.
 
If we do not receive instructions in time from all contract owners, we will vote shares for which we have not received instructions in the same proportion as we vote shares for which we have received instructions.  As a result of this proportional voting, the vote of a small number of contract owners may determine the outcome of a proposal.  We may vote any shares that we are entitled to vote directly, because of amounts we have accumulated in our Separate Account, as we deem appropriate.  If the federal securities laws or regulations or interpretations of them change so that we are permitted to vote shares in our own right or to restrict contract owner voting, we may do so.
 
Fund shares are sold to investors other than us.  Therefore, the shares voted by all shareholders will dilute the effect of voting instructions received by us from our contract owners.
 
How We Determine Your Voting Shares
 
You vote only on matters concerning the Funds that correspond to the Subaccounts in which you are invested on the record date set by the Trust.  We determine the number of shares you vote by dividing your Account Value in each Subaccount by the total value of assets in the Subaccount multiplied by the number of shares in the Subaccount.
 
Part 8 — Tax Aspects of the Contract
 
Tax Status of the Contract
 
This contract is only available as a traditional IRA, Roth IRA, or SEP IRA.  If you were able to purchase this contract as other than an IRA, the contract would not satisfy the diversification requirements under federal tax law to be treated as an annuity contract for federal income tax purposes, and you would be currently taxed on your investment and gain.
 
Variable annuity contracts (other than certain pension and qualified retirement plan contracts, including IRAs) are generally not treated as annuities for federal income tax purposes, and thus lose their tax-deferred character, if they do not satisfy certain diversification requirements set forth in Section 817(h) of the Tax Code.  Investing in the ETF shares that are “publicly available,” i.e., that can be purchased directly without purchasing a variable annuity or life insurance contract, is incompatible with these requirements.  Accordingly, standing alone, the contract would not be treated as an annuity contract for
 
V2I-40



 
federal income tax purposes.  However, we believe that an individual purchasing a contract as an IRA will not be taxed currently on the investment and gain.
 
Contracts that qualify as IRAs are not subject to restrictions against investing in publicly available investments if the contracts meet certain requirements set forth by the IRS.  We believe this contract will meet those requirements, although there is no guarantee that this will be the case.  If this contract is not maintained as an IRA, the taxes on the premiums and any gain will not be deferred (or for a Roth IRA, taxes on the gain will not be free from federal income tax) and the tax treatment will be uncertain.
 
Types of IRAs
 
Traditional IRAs
 
Section 408 of the Tax Code permits eligible individuals to contribute to an individual retirement program known as an IRA.  An IRA can be in the form of a trust or custodial account or an annuity.  An individual may make annual contributions to an IRA of up to the lesser of the limit specified in the Tax Code ($5,500 for 2014 and $5,500 plus cost of living adjustment in 2015 and beyond) or 100% of compensation includible in the individual’s gross income.  For an individual age 50 or older, the limit is increased by $1,000.  The premiums may be deductible in whole or in part, depending on the individual’s income and whether the individual or spouse participates in an employer sponsored retirement plan.  Contribution limits set by the Tax Code are cumulative limits that apply to all traditional and Roth IRAs owned by an individual. Distributions from another IRA or certain eligible employer plans may be transferred
or “rolled over” into an IRA on a tax-deferred basis without regard to these limits.  Amounts in the IRA are taxed when distributed from the IRA at ordinary income tax rates.  A 10% penalty tax (discussed below) generally applies to distributions made before age 59½, subject to certain exceptions.  IRAs have minimum distribution rules (also discussed below) that govern the timing and amount of required distributions from traditional IRAs.
 
SEP IRAs
 
Section 408 of the Tax Code permits SEP IRAs, which are a type of IRAs that allows employers to contribute to IRAs on behalf of their employees.  Employer premiums made to an employee’s SEP IRA cannot exceed the lesser of (1) 25% of the employee’s compensation, and (2) a limit specified in the Tax Code ($52,000 for 2014).  Distributions from SEP IRAs are subject to the same restrictions and rules that apply to IRA distributions.
 
Roth IRAs
 
Section 408A of the Tax Code permits certain eligible individuals to make non-deductible contributions to a Roth IRA in cash or as a rollover or transfer from another Roth IRA or other IRA.  Only individuals with income below certain amounts specified in the Tax Code may contribute to a Roth IRA.  An eligible individual may make annual contributions to a Roth IRA of up to the lesser of the limit specified in the Tax Code ($5,500 for 2014 and $5,500 plus cost of living adjustment in 2015 and beyond) or 100% of compensation includible in the individual’s gross income.  For an individual age 50 or older, the limit is increased by $1,000.  Contribution limits set by the Tax Code are cumulative limits that apply to all traditional and Roth IRAs owned by an individual. A rollover from, or conversion of, an IRA to a Roth IRA is generally subject to tax on the full amount rolled over or converted.
 
You should consult a tax advisor before converting amounts to a Roth IRA or combining any converted amounts with any other Roth IRA contributions, including any other conversion amounts from other tax years.
 
Distributions from a Roth IRA generally are not taxed, except that, once aggregate distributions exceed premiums to the Roth IRA, income tax and a 10% penalty tax (discussed below) may apply to distributions made (1) before age 59 1/2 (subject to certain exceptions), or (2) during the five taxable years starting with the year in which the first contribution is made to any Roth IRA.
 
V2I-41



 
Rollovers and Transfers
 
In many circumstances you may move money tax-free from one IRA to another IRA or from certain other qualified plans, such as a 401(k) plan or 403(b) tax sheltered annuity, to an IRA by means of a direct rollover or a transfer.  You may roll over, directly or indirectly, any eligible rollover distribution.  An eligible rollover distribution is defined generally as any distribution of all or part of the balance from a qualified plan, except you cannot roll over the following taxable distributions from another plan:
 
·                  any distribution that is part of a series of substantially equal payments made over your life expectancy;
·                  any distribution made for a specified period of 10 years or more;
·                  any distribution that is an RMD; or
·                  any hardship distribution.
 
Also, you cannot roll over from a SIMPLE IRA during the first two years of participation in the SIMPLE IRA and you cannot roll over after-tax contribution that is included in the other plans.
 
You can make only one rollover from an IRA to another (or the same) IRA in any 12-month period, regardless of the number of IRAs you own.  The limit will apply by aggregating all of an individual’s IRAs, including SEP and SIMPLE IRAs as well as traditional and Roth IRAs, effectively treating them as one IRA for purposes of the limit.  Trustee-to-trustee transfers between IRAs are not limited.  Rollovers from traditional to Roth IRAs (“conversions”) are not limited.
 
Tax laws are complex and your individual situation is unique.  You should always consult a tax advisor before you move or attempt to move assets between any IRA or qualified plan and another qualified contract or plan.
 
Early Distributions
 
Premature distributions are subject to an additional penalty tax equal to 10% of the amount of any payment from your IRA that is includible in your income.  This penalty is in addition to ordinary income tax.  Amounts paid from your IRA before you reach 59½ are considered premature distributions unless:
 
1.              the distribution is paid due to your death or disability;
2.              the distribution is the result of an Internal Revenue Service levy on the IRA;
3.              the distributions do not exceed your deductible medical expenses;
4.              you have received unemployment compensation under a federal or state program for at least 12 consecutive weeks and the distributions do not exceed the amount paid for health insurance coverage for yourself, your spouse and your dependents;
5.              a tax free rollover of the distribution is made;
6.              the distribution is part of a series of level periodic payments made over your life expectancy or joint life expectancy of you and your beneficiary;
7.              the distribution is used to cover certain qualified education expenses; or
8.              the distribution is used to cover qualified first-time home purchase expense (up to a lifetime maximum of $10,000).
 
Required Minimum Distributions (RMD)
 
For traditional and SEP IRAs, RMDs generally must commence no later than April 1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the owner reaches age 70½ .  The distribution required by April 1 is the distribution required for the year in which the owner actually turns 70½ years old.  You must take distributions for each calendar year after the year the owner turn age 70½ by December 31 of that year.  The amount of the RMD is based on the prior year-end fair market value of your contract. 
 
If your contract provides an additional benefit, such as the optional GLWB Rider, the fair market value of your contract may increase by the actuarial present value of the benefit.  Therefore, the amount of the RMD you must take may increase.
 
V2I-42



 
If you have more than one IRA, the distributions required by the Tax Code for all IRAs in the aggregate may be met by taking distributions from one or more of your IRAs.  Please note, however, that only the RMD as defined in the glossary (for this contract only one time each Contract Year) is protected from a withdrawal charge (see Part 5, section titled “Free Withdrawal Amount”) and from being a Nonguaranteed Withdrawal if you have a GLWB Rider (See Part 6, section titled “Withdrawal Protection for Required Minimum Distributions.)
 
Failure to comply with the RMD rules applicable to qualified contracts may result in the imposition of an excise tax.  This excise tax generally equals 50% of the amount by which an RMD exceeds the actual distribution from the contract.
 
Roth IRAs do not require distributions at any time prior to the owner’s death.
 
Inherited IRAs
 
The death benefit paid under this contract may be extended by the beneficiary as an inherited IRA.  (However, the contract cannot be initially issued as an inherited IRA.)  This occurs if, after the death of the owner, the owner’s beneficiary directs that the death proceeds be titled as an inherited IRA.  See Part 5, section titled “Death Benefit.”  The owner’s beneficiary of the original IRA contract will become the inherited IRA owner and may name his or her own beneficiary in the event of death.
 
The inherited IRA owner may invest in the Subaccounts then available under the contract.  Separate account charges will continue to apply.  The inherited IRA owner must take RMDs beginning on or before December 31 of the calendar year after the original owner’s death.  If the beneficiary is a spouse and has elected this option, distributions may begin at the end of the calendar year in which the owner would have reached age 70½, if later.
 
If the original owner dies before the Required Beginning Date, the inherited IRA owner must take RMD over his or her life expectancy as defined by the Tax Code.  If the owner dies after the Required Beginning Date, the inherited IRA owner may choose the longer of his or her life expectancy or the deceased owner’s life expectancy, both as defined by the Tax Code.  (For Roth IRAs, the owner is presumed to have died before the Required Beginning Date.)
 
The following chart summarizes the date when RMDs must begin and the life used to measure the RMDs:
 




Death of Owner 

  

Spouse 

  

Nonspouse  


Before Required  Beginning Date  

  

Distributions must  begin by the later of (i) 12/31 of year  after the calendar year of owner’s death, or (ii) 12/31 of the year when  the deceased owner would have reached age 70½.

After Required  Beginning Date  (Traditional and SEP  IRAs only) 

  

Distributions must  begin by 12/31 of year after the calendar year of owner’s death
 
RMD may be based on longer of the owner’s or beneficiary’s life expectancy. 

  

Distributions must  begin by 12/31 of year after the calendar year of owner’s death
 
RMD may be based on longer of the owner’s or beneficiary’s life expectancy.   

 
V2I-43



 
The following restrictions apply to the inherited IRA contract: (i) the inherited IRA owner may not add premium to the contract; (ii) the Death Benefit available to the beneficiary of the inherited IRA owner is the Account Value on the Death Benefit Date after the death of the inherited IRA owner; (iii) the beneficiary of the inherited IRA owner will be required to receive the remaining Account Value either in a lump sum, over five years or over the life expectancy of the inherited IRA owner as determined by the Tax Code.
 
A tax penalty applies if the inherited IRA owner fails to take the RMD.  The tax penalty equals 50% of the excess of the RMD over the amount actually withdrawn from the inherited IRA during the calendar year.
 
For more information on inherited IRAs, see Part IRS Publication 590.  Seek independent tax advice.
 
Federal and State Income Tax Withholding
 
We may be required to withhold federal income taxes on all distributions unless the eligible recipients elect not to have any amounts withheld and properly notify us of that election.
 
Certain states have indicated that pension and annuity withholding will apply to payments made to their residents.  Generally, an election out of federal withholding will also be considered an election out of state withholding.  For more information concerning a particular state, call our Administrative Office listed in the Glossary.
 
Tax Status of the Company
 
Under existing federal income tax laws, we do not pay tax on investment income and realized capital gains of the Separate Account.  We do not anticipate that we will incur any federal income tax liability on the income and gains earned by the Separate Account.  The Company, therefore, does not impose a charge for federal income taxes.  If federal income tax law changes and we must pay tax on some or all of the income and gains earned by the Separate Account, we may impose a charge against the Separate Account to pay the taxes.  We can also set up reserves for taxes.  We receive a tax deduction for dividends received by the Funds.
 
Transfers Among Subaccounts
 
There will not be any current tax liability if you transfer any part of the Account Value among the Subaccounts of your contract.
 
Seek Tax Advice
 
Integrity does not act as your tax or legal advisor.  This discussion of the federal income tax treatment of the contract is not designed to cover all situations and is not intended to be tax advice.  It is based upon our understanding of the present federal income tax laws as currently interpreted by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and various courts.  The IRS or the courts may change their views on the treatment of these contracts.  Future legislation may have a negative effect on annuity contracts or IRAs.  Also, we have not attempted to consider any applicable state or other tax laws.
 
Because of the complexity of the tax laws and the fact that tax results will vary according to the particular circumstances, anyone considering buying a contract, selecting an Annuity Option under the contract, or receiving annuity payments under a contract should consult a qualified tax advisor.
 
You should carefully consider the advantages and disadvantages of owning a variable annuity as an IRA or tax-qualified plan, as well as the costs and benefits of the contract (including the death benefits, income benefits and other non-tax-related benefits), before you purchase the contract as an IRA.
 
V2I-44



 
This contract includes an enhanced death benefit and offers an optional living benefit.  The IRS requires an actuarial present value of enhanced benefits to be added to the Account Value for purposes of calculating the fair market value of the annuity and determining the RMD.
 
The IRS has not reviewed the contract for qualification as an IRA and we make no guarantees that the contract will so qualify.  Integrity does not guarantee the tax status, federal, state, or local, of any contract or any transaction involving the contracts.
 
Part 9 — Additional Information
 
Systematic Withdrawal Program
 
We offer a program that allows you to pre-authorize periodic withdrawals from your contract prior to your Annuity Date.  You can choose to have withdrawals made monthly, quarterly, semi-annually or annually and can specify the day of the month (other than the 29th, 30th or 31st) on which the withdrawal is to be made.  If you do not select how often you want to receive withdrawals, we will make them on a monthly basis.  You may specify a dollar amount or an annual percentage to be withdrawn, such as the Free Withdrawal Amount.  The minimum Systematic Withdrawal is $100.  If you do not have enough Account Value to make the withdrawal you have specified, no withdrawal will be made and your enrollment in the program will end.  You may specify an account for direct deposit of your Systematic Withdrawals.  Direct deposit
is required for monthly withdrawals.  Withdrawals under this program are subject to withdrawal charges, if any (see Part 4, section titled “Withdrawal Charge”) and to income tax and a 10% tax penalty if you are under age 59½.  See Part 8.
 
To enroll in our Systematic Withdrawal Program, send the appropriate form to our Administrative Office.  You may terminate your participation in the program upon prior written notice.  We may terminate or change the Systematic Withdrawal Program at any time.
 
Income Plus Withdrawal Program
 
We offer an Income Plus Withdrawal Program that allows you to pre-authorize substantially equal periodic withdrawals, based on your life expectancy as defined by the Tax Code, from your contract anytime before you reach age 59½.  You will not have to pay a tax penalty for these withdrawals, but they will be subject to ordinary income tax.  See Part 8.  Once you begin receiving your withdrawals under this program, you should not change or stop the withdrawals until the later of:
 
·                       the date you reach age 59½; and
·                       five years from the date of the first withdrawal under the program.
 
If you change or stop the withdrawals or take an additional withdrawal, you may have to pay a 10% penalty tax that would have been due on all prior withdrawals made under the Income Plus Withdrawal Program before you reached the date described above, plus interest.
 
You may choose to have withdrawals made monthly, quarterly, semi-annually or annually and may specify the day of the month (other than the 29th, 30th or 31st) on which the withdrawal is made.  You may specify an account for direct deposit of your withdrawals.  Direct deposit is required for monthly withdrawals.  We will calculate the amount of the withdrawal, subject to a $100 minimum.  We are not responsible for any tax or other liability you may incur if our good faith calculations are not correct.  You should consult with your tax advisor to ensure these withdrawals are appropriate to your situation.
 
If on any withdrawal date you do not have enough Account Value to make the withdrawals you specified, no withdrawal will be made and your enrollment in the program will end.
 
To enroll in our Income Plus Withdrawal Program, send the appropriate form to our Administrative Office.  You may end your participation in the program upon prior written notice.  We may terminate or change the Income Plus Withdrawal Program at any time.  This program is not available in connection
 
V2I-45



 
with the Systematic Withdrawal Program.  Withdrawals under this program are subject to a withdrawal charge, if any.  See Part 4, section titled “Withdrawal Charge.”
 
This program is not available with a GLWB Rider.  See Part 6.
 
Choices Plus Required Minimum Distribution (RMD) Program
 
We offer a Choices Plus RMD Program that allows you to pre-authorize withdrawals from your IRA after you attain age 70½.  The Tax Code requires that you take minimum distributions beginning on or before April 1st of the calendar year following the calendar year in which you turn 70½ years old.  The distribution required by April 1 is the distribution required for the year you actually turn 70½ years old.  You must take distributions for each calendar year after the year you turn age 70½ by December 31 of that year.   These withdrawals are subject to ordinary income tax.  See Part 8. 
 
You can choose the Choices Plus RMD Program at any time if you are age 70½ or older by sending the election form to our Administrative Office.  You can choose to have withdrawals made monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annually and can specify the day of the month (other than the 29th, 30th, or 31st) on which the withdrawal is made.  You may specify an account for direct deposit of your withdrawals.  Direct deposit is required for monthly withdrawals.  As a convenience, we will calculate the amount of the withdrawals.  We are not responsible for any tax or other liability you may incur if our good faith calculations are not correct.  You should consult with your tax advisor to ensure these withdrawals are appropriate to your situation.
 
Withdrawals of Account Value that are made as part of the Choices Plus program are not subject to a withdrawal charge, as long as you do not take additional withdrawals.  You may end your participation in the program upon prior written notice.  We may terminate or change the Choices Plus RMD Program at any time.
 
This program is not available with a GLWB Rider.  See Part 6, section titled “Withdrawal Protection for Required Minimum Distributions.”
 
Systematic Transfer Program
 
We offer a Systematic Transfer Program where we accept new premiums into a Systematic Transfer Option (STO), which is a Fixed Account, and make transfers out of the STO to one or more Subaccounts on a monthly or quarterly basis.  We will transfer your STO premiums in approximately equal installments of at least $1,000 monthly over a six-month or monthly or quarterly over a one-year period, depending on the options you select.  You can only invest in either the six-month or one-year STO at any one time, but not both.  If you do not have enough Account Value in the STO to transfer to each Subaccount specified, a final transfer will be made on a pro rata basis and your enrollment in the program will end.  All interest accrued and any Account Value remaining in the STO at the end of the period during which transfers are scheduled to be made will be transferred at the end of that period on a pro rata basis to the
Subaccounts you chose for this program.  You cannot transfer Account Value into the STO.
 
Transfers made under our Systematic Transfer Program do not trigger a 60-day waiting period.  See Part 4, section titled “Allocations and Transfers.”
 
To enroll in our Systematic Transfer Program, send the appropriate form to our Administrative Office.  We can end the Systematic Transfer Program in whole or in part, or restrict premiums to the program.
 
This program is available with a GLWB Rider only for the initial premium we received on the Contract Date.  See Part 6.
 
Customized Asset Rebalancing Program
 
Asset rebalancing allows you to maintain a diversified investment mix that is appropriate for your goals
 
V2I-46



 
and risk tolerance.  Because your different Subaccounts will experience different gains and losses at different times, your asset allocation may shift from your preferred mix.  Asset rebalancing periodically resets your investments to your original allocations, ensuring that your asset mix stays in line with your investment strategy.
 
We offer a Customized Asset Rebalancing Program that allows you to have your investments rebalanced to your allocation percentages periodically.  You can choose to rebalance quarterly, semi-annually or annually.
 
The Account Value in the currently available Subaccounts will automatically be rebalanced back to your allocation percentages by selling all existing Units subject to rebalancing and repurchasing Units according to your allocation.  You will receive a confirmation notice after each rebalancing.  Subaccounts that are closed to new purchases, and the Fixed Account, are not included in the Customized Asset Rebalancing Program.
 
Transfers under our Customized Asset Rebalancing Program do not trigger a 60-day waiting period.  See Part 4, section titled “Allocations and Transfers.”
 
To enroll in our Customized Asset Rebalancing Program, send the appropriate form to our Administrative Office.  You may terminate your participation in the program upon prior written notice.  We may end or change the Customized Asset Rebalancing Program at any time.  We recommend you consult with your financial professional when establishing your allocation.
 
This program is not available with a GLWB Rider because quarterly rebalancing is required.  See Part 6.
 
Legal Proceedings
 
Integrity is a party to litigation and arbitration proceedings in the ordinary course of its business.  None of these matters is expected to have a material adverse effect on Integrity.

Appendix B — Withdrawal Charge Examples
 
We allow two ways for you to request withdrawals.  In the first method, you receive the amount requested, and any withdrawal charge is taken from the Account Value.  This reduces your Account Value by the amount of the withdrawal charge in addition to the amount you requested.  This is the method used unless you request otherwise or unless you have elected one of the GLWB Riders.  In the second method, you receive less than you requested if a withdrawal charge applies because the Account Value is reduced by the amount of the requested withdrawal and any withdrawal charge is taken from that amount.
 
For both methods, withdrawals are attributed to amounts in the following order:
 
1.              any Free Withdrawal Amount (except in the case of a surrender);
2.              premiums that are no longer subject to a withdrawal charge and have not yet been withdrawn (premiums are withdrawn from oldest to youngest);
3.              premiums subject to a withdrawal charge that have not yet been withdrawn (premiums are withdrawn from oldest to youngest);
4.              any gain, interest or other amount that is not considered a premium.
 
Example Assumptions
 
Assume one premium is paid, no previous withdrawals have been taken, and the Account Value at the time of the withdrawal is higher than the Account Value on the most recent Contract Anniversary:
 



Premium: 

  

$ 

50,000 

   


Account Value before  withdrawal: 

  

$ 

60,000 

   


Requested  withdrawal: 

  

$ 

16,000 

   


Withdrawal  charge percentage applicable to the premium: 

  

6 

%   
 
Taxes are not considered in this example.
 
Using the First Method
 
The Free Withdrawal Amount is calculated as:
 
$6,000 = $60,000 (Account Value on the date of the withdrawal) x 10% (free withdrawal percentage) - $0 (previous partial withdrawals during the current Contract Year).
 
After first applying the withdrawal to the Free Withdrawal Amount, the amount of the withdrawal still to be applied is:
 
$10,000 = $16,000 (requested withdrawal) - $6,000 (Free Withdrawal Amount).
 
There are no premiums that are no longer subject to a withdrawal charge, so the withdrawal is next applied to the premium subject to a withdrawal charge.  The withdrawal charge for this method is calculated as:
 
$638.30 = $10,000 (portion of the withdrawal still to be attributed) x 6% (withdrawal charge percentage) / (1 – 6%) (one minus the withdrawal charge percentage).
 
Using this method, you will receive $16,000; however, the total Account Value withdrawn is:
 
$16,638.30 = $16,000 (requested withdrawal) + $638.30 (withdrawal charge).
 
The amount of premium still subject to a withdrawal charge is:
 
$39,361.70 = $50,000 (premium) - $10,638.30 (portion of withdrawal attributed to premium including the withdrawal charge).
 
V2I-57



 
Note, the withdrawal charge does not just apply to the premium withdrawn ($10,000 x 6%).  It also applies to the withdrawal charge itself indicated by the (1- 6%) factor in the withdrawal charge formula.
 
Using the Second Method
 
The Free Withdrawal Amount is calculated as:
 
$6,000 = $60,000 (Account Value on the date of the withdrawal) x 10% (free withdrawal percentage) - $0 (previous partial withdrawals during the current Contract Year).
 
After first applying the withdrawal to the Free Withdrawal Amount, the amount of the withdrawal still to be attributed is:
 
$10,000 = $16,000 (requested withdrawal) - $6,000 (Free Withdrawal Amount).
 
There are no premiums that are no longer subject to a withdrawal charge, so the withdrawal is next applied to the premium subject to a withdrawal charge.  The withdrawal charge for this method is calculated as:
 
$600 = $10,000 (portion of the withdrawal still to be attributed) x 6% (withdrawal charge percentage).
 
Using this method, the total Account Value withdrawn is $16,000; however, you will receive:
 
$15,400 = $16,000 (requested withdrawal) - $600 (withdrawal charge).
 
The amount of premium still subject to a withdrawal charge is:
 
$40,000 = $50,000 (premium) - $10,000 (portion of withdrawal attributed to premium including the withdrawal charge).
 
Note the second method will produce the same withdrawal charge as the first method if the requested withdrawal under the second method is the same as the total Account Value withdrawn in the first method.  For example, a requested withdrawal of $16,638.30 using the second method produces the same $638.30 withdrawal charge as shown in the first method above.
 
This example is for illustrative purposes only and does not predict results.

Appendix C
 
Illustrations of Guaranteed Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit
 
The following examples demonstrate how the GLWB Riders work, based on the stated assumptions.  These examples are for illustration only, and do not predict future investment results.
 
Example #1
 
This example illustrates the Individual GLWB Rider where withdrawals equal to the Lifetime Payout Amount (LPA), as well as a Nonguaranteed Withdrawal, have been taken, additional premiums have been added and increases to the Withdrawal Percentage and step-ups have been applied.  It also illustrates payments for the life of the covered person even though the Account Value has been reduced to zero.  All amounts in the table are rounded to the nearest $1.00 in this example.
 
Assumptions:
·                  The Contract Date is June 27.
·                  The Owner’s age on Contract Date is 60 years.
·                  The Initial premium was $100,000; additional premiums of $10,000 were paid in calendar years 2 and 10.
·                  A Nonguaranteed Withdrawal equal to $776 is taken in calendar year 14.
·                  Withdrawals equal to LPA are taken in calendar years 6-13, and calendar years 15+.
·                  No withdrawals are taken that would result in withdrawal charges under the contract.
·                  The RMD is not higher than the LPA in any calendar year.
·                  The Rider remains in effect during the period covered in this example.

(A)   The covered person’s age for each year is as of January 1.  Also, on each January 1, the LPA is equal to the applicable Withdrawal Percentage multiplied by the Benefit Base.
 
(B)   In any year that an additional premium is added, it is assumed to be added on February 10.  For purposes of this example, we selected February 10 as the assumed date of additional premium payments.  Since premiums may be paid throughout the year, we hoped to accurately demonstrate the effect on the contract values by using a date other than the Contract Anniversary and January 1, which are the two key dates in the GLWB Rider calculations.
 
(C)   Any step-up is applied on the Contract Anniversary, which is June 27 of each year.
 
(D)   Any withdrawal is assumed to occur one time per year on October 8.  For purposes of this example, we selected October 8 as the assumed date of withdrawals. Since withdrawals may be made throughout the year, we hoped to accurately demonstrate the effect on the contract values by using a random date other than the Contract Anniversary and January 1, which are the two key dates in the GLWB Rider calculations.
 
(E)   The hypothetical Account Value on the Contract Anniversary and on the date of the withdrawal includes deduction of all separate account charges and is before any withdrawal.
 
(F)   The first calendar year begins on June 27, the Contract Date.  On this day, the Benefit Base ($100,000) is set equal to the initial premium ($100,000). The Withdrawal Percentage (4.00%) is equal to the Age Based Percentage (4.00%) plus the cumulative Deferral Percentage (0%) plus the First Year Deferral Percentage (0%).
 
V2I-60



 
Since the covered person is at least age 60 on the date the Rider is issued, the LPA is available.  It is calculated as the Withdrawal Percentage multiplied by the Benefit Base:
 
·                   4.0% (Withdrawal Percentage) x $100,000 (Benefit Base) = $4,000 (LPA).
 
Since this is the first calendar year, the LPA is multiplied by a pro rata portion of the calendar year that remains.  The pro rata factor is the number of days remaining in the calendar year divided by the total number of days in the calendar year:
 
·                   187 (Days remaining in calendar year) / 365 (Total days in calendar year assuming a non-leap year) x $4,000 (LPA) = $2,049 (1st Year LPA).
 
(G)        Since no withdrawal was taken in calendar year 1 and since the Contract Date was June 27, the First Year Deferral Percentage is determined as 0.050%.  The Withdrawal Percentage (4.050%) is equal to the Age Based Percentage (4.00%) plus the cumulative Deferral Percentage (0%) plus the First Year Deferral Percentage (0.050%).
 
The LPA is determined as the Withdrawal Percentage multiplied by the Benefit Base:
 
·                   4.050% (Withdrawal Percentage) x $100,000 (Benefit Base) = $4,050 (LPA).
 
(H)        An additional premium of $10,000 is made during calendar year 2.  Since this premium is during the first contract year, the Benefit Base is increased by the amount of the premium.
 
·                   $100,000 (Benefit Base) + $10,000 (additional premium amount) = $110,000 Benefit Base after the additional premium.
 
(I)            In calendar year 2, the Benefit Base increases to $112,614 because the hypothetical Account Value on the Contract Anniversary ($112,614) is larger than the Benefit Base ($110,000).  In calendar years 3 and 4, the Benefit Base again increases to the Account Value, because the Account Value on the Contract Anniversary is larger than the Benefit Base.  In calendar years 5 and later, the Benefit Base is always larger than the Account Value on the Contract Anniversary, and thus is not stepped up.
 
(J)            Since no withdrawal was taken in calendar year 2, the cumulative Deferral Percentage is increased by 0.10%.  The Withdrawal Percentage (4.150%) in calendar year 3 is equal to the Age Based Percentage (4.00%) plus the cumulative Deferral Percentage (0.10%) plus the First Year Deferral Percentage (0.050%).
 
The LPA is determined as the Withdrawal Percentage multiplied by the Benefit Base:
 
·                   4.150% (Withdrawal Percentage) x $112,614 (Benefit Base) = $4,673 (LPA).
 
Since no withdrawal was taken in calendar year 3, the cumulative Deferral Percentage is again increased by 0.10%.  The Withdrawal Percentage (4.250%) in calendar year 4 is equal to the Age Based Percentage (4.00%) plus the cumulative Deferral Percentage (0.20%) plus the First Year Deferral Percentage (0.050%). The LPA is determined as the Withdrawal Percentage multiplied by the Benefit Base:
 
·                   4.250% (Withdrawal Percentage) x $116,985 (Benefit Base) = $4,972 (LPA).
 
Since no withdrawal was taken in calendar year 4, the cumulative Deferral Percentage is again increased by 0.10%.  The Withdrawal Percentage (4.350%) in calendar year 5 is equal to the Age Based Percentage (4.00%) plus the cumulative Deferral Percentage (0.30%) plus the First Year Deferral Percentage (0.050%). The LPA is determined as the Withdrawal Percentage multiplied by the Benefit Base:
 
·                   4.350% (Withdrawal Percentage) x $121,300 (Benefit Base) = $5,277 (LPA).
 
(K)        Since no withdrawal was taken in calendar year 5, the cumulative Deferral Percentage is again increased by 0.10%.  The Age Based Percentage has changed to 4.50% because the covered person is now 65.  The Withdrawal Percentage (4.950%) in calendar year 6 is equal to the Age Based Percentage (4.50%) plus the cumulative Deferral Percentage (0.40%) plus the First Year Deferral Percentage (0.050%).
 
V2I-61



 
The LPA is determined as the Withdrawal Percentage multiplied by the Benefit Base:
 
·      4.95% (Withdrawal Percentage) x $121,300 (Benefit Base) = $6,004 (LPA).
 
Because there is a withdrawal during calendar year 6, the Age Based Percentage is locked at 4.50%.
 
(L)   An additional premium of $10,000 is made during calendar year 10.  Since this premium is paid after the first Contract Year, the premium has no impact on the Benefit Base.  All premiums received are immediately applied to the Account Value.  For this example, we have used hypothetical Account Values in an effort to reflect market fluctuations between -6% and +6% annually.  In the case of this $10,000 additional premium in Contract Year 10, the premium was applied to the Account Value, but because the hypothetical Account Value also reflects market losses, the $10,000 additional premium, assumed to be made on February 10, had declined in value by the Contract Anniversary on June 27.  The evolution of the hypothetical Account Value can be seen by tracking the Account Value from June 27 of year 9 to year 10.  The Account Value goes from $99,338 to $102,098 throughout the year, an increase of $2,760.  During
that Contract Year, there is a $6,004 withdrawal taken on October 8 and a $10,000 premium applied the following February 10; the premium is $3,996 larger than the withdrawal.  That means the market experience resulted in a downward movement of $1,236 ($3,996 - $2,760) throughout the year.

(M)  In calendar year 14, a Nonguaranteed Withdrawal in the amount of $776 ($6,780 amount withdrawn - $6,004 LPA) is taken.  The Adjusted Nonguaranteed Withdrawal amount is the Nonguaranteed Withdrawal amount multiplied by the greater of 1.0 and the ratio of the Benefit Base to the Account Value, where both values are calculated immediately before the Nonguaranteed Withdrawal. For this calculation, the Account Value before the Nonguaranteed Withdrawal is $72,977, equal to the Account Value before any withdrawal ($78,981) minus the LPA ($6,004). It is calculated as follows:
 
·      $776 (Nonguaranteed Withdrawal amount) x the greater of 1.0 and 1.6622 ($121,300 Benefit Base divided by $72,977 Account Value) = $1,290 (Adjusted Nonguaranteed Withdrawal amount).
 
The Benefit Base is reduced by the Adjusted Nonguaranteed Withdrawal amount:
 
·      $121,300 (Benefit Base) - $1,290 (Adjusted Nonguaranteed Withdrawal amount) = $120,010 Benefit Base after the Nonguaranteed Withdrawal.
 
(N)   In calendar year 27, the Account Value is reduced to zero after the withdrawal; however, the Benefit Base is greater than zero.  Therefore, the Rider enters Guaranteed Payment Phase and payments of the LPA continue.
 
V2I-62



 
Example #2
 
This example illustrates the Spousal GLWB Rider where withdrawals equal to the LPA as well as Nonguaranteed Withdrawals have been taken and increases to the Withdrawal Percentage have been applied.  It also illustrates the termination of the Rider if the Account Value is reduced to zero by a Nonguaranteed Withdrawal.  All amounts in the table are rounded to the nearest $1.00 in this example.
 
Assumptions:
·                  The Contract Date is August 8.
·                  The covered persons’ ages on Contract Date are: owner is 60 and spouse is 57.
·                  The Initial premium is $100,000; no additional premiums are paid.
·                  Withdrawals equal to LPA are taken in calendar years 4-13.
·                  A Nonguaranteed Withdrawal equal to $10,000 in calendar year 3.
·                  Full Account Value is withdrawn in calendar year 14.
·                  No withdrawals are taken that would result in withdrawal charges under the contract.
·                  The RMD is not higher than the LPA in any calendar year.
·                  The Rider remains in effect during the period covered in this example.

(A)        The covered persons’ ages for each year are as of January 1.  Also, each January 1 on or after the LPA Eligibility Date, the LPA is equal to the applicable Withdrawal Percentage multiplied by the Benefit Base.
 
V2I-63
 



 
(B)         Any applicable step-up is applied on the Contract Anniversary, which is August 8 of each year.
 
(C)         Any applicable withdrawal is assumed to occur one time per year on October 8.  For purposes of this example, we selected October 8 as the assumed date of withdrawals.  Since withdrawals may be made throughout the year, we hoped to accurately demonstrate the effect on the contract values by using a random date other than the Contract Anniversary and January 1, which are the two key dates in the GLWB Rider calculations.
 
(D)        The hypothetical Account Value on the Contract Anniversary and on the date of the withdrawal includes deduction of all separate account charges and is before any withdrawal.
 
(E)         The first calendar year begins on August 8, the Contract Date.  On this day, the Benefit Base ($100,000) is set equal to the initial premium ($100,000).  Since the LPA is not available until the LPA Eligibility Date, the Withdrawal Percentage and the LPA are not applicable.
 
(F)          In calendar year 2, the Benefit Base increases to $103,610 because the hypothetical Account Value on the Contract Anniversary ($103,610) is larger than the Benefit Base ($100,000).  In calendar year 3, the Benefit Base again increases to the Account Value, because the Account Value on the Contract Anniversary is larger than the Benefit Base.  In calendar years 4 and later, the Benefit Base is always larger than the Account Value on the Contract Anniversary, and thus is not stepped up.
 
(G)        In calendar year 3, a Nonguaranteed Withdrawal in the amount of $10,000 is taken.  The Adjusted Nonguaranteed Withdrawal amount is the Nonguaranteed Withdrawal amount multiplied by the greater of 1.0 or the ratio of the Benefit Base to the Account Value, where both values are calculated immediately before the Nonguaranteed Withdrawal.  It is calculated as follows:
 
·                   $10,000 (Nonguaranteed Withdrawal amount) x the greater of 1.0 and 0.9935 ($106,597 Benefit Base divided by $107,299 Account Value) = $10,000 (Adjusted Nonguaranteed Withdrawal amount).
 
The Benefit Base is reduced by the Adjusted Nonguaranteed Withdrawal amount:
 
·                   $106,597 (Benefit Base) - $10,000 (Adjusted Nonguaranteed Withdrawal amount) =$96,597 Benefit Base after the Nonguaranteed Withdrawal.
 
(H)        January 1 of calendar year 4 is the LPA Eligibility Date; thus, the LPA is now available.  Since no withdrawal was taken in calendar year 1 and since the Contract Date was August 8, the First Year Deferral Percentage is 0.025%.  Since no withdrawal was taken in calendar year 2, the cumulative Deferral Percentage is 0.10%.  The Age Based Percentage (4.00%) is based on the age of the younger covered person.  The Withdrawal Percentage (4.125%) is equal to the Age Based Percentage (4.00%) plus the Cumulative Deferral Percentage (0.10%) plus the First Year Deferral Percentage (0.025%).
 
The LPA is determined as the Withdrawal Percentage multiplied by the Benefit Base multiplied by the Spousal Factor:
 
·                   4.125% (Withdrawal Percentage) x $96,597 (Benefit Base) x 90% (Spousal Factor) = $3,586 (LPA).
 
Because there is a withdrawal during calendar year 4, the Age Based Percentage is locked at 4.0%.
 
(I)            A Nonguaranteed Withdrawal reduces the Account Value to zero in calendar year 14 and the Rider and annuity contract terminate.

General Information and History
 
Integrity Life Insurance Company (Integrity) is an Ohio life insurance company organized on May 3, 1966. Its principal executive offices are located at 400 Broadway, Cincinnati, Ohio 45202.  Integrity, the depositor of Separate Account I, is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Western and Southern Life Insurance Company (WSLIC), an Ohio life insurance company organized on February 23, 1888.  WSLIC is a wholly owned subsidiary of Western & Southern Financial Group, Inc., an Ohio corporation, which is wholly owned by Western & Southern Mutual Holding Company, an Ohio mutual insurance holding company.
 
Administration and Distribution of the Contracts
 
Administration
 
Integrity has responsibility for administration of Separate Account I (the Separate Account) and the variable annuity contracts issued through the Separate Account (Contracts). Integrity has entered into a Service Agreement with WSLIC to provide certain services, including administrative services for the Separate Account and the Contracts.   Compensation for these services, which is paid by Integrity, is based on the charges and expenses incurred by WSLIC, and will reflect actual costs to the extent reasonably possible.
 
Custodian
 
Mid Atlantic Trust Company (MATC), 330 South Poplar, Suite 103, Pierre, SD 57501, is the custodian for the exchange-traded funds (ETFs) held by the Subaccounts.  MATC provides certain services to the Separate Account, including custody of and accounting services for the ETFs owned by the Separate Account.  MATC also facilitates execution of the purchase and sale of the ETFs through broker-dealers.
 
Underwriter
 
Touchstone Securities, Inc. (Touchstone Securities), 303 Broadway, Suite 1100, Cincinnati, Ohio 45202, an indirect subsidiary of WSLIC and an affiliate of Integrity, is the principal underwriter of the Contracts.  Touchstone Securities is registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a broker-dealer and is a member in good standing of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).  The Contracts are offered through Touchstone Securities on a continuous basis.  The amount of distribution allowances paid to Touchstone Securities, the principal underwriter, for all variable annuity contracts issued by Integrity was $7,441,688 in 2015,
$7,892,977 in 2014, and $7,386,802 in 2013.  Touchstone Securities did not retain distribution allowances during these years.
 



 
Sales
 
The Contracts are sold by insurance agents licensed in the states where the Contracts may be lawfully sold.  The agents are also registered representatives of broker-dealers, which are registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are members of FINRA.
 
We make payments to the broker-dealer firms that distribute our variable annuity contracts in the form of commissions and other incentives.  We may make payments in the form of expense reimbursements or marketing allowances to the broker-dealers that distribute our Contracts in exchange for privileges, including additional or special access to broker-dealers’ sales staff, opportunities to provide and attend training and other conferences, and marketing enhancements of our Contracts.  The method for calculating any additional compensation may include consideration of the level of sales or assets attributable to the firm.  Not all broker-dealers receive additional compensation and the amount of compensation varies by firm.  These payments could be significant to a firm, and could create a conflict of interest between the firm or representative and the customer.  These payments could provide incentive to a firm
or representative to recommend a Contract that is not in a customer’s best interest.  We generally choose to compensate broker-dealers that have a strong capability to distribute the Contracts and that are willing to cooperate with our promotional efforts.
 
The following list includes the names of firms that received expense reimbursement or marketing allowance payments of more than $5,000 with respect to variable annuities sold for Integrity and its wholly owned subsidiary National Integrity Life Insurance Company during the last calendar year.

Performance Data and Illustrations
 
We may provide performance information and illustrations using performance information.  Performance information may be based on historical returns of the subaccounts.  At any time in the future, performance will likely be higher or lower than in the past.  Historical performance does not predict future results.
 
Performance Data
 
In advertisements or in information furnished to you, we may provide the average annual total return and the cumulative total return of the units of the subaccounts. The money market option may also from time to time include the yield and effective yield of its units.  Performance information is computed separately for each subaccount in accordance with the formulas described below.
 
Total return reflects all aspects of the return of a subaccount, including the automatic reinvestment of all distributions and the deduction of all charges that apply on an annual basis.  Performance represents annualized percentage change in net assets of a subaccount, based on a hypothetical $1,000 investment, the performance of the underlying portfolios and the charges that would have been made during the periods shown.  Premium taxes, if applicable, are not reflected.
 
Average annual total returns are calculated by determining the growth or decline in value of a hypothetical investment in the subaccount over certain periods, including 1, 3, 5, and 10 years and then calculating the annually compounded percentage rate that would have produced the same result if the rate of growth or decline in value had been constant over the period.
 
Investors should realize that a subaccount’s performance is not constant over time, but changes from year to year, and that the average annual returns represent the averages of historical periods as opposed to the actual historical performance of a subaccount during any portion of the period shown.  Average annual returns are calculated using this formula:
 
P (1+T)n = ERV, where P is a hypothetical initial payment of $1,000, T is the average annual total return, n is
 
2



 
the number of years, and ERV is the redeemable value at the end of the period.
 
Standardized returns are average annual total returns calculated from the subaccount inception date, which represents the date the subaccount was available in the Contract.  Standardized returns reflect the deduction of all Contract expenses, including underlying fund expenses, the annual separate account charges and the withdrawal charge. The cost of the optional guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit rider is not included.  If the cost of the rider were included, the returns would be lower.
 
Non-standardized returns are calculated from the fund inception date, which represents the inception date of the underlying fund, rather than the date it was included in the Contract.  Performance that predates the inclusion in the Contract is hypothetical and has been adjusted to include Contract expenses.  Two sets of non-standardized returns may be presented, each reflecting the deduction of underlying fund expenses and the annual separate account charge.  One set also reflects the withdrawal charge.  The cost of the guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit rider is not included.  If the cost of the rider were included, the returns would be lower.
 
Cumulative total returns are unaveraged and reflect the simple percentage change in the value of a hypothetical investment in the subaccount over a stated period of time.  In addition to the period since inception, cumulative total returns may be calculated on a year-to-date basis at the end of each calendar month in the current calendar year.  The last day of the period for year-to-date returns is the last day of the most recent calendar month at the time of publication.
 
Yields quoted in advertising reflect the change in value of a hypothetical investment in a subaccount over a stated period of time, not taking into account capital gains or losses, or any withdrawal charge.  Yields are annualized and stated as a percentage.
 
Current yield and effective yield are calculated for the money market option.  Current yield is based on the change in the value of a hypothetical investment (exclusive of capital changes) over a particular 7-day period, less Contract charges that would have applied during the period (the base period), and stated as a percentage of the investment at the start of the base period (the base period return).  The base period return is then annualized by multiplying by 365/7, with the resulting yield figure carried to at least the nearest hundredth of one percent.
 
Effective yield assumes that all dividends received during an annual period have been reinvested.  This compounding effect causes effective yield to be higher than current yield.  Calculation of effective yield begins with the same base period return used in the calculation of current yield, which is then annualized to reflect weekly compounding pursuant to the following formula:
 
Effective Yield = [(Base Period Return + 1)365/7] – 1
 
Individualized Illustrations
 
Integrity may provide computer-generated illustrations using programs available through third party firms to provide registered representatives and existing or potential Contracts owners with individualized hypothetical illustrations.  The illustrations may include contract values and returns for some or all of the subaccounts.  Such illustrations may include graphs, bar charts and other types of formats.
 
Hypothetical values may be based on: (i) the results of a hypothetical contribution to a Contract invested in a single or multiple subaccounts using standardized and non-standardized average annual returns; or (ii) the results of a hypothetical contribution to a Contract using either static or variable assumed rates of return, as allowed by law.

Distributions from Tax-Favored Retirement Programs
 
Distributions from tax-favored plans are subject to certain restrictions.  Owners of traditional and SEP IRAs must begin receiving distributions by April 1 of the calendar year following the year in which the owner or participant reaches age 70½.  If you do not take mandatory distributions, you may owe a 50% penalty tax on any difference between the required distribution amount and the amount distributed.  There are no mandatory distributions from Roth IRAs during the owner’s lifetime.   After death, distribution rules apply to traditional and Roth IRAs.
 
We are not permitted to make distributions from a Contract unless a request has been made.  It is therefore your responsibility to comply with the minimum distribution rules.  You should consult your tax adviser regarding these rules and their proper application.
 
The above description of the minimum distribution requirements and the federal income tax consequences of distributions from tax-favored retirement plans which may be funded by the Contract is only a brief summary and is not intended as tax advice.  The rules governing the provisions of plans are extremely complex and often difficult to comprehend.  If you do not fully comply with all rules, which are subject to change, you may suffer adverse tax consequences.  You should consult a qualified and competent tax adviser prior to adopting a plan or purchasing a Contract in connection with a tax-favored plan.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
 
The Contract Owners of Separate Account I of Integrity Life Insurance Company and
The Board of Directors of Integrity Life Insurance Company
 
We have audited the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities of the subaccounts of Separate Account I of Integrity Life Insurance Company (the “Separate Account”) (comprising the subaccounts included in these financial statements) as of December 31, 2015, and the related statements of operations and changes in net assets for each of the two years in the period then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Separate Account’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Separate Account’s internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Separate Account’s internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion.  An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation of securities owned as of December 31, 2015, by correspondence with the custodian, fund companies or their transfer agents. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of each of the respective subaccounts constituting Separate Account I of Integrity Life Insurance Company at December 31, 2015, and the results of their operations and changes in their net assets for the periods indicated thereon, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

of
Integrity Life Insurance Company
 
Notes to Financial Statements (continued)
 
1. Organization and Significant Accounting Policies
 
Organization and Nature of Operations
 
Integrity Life Insurance Company Separate Account I (the “Separate Account”) is a unit investment trust registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “1940 Act”), established by the Integrity Life Insurance Company (the “Company”), a life insurance company, that is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Western and Southern Life Insurance Company.  The Separate Account was established on May 19, 1986, for the purpose of issuing variable annuity contracts (“Contracts”).
 
Contract holders may allocate or transfer their account values to one or more of the Separate Account’s investment subaccounts, or for certain contract holders, to one or more fixed guaranteed rate options of the Company’s Separate Account Guaranteed Principal Option (“GPO”). Options in the Separate Account GPO include fixed guaranteed rate options over various maturity periods that are subject to a market value adjustment (“MVA”) and a Systematic Transfer Option (“STO”), which accumulates interest at a fixed rate without an MVA. All STO contributions must be transferred to other investment divisions or to a guaranteed rate option within either six months or one year of the contribution. In addition, certain contract holders may also allocate or transfer their account values to options held in the Company’s general account. Such options include a guaranteed interest division or quarterly
rate option.

Separate Account I
of
Integrity Life Insurance Company
 
Notes to Financial Statements (continued)
 
1.  Organization and Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
 
Mid Atlantic Trust Company (“MATC”), a South Dakota registered non-depository trust company, is the custodian for the Vanguard ETFs and the iShares ETFs held by the subaccounts.
 
The contract holder’s account value in a subaccount will vary depending on the performance of the corresponding Underlying Fund. The Separate Account currently has 961 subaccounts available. The investment objective of each subaccount is to invest in the corresponding Underlying Fund. Refer to each Underlying Fund’s prospectus for a description of investment objectives.
 
Under applicable insurance law, the assets and liabilities of the Separate Account are clearly identified and distinguished from the Company’s other assets and liabilities. The portion of the Separate Account’s assets applicable to contract holders’ accounts is not chargeable with liabilities arising out of any other business the Company may conduct.
 
Basis of Presentation
 
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“US GAAP”).
 
Investments
 
Investments in shares of the Underlying Funds are valued at fair value as determined by the closing net asset value per share on December 31, 2015. The difference between cost and fair value is reflected as unrealized appreciation or depreciation of investments.
 
Share transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains and losses on sales of the Underlying Funds’ shares are determined based on the identified cost basis.
 
Capital gain distributions are included in the realized gain distributions line on the Statements of Operations. Dividends are included in the reinvested dividends line on the Statements of Operations. Dividends and capital gain distributions are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Dividends and capital gain distributions from the Underlying Funds’ are reinvested in the respective Underlying Funds and are reflected in the unit values of the subaccounts.

Separate Account I
of
Integrity Life Insurance Company
 
Notes to Financial Statements (continued)
 
1. Organization and Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
 
The Separate Account’s investments are held at fair value. Fair value is the price that the Separate Account would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair Value is established using a three-level hierarchy based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability. Inputs may be observable or unobservable and refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Observable inputs reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity. Unobservable inputs reflect the reporting entity’s own assessment regarding the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and are developed based on the best information
available in the circumstances. The Separate Account’s investments are assigned a level based upon the observability of the inputs that are significant to the overall valuation. The three-tier hierarchy of inputs is summarized below.
 
·                  Level 1 - inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices in active markets.
·                  Level 2 - inputs to the valuation methodology are observable, directly or indirectly.
·                  Level 3 - inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and reflect assumptions on the part of the reporting entity.
 
The Separate Account’s investments are valued as Level 1. There were no transfers between levels 1, 2, and 3 during the year. The Separate Account’s policy is to recognize the transfers in and transfers out of levels at the beginning of the annual reporting period.
 
Unit Value
 
Unit values for the subaccounts are computed at the end of each business day. The unit value is equal to the unit value for the preceding business day multiplied by a net investment factor. This net investment factor is determined based on the net asset value of the Underlying Fund, reinvested dividends and capital gains, and the daily asset charge for the mortality and expense risk and certain administrative charges, as applicable.

Separate Account I
of
Integrity Life Insurance Company
 
Notes to Financial Statements (continued)
 
1. Organization and Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
 
Taxes
 
Operations of the Separate Account are included in the income tax return of the Company, which is taxed as a life insurance company under the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”). The Separate Account is not taxed as a regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the IRC. Under the provisions of the policies, the Company has the right to charge the Separate Account for federal income tax attributable to the Separate Account. No charge is currently being made against the Separate Account for such tax since, under current tax law, the Company pays no tax on investment income and capital gains reflected in variable annuity policy reserves. However, the Company retains the right to charge for any federal income tax incurred, which is attributable to the Separate Account if the law is changed. Charges for state and local taxes, if any, attributable to the Separate Account may also be made.
 
Use of Estimates
 
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
Subsequent Events
 
Management has evaluated subsequent events through the issuance of these financial statements and determined that no additional disclosures are required.

3. Expenses and Related Party Transactions (continued)
 
For optional benefits that are not included in the daily mortality and expense charge, the Company deducts an amount either quarterly or annually, depending on the benefit, to cover the cost of the additional benefits elected.
 
For charges that are dependent on contract owner actions, e.g., withdrawal charges and transfer fees, the Company deducts an amount at the time of the transaction to cover the cost. In both situations (ongoing benefit charges and transaction charges), the fees are deducted from the account value by redeeming units.

4.  Financial Highlights
 
A summary of net assets, unit values and units outstanding for variable annuity contracts, investment income and expense ratios, excluding expenses of the underlying funds and total returns are presented for each of the five years in the period ended December 31, 2015.
 
Investment income ratio amounts represent the dividends, excluding distributions of capital gains, received by the subaccount from the Underlying Fund net of management fees assessed by the fund manager, divided by the average net assets.  These ratios exclude those expenses, such as mortality and expense risk and administrative charges, that result in direct reductions in the unit values.  The recognition of investment income by the subaccount is affected by the timing of the declaration of dividends by the Underlying Fund in which the subaccounts invest.
 
Expense ratio amounts represent the annualized contract expenses of the subaccount, consisting primarily of mortality and expense risk and administrative charges, for each period indicated.  The ratios include only those expenses that result in a direct reduction to unit values.  Charges made directly to contract owner accounts through the redemption of units and expenses of the underlying fund are excluded.
 
Total return amounts represent the total return for the periods indicated, including changes in the fair value of the Underlying Fund, which includes expenses assessed through the reduction of unit values.  The ratio does not include any expenses assessed through the redemption of units.  Subaccounts with a date notation indicate the effective date of that investment option in the variable account.  The total return is calculated for the period indicated or from the effective date through the end of the reporting period.

Report of Independent Auditors
 
The Board of Directors
Integrity Life Insurance Company
 
We have audited the accompanying statutory-basis financial statements of Integrity Life Insurance Company, which comprise the balance sheets as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related statements of operations, changes in capital and surplus, and cash flow for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015, and the related notes to the financial statements.
 
Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements
 
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in conformity with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the Ohio Department of Insurance. Management also is responsible for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
 
Auditor’s Responsibility
 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
 
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions.
 
1



 
Basis for Adverse Opinion on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
 
As described in Note 1 to the financial statements, to meet the requirements of Ohio the financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the Ohio Department of Insurance, which practices differ from U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The variances between such practices and U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the effects on the accompanying financial statements are described in Note 1.
 
Adverse Opinion on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
 
In our opinion, because of the effects of the matter described in the preceding paragraph, the statutory-basis financial statements referred to above do not present fairly, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, the financial position of Integrity Life Insurance Company at December 31, 2015 and 2014, or the results of its operations or its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015.
 
Opinion on Statutory-Basis of Accounting
 
However, in our opinion, the statutory-basis financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Integrity Life Insurance Company at December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015, in conformity with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the Ohio Department of Insurance.
 
Supplementary Information
 
Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the statutory-basis financial statements as a whole.  The accompanying statutory-basis financial statement supplementary information listed in Schedules I, III, and IV is presented for purposes of additional analysis and is not a required part of the statutory-basis financial statements.  Such information is the responsibility of management and was derived from and relates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the statutory-basis financial statements. The information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the statutory-basis financial statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the statutory-basis financial statements or to the statutory-basis financial statements
themselves, and other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. In our opinion, the information is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the statutory-basis financial statements as a whole.

Integrity Life Insurance Company
 
Notes to Financial Statements (Statutory-Basis)
 
December 31, 2015
 
1. Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies
 
Integrity Life Insurance Company (the Company) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Western and Southern Life Insurance Company (Western and Southern). The Company, domiciled in the state of Ohio and currently licensed in 48 states and the District of Columbia, specializes in the asset accumulation business with particular emphasis on retirement savings and investment products. For the year ended December 31, 2015, approximately 41.5% of the gross premiums and annuity considerations for the Company were derived from California, Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Texas.
 
The Company’s wholly-owned insurance subsidiary, National Integrity Life Insurance Company (National Integrity), is currently licensed in eight states and the District of Columbia and distributes similar products, principally in the state of New York. Fort Washington Investment Advisors, Inc. (Fort Washington), a registered investment adviser, is a nonlife insurance subsidiary of Western and Southern and is the investment manager for the Company.
 
State regulatory authorities have powers relating to granting and revoking licenses to transact business, the licensing of agents, the regulation of premium rates and trade practices, the form and content of insurance policies, the content of advertising material, financial statements and the nature of permitted practices.
 
Use of Estimates
 
The preparation of statutory-basis financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
Basis of Presentation
 
The accompanying financial statements of the Company have been prepared in conformity with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the Ohio Department of Insurance (the Department). The National Association of Insurance Commissioners’ (NAIC) Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual (NAIC SAP) has been adopted as a component of prescribed or permitted practices by the State of Ohio. These practices differ in some respects from U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The more significant differences follow.

Integrity Life Insurance Company
 
Notes to Financial Statements (Statutory-Basis) (continued)
 
1. Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
 
Investments
 
Investments in debt securities and mandatory redeemable preferred stocks are reported at amortized cost or fair value based on the NAIC rating; for GAAP, such fixed maturity investments are designated at purchase as held-to-maturity, trading or available-for-sale. Held-to-maturity fixed investments are reported at amortized cost, and the remaining fixed maturity investments are reported at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses reported in operations for those designated as trading and as a separate component of other comprehensive income (loss) for those designated as available-for-sale.
 
All single-class and multiclass mortgage-backed/asset-backed securities (e.g., CMOs) are adjusted for the effects of changes in prepayment assumptions on the related accretion of discount or amortization of premium of such securities using the retrospective method. The prospective method is used to determine amortized cost for securities that experience a decline that is deemed to be other-than-temporary. Securities that are in an unrealized loss position which the Company intends to sell, or does not have the intent and ability to hold until recovery, are written down to fair value as a realized loss. Securities that are in an unrealized loss position which the Company has the intent and ability to hold until recovery are written down to the extent the present value of expected future cash flows using the security’s effective yield is lower than the amortized cost. For GAAP purposes, all securities, purchased
or retained, that represent beneficial interests in securitized assets (e.g., CMO, CBO, CDO, CLO, MBS and ABS securities), other than high credit quality securities, are adjusted using the prospective method when there is a change in estimated future cash flows. If it is determined that a decline in fair value is other-than-temporary, the cost basis of the security is written down to the extent the present value of expected future cash flows using the security’s effective yield is lower than the amortized cost. If high credit quality securities are adjusted, the retrospective method is used.
 
The Company monitors other investments to determine if there has been an other-than-temporary decline in fair value. Factors that management considers for each identified security include the following:
 
·                  The extent and length of time the fair value has been below the book/adjusted carrying value;
 
·                  The reasons for the decline in value;

Notes to Financial Statements (Statutory-Basis) (continued)
 
1. Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
 
·                  Specific credit issues related to the issuer and current economic conditions, including the current and future impact of any specific events;
 
·                  For structured investments (e.g., residential mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and other structured investments), factors such as overall deal structure and the Company’s position within the structure, quality of underlying collateral, delinquencies and defaults, loss severities, recoveries, prepayments and cumulative loss projections are considered;
 
·                  For all equity securities and other debt securities with credit-related declines in fair value, the Company’s intent and ability to hold the security long enough for it to recover its value to book/adjusted carrying value; and
 
·                  For all other debt securities with interest-related declines in fair value, the Company’s intent to sell the security before recovery of its book/adjusted carrying value.
 
If the decline is judged to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge to fair value is recorded as a net realized capital loss in the period the determination is made. Under GAAP, if the decline is judged to be other-than-temporary because the Company has the intent to sell the debt security or is more likely than not to be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery, an impairment charge to fair value is recorded as a net realized capital loss. If the decline is judged to be other-than-temporary because the Company does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security due to expected credit losses, an impairment charge is recorded to net realized capital loss as the difference between amortized cost and the net present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate implicit in the debt security prior to impairment.
 
Under a formula prescribed by the NAIC, the Company defers the portion of realized capital gains and losses on sales of fixed income investments, principally debt securities and mortgage loans, attributable to changes in the general level of interest rates and amortizes those deferrals over the remaining period to maturity of the individual security sold using the seriatim method. The net deferral is reported as the interest maintenance reserve (IMR) in the accompanying balance sheets. Realized capital gains and losses are reported in income net of federal income tax and transfers to the IMR. Under GAAP, realized capital gains and losses are reported in the statement of operations on a pretax basis in the period that the assets giving rise to the gains or losses are sold.

Notes to Financial Statements (Statutory-Basis) (continued)
 
1. Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
 
The asset valuation reserve (AVR) provides a valuation allowance for invested assets. The AVR is determined by an NAIC prescribed formula with changes reflected directly in capital and surplus. AVR is not recognized for GAAP.
 
Subsidiary
 
The accounts and operations of the Company’s subsidiary are not consolidated with the accounts and operations of the Company as would be required under GAAP.
 
Policy Acquisition Costs
 
The costs of acquiring and renewing business are expensed when incurred. Under GAAP, policy acquisition costs, related to traditional life insurance and certain long-duration accident and health insurance policies issued, to the extent recoverable from future policy revenues, would be deferred and amortized over the premium-paying period of the related policies using assumptions consistent with those used in computing policy benefit reserves; for universal life insurance and investment products, to the extent recoverable from future gross profits, deferred policy acquisition costs are amortized generally in proportion to the present value of expected gross profits from surrender charges and investments, mortality, and expense margins.
 
Nonadmitted Assets
 
Certain assets designated as “nonadmitted” (principally a portion of deferred tax assets), and other assets not specifically identified as an admitted asset within the NAIC’s Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual, are excluded from the accompanying balance sheets and are charged directly to accumulated deficit. Under GAAP, such assets are included in the balance sheets.
 
Premiums and Benefits
 
Revenues for universal life and annuity policies with mortality or morbidity risk, except for guaranteed interest and group annuity contracts, consist of the entire premium received, and benefits incurred represent the total of death benefits paid and the change in policy reserves. Premiums received for annuity policies without mortality or morbidity risk and for guaranteed interest and group annuity contracts are recorded using deposit accounting, and credited directly to an appropriate policy reserve account, without recognizing premium income. Under GAAP, premiums received in excess of policy charges would not be recognized as premium revenue and benefits would represent the excess of benefits paid over the policy account value and interest credited to the account values.

Notes to Financial Statements (Statutory-Basis) (continued)
 
1. Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
 
Benefit Reserves
 
Certain policy reserves are calculated using statutorily prescribed interest and mortality assumptions rather than on estimated expected experience or actual account balances as would be required under GAAP.
 
Reinsurance
 
A liability for reinsurance balances is required to be provided for unsecured policy reserves ceded to reinsurers not authorized to assume such business. Changes to those amounts are credited or charged directly to capital and surplus. Under GAAP, an allowance for amounts deemed uncollectible would be established through a charge to earnings.
 
Policy and contract liabilities ceded to reinsurers have been reported as reductions of the related reserves rather than as assets as would be required under GAAP. Commissions allowed by reinsurers on business ceded are reported as income when incurred rather than being deferred and amortized with policy acquisition costs as required under GAAP.
 
Deferred Income Taxes
 
Deferred tax assets are recorded for the amount of gross deferred tax assets expected to be realized in future years, and a valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets not meeting a more-likely-than-not realization threshold. Deferred tax assets are limited to 1) the amount of federal income taxes paid in prior years that can be recovered through loss carrybacks for existing temporary differences that reverse during a time frame corresponding with IRS tax loss carryback provisions, not to exceed three years, including amounts established in accordance with the provision of SSAP No. 5R, plus 2) for entities who meet the required realization threshold in SSAP No. 101, the lesser of the remaining gross deferred tax assets expected to be realized within three years of the balance sheet date or 15% of capital and surplus excluding any net deferred tax assets, electronic data processing equipment and
operating software and any net positive goodwill, plus 3) the amount of remaining gross deferred tax assets that can be offset against existing gross deferred tax liabilities. The remaining deferred tax assets are nonadmitted. Under GAAP, a deferred tax asset is recorded for the amount of gross deferred tax assets expected to be realized in all future years, and a valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets not meeting a more-likely-than-not realization threshold.

Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in the statements of cash flow represent cash balances and investments with initial maturities of one year or less. Under GAAP, the corresponding captions of cash and cash equivalents include cash balances and investments with initial maturities of three months or less.
 
A reconciliation of capital and surplus and net income of the Company as determined in accordance with NAIC SAP to amounts determined in accordance with GAAP as of December 31 and for the years then ended is as follows:

1. Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
 
Investments
 
Debt securities, common stocks, preferred stocks, and short-term investments are stated at values prescribed by the NAIC, as follows:
 
Debt securities not backed by other loans are principally stated at amortized cost using the interest method.
 
Single-class and multiclass mortgage-backed/asset-backed securities are valued at amortized cost using the interest method including anticipated prepayments. Prepayment assumptions are obtained from Bloomberg and broker-dealer prepayment models or derived from empirical data and are based on the current interest rate and economic environment. The retrospective adjustment method is used to value all such securities except securities that are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired and securities that are principal-only or interest-only, which are valued using the prospective method.
 
Unaffiliated common stocks are unrestricted and reported at fair value utilizing publicly quoted prices from third-party pricing services and the related unrealized capital gains and losses are reported in capital and surplus along with any adjustment for federal income taxes.
 
Redeemable preferred stocks that have characteristics of debt securities and are rated as medium quality or better are reported at cost or amortized cost. All other redeemable preferred stocks are reported at the lower of cost, amortized cost or fair value. Perpetual preferred stocks that have the characteristics of equity securities and are rated as medium quality or better are reported at cost. All other perpetual preferred stocks are reported at the lower of cost or fair value utilizing publicly quoted prices from third-party pricing services and the related unrealized capital gains and losses are reported in capital and surplus along with any adjustment for federal income taxes.
 
Short-term investments include investments with remaining maturities of one year or less at the date of acquisition and are principally stated at amortized cost, which approximates fair value.
 
Cash equivalents are short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less and are principally stated at amortized cost, which approximates fair value.

Integrity Life Insurance Company
 
Notes to Financial Statements (Statutory-Basis) (continued)
 
1. Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
 
The Company’s insurance subsidiary is reported at its underlying statutory equity. The net change in the subsidiary’s equity is included in capital and surplus.
 
Joint ventures, partnerships, and limited liability companies are carried at the Company’s interest in the underlying audited GAAP equity of the investee. Undistributed earnings allocated to the Company are reported in the change in net unrealized capital gains or losses. Distributions from earnings of the investees are reported as net investment income when received. Because of the indirect nature of these investments, there is an inherent reduction in transparency and liquidity and increased complexity in valuing the underlying investments. As a result, these investments are actively managed by the Company’s management via detailed evaluation of the investment performance relative to risk.
 
Mortgage loans are reported at unpaid principal balances, less an allowance for impairment. A mortgage loan is considered to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all principal and interest amounts due according to the contractual terms of the mortgage agreement. When management determines foreclosure is probable, the impairment is other than temporary; the mortgage loan is written down to realizable value and a realized loss is recognized.
 
Policy loans are reported at unpaid principal balances.
 
Debt securities and other loan interest are credited to income as it accrues. Dividends are recorded as income on ex-dividend dates. To the extent income is uncertain, due and accrued income is excluded and treated as nonadmitted through surplus.
 
Realized capital gains and losses are determined using the specific identification method.
 
Premiums
 
Life and accident and health premiums are recognized as revenue when due. Premiums for annuity policies with mortality and morbidity risk, except for guaranteed interest and group annuity contracts, are also recognized as revenue when due. Premiums received for annuity policies without mortality or morbidity risk and for guaranteed interest and group annuity contracts are recorded using deposit accounting.

Policy Reserves
 
Life and annuity reserves are developed by actuarial methods and are determined based on published tables using statutorily specified interest rates and valuation methods that will provide, in the aggregate, reserves that are greater than or equal to the minimum or guaranteed policy cash values or the amounts required by the Department. The Company waives deduction of deferred fractional premiums on the death of life and annuity policy insureds and does not return any premium beyond the date of death. Surrender values on policies do not exceed the corresponding benefit reserves. Policies issued subject to multiple table substandard extra premiums are valued on the standard reserve basis which recognizes the nonlevel incidence of the excess mortality costs. Additional reserves are established when the results of cash flow testing under various interest rate scenarios indicate the need for such reserves, or the
net premiums exceed the gross premiums on any insurance in-force.
 
The mean reserve method is used to adjust the calculated terminal reserve to the appropriate reserve at December 31. Mean reserves are determined by computing the regular mean reserve for the plan at the rated age and holding, in addition, one-half of the extra premium charge for the year. Policies issued after July 1 for substandard lives are charged an extra premium plus the regular premium for the true age. Mean reserves are based on appropriate multiples of standard rates of mortality. An asset is recorded for deferred premiums net of loading to adjust the reserve for modal premium payments.
 
For substandard table ratings, mean reserves are based on 125% to 500% of standard mortality rates. For flat extra ratings, mean reserves are based on the standard or substandard mortality rates increased by 1 to 25 deaths per thousand.
 
Tabular interest, tabular less actual reserves released, and tabular cost have been determined by formula as prescribed by the NAIC. Tabular interest on funds not involving life contingencies was derived from basic data.
 
The establishment of appropriate reserves is an inherently uncertain process, and there can be no assurance that the ultimate liability will not exceed the Company’s policy reserves and have an adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. Due to the inherent uncertainty of estimating reserves, it has been necessary, and may over time continue to be necessary, to revise estimated future liabilities as reflected in the Company’s policy reserves.

Reinsurance
 
Reinsurance premiums and benefits paid or provided are accounted for on a basis consistent with those used in accounting for the original policies issued and the terms of the reinsurance contracts. The change in reserves for modified coinsurance contracts is recorded on the reserve adjustments on reinsurance ceded line in the statements of operations.
 
Securities Lending
 
At December 31, 2015, the Company has loaned $107.4 million and $43.6 million (fair value) in the general and separate account, respectively, of various debt securities, preferred stocks and common stocks as part of a securities lending program administered by Deutsche Bank. At December 31, 2014, the Company has loaned $65.3 million and $43.3 million (fair value) in the general and separate account, respectively, of various debt securities, preferred stocks and common stocks as part of a securities lending program administered by Deutsche Bank. The Company maintains effective control over all loaned securities and, therefore, continues to report such securities as invested assets in the balance sheets.
 
The Company requires at the initial transaction that the fair value of the cash collateral received must be equal to 102% of the fair value of the loaned securities. The Company monitors the ratio of the fair value of the collateral to loaned securities to ensure it does not fall below 100%. If the fair value of the collateral falls below 100% of the fair value of the securities loaned, the Company nonadmits that portion of the loaned security. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company did not nonadmit any portion of the loaned securities.
 
The Company reports all collateral on the balance sheet with an offsetting liability recognized for the obligation to return the collateral. Collateral for the securities lending program is either managed by an affiliated agent of the Company or is managed by Deutsche Bank, an unaffiliated agent. Collateral managed by an affiliated agent, which approximated $147.6 million and $98.9 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, is invested primarily in investment-grade debt securities and cash equivalents and is included in the applicable amount on the balance sheets because the funds are available for the general use of the Company. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, collateral managed by an unaffiliated agent,
which approximated $6.7 million and $11.6 million, respectively, was invested in cash equivalents and was included in securities lending reinvested collateral assets on the balance sheet.

At December 31, 2015, the collateral for all securities on loan could be requested to be returned on demand by the borrower. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the fair value of the total collateral is $154.3 million and $110.5 million, respectively.
 
The Company receives cash collateral in an amount in excess of the fair value of the securities loaned. The Company reinvests the cash collateral primarily in investment-grade debt securities and cash equivalents.

At December 31, 2015, all of the collateral held for the securities lending program was invested in tradable securities that could be sold and used to pay for the $154.6 million in collateral calls that could come due under a worst-case scenario where all collateral was called simultaneously.
 
There is no difference in the policy and procedures for the separate account. In addition, collateral for separate account securities lent is held in the general account with a corresponding payable and receivable between the general and separate accounts. The corresponding payable and receivable is included in the due to/from general account/separate account line on the balance sheets and was $44.5 million and $44.1 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

1. Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
 
The Company does not accept collateral that is not permitted by contract or custom to sell or repledge. The Company does not have any securities lending transactions that extend beyond one year from the reporting date.
 
Separate Accounts
 
Separate account assets and liabilities reported in the accompanying balance sheets represent funds that are separately administered, principally for nonguaranteed variable annuity contracts and guaranteed market value adjustment annuity contracts. Assets held in the separate account supporting variable annuities are carried at fair value. Assets held in the separate account supporting market value adjusted annuities are carried at the general account basis. These separate account assets are considered legally insulated from the general account. Surrender charges collectible by the general account in the event of annuity contract surrenders are reported as a negative liability rather than an asset. Policy-related activity involving cash flow, such as premiums and benefits, are reported in the accompanying statements of operations in separate line items combined with related general account amounts. Investment
income and interest credited on deposits held in guaranteed separate accounts are included in the accompanying statements of operations as a net amount included in net transfers to (from) separate accounts. The Company receives administrative fees for managing the nonguaranteed separate accounts and other fees for assuming mortality and certain expense risks.
 
Federal Income Taxes
 
Western and Southern files a consolidated income tax return with its eligible subsidiaries and affiliates, including the Company. The provision for federal income taxes is allocated to the Company using a separate return method based upon a written tax-sharing agreement. The benefits from losses of subsidiaries and affiliates, which are utilized in the consolidated return, will be retained by the subsidiaries and affiliates under the tax-sharing agreement. Western and Southern pays all federal income taxes due for all members of the consolidated group. The Company will then charge or reimburse, as the case may be, the members of the group an amount consistent with the method described in the tax-sharing agreement.
 
The Company includes interest and penalties in the federal income tax line on the statements of operations.

The Company recognizes in the financial statements the effects of all subsequent events that provide additional evidence about conditions that existed at the balance sheet date. For nonrecognized subsequent events that must be disclosed to keep the financial statements from being misleading, the Company is required to disclose the nature of the event as well as an estimate of its financial effect, or a statement that such an estimate cannot be made. Management has evaluated subsequent events through the issuance of these financial statements on April 28, 2016.

The Company’s investments in mortgage loans principally involve commercial real estate. At December 31, 2015, 55.9% of such mortgages, or $105.9 million, involved properties located in Colorado, Indiana, Virginia, and Utah. Such investments consist primarily of first-mortgage liens on completed income-producing properties. The aggregate mortgage outstanding to any one

2. Investments (continued)
 
borrower does not exceed $32.0 million. During 2015, the respective maximum and minimum lending rates for mortgage loans issued were 5.0% and 4.0%. At the issuance of a loan, the percentage of any one loan to value of security, exclusive of insured, guaranteed or purchase money mortgage did not exceed 80.0%. During 2015, the Company did not reduce interest rates on any outstanding mortgages.
 
Derivative Instruments
 
The Company invests in derivatives as risk management for its equity indexed products. The exposure to credit risk on its interest rate floors and option positions is the risk of loss from a counterparty failing to perform according to the terms of the contract. That exposure includes settlement risk (i.e., the risk that the counterparty defaults after the Company has delivered funds or securities under terms of the contract) that would result in an accounting loss and replacement cost risk (i.e., the cost to replace the contract at current market rates should the counterparty default prior to settlement date). To limit exposure associated with counterparty nonperformance on its option positions, the Company limits its exposure to individual counterparties to 2% of admitted assets.
 
The Company markets equity indexed annuities. The risk associated with these products is that the ultimate benefit paid could be higher than the return earned from the underlying assets. The Company utilizes custom and exchange-traded call options to economically hedge the S&P 500 index and Goldman Sachs Multi-Asset Equity index exposure embedded in these products with a net notional amount of $698.8 million and $46.5 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Company purchases and writes call options to correlate with changes in the annuity features due to movements in the S&P 500 and Goldman Sachs Multi-Asset Equity index. At the beginning of these contracts, a premium is either paid or received for transferring the related risk. The Company retains basis risk and risk associated with actual
versus expected assumptions for mortality and lapse rates. The Company does not apply hedge accounting treatment to these call options. The Company recognizes changes in the fair value of these call options through unrealized gains/losses and the related gains/losses from terminations, maturities or expirations through realized capital gains/losses. The change in fair value was $(7.8) million and $0.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

The Company has entered into a collateral agreement with the counterparty whereby under certain conditions the counterparty is required to post assets on the Company’s behalf.  The posted amount is equal to the difference between the net positive fair value of the option and the agreed upon thresholds that are based on the credit rating of the counterparty. Inversely, if the net fair value of the option is negative, then the Company may be required to post assets using similar thresholds. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, $9.4 million and $0.0 million, respectively, of cash collateral had been posted to the Company.

3. Fair Values of Financial Instruments
 
Included in various investment-related line items in the financial statements are certain financial instruments carried at fair value. Other financial instruments are periodically measured at fair value, such as when impaired or, for certain bonds and preferred stocks, when carried at the lower of cost or market.
 
The Company uses fair value measurements to record the fair value of certain assets and liabilities and to estimate the fair value of financial instruments not recorded at fair value but required to be disclosed at fair value. Certain financial instruments, particularly policyholder liabilities other than investment-type contracts, are excluded from this fair value discussion. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
 
The Company’s financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value have been classified, for disclosure purposes, based on the following hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels. The Company’s policy is to recognize transfers in and transfers out of levels at the beginning of the quarterly reporting period.
 
·                  Level 1 — Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The Company’s Level 1 assets and liabilities primarily include exchange-traded equity securities and mutual funds, including those which are part of the Company’s separate account assets.
 
·                  Level 2 — Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. The Company’s Level 2 assets and liabilities include NAIC 6 industrial and miscellaneous bonds and residential mortgage-backed securities representing subordinated tranches in securitization trusts containing residential mortgage loans. These securities are currently rated below investment grade. The Company determined fair value through the use of third-party pricing services utilizing market observable inputs. Also included in Level 2 assets and liabilities are call options. The fair values of these instruments are determined through the use of third-party pricing services utilizing market observable inputs.
 
·                  Level 3 — Significant unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. The Company’s Level 3 assets and liabilities primarily include certain call options. The fair values of these instruments are determined through the use of valuation models that utilize significant unobservable inputs.
 
30



 
Integrity Life Insurance Company
 
Notes to Financial Statements (Statutory-Basis) (continued)
 
3. Fair Values of Financial Instruments (continued)
 
Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on available market information and judgments about the financial instrument, including discount rates, estimates of timing, amount of expected future cash flows and the credit standing of the issuer. Such estimates do not consider the tax impact of the realization of unrealized gains or losses.
 
For Level 3 investments, the fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets. In addition, the disclosed fair value may not be realized in the immediate settlement of the financial instrument.
 
As described below, certain fair values are determined through the use of third-party pricing services. Management does not adjust prices received from third parties; however, the Company does analyze the third-party pricing services’ valuation methodologies and related inputs and performs additional evaluation to determine the appropriate level within the fair value hierarchy. The Company performs annual due diligence of third-party pricing services, which includes assessing the vendor’s valuation qualifications, control environment, analysis of asset class-specific valuation methodologies and understanding of market observable assumptions and unobservable assumptions, if any, employed in the valuation methodology. Care should be exercised in deriving conclusions about the Company’s business, its value or financial position based on the fair value information of financial instruments presented below.
The following discussion describes the valuation methodologies utilized by the Company for assets and liabilities measured or disclosed at fair value.
 
Debt Securities
 
The fair values of debt securities and asset/mortgage-backed securities have been determined through the use of third-party pricing services utilizing market observable inputs. Private placement securities trading in less liquid or illiquid markets with limited or no pricing information are valued using either broker quotes or by discounting the expected cash flows using current market-consistent rates applicable to the yield, credit quality and maturity of each security.
 
Equity Securities
 
The fair values of actively traded equity securities have been determined utilizing publicly quoted prices obtained from third-party pricing services. The fair values of certain equity securities for which no publicly quoted prices are available have been determined through the
 
31



 
Integrity Life Insurance Company
 
Notes to Financial Statements (Statutory-Basis) (continued)
 
3. Fair Values of Financial Instruments (continued)
 
use of third-party pricing services utilizing market observable inputs. Actively traded mutual funds are valued using the net asset values of the funds.
 
Mortgage Loans
 
The fair values for mortgage loans, consisting principally of commercial real estate loans, are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, using interest rates currently being offered for similar loans collateralized by properties with similar investment risk. The fair values for mortgage loans in default are established at the lower of the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell or the carrying amount of the loan.
 
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments
 
The fair values of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are based on quoted market prices or stated amounts.
 
Derivative Instruments
 
The fair values of free-standing derivative instruments, primarily call options, are determined through the use of third-party pricing services utilizing market observable inputs or valuation models incorporating significant unobservable inputs, including projected cash flows, applicable swap curves and implied volatilities.
 
Securities Lending Reinvested Collateral Assets
 
The fair values of securities lending reinvested collateral assets are determined through the use of third-party sources utilizing publicly quoted prices.
 
Other Invested Assets
 
Other invested assets primarily include surplus debentures for which fair values have been determined through the use of third-party pricing services utilizing market observable inputs.
 
32



 
Integrity Life Insurance Company
 
Notes to Financial Statements (Statutory-Basis) (continued)
 
3. Fair Values of Financial Instruments (continued)
 
Assets Held in Separate Accounts
 
Assets held in separate accounts primarily include debt securities, equity securities, mutual funds and mortgage loans. The fair values of these assets have been determined using the same methodologies as similar assets held in the general account.
 
Life and Annuity Reserves for Investment-Type Contracts and Deposit Fund Liabilities
 
The fair value of liabilities for investment-type contracts is based on the present value of estimated liability cash flows, which are discounted using rates that incorporate risk-free rates and margins for the Company’s own credit spread and the riskiness of cash flows. Key assumptions to the cash flow model include the timing of policyholder withdrawals and the level of interest credited to contract balances. Fair values for insurance reserves are not required to be disclosed. However, the estimated fair values of all insurance reserves and investment contracts are taken into consideration in the Company’s overall management of interest rate risk.
 
Securities Lending Liability
 
The liability represents the Company’s obligation to return collateral related to securities lending transactions. The liability is short-term in nature and therefore, the fair value of the obligation approximates the carrying amount.
 
Separate Account Liabilities
 
Certain separate account liabilities are classified as investment contracts and are carried at an amount equal to the related separate account assets. Carrying value is a reasonable estimate of the fair value as it represents the exit value as evidenced by withdrawal transactions between contract holders and the Company.

5. Reinsurance
 
Certain premiums and benefits are assumed from and ceded to other insurance companies under various reinsurance agreements. The ceded insurance agreements provide the Company with increased capacity to write larger risks and maintain its exposure to loss within its capital resources.
 
The Company has a modified coinsurance agreement with Western and Southern, whereby the Company cedes structured settlements, guaranteed rate option annuities, and accumulation products written before July 1, 2002. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company retains the reserves and the related assets of this business.
 
The effect of reinsurance on premiums, annuity considerations and deposit-type funds is as follows for the years ended December 31:

In 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Company did not commute any ceded reinsurance nor did it enter into or engage in any agreement that reinsures policies or contracts that were in-force or had existing reserves as of the effective date of such agreements.
 
At December 31, 2015, the Company has no reserves ceded to unauthorized reinsurers. Amounts payable or recoverable for reinsurance on policy and contract liabilities are not subject to periodic or maximum limits. At December 31, 2015, the Company’s reinsurance recoverables are not material and no individual reinsurer owed the Company an amount that was equal to or greater than 3% of the Company’s capital and surplus.
 
Other than as described above, neither the Company nor any of its related parties control, directly or indirectly, any reinsurers with whom the Company conducts business. No policies issued by the Company have been reinsured with a foreign company, which is controlled, either directly or indirectly, by a party not primarily engaged in the business of insurance. The Company does not have any reinsurance agreements in effect under which the reinsurer may unilaterally cancel the agreement. At December 31, 2015, there are no reinsurance agreements in effect such that the amount of losses paid or accrued exceed the total direct premium collected. The Company remains obligated for amounts ceded in the event that the reinsurers do not meet their obligations.
 
There would be no reduction in surplus at December 31, 2015, if all reinsurance agreements were cancelled.

7. Capital and Surplus
 
The Company is required by statutory regulations to meet minimum risk-based capital standards. Risk-based capital is a method of measuring the minimum amount of capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations in consideration of its size and risk profile. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company exceeded the minimum risk-based capital.
 
Ohio insurance law limits the amount of dividends that can be paid to a parent in a holding company structure without prior approval of the regulators to the greater of 10% of statutory surplus or statutory net income as of the preceding December 31 less any dividends paid in the preceding 12 months, but only to the extent of earned surplus as of the preceding December 31. Based on these limitations, the Company is able to pay dividends of up to $62.4 million by the end of 2016 without seeking prior regulatory approval based on earned surplus of $62.4 million at December 31, 2015.
 
8. Commitments and Contingencies
 
The Company is named as a defendant in various legal actions arising principally from claims made under insurance policies and contracts. The Company believes the resolution of these actions will not have a material effect on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.
 
At December 31, 2015, the Company does not have any material lease agreements for office space or equipment.
 
At December 31, 2015, the Company has future commitments to provide additional capital contributions of $32.4 million to private equity joint ventures, limited partnerships and limited liability companies, excluding those related to Low Income Housing Tax Credit properties.
 
At December 31, 2015, the Company has future commitments to provide additional capital contributions of $0.4 million to joint ventures, limited partnerships and limited liability companies investing in Low Income Housing Tax Credit properties.

Interest rate changes may have temporary effects on the sale and profitability of annuity products offered by the Company. Although the rates offered by the Company are adjustable in the long-term, in the short-term they may be subject to contractual and competitive restrictions which may prevent timely adjustment. The Company’s management constantly monitors interest rates with respect to a spectrum of product durations and sells annuities that permit flexible responses to interest rate changes as part of the Company’s management of interest spreads. However, adverse changes in investment yields on invested assets will affect the earnings on those products with a guaranteed return.

10. Separate Accounts
 
The Company’s guaranteed separate account consists of non-indexed, guaranteed rate options that include market value adjustments and systematic transfer options. The guaranteed rate options are sold in fixed annuity products and as investment options within the Company’s variable annuity products. The guaranteed rate options and systematic transfer options carry a minimum interest guarantee based on the guarantee period selected by the policyholder. The fixed annuity products offered provide a death benefit equal to the account value, with one product offering an optional death benefit ranging from 25% to 40% of the gain in the contract. The fixed investment options offered within the Company’s variable annuity products provide the death benefits listed below for variable annuities.
 
The Company’s nonguaranteed separate accounts consist of subaccounts available through variable annuities and variable life insurance. The net investment experience of each subaccount is credited directly to the policyholder and can be positive or negative.  The variable annuities include guaranteed minimum death benefits that vary by product and include optional death benefits available on some products. The death benefits offered by the Company include the following: account value, return of premium paid, a death benefit that is adjusted after seven years to the current account value, a death benefit that is adjusted annually to the current account value, and an additional death benefit ranging from 25% to 40% of the gain in the contract. Some variable annuities also provide living benefits, which include guaranteed accumulation amounts on a date certain, guaranteed minimum withdrawal amounts and guaranteed
minimum lifetime withdrawal amounts.  The death benefit and cash value under the variable life insurance policies may vary with the investment performance of the underlying investments in the separate accounts.
 
As of December 31, 2015, the Company’s general account had a maximum guarantee for separate account liabilities of $40.3 million. To compensate the general account for the risk taken, the separate accounts paid risk charges of $2.2 million, $1.7 million, $1.2 million, $0.9 million and $0.4 million in 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The Company’s general account paid $0.2 million, $0.2 million, $0.1 million, $0.9 million and $0.6 million towards separate account guarantees in 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively.

Report of Independent Auditors
 
The Board of Directors
Western & Southern Life Insurance Company
 
We have audited the accompanying statutory-basis financial statements of Western & Southern Life Insurance Company, which comprise the balance sheets as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related statements of operations, changes in capital and surplus, and cash flow for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015, and the related notes to the financial statements.
 
Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements
 
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in conformity with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the Ohio Department of Insurance. Management also is responsible for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
 
Auditor’s Responsibility
 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.
 
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions.

Basis for Adverse Opinion on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
 
As described in Note 1 to the financial statements, to meet the requirements of Ohio the financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the Ohio Department of Insurance, which practices differ from U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The variances between such practices and U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the effects on the accompanying financial statements are described in Note 1.
 
Adverse Opinion on U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
 
In our opinion, because of the effects of the matter described in the preceding paragraph, the statutory-basis financial statements referred to above do not present fairly, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, the financial position of Western & Southern Life Insurance Company at December 31, 2015 and 2014, or the results of its operations or its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015.
 
Opinion on Statutory-Basis of Accounting
 
However, in our opinion, the statutory-basis financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Western & Southern Life Insurance Company at December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015, in conformity with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the Ohio Department of Insurance.
 
Supplementary Information
 
Our audit was conducted for the purpose of forming an opinion on the statutory-basis financial statements as a whole.  The accompanying statutory-basis financial statement supplementary information listed in Schedules I, III, and IV is presented for purposes of additional analysis and is not a required part of the statutory-basis financial statements.  Such information is the responsibility of management and was derived from and relates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the statutory-basis financial statements. The information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the statutory-basis financial statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the statutory-basis financial statements or to the statutory-basis financial statements
themselves, and other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. In our opinion, the information is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the statutory-basis financial statements as a whole.

The Western and Southern Life Insurance Company (the Company) is a stock life insurance company that offers primarily individual traditional and whole life insurance policies. The Company is licensed in 43 states and the District of Columbia. For the year ended December 31, 2015, approximately 68.1% of the gross premiums and annuity considerations for the Company were derived from California, Illinois, Indiana, North Carolina, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. The Company is domiciled in Ohio. The Company is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Western & Southern Mutual Holding Company (Mutual Holding), a mutual holding company formed pursuant to the insurance regulations of the State of Ohio. Ohio law requires Mutual Holding to hold at least a majority voting interest in the Company. Currently, Mutual Holding indirectly holds 100% of the voting interest through
Western & Southern Financial Group, Inc. (WSFG), its wholly-owned subsidiary. The Company wholly owns the following insurance entities: Western-Southern Life Assurance Company (WSLAC), Columbus Life Insurance Company (Columbus Life) and Integrity Life Insurance Company (Integrity). Integrity Life Insurance Company wholly owns National Integrity Life Insurance Company (National).
 
State regulatory authorities have powers relating to granting and revoking licenses to transact business, the licensing of agents, the regulation of premium rates and trade practices, the form and content of insurance policies, the content of advertising material, financial statements and the nature of permitted practices.
 
Included within the financial statements, the Company has established and operates a closed block for the benefit of holders of most participating individual ordinary and weekly industrial life insurance policies issued on or before the formation of Mutual Holding in 2000 (the Closed Block). Assets have been allocated to the Closed Block in an amount that is expected to produce cash flows which, together with anticipated revenue from the policies included in the Closed Block, are reasonably expected to be sufficient to support the Closed Block policies, the continuation of policyholder dividends, in aggregate, in accordance with the 2000 dividend scale if the experience underlying such scale continues, and for appropriate adjustments in the dividend scale if the experience changes. Invested assets allocated to the Closed Block consist primarily of high-quality debt securities, mortgage loans, policy loans, short-term
investments, other invested assets, and securities lending reinvested collateral. Invested assets of $2,128.5 million and $2,171.7 million were allocated to the Closed Block as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The assets allocated to the Closed Block inure solely for the benefit of the Closed Block policyholders and will not revert to the benefit of the Company. The purpose of the Closed Block is to protect the policy dividend expectations of these policies after the formation of Mutual Holding. The Closed Block will continue in effect until the last policy in the Closed Block is no longer in force.

Use of Estimates
 
The preparation of statutory-basis financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
Basis of Presentation
 
The accompanying financial statements of the Company have been prepared in conformity with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the Ohio Department of Insurance (the Department). The National Association of Insurance Commissioners’ (NAIC) Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual (NAIC SAP or SSAP) has been adopted as a component of prescribed or permitted practices by the State of Ohio. These practices differ in some respects from U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The more significant differences follow.
 
Investments
 
Investments in debt securities and mandatory redeemable preferred stocks are reported at amortized cost or fair value based on the NAIC’s rating; for GAAP, such fixed maturity investments are designated at purchase as held-to-maturity, trading or available-for-sale. Held-to-maturity fixed investments are reported at amortized cost, and the remaining fixed maturity investments are reported at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses reported in operations for those designated as trading and as a separate component of other comprehensive income (loss) for those designated as available-for-sale.
 
All single-class and multiclass mortgage-backed/asset-backed securities (e.g., CMOs) are adjusted for the effects of changes in prepayment assumptions on the related accretion of discount or amortization of premium of such securities using the retrospective method. The prospective method is used to determine amortized cost for securities that experience a decline that is deemed to be other-than-temporary. Securities that are in an unrealized loss position which the Company intends to sell, or does not have the intent and ability to hold until recovery, are written down to fair value as a realized loss. Securities that are in an unrealized loss position which the Company has the intent and ability to hold until recovery are written down to the extent the present value of expected future cash flows using the security’s effective yield is lower than the amortized cost. For GAAP purposes, all securities, purchased
or retained, that represent

Notes to Financial Statements (Statutory-Basis) (continued)
 
1. Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
 
beneficial interests in securitized assets (e.g., CMO, CBO, CDO, CLO, MBS and ABS securities), other than high credit quality securities, are adjusted using the prospective method when there is a change in estimated future cash flows. If it is determined that a decline in fair value is other-than-temporary, the cost basis of the security is written down to the extent the present value of expected future cash flows using the security’s effective yield is lower than the amortized cost. If high credit quality securities are adjusted, the retrospective method is used.
 
The Company monitors other investments to determine if there has been an other-than-temporary decline in fair value. Factors that management considers for each identified security include the following:
 
·                  The extent and length of time the fair value has been below the book/adjusted carrying value;
 
·                  The reasons for the decline in value;
 
·                  Specific credit issues related to the issuer and current economic conditions, including the current and future impact of any specific events;
 
·                  For structured investments (e.g., residential mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and other structured investments), factors such as overall deal structure and the Company’s position within the structure, quality of underlying collateral, delinquencies and defaults, loss severities, recoveries, prepayments and cumulative loss projections are considered;
 
·                  For all equity securities and other debt securities with credit-related declines in fair value, the Company’s intent and ability to hold the security long enough for it to recover its value to book/adjusted carrying value; and
 
·                  For all other debt securities with interest-related declines in fair value, the Company’s intent to sell the security before recovery of its book/adjusted carrying value.

1. Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
 
If the decline is judged to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge to fair value is recorded as a net realized capital loss in the period the determination is made. Under GAAP, if the decline is judged to be other-than-temporary because the Company has the intent to sell the debt security or is more likely than not to be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery, an impairment charge to fair value is recorded as a net realized capital loss. If the decline is judged to be other-than-temporary because the Company does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security due to expected credit losses, an impairment charge is recorded to net realized capital loss as the difference between amortized cost and the net present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate implicit in the debt security prior to impairment.
 
Investments in real estate are reported net of required obligations rather than on a gross basis as for GAAP. Real estate owned and occupied by the Company is included in investments rather than reported as an operating asset as under GAAP, and investment income and operating expenses include rent for the Company’s occupancy of those properties.
 
Under a formula prescribed by the NAIC, the Company defers the portion of realized capital gains and losses on sales of fixed income investments, principally debt securities and mortgage loans, attributable to changes in the general level of interest rates and amortizes those deferrals over the remaining period to maturity based on groupings of individual security sold in five-year bands. The net deferral is reported as the interest maintenance reserve (IMR) in the accompanying balance sheets. Realized capital gains and losses are reported in income net of federal income tax and transfers to the IMR. Under GAAP, realized capital gains and losses are reported in the statement of operations on a pretax basis in the period that the assets giving rise to the gains or losses are sold.
 
The asset valuation reserve (AVR) provides a valuation allowance for invested assets. The AVR is determined by an NAIC prescribed formula with changes reflected directly in capital and surplus. AVR is not recognized for GAAP.
 
Subsidiaries
 
The accounts and operations of the Company’s subsidiaries are not consolidated with the accounts and operations of the Company as would be required under GAAP.

Policy Acquisition Costs
 
The costs of acquiring and renewing business are expensed when incurred. Under GAAP, policy acquisition costs, related to traditional life insurance and certain long-duration accident and health insurance policies sold, to the extent recoverable from future policy revenues, would be deferred and amortized over the premium-paying period of the related policies using assumptions consistent with those used in computing policy benefit reserves; for universal life insurance and investment products, to the extent recoverable from future gross profits, deferred policy acquisition costs are amortized generally in proportion to the present value of expected gross profits from surrender charges and investments, mortality, and expense margins.
 
Nonadmitted Assets
 
Certain assets designated as “nonadmitted” (principally investments in unaudited subsidiaries and controlled and affiliated entities, electronic data processing equipment and software, and furniture and other equipment), and other assets not specifically identified as admitted assets within the NAIC’s Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual, are excluded from the accompanying balance sheets and are charged directly to accumulated surplus. Under GAAP, such assets are included in the balance sheets.
 
Premiums and Benefits
 
Revenues for universal life and annuity policies with mortality or morbidity risk, except for guaranteed interest and group annuity contracts, consist of the entire premium received, and benefits incurred represent the total of death benefits paid and the change in policy reserves. Premiums received for annuity policies without mortality or morbidity risk and for guaranteed interest and group annuity contracts are recorded using deposit accounting, and credited directly to an appropriate policy reserve account, without recognizing premium income. Under GAAP, premiums received in excess of policy charges would not be recognized as premium revenue and benefits would represent the excess of benefits paid over the policy account value and interest credited to the account values.

Notes to Financial Statements (Statutory-Basis) (continued)
 
1. Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
 
Benefit Reserves
 
Certain policy reserves are calculated using statutorily prescribed interest and mortality assumptions rather than on estimated expected experience or actual account balances as would be required under GAAP.
 
Reinsurance
 
A liability for reinsurance balances is required to be provided for unsecured policy reserves ceded to reinsurers not authorized to assume such business. Changes to those amounts are credited or charged directly to capital and surplus. Under GAAP, an allowance for amounts deemed uncollectible would be established through a charge to earnings.
 
Policy and contract liabilities ceded to reinsurers have been reported as reductions of the related reserves rather than as assets as would be required under GAAP. Commissions allowed by reinsurers on business ceded are reported as income when incurred rather than being deferred and amortized with policy acquisition costs as required under GAAP.
 
Employee Benefits
 
For purposes of calculating the Company’s pension and postretirement benefit obligations, vested participants, non-vested participants and current retirees are included in the valuation. The prepaid pension asset resulting from the excess of the fair value of plan assets over the benefit obligation, which is nonadmitted under statutory accounting rules, is included in other comprehensive income under GAAP.
 
Deferred Income Taxes
 
Deferred tax assets are recorded for the amount of gross deferred tax assets expected to be realized in future years, and a valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets not meeting a more-likely-than-not realization threshold. Deferred tax assets are limited to 1) the amount of federal income taxes paid in prior years that can be recovered through loss carrybacks for existing temporary differences that reverse during a time frame corresponding with IRS tax loss carryback provisions, not to exceed three years, including amounts established in accordance with the provision of SSAP No. 5R, plus 2) for entities who meet the required realization threshold in SSAP No. 101, the lesser of the remaining gross deferred tax assets expected to be realized within three years of the balance sheet date or 15% of capital and surplus excluding any

net deferred tax assets, electronic data processing equipment and operating software and any net positive goodwill, plus 3) the amount of remaining gross deferred tax assets that can be offset against existing gross deferred tax liabilities. The remaining deferred tax assets are nonadmitted. Under GAAP, a deferred tax asset is recorded for the amount of gross deferred tax assets expected to be realized in all future years, and a valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets not meeting a more-likely-than-not realization threshold.
 
Policyholder Dividends
 
Policyholder dividends are recognized when declared rather than over the term of the related policies.
 
Statements of Cash Flow
 
Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in the statements of cash flow represent cash balances and investments with initial maturities of one year or less. Under GAAP, the corresponding captions of cash and cash equivalents include cash balances and investments with initial maturities of three months or less.
 
A reconciliation of capital and surplus and net income of the Company as determined in accordance with NAIC SAP to amounts determined in accordance with GAAP as of December 31 and for the year then ended is as follows:

Investments
 
Debt securities, common stocks, preferred stocks, and short-term investments are stated at values prescribed by the NAIC, as follows:
 
Debt securities not backed by other loans are principally stated at amortized cost using the interest method.
 
Single-class and multiclass mortgage-backed/asset-backed securities are valued at amortized cost using the interest method including anticipated prepayments. Prepayment assumptions are obtained from Bloomberg and broker-dealer prepayment models or derived from empirical data and are based on the current interest rate and economic environment. The retrospective adjustment method is used to value all such securities except securities that are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired and securities that are principal-only or interest-only, which are valued using the prospective method.

Unaffiliated common stocks are reported at fair value utilizing publicly quoted prices from third-party pricing services and the related unrealized capital gains and losses are reported in capital and surplus along with any adjustment for federal income taxes.
 
Redeemable preferred stocks that have characteristics of debt securities and are rated as medium quality or better are reported at cost or amortized cost. All other redeemable preferred stocks are reported at the lower of cost, amortized cost or fair value. Perpetual preferred stocks that have the characteristics of equity securities and are rated as medium quality or better are reported at cost. All other perpetual preferred stocks are reported at the lower of cost or fair value utilizing publicly quoted prices from third-party pricing services and the related unrealized capital gains and losses are reported in capital and surplus along with any adjustment for federal income taxes.
 
There are no restrictions on unaffiliated common or preferred stocks.
 
Short-term investments include investments with remaining maturities of one year or less at the date of acquisition and are principally stated at amortized cost, which approximates fair value.
 
Cash equivalents are short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less and are principally stated at amortized cost, which approximates fair value.
 
The Company’s insurance subsidiaries are reported at their underlying statutory equity. The Company’s noninsurance subsidiaries are reported based on underlying audited GAAP equity. The net change in the subsidiaries’ equity is included in capital and surplus.
 
Joint ventures, partnerships, and limited liability companies are carried at the Company’s interest in the underlying audited GAAP equity of the investee. Undistributed earnings allocated to the Company are reported in the change in net unrealized capital gains or losses. Distributions from earnings of the investees are reported as net investment income when received. Because of the indirect nature of these investments, there is an inherent reduction in transparency and liquidity and increased complexity in valuing the underlying investments. As a result, these investments are actively managed by the Company’s management via detailed evaluation of the investment performance relative to risk.

Mortgage loans are reported at unpaid principal balances, less an allowance for impairment. A mortgage loan is considered to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all principal and interest amounts due according to the contractual terms of the mortgage agreement. When management determines foreclosure is probable, the impairment is other than temporary; the mortgage loan is written down to realizable value and a realized loss is recognized.
 
Policy loans are reported at unpaid principal balances.
 
Real estate occupied by the Company and real estate held for the production of income are reported at depreciated cost net of related obligations. Real estate that the Company has the intent to sell is reported at the lower of depreciated cost or fair value, net of related obligations. Depreciation is computed by the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the properties.
 
Property acquired in the satisfaction of debt is recorded at the lower of cost less accumulated depreciation or fair market value.
 
Debt securities and other loan interest are credited to income as it accrues. Dividends are recorded as income on ex-dividend dates. To the extent income is uncertain, due and accrued income is excluded and treated as nonadmitted through surplus.
 
Realized capital gains and losses are determined using the specific identification method.
 
Premiums
 
Life and accident and health premiums are recognized as revenue when due. Premiums for annuity policies with mortality and morbidity risk, except for guaranteed interest and group annuity contracts, are also recognized as revenue when due. Premiums received for annuity policies without mortality or morbidity risk and for guaranteed interest and group annuity contracts are recorded using deposit accounting.

Policy Reserves
 
Life, annuity and accident and health disability benefit reserves are developed by actuarial methods and are determined based on published tables using statutorily specified interest rates and valuation methods that will provide, in the aggregate, reserves that are greater than or equal to the minimum or guaranteed policy cash values or the amounts required by the Department. The Company waives deduction of deferred fractional premiums on the death of life and annuity policy insureds and does return any premium beyond the date of death. Surrender values on policies do not exceed the corresponding benefit reserves. Policies issued subject to multiple table substandard extra premiums are valued on the standard reserve basis which recognizes the nonlevel incidence of the excess mortality costs. Additional reserves are established when the results of cash flow testing under various interest rate scenarios indicate
the need for such reserves, or the net premiums exceed the gross premiums on any insurance in-force.
 
Policy reserves for life insurance and supplemental benefits are computed on the Commissioner’s Reserve Valuation Method. The following mortality tables and interest rates are used:

The mean reserve method is used to adjust the calculated terminal reserve to the appropriate reserve at December 31. Mean reserves are determined by computing the regular mean reserve for the plan at the rated age and holding, in addition, one-half of the extra premium charge for the year. Policies issued after July 1 for substandard lives, are charged an extra premium plus the regular premium for the true age. Mean reserves are based on appropriate multiples of standard rates of mortality. An asset is recorded for deferred premiums net of loading to adjust the reserve for modal premium payments.
 
For substandard table ratings, mean reserves are based on 125% to 500% of standard mortality rates. For flat extra ratings, mean reserves are based on the standard or substandard mortality rates increased by 1 to 25 deaths per thousand.
 
As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, reserves of $21.1 million and $23.4 million, respectively, were recorded on in-force amounts of $1,163.2 million and $1,247.7 million, respectively, for which gross premiums are less than the net premiums according to the standard of valuation required by the Department. The Company anticipates investment income as a factor in the premium deficiency calculation for all accident and health contracts.
 
Tabular interest, tabular less actual reserves released, and tabular cost have been determined by formula. Tabular interest on funds not involving life contingencies is calculated as one-hundredth of the product of such valuation rate of interest times the mean of the amount of funds subject to such valuation rate of interest held at the beginning and end of the year of valuation.
 
The establishment of appropriate reserves is an inherently uncertain process, and there can be no assurance that the ultimate liability will not exceed the Company’s policy reserves and have an adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. Due to the inherent uncertainty of estimating reserves, it has been necessary, and may over time continue to be necessary, to revise estimated future liabilities as reflected in the Company’s policy reserves.
 
Policyholders’ Dividends
 
The amount of policyholders’ dividends to be paid (including those on policies included in the Closed Block) is determined annually by the Company’s Board of Directors. The aggregate amount of policyholders’ dividends is related to actual interest, mortality, morbidity and expense experience for the year and judgment as to the appropriate level of statutory surplus to be retained by the Company.

Policy and Contract Claims
 
Policy and contract claims in process of settlement represent the estimated ultimate net cost of all reported and unreported claims incurred through December 31, 2015 and 2014. The reserves for unpaid claims are estimated using individual case-basis valuations and statistical analysis. These estimates are subject to the effects of trends in claim severity and frequency. Although considerable variability is inherent in such estimates, management believes that the reserves for claims are adequate. The estimates are continually reviewed and adjusted as necessary as experience develops or new information becomes known; such adjustments are included in current operations.
 
Reinsurance
 
Reinsurance premiums and benefits paid or provided are accounted for on a basis consistent with those used in accounting for the original policies issued and the terms of the reinsurance contracts.
 
Securities Lending
 
At December 31, 2015, the Company had loaned various debt securities, preferred stocks and common stocks as part of a securities lending program administered by Deutsche Bank, of which the fair value was $143.9 million and $90.9 million in the general and separate account, respectively. At December 31, 2014, the Company had loaned various debt securities, preferred stocks and common stocks as part of a securities lending program administered by Deutsche Bank, of which the fair value was $252.9 million and $91.8 million in the general and separate account, respectively. The Company maintains effective control over all loaned securities and, therefore, continues to report such securities as invested assets in the balance sheets. The general account collateral is managed by both an affiliated and unaffiliated agent.
The separate account is managed by an unaffiliated agent.
 
The Company requires at the initial transaction that the fair value of the cash collateral received must be equal to 102% of the fair value of the loaned securities. The Company monitors the ratio of the fair value of the collateral to loaned securities to ensure it does not fall below 100%. If the fair value of the collateral falls below 100% of the fair value of the securities loaned, the Company nonadmits that portion of the loaned security. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company did not nonadmit any portion of the loaned securities.

The Company reports all collateral on the balance sheet with an offsetting liability recognized for the obligation to return the collateral. Collateral for the securities lending program is either managed by an affiliated agent of the Company or is managed by Deutsche Bank, an unaffiliated agent. Collateral managed by an affiliated agent, which approximated $91.8 million and $139.1 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, is invested primarily in investment-grade debt securities and cash equivalents and is included in the applicable amount on the balance sheets because the funds are available for the general use of the Company. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, collateral managed by an unaffiliated agent,
which approximated $55.1 million and $119.8 million, respectively, was invested in cash equivalents and was included in securities lending reinvested collateral assets on the balance sheet.
 
At December 31, 2015, the collateral for all securities on loan could be requested to be returned on demand by the borrower. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the fair value of the total collateral in the general account was $146.9 million and $258.1 million, respectively. The fair value of the total collateral in the separate account was $92.8 million and $93.8 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which was all managed by an unaffiliated agent.
 
The Company receives cash collateral in an amount in excess of the fair value of the securities loaned. The Company reinvests the cash collateral primarily in investment-grade debt securities and cash equivalents.

At December 31, 2015, all of the collateral held for the securities lending program was invested in tradable securities that could be sold and used to pay for the $147.4 million and $92.8 million in the general and separate accounts, respectively, in collateral calls that could come due under a worst-case scenario where all collateral was called simultaneously.
 
The Company does not accept collateral that is not permitted by contract or custom to sell or repledge. The Company does not have any securities lending transactions that extend beyond one year from the reporting date.
 
Separate Account
 
The Company maintains a separate account, which holds all of the Company’s pension plan assets. The assets of the separate account consist primarily of marketable securities, which are recorded at fair value. These assets are considered legally insulated from the general accounts.
 
There are no separate account liabilities that are guaranteed by the general account. (See Note 10 for further discussion on the general account’s responsibility as it relates to the obligations of the Company’s pension plan.)

Notes to Financial Statements (Statutory-Basis) (continued)
 
1. Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
 
The activity within the separate account, including realized and unrealized gains or losses on its investments, has no effect on net income or capital and surplus of the Company. The Company’s statements of operations reflect annuity payments to pension plan participants and other expenses of the separate account, as well as the reimbursement of such expenses from the separate account.
 
Federal Income Taxes
 
The Company files a consolidated income tax return with its eligible subsidiaries and affiliates. The provision for federal income taxes is allocated to the individual companies using a separate return method based upon a written tax-sharing agreement. Under the agreement, the benefits from losses of subsidiaries and affiliates are retained by the subsidiary and affiliated companies. The Company pays all federal income taxes due for all members of the group. The Company then immediately charges or reimburses, as the case may be, the members of the group an amount consistent with the method described in the tax-sharing agreement.
 
The Company includes interest and penalties in the federal income tax line on the statements of operations.
 
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions
 
The Company accounts for its postretirement benefits other than pensions on an accrual basis. The postretirement benefit obligation for current retirees and fully eligible employees is measured by estimating the actuarial present value of benefits expected to be received at retirement using explicit assumptions.
 
Actuarial and investment gains and losses arising from differences between assumptions and actual experience upon subsequent remeasurement of the obligation may be recognized as a component of the net periodic benefit cost in the current period or amortized. The net gain or loss will be included as a component of net postretirement benefit cost for a year if, as of the beginning of the year, the unrecognized net gain or loss exceeds 10% of the postretirement benefit obligation. That gain or loss, if not recognized immediately, will be amortized over the average life expectancy of the employer’s fully vested and retiree group.

Accounting Changes
 
Effective January 1, 2015, the Company updated its valuation methodology on certain critical illness and accident and health reserves.  This resulted in a change of statutory reserve valuation that is required to be recorded directly to surplus rather than as a part of the reserve change recognized in the statements of operations.  The Company has recorded a $0.6 million decrease directly to surplus as a result of the change in valuation bases through the change in reserve on account of change in valuation basis line on the statements of changes in capital and surplus.
 
During 2015, the Company determined that its critical illness reserves were understated due to an error in the calculation of ceded reserves. This resulted in a change of the statutory aggregate reserve for accident and health contracts that is required to be recorded directly to surplus rather than as a part of the reserve change recognized in the statements of operations. As a result, effective January 1, 2015, the Company has recorded a $7.5 million decrease directly to surplus as a result of the change in ceded reserves through the correction of critical illness ceded reserve line on the statements of changes in capital and surplus.
 
Effective January 1, 2013, the Company changed its methodology of reporting the dividend accumulation liability to a policy-level basis from an aggregate basis.  This resulted in a change of statutory reserve valuation that was required to be recorded directly to surplus rather than as a part of the reserve change recognized in the statements of operations during 2013.  The Company recorded an increase of $5.7 million to surplus through the change in reserve on account of change in valuation basis line on the statements of changes in capital and surplus for the year ended December 31, 2013.
 
Effective January 1, 2013, the Company adopted Statements of Statutory Accounting Principles (SSAP) No. 102, Accounting for Pensions, A Replacement of SSAP No. 89 (SSAP 102). SSAP 102 requires any underfunded defined benefit pension amounts, as determined when the projected benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of plan assets, to be recognized as a liability under SSAP No. 5R. The Company elected to utilize the minimum transition option reflected in paragraph 85 of SSAP 102 which requires the initial transition liability to be the greater of 10% of the calculated surplus impact of $12.3 million, the estimated annual amortization of “unrecognized items” of $48.7 million, and the difference between accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets of $90.6 million. The minimum transition liability was $90.6 million.
 
The Company had recorded an additional minimum pension liability at December 31, 2012, of $85.5 million, under the previous guidance for pensions, SSAP 89, Accounting for Pensions, A

1. Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
 
Replacement of SSAP No. 8.  As a result of the adoption of SSAP 102 requiring a minimum transition liability of $90.6 million, the Company recorded a $5.1 million increase to the pension liability on January 1, 2013, and a $3.3 million decrease to surplus, net of tax impact, through the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles line on the statements of changes in capital and surplus. On January 1, 2013, the plan was underfunded by $123.2 million. The amount previously recognized at December 31, 2012, was $85.5 million. The amount recognized at January 1, 2013, was $5.1 million. As a result, the remaining transition liability at adoption was $32.6 million. Due to favorable assumption changes
at December 31, 2013, this entire amount was recognized in 2013.
 
Although the Company elected the transition option for surplus deferral, and SSAP 102 allows up to ten years for deferral, the Company must continue to recognize a minimum amount of the transition liability annually. SSAP 102 requires the Company to recognize each year an amount that is at least equal to the estimated annual amortization of the unrecognized items in effect at transition. The Company’s estimated annual amortization of the unrecognized items in effect at transition was $48.7 million.
 
As a result of the adoption of SSAP 102, the Company no longer carries a nonadmitted prepaid pension asset on the balance sheet unless the plan assets exceed the plan obligation.  At adoption, this resulted in a net change in nonadmitted assets through surplus of $428.4 million which was offset by a change in the pension liability from adoption of SSAP 102 in surplus of $428.4 million at January 1, 2013. Both items are reflected on the statements of changes in capital and surplus.
 
Effective January 1, 2013, the Company adopted SSAP No. 92, Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, A Replacement of SSAP No. 14 (SSAP 92). The adoption of SSAP 92 increased surplus by $13.6 million, net of tax impact, through the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles line on the statements of changes in capital and surplus. SSAP 92 requires any underfunded defined benefit amounts, as determined when the accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of plan assets, to be recognized as a liability under SSAP No. 5R. The Company elected to recognize the full impact of SAP 92 immediately upon adoption.  On December 31, 2012, the liability for benefits was $230.1 million. On January 1, 2013, the liability for benefits
was $209.3 million. The change was due to a decrease of prior service costs of $4.5 million and a decrease in unrecognized gains of $16.3 million.

The Western and Southern Life Insurance Company
 
Notes to Financial Statements (Statutory-Basis) (continued)
 
2. Investments (continued)
 
The Company’s investments in mortgage loans principally involve commercial real estate. At December 31, 2015, 87.1% of such mortgages, or $35.7 million, involved properties located in Arizona and Missouri. Such investments consist of primarily first-mortgage liens on completed income-producing properties. The aggregate mortgage outstanding to any one borrower does not exceed $18.2 million. During 2015, the respective maximum and minimum lending rates for mortgage loans issued were 14.0% and 4.4%. At the issuance of a loan, the percentage of any one loan to value of security, exclusive of insured, guaranteed or purchase money mortgage did not exceed 80.0%. During 2015, the Company did not reduce interest rates on any outstanding mortgages.
 
The Company entered into interest rate swaps and swaptions in an effort to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates on long maturity bonds.  The interest rate swaps are forward starting and allow the Company to pay a fixed interest rate in exchange for receipt of a floating interest rate with the counterparty on specified terms. The swaptions provide the Company an option to enter into an interest rate swap to pay floating rate in exchange for receipt of a fixed rate with the counterparty on specified terms.  In 2015, the Company discontinued the use of swaptions for hedging interest rates. The swaps and swaptions utilized in these transactions were considered derivative instruments and not designated as a hedge for accounting purposes.  These instruments are carried at fair value on the balance sheet with changes in fair value recorded in surplus.  If the instruments are terminated prior to maturity, proceeds
are exchanged equal to the fair value of the contract and a realized gain or loss would be recognized.  There was no limit on maximum exposure for the instruments at year end December 31, 2015, and $57.2 million maximum exposure at year end December 31, 2014. The net fair value was $(1.0) million and $(47.0) million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The change in fair value was $47.5 million and $(77.4) million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 respectively.
 
The Company has entered into a collateral agreement with the counterparty whereby under certain conditions the counterparty is required to post assets on the Company’s behalf.  The posted amount is equal to the difference between the net positive fair value of the swap and the agreed upon thresholds that are based on the credit rating of the counterparty. Inversely, if the net fair value of the swap is negative, then the Company may be required to post assets using similar thresholds.  At December 31, 2015 and 2014, $15.9 million and $121.9 million of cash and security collateral had been posted by the Company, respectively.

3. Fair Values of Financial Instruments
 
Included in various investment-related line items in the financial statements are certain financial instruments carried at fair value. Other financial instruments are periodically measured at fair value such as when impaired or, for certain bonds and preferred stocks, when carried at the lower of cost or market.
 
The Company uses fair value measurements to record the fair value of certain assets and liabilities and to estimate the fair value of financial instruments not recorded at fair value but required to be disclosed at fair value. Certain financial instruments, particularly policyholder liabilities other than investment-type contracts, are excluded from this fair value discussion.
 
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Company’s financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value have been classified, for disclosure purposes, based on the following hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels. The Company’s policy is to recognize transfers in and transfers out of levels at the beginning of the quarterly reporting period.

The Western and Southern Life Insurance Company
 
Notes to Financial Statements (Statutory-Basis) (continued)
 
3. Fair Values of Financial Instruments (continued)
 
·                  Level 1 — Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The Company’s Level 1 assets and liabilities primarily include exchange-traded equity securities and mutual funds, including those which are part of the Company’s separate account assets.
 
·                  Level 2 — Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. The Company’s Level 2 assets and liabilities primarily include debt securities within the Company’s separate account for which public quotations are not available, but that are priced by third-party pricing services or internal models using observable inputs. Also included in Level 2 assets and liabilities are interest rate swaps and call options. The fair value of these instruments is determined through the use of third-party pricing services or models utilizing market observable inputs.
 
·                  Level 3 — Significant unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. The Company’s Level 3 assets and liabilities primarily include certain debt securities and private equity securities within the Company’s separate account that must be priced using non-binding broker quotes or other valuation techniques that utilize significant unobservable inputs.
 
Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on available market information and judgments about the financial instrument, including discount rates, estimates of timing, amount of expected future cash flows and the credit standing of the issuer. Such estimates do not consider the tax impact of the realization of unrealized gains or losses.
 
For Level 3 investments, the fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets. In addition, the disclosed fair value may not be realized in the immediate settlement of the financial instrument.
 
As described below, certain fair values are determined through the use of third-party pricing services. Management does not adjust prices received from third parties; however, the Company does analyze the third-party pricing services’ valuation methodologies and related inputs and performs additional evaluation to determine the appropriate level within the fair value hierarchy. Care should be exercised in deriving conclusions about the Company’s business, its value or financial position based on the fair value information of financial instruments presented below. The following discussion describes the valuation methodologies utilized by the Company for assets and liabilities measured or disclosed at fair value.

The Western and Southern Life Insurance Company
 
Notes to Financial Statements (Statutory-Basis) (continued)
 
3. Fair Values of Financial Instruments (continued)
 
Debt Securities
 
The fair values of debt securities and asset/mortgage-backed securities have been determined through the use of third-party pricing services utilizing market observable inputs. Private placement securities trading in less liquid or illiquid markets with limited or no pricing information are valued using either broker quotes or by discounting the expected cash flows using current market-consistent rates applicable to the yield, credit quality and maturity of each security.
 
Equity Securities
 
The fair values of actively traded equity securities have been determined utilizing publicly quoted prices obtained from third-party pricing services. The fair values of certain equity securities for which no publicly quoted prices are available have been determined through the use of third-party pricing services utilizing market observable inputs. Actively traded mutual funds are valued using the net asset values of the funds.
 
Mortgage Loans
 
The fair values for mortgage loans, consisting principally of commercial real estate loans, are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, using interest rates currently being offered for similar loans collateralized by properties with similar investment risk. The fair values for mortgage loans in default are established at the lower of the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell or the carrying amount of the loan.
 
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments
 
The fair values of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments are based on quoted market prices or stated amounts.
 
Derivative Instruments
 
The fair values of free-standing derivative instruments, primarily call options and interest rate swaps, are determined through the use of third-party pricing services or models utilizing market observable inputs.

Securities Lending Reinvested Collateral Assets
 
The fair values of securities lending reinvested collateral assets are determined through the use of third-party sources utilizing publicly quoted prices.
 
Other Invested Assets
 
Other invested assets primarily include surplus debentures for which fair values have been determined through the use of third-party pricing services utilizing market observable inputs.
 
Assets Held in Separate Accounts
 
Assets held in separate accounts include debt securities, equity securities, mutual funds, private equity, and private debt fund investments. The fair values of debt securities, equity securities and mutual funds have been determined using the same methodologies as similar assets held in the general account.  The fair values of private equity and private debt fund investments have been determined utilizing the net asset values of the funds.
 
Life and Annuity Reserves for Investment-Type Contracts and Deposit Fund Liabilities
 
The fair value of liabilities for investment-type contracts is based on the present value of estimated liability cash flows, which are discounted using rates that incorporate risk-free rates and margins for the Company’s own credit spread and the riskiness of cash flows. Key assumptions to the cash flow model include the timing of policyholder withdrawals and the level of interest credited to contract balances. Fair values for insurance reserves are not required to be disclosed. However, the estimated fair values of all insurance reserves and investment contracts are taken into consideration in the Company’s overall management of interest rate risk.
 
Securities Lending Liability
 
The liability represents the Company’s obligation to return collateral related to securities lending transactions. The liability is short-term in nature and therefore, the fair value of the obligation approximates the carrying amount.

*           Gains and losses for assets held in separate accounts do not impact net income or surplus as the change in value of assets held in separate accounts is offset by a change in value of liabilities related to separate accounts.
** Transfers out of Level 3 are due to securities no longer having an NAIC 6 rating or the price source has changed to using a third-party pricing service utilizing market observable inputs.

The Company had $26.0 million and $33.3 million receivable from parent, subsidiaries and affiliates as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  The Company did not have any amounts payable to parent, subsidiaries and affiliates as of December 31, 2015 or 2014.  The terms of the settlement generally require that these amounts be settled in cash within 30 days.
 
The Company has entered into multiple reinsurance agreements with affiliated entities. See Note 5 for further description.
 
5. Reinsurance
 
Certain premiums and benefits are assumed from and ceded to other insurance companies under various reinsurance agreements. The ceded reinsurance agreements provide the Company with increased capacity to write larger risks and maintain its exposure to loss within its capital resources.
 
The Company has a modified coinsurance agreement with Integrity, whereby the Company assumes structured settlements, guaranteed rate option annuities, and accumulation products written before July 1, 2002. Under the terms of the agreement, Integrity retains the reserves and the related assets of this business.
 
The Company has a ceded reinsurance agreement with Columbus Life. Under the reinsurance agreement, Columbus Life reinsures the former liabilities of Columbus Mutual, a former affiliate, which was merged into the Company. Life and accident and health reserves ceded from the Company to Columbus Life totaled $573.0 million and $593.5 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

5. Reinsurance (continued)
 
In 2006, the Company entered into a yearly renewable term reinsurance agreement with Lafayette Life, an affiliated entity, whereby the Company provides reinsurance coverage on certain life products and associated riders as this coverage is recaptured by Lafayette Life from unaffiliated reinsurers. Life reserves ceded from Lafayette Life to the Company under this agreement totaled $1.1 million and $1.2 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
 
Certain premiums and benefits are ceded to other unaffiliated insurance companies under various reinsurance agreements. The majority of the ceded business is due to ceding substandard business to reinsurers (facultative basis).
 
The effects of reinsurance on premiums, annuity considerations and deposit-type funds are as follows for the years ended December 31:

Notes to Financial Statements (Statutory-Basis) (continued)
 
5. Reinsurance (continued)
 
Other than as described above, in 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Company did not commute any ceded reinsurance nor did it enter into or engage in any agreement that reinsures policies or contracts that were in-force or had existing reserves as of the effective date of such agreements.
 
At December 31, 2015, the Company has no significant reserves ceded to unauthorized reinsurers. Amounts payable or recoverable for reinsurance on policy and contract liabilities are not subject to periodic or maximum limits. At December 31, 2015, the Company’s reinsurance recoverables are not material and no individual reinsurer owed the Company an amount that was equal to or greater than 3% of the Company’s capital and surplus.
 
Other than as described above, neither the Company nor any of its related parties, control directly or indirectly, any reinsurers with whom the Company conducts business. No policies issued by the Company have been reinsured with a foreign company, which is controlled, either directly or indirectly, by a party not primarily engaged in the business of insurance. The Company does not have any reinsurance agreements in effect under which the reinsurer may unilaterally cancel the agreement. At December 31, 2015, there are no reinsurance agreements in effect such that the amount of losses paid or accrued exceed the total direct premium collected. The Company remains obligated for amounts ceded in the event that the reinsurers do not meet their obligations.
 
There would be no reduction in surplus at December 31, 2015, if all reinsurance agreements were cancelled.

6. Federal Income Taxes
 
The Company and its eligible subsidiaries and affiliates file a consolidated federal income tax return. Amounts due (to)/from the subsidiaries and affiliates for federal income taxes were $(15.3) million and $30.7 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The tax years 2008 through 2015 remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions.
 
The amount of federal income taxes incurred that will be available for recoupment at December 31, 2015, in the event of future net losses is $88.4 million, $94.4 million, and $66.8 million from 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

7. Capital and Surplus
 
The Company is required by statutory regulations to meet minimum risk-based capital standards. Risk-based capital is a method of measuring the minimum amount of capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations in consideration of its size and risk profile. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company exceeded the minimum risk-based capital.
 
Ohio insurance law limits the amount of dividends that can be paid to a parent in a holding company structure without prior approval of the regulators to the greater of 10% of statutory surplus or statutory net income as of the preceding December 31 less any dividends paid in the preceding 12 months, but only to the extent of earned surplus as of the preceding December 31. Based on these limitations, the Company is able to pay dividends of up to $454.8 million by the end of 2016 without seeking prior regulatory approval based on capital and surplus of $4,548.3 million at December 31, 2015.
 
8. Commitments and Contingencies
 
The Company is named as a defendant in various legal actions arising principally from claims made under insurance policies and contracts. The Company believes the resolution of these actions will not have a material effect on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.
 
At December 31, 2015, the Company does not have any material lease agreements as a lessee for office space or equipment.
 
At December 31, 2015, the Company has future commitments to provide additional capital contributions of $360.1 million to private equity and real estate joint ventures, limited partnerships and limited liability companies.
 
The Company guarantees the payment of all policyholder obligations of each of the following wholly-owned subsidiaries: Columbus Life and Integrity. In addition, the Company guarantees all policyholder obligations of National, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Integrity, and Lafayette Life, an affiliated entity which is wholly-owned by the Company’s parent, WSFG. Guarantees on behalf of wholly-owned subsidiaries or on behalf of related parties that are considered to be unlimited (as in the case of the guarantee on behalf of Lafayette Life) are exempt from the initial liability recognition criteria and therefore no liability has been recognized in the financial

statements. Due to the unlimited nature of the guarantees, the Company is unable to estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments under the guarantees. In the unlikely event the guarantees would be triggered, the Company may be permitted to take control of the underlying assets to recover all or a portion of the amounts paid under the guarantees.
 
9. Annuity Reserves and Deposit-Type Contract Liabilities
 
At December 31, 2015, the Company’s general and separate account annuity reserves and deposit-type contract liabilities that are subject to discretionary withdrawal (with adjustment), subject to discretionary withdrawal (without adjustment), and not subject to discretionary withdrawal provisions are summarized as follows:

Interest rate changes may have temporary effects on the sale and profitability of annuity products offered by the Company. Although the rates offered by the Company are adjustable in the long-term, in the short-term they may be subject to contractual and competitive restrictions, which may prevent timely adjustment. The Company’s management constantly monitors interest rates with respect to a spectrum of product durations and sells annuities that permit flexible responses to interest rate changes as part of the Company’s management of interest spreads. However, adverse changes in investment yields on invested assets will affect the earnings on those products with a guaranteed return.

10. Employee Retirement Benefits
 
The Company has a noncontributory pension plan under group annuity contracts written by the Company covering substantially all employees and field representatives. In addition, the Company provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees or their beneficiaries. Substantially all of the Company’s employees and field representatives may become eligible for those benefits when they reach normal retirement age while working for the Company.
 
The Company uses a December 31 measurement date for all plans.

The Company’s pension liability was $115.9 million and $141.5 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
 
The Company’s discount rate assumption is determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis of the Company’s obligations.  The yield curve utilized in the cash flow analysis is comprised of highly rated (Aaa or Aa) corporate bonds.  The discount rate was increased from 4.05% at December 31, 2014, to 4.35% at December 31, 2015.  This resulted in a $40.8 million decrease in the pension benefit obligation in 2015.
 
The Company’s mortality assumption for plan participants, including future mortality improvements are generally derived from tables published by the Society of Actuaries (SOA). In the fourth quarter of 2014, the SOA issued new mortality and mortality improvement tables that raise life expectancies. The Company incorporated the new SOA mortality improvement tables into the December 31, 2014, pension benefit obligation. The change to the mortality assumption resulted in a $60.0 million increase in the pension benefit obligation in 2014.

The Company employs a prospective building block approach in determining the long-term expected rate of return for plan assets. Historical returns are determined by asset class. The historical relationships between equities, fixed income securities, and other assets are reviewed. The Company applies long-term asset return estimates to the plan’s target asset allocation to determine the weighted-average long-term return. The Company’s long-term asset allocation was determined through modeling long-term returns and asset return volatilities and is guided by an investment policy statement created for the plan.
 
The asset allocation for the defined benefit pension plan at the end of 2015 and 2014, and the target allocation for 2015 by asset category, are as follows:

The plan employs a total return investment approach whereby a mix of fixed income and equity investments are used to maximize the long-term return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk. Risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded status, and corporate financial condition. The total portfolio is structured with multiple sub-portfolios, each with a specific fixed income or equity asset management discipline. Each sub-portfolio is subject to individual limitations and performance benchmarks as well as limitations at the consolidated portfolio level. Quarterly asset allocation meetings are held to evaluate portfolio asset allocations and to establish the optimal mix of assets given current market conditions and risk tolerance. Investment mix is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through regular investment reviews, annual liability measurements, and periodic
asset/liability studies.
 
The Company’s pension plan assets consist primarily of debt and equity securities, mutual funds and private equity funds, all of which are carried at fair value.

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (an exit price). The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels.
 
·                  Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The Company’s Level 1 assets primarily include exchange-traded equity securities and mutual funds.
 
·                  Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. The Company’s Level 2 assets include certain debt securities for which public price quotations are not available, but that use other market observable inputs from third-party pricing service quotes or internal valuation models using observable inputs.  Level 2 assets also include private funds that invest primarily in domestic debt securities where the Company has the right to redeem its interest at net asset values. The underlying debt securities within these funds employ similar valuation methodologies as the Company’s other investments in debt securities.
 
·                  Level 3 – Significant unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. The Company’s Level 3 assets primarily include private equity fund interests.
 
Debt Securities
 
The fair values of actively traded debt securities have been determined through the use of third-party pricing services utilizing market observable inputs.
 
Equity Securities
 
The fair values of actively traded equity securities have been determined utilizing publicly quoted prices from third-party pricing services.
 
Mutual Funds
 
The fair values of mutual funds have been determined utilizing the net asset values of the funds.
 
Private Equity and Fixed Income Funds
 
The fair values of private equity and fixed income funds have been determined utilizing the net asset values of the funds.

Other Assets
 
Other assets primarily include securities lending reinvested collateral and a group annuity contract. The fair value of securities lending reinvested collateral assets are from third-party sources utilizing publicly quoted prices.  The group annuity contract is carried at cash surrender value, which approximates fair value.
 
The fair value of the pension plan’s assets by asset category is as follows:

10. Employee Retirement Benefits (continued)
 
For measurement purposes of the postretirement benefit obligation, a 5.625% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits is assumed for 2015. The rate was assumed to decrease gradually to 4.75% for 2023 and remain at that level thereafter.
 
Increasing or decreasing the assumed health care cost trend rate assumption by one percentage point in each year would increase (decrease) the postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2015, by $25.9 million and $(21.4) million, respectively, and the estimated interest cost components of net period postretirement benefit cost for 2015 by $1.4 million and $(1.1) million, respectively.
 
At December 31, 2015, the assets of the Company’s pension include approximately $69.9 million invested in the Touchstone Family of Funds, which are administered by the Company, $172.0 million invested in private equity and fixed income funds managed by Fort Washington Investment Advisors, Inc., and a $1.8 million investment in a group annuity contract issued by Lafayette Life. At December 31, 2014, the assets of the Company’s pension include approximately $130.9 million invested in the Touchstone Family of Funds, which are administered by the Company, $170.7 million invested in private equity and fixed income funds managed by Fort Washington Investment Advisors, Inc., and a $3.1 million investment in a group annuity contract issued by Lafayette Life.
 
As of December 31, 2015, future benefit payments for the pension plan are expected as follows (in millions):

The Company does not anticipate a required contribution to the pension plan during 2016. The Company did not contribute to the pension plan during 2015.
 
The Company made contributions to the postretirement medical plan of $9.6 million in 2015 and expects to contribute $114.7 million between 2016 and 2025, inclusive. The Company received $0.0 million of subsidies in 2015. The Company’s postretirement medical plan did not collect the Medicare Part D Subsidy for claims activity occurring after January 1, 2013.
 
The Company sponsors a contributory employee retirement savings plan covering substantially all eligible, full-time employees. This plan is subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). The Company’s contributions to the plan are based on a combination of the employee’s contributions to the plan and a percentage of the employee’s earnings for the year. The total of the Company’s contributions to the defined contribution plan were $4.2 million, $5.9 million, and $3.9 million for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Item 28.              Indemnification
 
Integrity’s By-Laws provide, in Article V, Section 5.1 provides:
To the extent permitted by the laws of the State of Ohio, subject to all applicable requirements thereof:
(a)                   The Corporation shall indemnify or agree to indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party, to any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative, other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation, by reason of the fact that he is or was a Director, officer, employee, or agent of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a Director, trustee, officer, employee, or agent of another corporation, domestic or foreign, non-profit or for profit, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise, against expenses, including attorney’s fees, judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit, or proceeding if he acted in good faith and in
a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful.  The termination of any action, suit, or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, he had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.
(b)                   The Corporation shall indemnify or agree to indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending, or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a Director, officer, employee, or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a Director, trustee, officer, employee, or agent of another corporation, domestic or foreign, non-profit or for profit, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise, against expenses, including attorney’s fees, actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation,
except that no indemnification shall be made in respect to any of the following:
(1)           Any claim, issue, or matter as to which such person is adjudged to be liable for negligence or misconduct

 
13



 
in the performance of his duty to the Corporation unless, and only to the extent the court of common pleas or the court in which such action or suit was brought determines upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability, but in view of all circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses as the court of common pleas or such other court shall deem proper;
(2)           Any action of suit in which the only liability asserted against a Director is pursuant to Section 1701.95 of the Ohio Revised Code.
(c)                    To the extent that a Director, trustee, officer, employee, or agent has been successful in the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit, or proceeding referred to in division (a) and (b) of this Article, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified against expenses, including attorney’s fees, actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the action, suit, or proceeding.
(d)                   Any indemnification under divisions (a) and (b) of this Article, unless ordered by a court, shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon the determination that indemnification of the Director, officer, employee, or agent is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in divisions (a) and (b) of this Article.  Such determination shall be made as follows:
(1)           By a majority vote of a quorum consisting of Directors of the Corporation who were not and are not parties to or threatened with any such action, suit, or proceeding;
(2)           If the quorum described in division (d)(1) of this Article is not obtainable or if a majority vote of a quorum of disinterested Directors so directs, in a written opinion by independent legal counsel other than an attorney, or a firm having associated with it an attorney, who has been retained by or who has performed services for the Corporation or any person to be indemnified within the past five years;
(3)           By the Shareholders; or
(4)           By the court of common pleas or the court in which such action, suit or proceeding was brought.
Any determination made by the disinterested Directors under Article (d)(1) or by independent legal counsel under Article (d)(2) shall be promptly communicated to the person who threatened or brought the action or suit by in the right of the Corporation under (b) of this Article, and within ten days after receipt of such notification, such person shall have the right to petition the court of common pleas or the court in which such action or suit was brought to review the reasonableness of such determination.
(e)                    (1)           Expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by a Director in defending the action, suit, or proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation as they are incurred, in advance of the final disposition of the action, suit, or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Director in which he agrees to do both of the following:
(i)                   Repay such amount if it is proved by clear and convincing evidence in a court of competent jurisdiction that his action or failure to act involved an act or omission undertaken with deliberate intent to cause injury to the Corporation or undertaken with reckless disregard for the best interests of the Corporation;
(ii)                Reasonably cooperate with the Corporation concerning the action, suit or proceeding.
(2)           Expenses, including attorney’s fees, incurred by a Director, officer, employee, or agent in defending any action, suit, or proceeding referred to in divisions (a) and (b) of this Article, may be paid by the Corporation as they are incurred, in advance of the final disposition of the action, suit, or proceeding as authorized by the Directors in the specific case upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Director, officer, employee, or agent to repay such amount, if it ultimately is determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation.
(f)                     The indemnification authorized by this section shall not be exclusive of, and shall be in addition to, any other rights granted to those seeking indemnification under the Articles or the Regulations for any agreement, vote of Shareholders or disinterested Directors, or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a Director, officer, employee, or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the  heirs, executors, and administrators of such a person.
(g)                    The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance or furnish similar protection, including but not limited to trust funds, letters of credit, or self insurance, on behalf of or for any person who is or was a Director, officer, employee, or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a Director, officer, employee, or agent of another corporation, domestic or foreign, non-profit or for profit, partnership, joint venture, trust, or other enterprise, against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under this section.  Insurance may be purchased from or maintained with a person in whom the Corporation has a financial interest.
 
14



 
Insofar as indemnification for liability arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court
of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

The Registrant hereby undertakes:
(a)         to file a post-effective amendment to this registration statement as frequently as is necessary to ensure that the audited financial statements of the Registrant, Depositor and Guarantor in the registration statement are never more than 16 months old for so long as payments under the variable annuity contracts may be accepted;
(b)         to include either (1) as part of any application to purchase a contract offered by the prospectus, a space that an applicant can check to request a Statement of Additional Information, or (2) a postcard or similar written communication affixed to or included in the prospectus that the applicant can remove to send for a Statement of Additional Information;
(c)          to deliver any Statement of Additional Information and any financial statements required to be made available under this Form, including the WSLIC financial statements, promptly upon written or oral request; and
(d)         to update the registration statement if WSLIC terminates its guarantee to Integrity policyholders.
 
During any time there are insurance obligations outstanding and covered by its guarantee (Guarantee) issued by WSLIC, filed as an exhibit to this registration statement, Integrity hereby undertakes to provide notice to contract owners promptly after the happening of significant events related to the Guarantee.  These significant events include: (i) termination of the Guarantee that has a material adverse effect on the contract owner’s rights under the Guarantee; (ii) a default under the Guarantee that has a material adverse effect on the contract owner’s rights under the Guarantee; or (iii) the insolvency of WSLIC.

Integrity represents that it recognizes the requirements of Section 17(h) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, specifically that it shall not protect or purport to protect any director or officer of the Registrant or Depositor against any liability to them or to their security holders to which he would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of his office.
