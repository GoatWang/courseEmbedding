The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.

You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

				Maintaining your brows shouldn't involve a small army of products and a sizeable amount of real estate in your bag. That's why Urban Decay created Brow Box, an all-in-one, ultra-compact kit that contains ALL the essentials for amazing brows. Each set includes two shades of silky brow powder, perfecting/setting wax, high-quality metal mini tweezers that remove the tiniest hairs, a mini angled brow brush, a mini spoolie, and two mirrors (one of them magnifies so you won't miss a single stray!).Brow Box is extremely versatile! Blend both shades of brow powder together to create your perfect shade (for natural-looking results you could never achieve with a standard eyebrow pencil); then use the wax to create a precise shape and keep hairs in place. You can also use the wax before the powder to help shape brows and expose spots where color is needed.Don't be fooled by its small size; Brow Box is deluxe. The ultra-fine, silky powders create defined, natural-looking brows, and the soft, pliable perfecting/setting wax (infused with nourishing aloe, beeswax and coconut) provides the ideal amount of grip without being sticky.Need to touch up in public? Not to worry. With Brow Box, you¿ll look as good while applying as your brows will afterward. Sturdy and soft to the touch, this double-layer compact has a custom cover in a mesmerizing black geometric design with metallized lavender cutouts. The top tier holds the powders and wax, and the bottom tier holds all the tools.

				Blend both shades of brow powder to create the perfect match. Then, use the wax to set the color and shape. (You can also use the wax first to shape brows and expose any spots where color is needed.)

 The Epicurious Blog          share  Facebook Tweet pinit googleplus email  print                 Which Tastes Best: Pizza Hut, Papa John's, Little Caesars, or Domino's? by Kendra Vizcaino-Lico on 01/23/14 at 03:00 PM    In preparation for our Super Bowl Sunday celebrations, we decided to find out which of the big pizza delivery chain restaurants had the best pies. We tasted cheese and pepperoni pizzas from the big four (Pizza Hut, Domino's, Papa John's, and Little Caesars) to find out which one was worthy of a place in our game day spread. See the results after the jump >>      The winner: Domino's This was by far Epi editors' preferred pizza of the bunch. They liked the balance of softness and crispiness in the crust, the slightly sweet sauce, and the savory spice of the pepperoni. Some felt it could use a little more cheese, but the quality of the crust is what won over the tasters, "The crispy crust is a nice touch, it has a little chewiness like real pizza," said one judge. 2nd Place: Pizza Hut Overly sweet sauce and a thick, doughy crust put this pizza out of favor with many of the tasters. "The crust is quite puffy and fluffy, not for a crisp crust lover." However, the abundance of gooey cheese and a healthy helping of pepperoni helped make up for some of this pie's shortcomings. 3rd Place: Little CaesarsWhile the judges enjoyed the thin crust and flavorful "zesty" sauce of this pizza, it ultimately lost points for lack of freshness. Despite the fact that it was made while we waited (there were no "Hot-n-Ready" pizzas prepared), most judges felt it was very similar to frozen pizza. "Very processed look and flavorless dough, tastes very pre-fab," stated one judge. 4th Place: Papa John's Although the majority of the judges felt this one looked the best in the box, they were disappointed by the very sweet sauce, lack of cheesiness, and dry mouth feel. "Tastes like the dough mostly. Needs a heavier hand with the cheese," noted one taster. (Photo: Sara Bonisteel)    Tagged with: Pizza, Taste Tests      Comments (10)          KevinLeugan  01:06:18 AM on  09/18/14   This was one of the threads I consulted before my Dominos taste test, and I'm sorry to say that I was misled. My advice would be go for Papa Johns. It's slightly more expensive but they have nice offers online and taste much better than either Dominos or Pizza Hut. Recently I ordered a 2 topping pizza, chicken bacon ranch sub, sauceless wings, and dish chicken alfredo pasta from Dominos all in one go so that I could have a comprehensive evaluation. The pizza was actually good though my standards aren't particularly high. The sub was a bit disappointing. For some reason it was more sour than I thought it would be even given the fact that Ranch turns sour when heated. It just didn't taste all that great and the bacon was hardly noticeable though the chicken and cheese were nice. The pasta was probably my favorite part. I would say they gave you enough chicken and that the sauce is not too greasy, but overall it wasn't anything to cry with joy over. The real deal breaker was the chicken wings. Though the taste was acceptable the texture was absolutely horrifying. I could not believe I was eating meat. By comparison I had always liked the Papa John wings (sauceless). After an 8pc of the Dominos wings (I finished it because I hate wasting food) I had to rinse my mouth with sweet ice tea and order 30pcs of PJ wings to reconvince myself that chicken wings were edible. The meat was soft and soggy (how does that even happen?) and there was hardly any chicken taste. So I realize that one trial may not be best to go by but Dominos chose a bad day to screw up because I can pretty safely say that I won't be trying them again. Sure they are cheaper than Papa John's, but if you add the various deals (like Monday Mania and Web Wednesday) and the points (worth about $3 per if you translate between 25 pts and a 3 topping large pizza), the difference in price is very little and VERY worth it. So my verdict is PAPA JOHNS over dominos unless you want to permanently ruin chicken wings for someone that is, in which case get them 40pcs of unsauced wings and force them to eat it all.       JaneDoe2  02:41:21 PM on  04/16/14   Article claims that Pizza Hut has "overly sweet sauce?" Really? Then what does that make Papa John's sauce? Pizza Hut's sauce NEEDS more sugar, whereas Papa John' is just right. The perfect pizza 'merge' would be Pizza Hut's thin crust Super Supreme, but with Papa John's sauce. I like a greasy pizza- and like it to be cooked lightly brown on top and not a lot of tomato sauce.       uskathoth  06:50:33 PM on  01/28/14   If I was judging it would be Papa John's as worst and then a three way tie for not-quite-as-bad-as-Papa John's. However, even bad pizza is pretty good. I wouldn't turn down PJ if someone else ordered it and paid.        Elric  07:46:49 PM on  01/25/14   Felixvega you lie. Domino's does not use frozen dough for its hand-tossed pizza, never has. Stop making stuff up.        FelixVega  11:06:44 AM on  01/25/14   This article really doesn't make sense? I am not all all biased but, I have worked at several of these chains. First you say delivery chains, but Little Caesars does not deliver. The article states that Little Caesars tastes "Pre-Fab?" What you may not know is that they are the only major chain that still makes dough in the store fresh. No frozen discs made 3 months ago (Pizza Hut) and no frozen dough balls allowed to defrost made 3 months ago (Dominos). If the critics that made the comparison were judging based a New York Style pizza....ok...maybe these are not the same. But these "great and gourmet" pizza parlours are just mom and pop locations. Not Billion dollar empires like the big three. I eat from all Pizza locations trying to size up competition. In order it should be: Little Caesars, Dominos, Papa Johns, Pizza Hut. That is why Little Caesars is the fastest growing pizza chain in the world and Voted Best Value in America 7 years in a row!!!       amberj32  12:22:54 PM on  01/24/14   Papa John's 4th place - I don't think so. Pizza Hut is one big greasy mess. My list would be: 1st - Papa John's 2nd - Domino's 3rd - Pizza Hut 4th - Little Caesars I've heard of Papa Murphy's but never had it. They don't have in California that I know of. Round Table is good but expensive.         alley36  11:44:11 AM on  01/24/14   Papa Murphy's is pizza that is freshly made at the store, you take it home and bake it yourself. They're not bad and you can customize however you like.       serena72  08:47:02 AM on  01/24/14   Never heard of Round Table and Papa Murphy's. I'm guessing they were going for national chains, all of which are gross. I'd rather eat a Red Baron.       cd1  07:19:59 PM on  01/23/14   Papa Murphy's?       sydthekyd  06:44:31 PM on  01/23/14   What about Round Table?            ‹ Juicing: 3 Reasons to Give It a Try8 Gorgeous Reasons Why You Should Eat Pie Today ›          main categories baking books chefs cooking drinking entertaining family fare healthy news & gossip recipes restaurants seasonal travel vegetarian  recent posts Dress Up These Pigs in a Blanket for the Big Game (You'll Hardly Recognize Them) The Crunchy, Salty Snack Every Super Bowl Party Needs The Other Thing To Do With Bacon (Besides Eat It) The Juicy, Meaty Cut of Chicken You Forgot About How To Turn an Overstocked Pantry Into an Addictive Meal We Buy These 7 Fruits and Vegetables Already Prepped, and Feel No Shame About It These Cookies Can All Be Made In Less Than An Hour Better Hot Chocolate Is Just A Snow Day Away A Can Of White Beans Just Saved Winter The Ultimate Guide to Buying and Using Sugar  about this blog welcome to the epi-log  guest contributors   Hugh Acheson    Shauna James Ahern    Kelly Alexander    Serena Bass    Rick Bayless    John Besh    Ethan Book    Joanne Camas    Melissa Clark    Annie Copps    James Oliver Cury    John T.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
