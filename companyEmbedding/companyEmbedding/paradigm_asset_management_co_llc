About Paradigm 

































 
 
 
 
 





Established in 1990, PARADIGM ASSET MANAGEMENT has been an innovator of quantitative equity strategies built specifically for institutional investors. The firm's investments discipline provides an optimal combination of market information with technology to build structured risk-controlled portfolios. Utilizing a proprietary research database, models, and procedures, Paradigm is able to dynamically identify and forecast the key drivers of  a styles performance.

What is a paradigm shift? 
A radical change in a way of thinking, a sudden re-orientation which remakes an entire discipline. Technology frequently exists for many years before individuals begin to use it, simply because it takes vision, commitment and courage to break free from established methods.
We at Paradigm Asset Management believe our proprietary, equity style management approach to investing represents such a paradigm shift, as it challenges much of the conventional wisdom about portfolio management.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Paradigm Asset Management Launches Innovative Small Core Strategy Capturing Interest Of Large Institutional Investors

Paradigm Asset Management Co. LLC, manager of quant-active equity strategies for institutional investors, has launched a high capacity Small Core Strategy designed to provide investors greater active exposure to a wide range of small cap stocks.The Small Core Strategy officially launched in the fourth quarter of 2007 and has already received traction."We not only have interest from a number of institutional investors in the Small Core Strategy, but we've already received funding from two plans. Our firm's aim is to create compelling, cutting edge product choices that suit the dynamic needs of our clients and we think this early interest and commitment from these institutions validates our efforts and expertise," says James Francis, president and CEO, Paradigm."Many large institutional plans are unable to achieve an optimum active exposure to small cap stocks, due to their size," adds Francis. "We created the Small Core Strategy because we recognized that many institutional investors, who would prefer to have access to an alpha rich small cap approach with consistent reliable performance, have been shut out due to capacity constraints and have had to settle for passive exposure. We believe this new strategy will help fulfill those needs."According to Greg Pai, managing director, Paradigm, the Small Core Strategy is representative of Paradigm's next generation products that feature security level research more akin to fundamental analysis combined with the breadth of coverage typically associated with pure quantitative products."It leverages our research database designed to identify key performance drivers within the small cap style. In addition, it incorporates Paradigm's AlphaMax ranking process that is applied to a proprietary universe of over 2000 securities on a monthly basis. This process allows the portfolio to dynamically track the pulse of small cap in terms of security, sector and fundamental leadership."In keeping with the firm's overall investment philosophy, we use our distinctive research resources and 17 years of small cap investment experience to achieve superior returns while reducing unintended risk for our institutional clients," says Pai.Francis said that the Small Core product was designed to produce 4% 5% annualized excess return with a 3% 4% tracking error relative to the Russell 2000 Index.The Small Core portfolio will be managed utilizing a team approach led by Francis, Pai and Jeffrey Marcus, senior portfolio manager at Paradigm.
