N-Viro International Corp. Offers an Update for the Jiaxing China Project Development
Oct 14 16
N-Viro International Corporation offered an update for the Jiaxing China project development. The proposed heads of terms agreement will allow the project to be executed in two phases. Phase I is expected to rapidly deploy the N-Viro Fuel technology to process 500 metric tons of wastewater biosolids per day into a fuel product to be used in combustion power generation. Phase II is expected to commence immediately thereafter and utilize the N-Viro Fuel with a gasification process for captive utility generation and grid connection. The Jiaxing area has experienced significant growth over the past and this trend is expected to continue. The Jiaxing United Sewage Waste Water Treatment Plant is currently undergoing expansion and the ongoing plan would incorporate the N-Viro facility to accommodate up to 1,500 metric tons of biosolids per day. Additionally, the company expects to have discussions relating to other projects within the area to commence soon after the Jiaxing project is finalized.

					Full Description



N-Viro International Corporation, incorporated on April 29, 1993, is focused on marketing its N-Viro Fuel technology, which produces a renewable alternative fuel product out of certain bio-organic wastes. The Company owns and licenses the N-Viro Process, which is a technology to treat and recycle wastewater sludge and other bio-organic wastes. The N-Viro Process utilizes certain alkaline by-products produced by the cement, lime, electric utilities and other industries. Its N-Viro Fuel technology converts waste products being landfilled or land applied into renewable energy solutions. The Company is engaged in production at its biosolids processing facility in Polk County (Bradley) Florida. The N-Viro Process is commercially utilized for the recycling of wastewater sludge from municipal wastewater treatment facilities.The Company's N-Viro Fuel is a biomass alternative energy fuel process that produces a product that has physical and chemical characteristics similar to certain coals and is created from municipal bio solids, collectable animal manure, pulp and paper sludge and possibly other organic wastes. N-Viro Fuel is manufactured by blending the waste materials with one or more alkaline products, followed by thorough drying of the mixture using a thermal evaporative process.The N-Viro Soil Process involves mixing wastewater residuals (sludge) proportionally with an alkaline admixture and then subjecting the mixture to a controlled period of storage, mechanical turning and/or accelerated drying. The N-Viro Process stabilizes and pasteurizes the wastewater residuals, reduces odors to acceptable levels, neutralizes or immobilizes various constituents and generates N-Viro Soil, a product having granular appearance similar to soil, and has multiple agricultural uses. The Company is a distributor of alkaline admixtures for others. The Company also markets its N-Viro Soil to local agricultural markets.

Company Highlights 


N-VIRO Fuel™ is a proven technology that has the capability to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions at coal-fired plants and similar facilities.  N-VIRO Fuel™ has a net positive carbon footprint and is vital to facilitate power generators to meet the state and federal mandates for alternative power generation.   N-VIRO Fuel™ provides an additional benefit to power generators in the form of renewable energy/carbon credits.
N-VIRO International Corporation received endorsement from the US EPA identifying N-VIRO Fuel™ as an alternative, renewable biomass- derived fuel in January, 2009.
N-VIRO International Corporation has 15 years experience in the biosolids industry with a strong brand reputation.  Strategies for maintaining competitive advantage are N-VIRO’s proven product quality, service quality/reliability, and patented technologies.

N-VIRO International Corporation currently generates 5 M in revenues from bio-organic processing fees at managed facilities producing   N-VIRO Soil™ ; however the Company is focused toward the development of both international and domestic facilities where the revenue potential for N-VIRO Fuel™ appears to be significant.
N-VIRO’s patented process technology can offer the end-user three different applications – agriculture, co-combustion and combined heat and power. The technology is not capital-intensive and N-VIRO Fuel™ coupled with other advanced treatment methods provides two independent reuse alternatives with a flip of a switch. The same facility can produce both alternatives, supply and demand ready.  The N-VIRO process has the US EPA’s Class “A”, Exceptional Quality and biomass-derived authorization.
N-VIRO Products
N-VIRO Fuel™ – supports a low-carbon economy that when mixed with coal combustion products reduce emissions while utilizing abundant and inexpensive coal resources for power generation.
N-VIRO Fuel™ Hybrid System – A combined heat and power (CHP) biomass system that uses clean hot air to power turbine and drying equipment. The hybrid system essentially generates electricity through endothermic combustion.
N–VIRO Soil™ – safely “puts back” into the ecosystem an environmentally responsible product that is derived from bio-organic matter and wastewater residuals.

Production is supported through manufacturing at full-scale facilities
Mobile Pilot Facility available for on site demonstrations of alternative fuel production
Market – Agricultural Application: in the United States, Canada and Israel
Priced below commercial fertilizers
Research established N-Viro Soil™  as an industry leader
Slow release of organic matter
Improves texture and water-holding capacity in soil to promote root growth
Supplies nutrients essential for plant growth, including nitrogen and phosphorus, as well as some essential micro-nutrients, such as nickel, zinc, and copper
The organic form of nutrients in biosolids are less water-soluble

Style Scores:



NA Value | NA Growth | NA Momentum | NA VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
