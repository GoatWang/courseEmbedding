Robert D. Walter

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Robert D. Walter (born 1944) is an American businessman best known for his role in the creation of Cardinal Health.
Walter graduated from St. Charles Preparatory School and has a BA from Ohio University. After a brief and unhappy stint as an engineer, Walter attended Harvard Business School, where he received an MBA.[1]
In 1971 he purchased Cardinal Foods, a small Ohio food wholesaler, in a leveraged buyout. In 1979, the company acquired Bailey Drug Company and began wholesaling drugs. In subsequent years, the company experienced extraordinary growth, "one of a handful of large U.S. companies that had achieved earnings-per-share growth in excess of 20 percent for 15 years straight."[2] Cardinal Health is now a Fortune 100 company and one of the largest distributors of pharmaceuticals, health & beauty products, and hospital supplies in the United States.[3] In 2007, he was #14 on Fortune magazine's list of the 25 top-paid male executives, with total compensation of $42.7 million the previous year.[4] He retired from Cardinal Health on June 20, 2009.
He is married to Margaret "Peggy" Walter, who also attended Ohio University. The Walters have given support to the Ohio University community including Margaret Walter Hall, and to the Columbus Museum of Art.[5] Walter resides in Dublin, Ohio; Boca Raton, Florida; and Park City, Utah.

      ■ Robert Walter founded the food-distribution business Cardinal
      Foods in 1971. In 1980 he began diversifying the company to pharmaceutical
      distribution and in 1987 sold off its food distribution component; in 1994
      the company's name was changed to Cardinal Health. By the late
      1990s, after acquiring numerous other companies under Walter's
      direction as CEO, Cardinal had become a large, highly profitable
      health-care conglomerate engaged in the manufacture and distribution of
      drugs and medical and surgical supplies. Walter remained the CEO of
      Cardinal through 2004. Analysts and friends described him as modest,
      highly competitive, and a superb deal-maker, and he repeatedly attributed
      his success with Cardinal to "sneaking up" on his
      competition and to carefully avoiding the pitfalls of big-company culture.
    

      EDUCATION AND FORMATIVE EXPERIENCE WITH ROCKWELL
    

      As an undergraduate at Ohio State University Robert Walter never missed a
      class. A classmate who eventually became

          . 
        


      a CEO himself said that Walter showed a knack for dealing with complexity
      and prioritizing. Walter graduated summa cum laude in 1967 with a BS in
      mechanical engineering and went straight to work for the missile maker
      North American Rockwell (which later became Rockwell International). The
      experience was formative: Walter loathed Rockwell's corporate
      culture, where individual initiative was swallowed up in bu reaucracy. As
      Walter saw it, the company was overstaffed, hampered by a rigid seniority
      system, and made lazy by risk-free, cost-plus government contracts. He was
      later to describe his stint at Rockwell as the worst and scariest
      experience of his career. After only six months Walters left for Harvard
      Business School, determined never to work for an oversized company again.
    

      FOUNDS CARDINAL AS A FOOD DISTRIBUTOR
    

      Fresh out of Harvard's MBA program Walter decided to acquire and
      rehabilitate a mismanaged company in a simple line of business. He
      returned to Columbus, borrowed $1.3 million, and acquired the ailing
      food-distribution division of Consolidated Foods in a leveraged buyout in
      1971; he christened his new company Cardinal Foods. Its business was
      indeed simple: to truck food from wholesale outlets to retail stores.
      Walter managed Cardinal into a major regional food distributor, increasing
      its sales tenfold by 1980. At that point, however, he ran out of headroom.
      The U.S. food-distribution business had been consolidated into the hands
      of a few large companies—too large for Cardinal to acquire or
      compete with for market share. As a food-distribution business Cardinal
      was poised to diversify into the realms of either food or distribution
      alone. Walter tried to diversify within the food business by starting a
      supermarket chain but failed, an experience that he later characterized as
      his most humbling.
    

      DIVERSIFIES CARDINAL
    

      Diversifying into food retailing had been unsuccessful, but Walter
      reasoned that he could still translate his understanding of food
      distribution into the distribution of other items. Researching the
      industry, he found that although food distribution had already been
      heavily consolidated, drug distribution was still highly fragmented. At
      that time there were 354 independent distributors in the United States and
      only three public companies. (Thanks in large part to Walter himself, drug
      distribution would eventually go the way of food distribution: by 2003
      Cardinal and its two biggest competitors controlled 90 percent of the
      drug-distribution market.) In 1980 Walter purchased Baily Drug, the Ohio
      company that distributed drugs to pharmacies, and renamed his own company
      Cardinal Distribution to reflect its expanded scope. Three years later he
      purchased four midwestern drug-distribution centers and took his company
      public. In the next few years Cardinal swiftly expanded—always by
      acquisition, always under Walter's personal control, and always in
      the drug distribution business, which remained simple: Cardinal bought
      drugs from makers like Pfizer and trucked them to customers like hospitals
      or the pharmacy chain CVS.
    

      In 1988 Walters sold off the food-distribution segment of Cardinal; for
      the next six years he concentrated on expanding Cardinal's drug
      distribution business beyond the Midwest. By 1994 Cardinal had been doing
      nothing but transporting drugs and acquiring smaller distributors for some
      14 years. Concerned that Cardinal's narrowness made it vulnerable
      to market instability and declining profit margins in drug distribution,
      Walters decided to diversify. He changed the company's name to
      Cardinal Health and in 1995 made his first nondistribution acquisition,
      Medicine Shoppe International (a large franchiser of retail pharmacies).
      In the following years Cardinal continued to diversify, expanding into
      higher-margin businesses like drug manufacture and the distribution of
      nondrug medical, surgical, and laboratory products. In 1996 it purchased
      Pyxis, the maker of automated drug-dispensing machines used by nurses in
      hospitals. In 1999 Cardinal purchased Allegiance Corporation, the
      manufacturer and distributor of medical-surgical products, for $5.4
      billion. By 2001 Cardinal had increased its earnings by more than 20
      percent annually for 15 consecutive years. By 2004 it was the
      third-largest health-care service provider in the United States, worth
      approximately $44 billion and employing about 50,000 people (40 percent of
      whom worked abroad, mostly in manufacturing).
    

      ACQUISITION AS A BUSINESS: HIGH STANDARDS, CALCULATED RISKS
    

      Walter established Cardinal by acquisition and spurred its growth through
      acquisition. His skill was not in the creation of brand-new businesses or
      industries but in the gluing together of existing pieces. As Walter
      himself told the industry journal 
      
        Modern Healthcare
      
       in 1999, "I don't think my expertise ever has been to start
      businesses up. What I want to focus on is finding good base businesses
      that I think I can improve" (April 19, 1999). Indeed, between 1983
      and 2001 Walter oversaw more than one hundred acquisitions; in 1996 he
      went as far as to state that acquisition was a line of business at
      Cardinal.
    

      Walter succeeded at the notoriously risky business of company-buying
      through a blend of ambition and conservatism. Friends and colleagues
      described him as intensely ambitious, both at work and at play—he
      was consistently ranked among the top five CEO golfers in the United
      States in the late 1990s and early 2000s—but he tempered his urge
      to get ahead with cautious deal-making. Once Cardinal had gained
      recognition as a national company, Walter instituted a policy of never
      acquiring businesses that were not ranked first or second in their market
      areas, shunning high-risk deals. He also took an approach to
      acquisition—first in food distribution and later in health
      care—that was plodding compared to those of other diversifiers. He
      only acquired companies that his existing customer base already depended
      on and trusted, thus continually increasing Cardinal's
      indispensability to those who relied upon it. Cardinal acquired one of
      every 50 companies it considered buying; Walters said in 2003 that the
      mark of successful risk takers was that they calculated the odds well.
    

      In 2003 
      
        Euromoney Institutional Investor
      
       characterized Walter as "methodical in the way he seeks out
      higher-margin opportunities that complement the core business"
      (January 2003). Lawrence Marsh, the senior vice president at Lehman
      Brothers in New York, said in 1999 in 
      
        Modern Healthcare
      
       that Walter and his team were "stellar in my book" because
      they
       took "calculated, prudent bets" (April 19, 1999). According
      to Walter, another guiding principle of his expansion strategy was to
      always acquire businesses with a higher profit margin than Cardinal
      already had. Yet in 2002, 56 percent of Cardinal's operating
      earnings still came from drug distribution, its least-profitable major
      asset, underlining the conservatism of Walter's acquisition
      philosophy.
    

      Walter never forgot his youthful loathing of the corporate culture at
      North American Rockwell. Even when his own company had become undeniably
      large, Walter adamantly maintained a smaller-business feeling. He allowed
      executives from acquired companies to retain a large degree of autonomy;
      as a result Cardinal became a conglomeration of small segments, with the
      people in charge of each segment given a high degree of authority and
      responsibility and asked to act quickly and decisively, as if they were
      the owners.
    

      BUMPS IN THE ROAD
    

      Walter's upward course was not without setbacks. In 1998 the
      Federal Trade Commission brought a successful antitrust suit against
      Cardinal's attempt to acquire Bergen Brunswig Corporation, the
      competing health-supplies distributor. The following year Walter
      unhesitatingly turned to planning the purchase of another distributor,
      Allegiance—despite the fact that on the strength of the Internet
      bubble of the late 1990s some analysts were saying online ordering would
      eliminate distributors altogether. When the Internet bubble burst at the
      end of the 20th century, Walter's actions were deemed more
      reasonable.
    

      In June 2002 Cardinal announced that it was buying Syncor International
      Corporation for $1.1 billion in a bid to expand its business in nuclear
      pharmaceuticals (radioactive materials used for diagnostic purposes in
      hospitals). Then the news broke that Syncor had made improper payments to
      state-owned health-care employees in Taiwan. After researching the matter,
      Walter and his team decided that the bribery had been small-scale and not
      connected with Syncor's main business; Walter gave the deal the
      go-ahead and the acquisition proved stable. Also in 2002 Walter was
      obligated to take a conference call with major investors to assure them
      that the fact that Arthur Andersen had been Cardinal's auditor did
      not mean that a Cardinal scandal was about to break. (Andersen had just
      been convicted of obstructing the federal Securities and Exchange
      Commission's investigation of its client bankrupt energy-giant
      Enron.)
    

      In March 2004, in the wake of a string of disasters involving
      overreporting of income by large corporations, Bristol-Meyers announced
      that it had incorrectly recorded incentives paid to Cardinal to accept
      excess inventory. Once again Walter's caution paid off: he was able
      to prove to Cardinal's investors that the company had only recorded
      revenues for merchandise actually sold to retailers and that there would
      be no need for restatements of income.
    

      Throughout this string of near disasters, Walter's attachment to
      basic business—comprising tangible goods and services, low debt,
      and straightforward accounting—stood Cardinal, its investors, and
      its employees (who owned 10 percent of the company) in good stead. As of
      2004 Cardinal was the world's largest provider of health-care
      products and services. Its success reflected to an unusual degree the
      cautious deal-making practices of its lifetime CEO Robert Walter.
      "He's one of the best managers I've ever
      seen," said Peter Lynch, the vice chairman of the
      investment-advisor arm of Fidelity Investments, in 
      
        Fortune
      
      , "and I've seen thousands" (April 14, 2003).

Robert D. Walter

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Robert D. Walter (born 1944) is an American businessman best known for his role in the creation of Cardinal Health.
Walter graduated from St. Charles Preparatory School and has a BA from Ohio University. After a brief and unhappy stint as an engineer, Walter attended Harvard Business School, where he received an MBA.[1]
In 1971 he purchased Cardinal Foods, a small Ohio food wholesaler, in a leveraged buyout. In 1979, the company acquired Bailey Drug Company and began wholesaling drugs. In subsequent years, the company experienced extraordinary growth, "one of a handful of large U.S. companies that had achieved earnings-per-share growth in excess of 20 percent for 15 years straight."[2] Cardinal Health is now a Fortune 100 company and one of the largest distributors of pharmaceuticals, health & beauty products, and hospital supplies in the United States.[3] In 2007, he was #14 on Fortune magazine's list of the 25 top-paid male executives, with total compensation of $42.7 million the previous year.[4] He retired from Cardinal Health on June 20, 2009.
He is married to Margaret "Peggy" Walter, who also attended Ohio University. The Walters have given support to the Ohio University community including Margaret Walter Hall, and to the Columbus Museum of Art.[5] Walter resides in Dublin, Ohio; Boca Raton, Florida; and Park City, Utah.

Robert D. Walter - Wikipedia





















 






Robert D. Walter

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Robert D. Walter (born 1944) is an American businessman best known for his role in the creation of Cardinal Health.
Walter graduated from St. Charles Preparatory School and has a BA from Ohio University. After a brief and unhappy stint as an engineer, Walter attended Harvard Business School, where he received an MBA.[1]
In 1971 he purchased Cardinal Foods, a small Ohio food wholesaler, in a leveraged buyout. In 1979, the company acquired Bailey Drug Company and began wholesaling drugs. In subsequent years, the company experienced extraordinary growth, "one of a handful of large U.S. companies that had achieved earnings-per-share growth in excess of 20 percent for 15 years straight."[2] Cardinal Health is now a Fortune 100 company and one of the largest distributors of pharmaceuticals, health & beauty products, and hospital supplies in the United States.[3] In 2007, he was #14 on Fortune magazine's list of the 25 top-paid male executives, with total compensation of $42.7 million the previous year.[4] He retired from Cardinal Health on June 20, 2009.
He is married to Margaret "Peggy" Walter, who also attended Ohio University. The Walters have given support to the Ohio University community including Margaret Walter Hall, and to the Columbus Museum of Art.[5] Walter resides in Dublin, Ohio; Boca Raton, Florida; and Park City, Utah.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
