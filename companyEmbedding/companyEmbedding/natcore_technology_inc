We are creating the next generation of solar cells. Our technology will change the world.
We are Natcore Technology. We’re a solar R&D company.
And we are creating technology that promises to make solar energy even more cost-competitive with energy derived from fossil fuels.
To reach that goal, we must attain the highest silicon cell efficiencies at the lowest cost. Our technology promises to do both.
So we’re changing how solar cells are made. We have attracted a team of scientists well known for their achievements in the solar industry. We’ve established exclusive licenses and/or joint research agreements with Rice University, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), Fraunhofer ISE and the University of Virginia. We’ve received 31 patents (with 34 more pending).
Natcore is aggressively developing two primary technologies:

Low-cost, all-back-contact solar cell structures.
Black Silicon cells.

We’ve not only achieved exciting new scientific advances in these technologies, we’re also now engaging partners who will help us commercialize them.
We plan to generate revenue from these technologies via licensing agreements, royalties and material sales agreements with solar cell manufacturers and equipment producers.
And through our Best-of-Breed program—wherein we leverage our knowledge to function as a consultant on the design and construction of solar cell and panel fabrication facilities and solar farms—we are now generating important revenue to support our R&D efforts.

Solar Overview


Making Solar Energy Economically Viable
Most people believe that it would take rich government subsidies to make solar energy cost-competitive with energy derived from fossil fuels. They believe it’s going to be that way for many years to come.
We think they’ll be proven wrong.
That’s because we’ve developed remarkable new technologies that can completely change the way solar cells are manufactured.
We’re using a proprietary laser technology to create the Natcore Foil Cell™, the first laser-processed, all-low-temperature solar cell using an aluminum foil laminate to realize an all-back-contact system.
In doing so, we’ve replaced high-cost silver with low-cost aluminum.
We’re also using black silicon technology to optimize low solar cell reflectance. We’ve eliminated the traditional thermal vacuum processes such as CVD and PECVD for making anti-reflective coatings, and we’ve eliminated the use of gold as a catalyst in etching silicon wafers.
The solar cell of tomorrow is already in our laboratory today. We are engineering a cell of higher quality and higher efficiency. It will be cleaner and less expensive than conventional solar cells.

President’s Message



Natcore has always been a good blend of business and science. Our scientific team develops things that others have not thought of while our business component ensures that there is a path to commercialization.
Our Best of Breed Consulting business is a direct result of the industry knowing about our technology and wanting to be part of it. We leveraged that interest into a consulting business that coordinates solar farm developers, cell manufacturers, panel manufacturers and builders.   Our relationships with developers have emphasized an important component of our technology that could have three great short-term benefits to Natcore with respect to commercialization and revenue.
Two of the benefits of our Foil Cell technology are obvious: higher efficiency and lower cost. A third benefit may be more subtle but apparently more important to the industry on a short-term basis. That third component is something called Cell-To-Module (CTM) energy loss.
A solar cell is a very sophisticated and delicate device. It is made in clean rooms with very low tolerances for error. This very sophisticated cell is then put into a very inefficient glass box — a solar panel — and that transition typically causes a 5%-10% energy loss in the cell. Back contact cells give much better (lower) CTM numbers, but they are normally expensive. Our cell approach, combined with a unique way that the cells can be joined in the solar panel, can virtually eliminate this Cell To-Module energy loss in an extremely cost effective way.
For a developer of large solar projects, like our projects in Australia and Vietnam, 5% to 10% more power has an enormous impact on the economics of a project. Developers have recently begun to urge us — quite aggressively — to begin producing larger cells that are appropriately sized to immediately integrate into panels. In other words, they want to quantify and realize the benefits of our CTM advantages as soon as possible.
As you know, our current cells are consistently yielding efficiencies of just under 21%. While these are higher efficiencies than are found in most current commercial cells, and while our projections show our technology will achieve efficiencies well into the mid-twenties at very low cost, we’re discovering that our unique Cell-To-Module advantage could provide a quicker and more direct path to commercialization and revenue.
We currently work with smaller cells in the lab because it is cost efficient and allows us shorter turn-around time in experiments. Our scientists are now doing what is necessary to move our technology to standard-size cells that could be used sooner in the industry.
The business side of our team is listening to the marketplace and what the industry wants. The scientific side is adjusting our priorities a bit to fill that need. Bottom line: Feedback from the industry continues to demonstrate that our truly unique technology will change the solar energy paradigm.
If you have any questions or comments, please let us know.

 Corporate Website: http://www.natcoresolar.com  [Latest Presentation] (DECEMBER 2016): http://www.natcoresolar.com/core/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Natcore-GTM-Presentation-12.8.16-NRev.pdf   NatcoreTechnology "NatcoreTechnology is a research and development company pioneering solar cells with improved efficiency and reduced cost. By combining the expertise of our scientists – who are among the most renowned in the solar community – with a well-equipped research facility, we are developing approaches that will define the next generation of cells. Our output is technology: our intellectual property is currently protected by 62 patents granted or pending. Natcore plans to move our technologies into manufacturing through partnerships that ultimately yield licensing and royalty revenue streams."  • Natcore is a dual-pronged business consisting of 1) commercialising technology (licensing, royalties, material sales) 2) international consulting for industrial scale solar facilities (Best-of-Breed Program).  The company has been funded via private placement for several years back in a purely R&D phase and now looks to turn the corner with revenue generation.    Primary Technology:   Rochester, N.Y., research and development center (19,000 sf with 8,000 sf clean room)  ♦ [Natcore Foil Cell] (All Back Contact Solar Cell): The cell is several technologies combined under the product name "Foil Cell". The structure uses aluminum instead of industry traditional silver, greatly reducing material costs. The patented low temperature laser process rids the need for expensive furnaces.       • Current Efficiency: 19.4% (Short term target of >20%)      • Early Phase Full Production Estimate: 22%      • Long Term Full Production Estimate: 24-26%  ♦ [Black Silicon]: The black silicon technology streamlines the path to low solar cell reflectance.  By reducing steps in the manufacturing process, costs are greatly reduced.   Technical Executive Summary:  "The vast majority of solar cells produced today employ front contacts—one of the cell’s electrical contacts is the familiar grid of metal lines on the front of a cell. Even though the grid lines are thin, they block light and thus reduce efficiency. These standard solar cells are also made with a thermally diffused emitter, requiring very high process temperatures (>800C). The combination of front contacts and thermally diffused emitters limit current cell efficiency to about 19%.  Recently, a 25.6% efficiency was reported – the highest efficiency ever reached for a silicon solar cell. The cell in question used only back contacts, thus blocking no light. It also used a silicon heterojunction (SHJ) emitter, eliminating high temperature diffusion steps. While the achievement showed the value of these approaches, the cell was produced using a complicated, high cost process. The goal then: produce a cell like that at low cost.  The Natcore Cell leverages laser processing and a revolutionary approach to contacting/metallizing the cell in order to drive out cost while getting to high efficiency.  Our design requires highly defined regions of heavily doped silicon in order to form the base contact of the solar cell. By using a powerful focused laser beam, small regions of the silicon surface can be melted in the presence of a specially applied dopant, allowing that dopant to penetrate the silicon matrix. In particular, Natcore scientists have discovered a method to laser-form these dopant regions while not disrupting the high quality emitter already present on the solar cell. The laser process is rapid, and can be performed in low capital equipment at atmospheric conditions.  Our approach to metallization is game changing. Silver is a staple of current solar cells, being used for its high conductivity and easy processing. However, it can represent from 30 to 50% of the fabrication cost of a solar cell. Our unique metallization approach relies upon a simple multilayer structure composed of aluminum foils. The use of aluminum alone permits great cost saving. However, there are two additional areas of cost saving with our approach. First of all, the metallization process, leveraging the worldwide volume of aluminum foil production, can have a very low capital cost and footprint. Secondly, the resulting cell architecture is ideal for subsequent incorporation into modules cheaply and with low cell-to-module (CTM) losses.  Natcore has specifically protected its laser back contacted cell approach with a number of patent filings covering the architecture, laser process, and general processing characteristics. Natcore’s rapid progress in this area is enabled by David Carlson, member of our Science Advisory Board and Charlie Gay, auxiliary scientific advisor. Both bring a recognized, extensive career in solar technology and business to the table."   ♦ Natcore makes solar energy cost-competitive by increasing efficiency and lowering cost.  ♦ In a solar cell industry where manufacturers are fighting for fractions of a percent improvement in performance or costs, Natcore’s new cells will offer cost/watt improvements likely well over 30% – a generational leap in performance that will essentially force adoption by the industry.  ♦ Natcore will have a very quick ramp-up to significant revenues, with virtually no capital expense and margins near 100%. This is because the company’s business model calls for licensing the technology to any and all comers, earning royalties on equipment, materials and every solar cell sold using the proprietary process.     International Solar Project Consulting (Best-of-Breed):  • Provide project financing and technology; • Design, develop, implement and bring solar plants to the turnkey phase; • Serve as supplier and promoter of the project; • Select suppliers, PV plant locations and EPC company    Projects in the Pipeline ♦ Belize: 10MW ♦ Australia: 30MW ♦ Vietnam 200MW (Multi Phase With State Party Interest in Manufacturing Facility) ♦ Middle East 1,000MW ♦ South Africa ♦ Ukraine/Moldova ♦ Philippines   Vietnam - Phase 1: 56.18MW (December 2016 Presentation)  Drone Aerial Image of Land  Project: • Total Investment: $65.5 Million • PPA: $0.112 kWh • Average Yearly Revenue: $9.3M (Recurring for 20 Years)  Estimated Fees to Natcore: 56.18MW - Phase 1 • Engagement Fee:$1.5M • Cost Plus $3.25M • Annual Partnership Participation (10%) 20 Year Term: $18.6M  200MW - All Phases • Engagement Fee:$6.0M • Cost Plus $13M • Annual Partnership Participation (10%) 20 Year Term: $74.4M   Natcore’s Scientific Staff:  Current and auxiliary advisory members boast some of the world’s top experts and authorities in photovoltaics, highlighted by:     Dr. David Levy (Director of Research & Technology) Dr. Levy earned his BSE in Chemical Engineering from the University of Pennsylvania and his PhD in Chemical Engineering, with a minor in Electrical Engineering, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He invented the atmospheric Spatial Atomic Layer Deposition process (SALD) while he was a Senior Research Scientist at Eastman Kodak, where he spent 20 years. With primary applications in the semiconductor industry, SALD is now a recognized area of research in the atomic layer deposition community. While working with air-free synthesis of nanoparticles, Dr. Levy also gained familiarity with quantum dot systems. The ability to create a three dimensional matrix of quantum dots is a critical step toward the formation of a fully functioning tandem cell, a principal goal of Natcore scientists. Dr. Levy has been granted 90 patents and has authored 11 peer-reviewed journal articles. He has been an invited presenter at meetings of the Materials Research Society and the American Vacuum Society.     Dr. Dennis Flood (former Chief of Photovolatic and Space Environments Branch, NASA)  Dennis Flood, PhD, is a Natcore co-founder. He has more than 30 years’ experience in developing solar cell and array technology for both space and terrestrial applications. At the NASA Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, he served for 15 years as Chief of the Photovoltaic and Space Environments Branch and led programs in advanced photovoltaic systems development.       Dr. Charlie Gay (former Director of U.S. National Renewable Energy Lab, president of Applied Solar at Applied Materials, chairman of technical advisory board of Sunpower)  He has 41 years of professional management, manufacturing and advanced technology experience in renewable energy and photovoltaics.

We are Natcore Technology. We’re a solar R&D company. And we are creating technology that promises to make solar energy even more cost-competitive with energy derived from fossil fuels. To reach that goal, we must attain the highest silicon cell efficiencies at the lowest cost. Our technology promises to do both. So we’re changing how solar cells are made. We have attracted a team of scientists well known for their achievements in the solar industry. We’ve established exclusive licenses and/or joint research agreements with Rice University, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), Fraunhofer ISE and the University of Virginia. We’ve received 27 patents (with 36 more pending).

                        About Us
                    


Natcore is aggressively developing two primary technologies:

Low-cost, all-back-contact solar cell structures.
Black Silicon cells.

We’ve not only achieved exciting new scientific advances in these technologies, we’re also now engaging partners who will help us commercialize them.
We plan to generate revenue from these technologies via licensing agreements, royalties and material sales agreements with solar cell manufacturers and equipment producers.
And through our Best-of-Breed program—wherein we leverage our knowledge to function as a consultant on the design and construction of solar cell and panel fabrication facilities and solar farms—we are now generating important revenue to support our R&D efforts.

In this message, I’ll bring you up to date on our technology improvements, our search for potential partners and our Best-of-Breed power plant opportunities.
Technology
Remember our mantra: increase the efficiency, lower the cost.
We are making progress with improved efficiencies in our laboratory by focusing most of our research efforts on monocrystalline silicon wafers because of their greater efficiency potential. (In fact, the solar industry is now quickly moving to monocrystalline for that reason.)
And we continue to simplify our process. That translates directly to reducing cost at competitive or improved efficiencies in the market.
One of the areas of improvement is our scientists have identified better light wavelengths for our laser process. As an example, infrared light, which cannot be seen by humans, is traditionally used in the laser process. Our scientists have found that this infrared light is only weakly absorbed by silicon, which limits the ability to precisely tailor laser pulses. As a result, they have created a new set of optical components that convert light to green, which is absorbed 100 times more effectively by the silicon. These optics allow us to use whichever wavelengths are needed and help push our progress further along.
Additionally, we are continually simplifying the process used to produce our aluminum foil bi-layer cells. We recently have demonstrated that by slight modifications of the composition of an important conductive layer, we eliminate a sequence of patterning steps that we have been using up until now. This simplification has a direct correlation to reducing costs.
Potential partners
The improvement in the foil bi-layer cells has added another dimension to our search for a partner whose scale and resources can help us reach the ultra-high-efficiency potential that our cells are capable of.
Until now, we’d been limiting our quest to cell manufacturers and other companies in the solar industry. But our advances with the Natcore Foil Cell™ makes us attractive to aluminum foil manufacturers who want to expand into new, high-margin markets.
By giving the rights to produce our proprietary foil to an aluminum company partner, we would also be giving them the opportunity to gain access to the solar industry. Included in our package would be some type of exclusivity in providing this unique foil in conjunction with license agreements to cell manufacturers. We believe that it is a much simpler sell to the aluminum companies at this stage of our development.
Best of breed
I continue to believe that our first important revenue will come from our Best of Breed program, which continues to capture the interest of major international projects. Recently I was hosted by the developers of the Belize project. I met all the partners and viewed the site for the proposed power facility, which is adjacent to the international airport that they are currently building. The funding for the solar project is part of the airport funding. This airport is currently 60% completed.
We are also currently negotiating agreements with and hope to be chosen by a developer who is known very well to us to participate in a multi-faceted facility in a Middle Eastern country. We are at a similar level in negotiations with a Southeast Asian country. These latter two projects are each in excess of 500 MW. Each has contingent financing; one of them also has a sovereign government guarantee.
 
I hope this gives you some idea of the significance of our unique cell technology as well as our flexibility in identifying potential markets, whether they be obvious or outside the box.
