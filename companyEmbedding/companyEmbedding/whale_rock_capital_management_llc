INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY
Our investment philosophy is specifically designed for the unique characteristics of the technology space with the goal of isolating the best opportunities for wealth creation while reducing risk.

While technology is subject to rapid change and extreme competition, our focus on understanding technology adoption cycles and identifying companies with very strong competitive advantages is key.
While many are focused on near term results, we seek to identify long-term underappreciated earnings power which often allows us to invest in great companies at attractive valuations.



We are looking for three key drivers to our investments:




PRODUCT CYCLE
Identify powerful new trends, product cycles and themes and map them to the S–Curve:
When technologies hit the mainstream, they inflect up the curve, creating several years of rapid and predictable growth.



COMPETITIVEADVANTAGE
Evaluate the companies exposed to the trend, focusing on strong competitive advantages:
While TMT can be extremely competitive, sometimes companies emerge with very wide moats.



UNDERAPPRECIATED EARNINGS POWER
S-Curve + competitive advantage drives exponential earnings growth.  The street can often miss this, allowing us to buy what we believe are great companies at bargain prices.

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for NIC (NASDAQ:EGOV) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Sell Rating, 5 Hold Ratings, 1 Buy RatingConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.00)Consensus Price Target: $19.67 (22.15% upside)
