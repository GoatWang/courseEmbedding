Endo to cut 875 jobs and close facilities in Alabama
Endo International PLC  said Friday it was cutting 875 jobs, which is about 18% of its workforce, as part of a restructuring aimed at cutting costs by up to $65 million a year. The pharmaceutical company said it will close manufacturing and distribution facilities in Huntsville, Ala. over the next 12-to-18 months, as a result of declining volumes of commoditized products. Endo expects to record restructuring charges of $325 million, including cash charges of $60 million. "Today's announced action enables a redeployment of investment from commoditized products to more differentiated capabilities and products that represent our core areas of future growth," said Chief Executive Paul Campanelli. The stock, which slipped 0.5% in premarket trade, has tumbled 25.2% year to date through Thursday, while SPDR S&P Pharmaceuticals ETF  has climbed 13.2% and the S&P 500  has gained 10.5%.

Endo will remove opioid from market, following FDA request
Endo International PLC  said on Thursday that it will voluntarily remove the opioid pain medication Opana ER from the market, in response to a Food and Drug Administration request last month. Endo expects an about $20 million pre-tax impairment charge in the second quarter "to write-off the remaining net book value of its Opana ER intangible asset." Opana ER sales amounted to about $160 million last year and nearly $36 million in the first quarter, the company said. Endo also said that it continues to believe in the drug's safety and efficacy when used as intended. Opana ER was reformulated in 2012 to prevent abuse through snorting or injecting. However, the drug was being abused after reformulation via injection, the FDA said in June. Public health consequences of that abuse included a serious outbreak of HIV and Hepatitis C and cases of a harmful blood disorder, the FDA said then. Endo shares declined 2.2% in afternoon trade, compared with a 0.5% decline in the S&P 500 . Shares have declined 1.2% over the last three months, compared with a 2.7% rise in the S&P 500 .

Collegium's stock jumps on belief its opioid drug will get a boost from a rival's woes
Shares of Collegium Pharmaceutical Inc.  shot up 10% in active morning trade Friday, amid expectations that the pain treatment maker will get a big boost from rival Endo International PLC's  misfortune. Late Thursday, the Food and Drug Administration asked Endo to "voluntarily" stop selling its opioid pain medication Opana ER, citing concerns that the drug's benefits may not outweigh the risks, as opioid abuse has reached "crisis" levels. That sent Endo's stock plunging 15%. Janney analyst Ken Trbovich said the removal of Opana ER means the near-500,000 prescriptions filled for the drug in the past year will be transferred to other products like Collegium's Xtampsa. "This provides meaningful potential upside to [Collegium's stock] and it should also help [Collegium's] messaging about Xtampza's superior abuse deterrent features because it highlights the unique nature of each product in the market," Trbovich wrote in a note to clients. Collegium's stock has shed 29.4% year to date, while Endo shares have slumped 28.7% and the S&P 500  has gained 9.2%.

FDA asks Endo to stop selling opioid, in first such move
Endo International  shares plummeted 13.6% after the close Thursday after the Food and Drug Administration said it has asked the company to stop selling its opioid pain medication, reformulated Opana ER. The FDA said that this is the first time it has done something like this with an opioid medication based on concerns about abuse. Opana ER was reformulated in 2012, amid a national opioid crisis that continues to this day, to prevent abuse through snorting or injecting, though the FDA didn't allow the company to label the product as potentially deterring abuse. But postmarketing data for Opana ER showed that abuse of the drug shifted from nasal to injection after reformulation, the FDA said, prompting the regulator to ask Endo to take it off the market. There have been public health consequences associated with injection abuse of the drug, the FDA said, including a serious outbreak of HIV and Hepatitis C and cases of a serious blood disorder. If Endo doesn't voluntarily stop selling Opana ER, the FDA said it plans to withdraw approval for the product. The regulator will continue to examine approved opioid pain medications and "take further actions as appropriate," it said. Endo shares have risen 27.6% over the last three months to $13.78, compared with a 3% rise in the S&P 500 .

	On July 21, 2017, the Registrant announced that after completing a comprehensive review of its manufacturing network, the Registrant will be ceasing operations and closing its manufacturing and distribution facilities in Huntsville, Alabama (the “2017 U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals restructuring initiative”). The closure of the facilities is expected to take place over the next 12 to 18 months. The Registrant’s Board of Directors approved the 2017 U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals restructuring initiative on July 18, 2017. The Huntsville locations have been impacted by declining volumes of commoditized products and these restructuring actions are intended to better match manufacturing capacity to projected future demand.




	As a result of the 2017 U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals restructuring initiative, the Registrant's workforce is expected to be reduced by approximately 875 positions, including approximately 35 open positions, and the Registrant expects to incur total pre-tax restructuring-related expenses of approximately $325 million, including total estimated cash outlays of approximately $60 million, substantially all of which will be paid by the end of 2018. The estimated restructuring charges consist of accelerated depreciation charges of approximately $165 million, asset impairment charges related to identifiable intangible assets and certain property, plant and equipment of approximately $90 million, charges to increase excess inventory reserves of approximately $10 million, employee separation, retention and other benefit-related costs of approximately $40 million and certain other charges of approximately $20 million. The Registrant expects to realize approximately $55 million to $65 million in annual net run rate pre-tax cost savings by the fourth quarter of 2018.




	Any charges associated with the 2017 U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals restructuring initiative will be included in the U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals segment. Associated impairment charges, charges to increase excess inventory reserves and certain other charges will be recorded during the second quarter of 2017 and reported in the Registrant's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, expected to be filed no later than August 9, 2017. Employee separation, retention and certain other employee benefit-related costs will be expensed ratably over the requisite service period. Other costs that will be incurred including, but not limited to, contract termination fees and product technology transfer costs, will be expensed as incurred.




	The estimated expenses, charges, costs and savings noted above are subject to a number of assumptions. Actual results may differ materially as a result of various important factors, including the risks and uncertainties described under the heading “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in the copy of the press release included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, which are incorporated by reference herein.

	Endo to Restructure Manufacturing Network














	DUBLIN, July 21, 2017 --


	Endo International plc (NASDAQ: ENDP) today announced that after completing a comprehensive review of its manufacturing network, the Company will be ceasing operations and closing its manufacturing and distribution facilities in Huntsville, Alabama. The closure of the facilities is expected to take place over the next 12 to 18 months. The Huntsville location has been impacted by declining volumes of commoditized products and these restructuring actions are intended to better match manufacturing capacity to projected future demand.




	“Endo’s key priorities include building our product portfolio and technological capabilities for the future. Today’s announced action enables a redeployment of investment from commoditized products to more differentiated capabilities and products that represent our core areas of future growth,” said Paul Campanelli, President and CEO of Endo.




	“I would like to recognize the efforts and hard work of those who have been impacted by this difficult decision and thank them for their valuable contributions to our Company,” Mr. Campanelli added.




	These restructuring actions are expected to reduce Endo’s workforce by approximately 875 positions (including approximately 35 open positions) and to result in pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $325 million, including approximately $60 million of cash charges. The remaining estimated non-cash charges consist primarily of accelerated depreciation of approximately $165 million and intangible asset and property, plant and equipment impairment charges of approximately $90 million. Endo expects to realize approximately $55 million to $65 million in annual net run rate pre-tax cost savings by the fourth quarter of 2018.





















	About Endo International plc




	Endo International plc (NASDAQ: ENDP) is a highly focused generics and specialty branded pharmaceutical company delivering quality medicines to patients in need through excellence in development, manufacturing and commercialization. Endo has global headquarters in Dublin, Ireland, and U.S. headquarters in Malvern, PA. Learn more at www.endo.com.









	Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements





	This press release contains "forward-looking statements," including, but not limited to, statements by Mr. Campanelli and statements regarding the restructuring, including the expected closing of the Huntsville manufacturing and distribution facilities and the potential impact of the restructuring, expected cost savings and anticipated use of such cost savings on the Company's business and future results. Because forecasts are inherently estimates that cannot be made with precision, the Company’s performance may differ materially from its expectations, estimates and targets, and the Company often does not know what the actual results will be until after the end of the applicable reporting period. Therefore, the Company will not report or comment on its progress during a current quarter except through public announcement. Any statement made by others with respect to progress during a current quarter cannot be attributed to the Company. All forward-looking statements in this press release reflect the Company’s current analysis of information and represent the Company’s judgment only as of the date of this press release. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially from the Company’s expectations. Risks and uncertainties include, among other things, general industry and market conditions; technological advances and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in the research and development and regulatory processes, including regulatory decisions, product recalls, withdrawals and other unusual items; challenges related to product marketing, such as the unpredictability of market acceptance for new products and/or the acceptance of new indications for such products; inconsistency of treatment results among patients; potential difficulties in manufacturing; the outcome of litigation, settlement discussions or other adverse proceedings; general economic conditions; and governmental laws and regulations affecting domestic and foreign operations. The Company expressly disclaims any intent or obligation to update these forward-looking statements except as





















	required by law. Additional information concerning these and other risk factors can be found in the Company’s periodic reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and in Canada on the System for Electronic Data Analysis and Retrieval (“SEDAR”), including current reports on Form 8-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and annual reports on Form 10-K.

Acquisitions[edit]
In 2009, Endo bought Indevus Pharmaceuticals to diversify into endocrinology and oncology.[2] The company entered the male hypogonadism market later in 2010 with Fortesta 2% gel.[2]
In November 2013, Endo agreed to purchase Paladin Labs Inc for about $1.6 billion to gain access to the Canadian market as well as expand into emerging markets.[3][4]
In October 2014, Endo said it would buy Auxilium Pharmaceuticals for $2.6 billion.[5]
In 2015, Endo acquired the specialty generics and sterile injectables company Par Pharmaceutical for $8.05 billion.[6]
Acquisition attempts[edit]
In early 2014, Endo sought to acquire NuPathe, a speciality pharmaceutical developer, for US$105,000,000.[7] However, Teva prevailed in this acquisition with a substantially higher bid.[8]

	FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS




	Statements contained or incorporated by reference in this document contain information that includes or is based on “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. These statements, including estimates of future revenues, future expenses, future net income and future net income per share, contained in the section titled “


	Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations


	,” which is included in this document, are subject to risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements include the information concerning our possible or assumed results of operations. We have tried, whenever possible, to identify such statements by words such as “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “estimates,” “plan,” “projected,” “forecast,” “will,” “may” or similar expressions. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections about the growth of our business, our financial performance, and the development of our industry. Because these statements reflect our current views concerning future events, these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Investors should note that many factors, as more fully described in


	Part I, Item 1A


	 of this report under the caption “Risk Factors”, and as otherwise enumerated herein, could affect our future financial results and could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements contained or incorporated by reference in this document.




	We do not undertake any obligation to update our forward-looking statements after the date of this document for any reason, even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future, except as may be required under applicable securities law. You are advised to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and with securities regulators in Canada on the System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval (SEDAR). Also note that, in


	Part I, Item 1A


	 we provide a cautionary discussion of the risks, uncertainties and possibly inaccurate assumptions relevant to our business. These are factors that, individually or in the aggregate, we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results. We note these factors for investors as permitted by Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. You should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, you should not consider this to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties.

	PART I










	Item 1.


	        


	Business








	Overview




	Endo International plc is an Ireland-domiciled, generics and specialty branded pharmaceutical company. We aim to be the premier partner to healthcare professionals and payment providers, delivering an innovative suite of generic and branded drugs to meet patients’ needs.


	Unless otherwise indicated or required by the context, references throughout to “Endo,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us” refer to financial information and transactions of Endo Health Solutions Inc. (EHSI) and its consolidated subsidiaries prior to February 28, 2014 and Endo International plc and its consolidated subsidiaries thereafter.




	The Company’s focus is on U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals, U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals and International Pharmaceuticals and we target areas where we can build a leading position. Endo uses a differentiated operating model based on a lean and nimble structure, the rational allocation of capital and an emphasis on research and development for high-value targets. We believe this operating model and the execution of our corporate strategy will enable Endo to create shareholder value over the long-term.




	While Endo’s primary focus will be on organic growth, we will evaluate and, where appropriate, execute on opportunities to expand through the acquisition of products and companies in areas that will serve patients and customers and that we believe will offer above average growth characteristics and attractive margins.




	On October 31, 2013, Endo International plc was incorporated in Ireland as a private limited company and re-registered effective February 18, 2014 as a public limited company. Endo International plc was established for the purpose of facilitating the business combination between EHSI and Paladin Labs Inc. (Paladin). On February 28, 2014, the Company, through a Canadian subsidiary, acquired all of the shares of Paladin and a U.S. subsidiary of the Company merged with and into EHSI, with EHSI surviving the merger. As a result of these transactions, the former shareholders of EHSI and Paladin became the shareholders of Endo International plc and both EHSI and Paladin became indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company.




	We operate in three business segments which are U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals, U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals and International Pharmaceuticals. Our segments are further discussed in


	Note 6. Segment Results


	 in the


	Consolidated Financial Statements


	 included in


	Part IV, Item 15 of this report "Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules"


	 and in


	Item 7 of this report "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"


	 under the caption “


	Business Segment Results Review


	.”




	On September 25, 2015, we acquired Par Pharmaceutical Holdings, Inc. (Par), which develops, licenses, manufactures, markets and distributes innovative and cost-effective pharmaceuticals that help improve patient quality of life. Par focuses on first-to-file or first-to-market opportunities and high-barrier-to-entry products that are difficult to formulate, difficult to manufacture, or that face complex legal and regulatory challenges. The Company’s U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals segment, which was formed through a series of acquisitions including Par, Generics International (US Parent), Inc. (formerly doing business as Qualitest Pharmaceuticals (Qualitest)), Boca Pharmacal LLC (Boca) and DAVA Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (DAVA), now collectively doing business as Par Pharmaceutical, is the fourth largest U.S. generics company based on market share.




	Our


	U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals


	 portfolio, which accounted for


	64%


	,


	51%


	 and


	48%


	 of total revenues in


	2016


	,


	2015


	 and


	2014


	, respectively, currently consists of a differentiated product portfolio including tablets, capsules, powders, injectables, liquids, nasal sprays, ophthalmics and patches.




	On January 29, 2015, we acquired Auxilium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Auxilium), a fully integrated specialty pharmaceutical company with a focus on developing and commercializing innovative products for specific patients’ needs in orthopedics, dermatology and other therapeutic areas. Auxilium was absorbed into our legacy branded business along with branded assets obtained from other acquisitions, including Par, to form our current U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals segment. We have a portfolio of products offered by our


	U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals




	segment that includes established brand names such as Lidoderm



	®



	, OPANA



	®



	 ER, Voltaren



	®



	 Gel, Percocet

	, Aveed



	®



	, Supprelin



	®



	 LA and XIAFLEX



	®



	, among others. Our branded pharmaceuticals comprised approximately


	29%


	,


	39%


	 and


	41%


	 of our total revenues in


	2016


	,


	2015


	 and


	2014


	, respectively.

	The International Pharmaceuticals segment, which accounted for


	7%


	,


	10%


	 and


	11%


	 of total revenues in


	2016


	,


	2015


	 and


	2014


	, respectively, includes a variety of specialty pharmaceutical products for the Canadian, Latin American, South African and world markets, which we acquired in the Paladin acquisition in February 2014, including Litha Healthcare Group Limited (Litha) in South Africa, in the Grupo Farmacéutico Somar, Sociedad Anónima Promotora de Inversión de Capital Variable (Somar) acquisition in July 2014 and through the acquisition of certain Aspen Holdings assets in October 2015 (the Aspen Asset Acquisition). Paladin’s key products serve growing therapeutic areas, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), pain, women’s health and oncology. Somar develops, manufactures and markets high-quality generic, branded generic and over-the-counter products across key market segments including dermatology and anti-infectives. Litha is a diversified healthcare group providing services, products and solutions to public and private hospitals, pharmacies, general and specialist practitioners, as well as government healthcare programs. During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company initiated a process to sell its Litha Healthcare Group Limited and related Sub-Sahara African business assets (Litha) and on February 27, 2017, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell Litha to Acino Pharma AG. The assets and liabilities of Litha are classified as held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2016.




	Across all of our businesses, we generated total revenues of


	$4.01 billion


	,


	$3.27 billion


	 and


	$2.38 billion


	 in


	2016


	,


	2015


	 and


	2014


	, respectively.




	On February 24, 2016, the Board of Directors resolved to wind-down the Company’s Women’s Health Business (formerly part of our American Medical Systems Holdings, Inc. (AMS) business) (referred to herein as Astora) as it did not align with the Company’s strategic direction and to reduce Astora’s exposure to mesh-related product liability. Astora ceased business operations on March 31, 2016 and completed a wind-down process during 2016 that included, among other things, assisting physician-customers in transitioning to alternative products.

	Our Strategy




	Endo’s strategy is to focus on our core assets, a leading U.S. generics business and a specialty branded pharmaceutical business, that deliver high quality medicines to patients through excellence in development, manufacturing, and commercialization. Through a lean and efficient operating model, we are committed to serving patients and customers while continuing to innovate and provide products that make a difference in the lives of patients. We strive to maximize shareholder value by adapting to market realities and customer needs.




	We are committed to driving organic growth at attractive margins by improving execution, optimizing cash flow and leveraging our market position, while maintaining a streamlined cost structure throughout each of our businesses. Specific areas of management’s focus include:













	•






	U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals


	: Capitalizing on encouraging demand trends for a differentiated product portfolio and focusing on developing or acquiring high-barrier-to-entry products, including first-to-file or first-to-market opportunities that are difficult to formulate, difficult to manufacture or face complex legal and regulatory challenges.
















	•






	U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals


	: Accelerating performance of organic growth drivers in our Specialty portfolio, increasing profitability from our mature brands and investing in key pipeline development opportunities.
















	•






	International Pharmaceuticals


	: Operating in high growth business segments with durable revenue streams and where physicians play a significant role in choosing the course of therapy and expanding distribution of certain of our generic and branded products outside of the U.S.







	We remain committed to strategic R&D across each business unit. Going forward, while our primary focus will be on organic growth, we will evaluate and, where appropriate, execute on opportunities to expand through acquisitions of products and companies.








	Our Competitive Strengths




	To successfully execute our strategy, we must continue to capitalize on our following core strengths:




	Experienced and dedicated management team.


	 Through the acquisition of Par, we have obtained a highly skilled and customer focused management team that is now in critical leadership positions across all of Endo. Our senior management team has extensive experience in the pharmaceutical industry and a proven track record of developing businesses and value creation. This experience includes improving business performance through organic revenue growth and through identifying, consummating and integrating licensing and acquisition opportunities.




	Focus on the differentiated products of our generics business.


	 We develop high-barrier-to-entry generic products, including first-to-file or first-to-market opportunities that are difficult to formulate, difficult to manufacture or face complex legal and regulatory challenges. We believe products with these characteristics will face a lesser degree of competition and therefore provide longer product life cycles and higher profitability than commodity generic products. Our business model continues to focus on being the lowest-cost producer of products in categories with higher barriers to entry and lower levels of competition by leveraging operational efficiency. Our


	U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals


	 segment is focused in categories where there are fewer challenges from low-cost operators.




	Operational excellence.


	Through our acquisition of Par, we have strategically enhanced the efficiency, effectiveness, and quality of our U.S. Generics manufacturing capabilities across a diversified array of dosage forms. We believe our comprehensive suite of technology, manufacturing and development competencies increases the likelihood of success in commercializing high-barrier-to-entry products and obtaining first-to-file and first-to-market status on future products, yielding more sustainable market share and profitability. We believe that our competitive advantages include our integrated team-based approach to product development that combines our formulation, regulatory, legal, manufacturing and commercial capabilities; our ability to introduce new generic equivalents for brand-name drugs; our quality and cost-effective production; our ability to meet customer expectations; and the breadth of our existing generic product portfolio offerings. Through our recent strategic assessment, we have taken further steps to optimize our generic and specialty branded product portfolios and now look to capitalize on a much stronger and durable in-line product portfolio and R&D pipeline. We are focused only on those marketed products that deliver acceptable returns on investment, thereby leveraging our existing platform to drive operational efficiency.




	Growth of our branded Specialty products while leveraging the strength of our established brands portfolio.


	 We have assembled a portfolio of branded prescription products offered by our


	U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals


	 segment to treat and manage conditions in urology, urologic oncology, endocrinology, pain and orthopedics. Our Specialty products include: XIAFLEX



	®



	 for the treatment of Peyronie’s disease and XIAFLEX



	®



	 for Dupuytren’s contracture, Supprelin



	®



	 LA for Central Precocious Puberty, Nascobal



	®



	used as a supplement to treat vitamin B



	12



	 deficiency and Aveed



	®



	 and Testopel



	®



	 for testosterone replacement therapy.






	Our established branded products also include: Lidoderm



	®



	, OPANA



	®



	 ER, Voltaren



	®



	 Gel, Percocet



	®



	, Fortesta

	Continuing proactive diversification of our business.


	 We have executed a number of corporate acquisitions to diversify our business and divested certain other assets to become a highly focused generics and specialty branded pharmaceutical company. Our acquisitions of Paladin and Auxilium have enhanced our branded pharmaceutical research and development pipeline. The acquisition of Par created critical mass and added scale in our generics business while enhancing and expanding our capabilities in Paragraph IV products, complex dosage forms and research and development. As a result, we have redefined our position in the healthcare marketplace. Going forward, our primary focus will be on organic growth. However, we will evaluate and, where appropriate, execute on opportunities to expand through acquisitions of products and companies in areas that will serve patients and customers and that we believe will offer above average growth characteristics and attractive margins. In particular, we look to continue to enhance our product lines by acquiring or licensing rights to additional products and regularly evaluating selective acquisition opportunities.




	Research and development expertise.


	 Our research and development efforts are focused on the development of a balanced, diversified portfolio of innovative and clinically differentiated products. The acquisition of Auxilium added multiple, strategically-aligned programs to our branded pharmaceutical research and development pipeline with the addition of XIAFLEX



	®



	. Through our U.S. Generics business, we seek out and develop high-barrier-to-entry generic products, including first-to-file or first-to-market opportunities. We remain committed to research and development across each business unit with a particular focus on assets with inherently lower risk profiles and clearly defined regulatory pathways. Our current research and development pipeline consists of products in various stages of development. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, our


	U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals


	 segment has over


	200


	 products in our pipeline, which included approximately


	120


	 Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) pending with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) representing approximately


	$32.0 billion


	 of combined annual sales for the corresponding branded products in 2016, including


	35


	 potential first-to-file and


	four


	 first-to-market opportunities. In addition, we have submitted applications for regulatory approval of various products in our international markets. For a more detailed description of our development pipeline, see “


	Select Products in Development


	.”




	At February 21, 2017, our research and development and regulatory affairs staff consisted of


	1,172


	 employees, based primarily in Huntsville, Alabama, Chestnut Ridge, New York, Chennai, India, at our global headquarters in Dublin, Ireland and at our U.S. headquarters in Malvern, Pennsylvania.




	Targeted sales and marketing infrastructure.


	 Our sales and marketing activities focus on the promotion of our Specialty product portfolio. We market our products directly to physicians through a dedicated sales force of


	over 250


	 individuals, the majority of which are in the United States. We market our products to specialty physicians, including those specializing in urology, orthopedics, neurology, surgery and pediatric endocrinology. Our sales force also targets retail pharmacies and other healthcare professionals. We distribute our products through independent wholesale distributors, but we also sell directly to retailers, clinics, government agencies, doctors, independent retail and specialty pharmacies and independent specialty distributors. Our marketing policy is designed to provide that products and relevant, appropriate medical information are immediately available to physicians, pharmacies, hospitals, public and private payers, and appropriate healthcare professionals. We work to gain access to healthcare authority, pharmacy benefit managers and managed care organizations’ formularies (lists of recommended or approved medicines and other products), including Medicare Part D plans and reimbursement lists by demonstrating the qualities and treatment benefits of our products within their approved indications.




	Cash flow from operations.


	 We have historically generated cash flow from operations due to a unique combination of strong brand equity and attractive margins. While we expect our core business to continue to generate significant cash flow from operations, these cash flows have been adversely impacted and may continue to be adversely impacted by certain payments related to mesh legal settlements and other items. For the year ended


	December 31, 2016


	, we generated


	$524.4 million


	 of cash from operations. This was primarily driven by U.S. Federal tax refunds received of


	$760.0 million


	 and increased revenues. Partially offsetting these sources of cash are significant pre-tax cash outlays made during 2016, including


	$1,195.9 million


	 of previously accrued mesh-related product liability and other litigation matters payments,


	$97.9 million


	 of cash paid related to restructuring initiatives and


	$68.2 million


	 of transaction costs and certain integration costs.




	We expect to continue to maintain sufficient liquidity to give us flexibility to make investments in our business and to service our liabilities, including our mesh-related obligations. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, we had


	$519.5 million


	 of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities and up to


	$997.4 million


	 of availability under the revolving credit facilities. In addition, at


	December 31, 2016


	, our restricted cash and cash equivalents includes


	$276.0 million


	 held in Qualified Settlement Funds for mesh product liability settlement agreements, which are expected to be paid to qualified claimants within the next twelve months.








	Our Areas of Focus




	Generic Pharmaceuticals Market




	Our


	U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals


	 segment develops, licenses, manufactures, markets and distributes innovative and cost-effective pharmaceuticals with a focus on first-to-file or first-to-market opportunities and high-barrier-to-entry products that are difficult to formulate, difficult to manufacture, or that face complex legal and regulatory challenges.

	Table of Contents









	We sell generic products primarily in the United States across multiple therapeutic categories, including pain management, urology, central nervous system disorders, immunosuppression, oncology, women’s health and cardiovascular disease markets, among others. Product dosage forms and delivery systems include solid oral extended-release, solid oral immediate-release and abuse-resistant products, as well as alternative dosage forms such as liquids, semi-solids, patches, powders, ophthalmics, sprays, and sterile injectable products.




	Our largest


	U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals


	 manufacturing sites are in Chestnut Ridge, New York; Huntsville, Alabama; Irvine, California; Rochester, Michigan; and Chennai, India; which handle the production, assembly, quality assurance testing and packaging of our products.  We estimate that, for the products we manufacture, our U.S. facilities contributed over


	95%


	 of our manufacturing production based on revenue compared to fewer than


	5%


	 contributed by our facility in India.




	Refer to the Products Overview section below for additional information on our U.S. Generics Pharmaceutical products.




	Branded Pharmaceutical Products Markets




	Specialty Pharmaceuticals Market




	Endo commercializes a number of products within the market served by specialty distributors and specialty pharmacies, and in which healthcare practitioners (HCPs) can purchase and bill payors directly (the buy and bill market). Our treatment offerings currently are in two distinct areas: Urology, which focuses mainly on XIAFLEX



	®



	 for the treatment of Peyronie’s disease; and in Orthopedics/Pediatric Endocrinology, focusing on XIAFLEX



	®



	 for Dupuytren’s contracture and Supprelin



	®



	LA for Central Precocious Puberty (CPP).




	Peyronie's Disease (PD)—


	PD is a condition that involves the development of collagen plaque, or scar tissue, on the shaft of the penis. The scar tissue, known as a Peyronie's plaque, may harden and reduce flexibility, which may cause bending or arching of the penis during erection. PD can result in varying degrees of penile curvature deformity and disease bother, which encompasses concern about erection appearance, erection pain and the impact of PD on intercourse and on frequency of intercourse. PD is a disease with an initial inflammatory component. This inflammatory phase is poorly understood with a somewhat variable disease course and spontaneous resolution occurring in an estimated


	20%


	 of cases. After approximately 12 months of disease, the disease is reported to often develop into a more chronic, stable phase. The incidence of PD is estimated between


	3%


	 and


	9%


	 of the population; however the disease is believed to be underdiagnosed and undertreated.




	Dupuytren's Contracture (DC)—


	DC is a progressive condition that limits hand function, diminishes quality of life, and may ultimately disable the hand through the inability to move or straighten one’s finger or fingers. It is caused by an abnormal buildup of collagen. In people with DC, this collagen builds up over time and can thicken into a rope-like cord in the palm that contracts the finger. DC is a genetic condition and the incidence of DC is estimated to be between


	3%


	 and


	9%


	 of the population among adult Caucasians. DC is more common in men than in women, and increases in incidence with age.




	Central Precocious Puberty (CPP)—


	Precocious puberty is defined as the onset of developmental signs of sexual maturation earlier than would be expected based on population norms. This is typically delineated as puberty onset before eight years in girls and nine years in boys. In the most common form of CPP, sexual maturation proceeds from a premature activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. The HPG axis is active during infancy, dormant during childhood, and reactivated at the onset of puberty. The epidemiology of CPP is somewhat nebulous, with a commonly cited prevalence range of one in 5,000 to one in 10,000 children. CPP is known to occur more frequently in girls than in boys and has different predominant causes for each sex. Idiopathic CPP, without an identifiable predisposing condition, accounts for the majority of cases of precocious puberty in girls, but is less frequent in boys. Central nervous system findings such as tumors and congenital malformations are more frequently observed in boys who present with central precocious puberty. It is estimated that two thirds of precocious puberty cases in boys are due to neurological abnormalities. The likelihood of an organic cause for CPP is greater in patients who present at younger ages.




	Urology Market




	Endo has a number of key treatment offerings within the urology markets, specifically the men’s health sector with testosterone replacement therapies (TRT).




	In the U.S. alone, the prevalence of hypogonadism is approximately


	8%


	 of men above 50 years of age, however, only approximately


	9%


	 of those affected are currently being treated. By 2025, it is estimated there will be approximately


	6.5 million


	 American men 30-80 years of age who are diagnosed with androgen deficiency. Hypogonadism, or low testosterone, is under diagnosed and under treated. Factors contributing to this include a lack of screening for low testosterone and the perceived risk of prostate cancer associated with current treatment strategies. In the U.S., TRT sales were approximately


	$1.9 billion


	 in


	2016


	. For TRT, our treatment offerings include the long-acting products Aveed



	®



	, which was launched in March 2014 and TESTOPEL



	®



	. In addition, our TRT treatment offerings include our gel products such as Fortesta



	®



	 Gel and the authorized generic of Fortesta



	®



	 Gel, which launched in September 2014, and Testim



	®



	.

	Pain Management Market




	Endo has a number of key treatment offerings within the Pain Management Market. Our treatment offerings currently are in two key areas: Chronic Pain, including OPANA



	®



	 ER and Percocet



	®



	 in the opioid analgesics segment, and Lidoderm



	®



	, which is for the relief of pain associated with post-herpetic neuralgia; and Osteoarthritis (OA) Pain, which is treated with Voltaren



	®



	 Gel.




	In December 2016, Endo announced that it was returning BELBUCA



	TM



	to BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc. (BDSI). As a result of this announcement, Endo restructured its U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals segment sales organization, which will allow the Company to focus efforts and resources more fully on its core U.S. Branded assets, including XIAFLEX



	®



	 in the approved indications and the cellulite development program. The Company’s legacy pain portfolio products, including OPANA



	®



	 ER and Percocet



	®



	, among others, will be managed as mature brands. The restructuring was comprised of certain cost savings initiatives, including the elimination of an approximate 375-member U.S. Branded pain field sales force.




	International Pharmaceuticals Market




	Our International Pharmaceuticals segment includes a variety of specialty pharmaceutical and branded generic products for the Canadian, Latin American, South African and non-U.S. markets. During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company initiated a process to sell its Litha and related Sub-Sahara African business assets and on February 27, 2017, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell Litha to Acino Pharma AG.








	Products Overview




	U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals




	The U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals segment, which comprised


	64%


	 of the Company’s consolidated revenues for the year-ended December 31, 2016, consists of a portfolio of over


	250


	 generic prescription product families focused in the areas of pain management, urology, central nervous system (CNS) disorders, immunosuppression, oncology, women’s health and cardiovascular disease markets, among others. Generic drugs are the pharmaceutical and therapeutic equivalents of branded products and are generally marketed under their generic (chemical) names rather than by brand names. Typically, a generic drug may not be marketed until the expiration of applicable patent(s) on the corresponding branded product, unless a resolution of patent litigation results in an earlier opportunity to enter the market. Generic drugs are the same as branded products in dosage form, safety, efficacy, route of administration, quality, performance characteristics and intended use, but they are sold generally at prices below those of the corresponding branded products. Generic drugs provide a cost-effective alternative for consumers, while maintaining the same high quality, efficacy, safety profile, purity and stability of the branded product.




	An ANDA is required to be filed and approved by the FDA in order to manufacture a generic drug for sale in the United States (except in the case of authorized generics, described further below). We sell generic products primarily in the United States across multiple therapeutic categories. An ANDA that is the first ANDA filed containing a patent challenge to the corresponding branded product (a first-to-file product or a Paragraph IV product) offers the opportunity for 180 days of generic marketing exclusivity if we are successful in litigating the patent challenge and receive final FDA approval of the product. A first-to-market product refers to a product that is the first marketed generic equivalent of a branded product for reasons apart from statutory marketing exclusivity, such as the generic equivalent of a branded product that is difficult to formulate or manufacture. We target these types of market opportunities to mitigate risks from competitive pressure commonly associated with commoditized generic products.




	The timing of final FDA approval of ANDA applications depends on a variety of factors, including whether the applicant challenges any listed patents for the drug and whether the manufacturer of the reference listed drug is entitled to one or more regulatory exclusivity periods, during which the FDA is prohibited from approving generic equivalents. In certain circumstances, a regulatory exclusivity period can extend beyond the life of a patent, and thus block ANDAs from being approved until after the patent expiration date. The time required to obtain FDA approval of ANDAs for a new product varies in time, generally requiring a minimum of 10 months following submission of the ANDA to FDA, but could also take several years from the date of application.




	We have a generics portfolio across an extensive range of dosage forms and delivery systems, including immediate and extended release oral solids (tablets, orally disintegrating tablets, capsules and powders), injectables, liquids, nasal sprays, ophthalmics (which are sterile pharmaceutical preparations administered for ocular conditions) and transdermal patches (which are medicated adhesive patches designed to deliver the drug through the skin).




	We have development, manufacturing and distribution capabilities in the rapidly growing U.S. market for sterile drug products, such as injectable products, ophthalmics, and sterile vial and hormonal handling capabilities. These capabilities afford us a broader and more diversified product portfolio and a greater selection of targets for potential development. We target products with limited competition for reasons such as manufacturing complexity or the market size, which make our sterile products a key growth driver of our generics portfolio and complementary to our other generic product offerings.

	Authorized generics are generic versions of branded drugs licensed by brand drug companies under a New Drug Application (NDA) and marketed as generics. Authorized generics do not face regulatory barriers to introduction and are not prohibited from sale during the 180-day marketing exclusivity period granted to the first-to-file ANDA applicant. The sale of authorized generics adversely impacts the market share of a generic product that has been granted 180 days of marketing exclusivity. Our recent authorized generics include lidocaine patch 5% (Lidoderm



	®



	), metoprolol succinate ER (Toprol-XL



	®



	), budesonide (Entocort



	®



	 EC), and diclofenac sodium gel (Voltaren



	®



	 Gel). We believe we are a partner of choice to larger brand companies seeking an authorized generics distributor for their branded products. We have recently been the authorized generic distributor for such companies as AstraZeneca plc, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, and Merck & Co., Inc.

	The U.S. Generics Base revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 in the table above includes revenue for New Launches and Alternative Dosages. We began tracking New Launches and Alternative Dosages for the year ended December 31, 2015. There was no Sterile Injectables revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014.







	U.S. Generics Base is comprised of more than


	200


	 solid oral-extended release, solid oral-immediate release and pain/controlled substances products. This category includes the antidepressant bupropion XL and the portfolio of opioid-containing products such as hydrocodone bitartrate and acetaminophen tablets.




	Sterile Injectables is comprised of high-barrier-to-entry injectable products that are generally difficult to manufacture, including Vasostrict



	®



	, the first and only vasopressin injection product approved by the FDA. We have been issued a patent relating to Vasostrict



	®



	 by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO). This patent expires in January 2035 and was submitted to the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (known as the Orange Book) on June 28, 2016. The Orange Book listing requires any ANDA applicant seeking FDA approval for a generic version of Vasostrict



	®



	 prior to expiration of the patent to notify us of its ANDA filing before it can obtain FDA approval. Any ANDA filer seeking approval prior to patent expiry whose application was not received prior to submission of the patent information would be subject to a 30-month stay of marketing approval by the FDA upon our initiation of Hatch-Waxman litigation against the ANDA filer within the statutory time period.




	New Launches and Alternative Dosages is comprised of liquids, semi-solids, patches, powders, ophthalmics, sprays and new product launches. Products are included in New Launches during the calendar year of launch and the subsequent calendar year such that the period of time any product will be considered a New Launch will range from thirteen to twenty-four months. Material products launched in 2016 include ezetimibe tablets (generic version of Zetia

	Pain Management




	Lidoderm



	®



	.


	 Lidoderm



	®



	 was launched in September 1999. A topical patch product containing lidocaine, Lidoderm



	®



	 was the first FDA approved product for the relief of the pain associated with post-herpetic neuralgia, a condition thought to result after nerve fibers are damaged during a case of Herpes Zoster (commonly known as shingles). In May 2012, we entered into a settlement and license agreement with Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Watson), subsequently acquired by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (Teva), which allowed Watson to launch its lidocaine patch 5%, a generic version of Lidoderm



	®



	 on September 15, 2013. In May 2014, the Company's 


	U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals


	 segment launched its authorized generic of Lidoderm



	®



	. In August 2015, Mylan, Inc. (Mylan) launched a generic version of Lidoderm



	®



	.




	OPANA



	®



	 ER


	. OPANA



	®



	 ER is an opioid agonist indicated for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. OPANA



	®



	 ER represents the first drug in which oxymorphone is available in an oral, extended-release formulation and is available in 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg and 40 mg tablets. In December 2011, the FDA approved a new formulation of OPANA



	®



	 ER with INTAC



	®



	 technology. This formulation of OPANA



	®



	 ER with INTAC



	®



	 technology has the same dosage strengths, color and packaging and similar tablet size as original OPANA



	®



	 ER. Endo transitioned to this formulation in March 2012 upon successfully accelerating its production. Launches of competing generic versions of the non-INTAC



	®



	 technology formulation OPANA



	®



	 ER, which began in early 2013, adversely affected our results of operations. The FDA has announced an upcoming Advisory Committee for Opana



	®



	 ER and oxymorphone for March 2017. The Advisory Committee will likely discuss pre- and post-marketing data about the abuse of OPANA



	®



	 ER, and the overall risk-benefit of this product. The Advisory Committee will also discuss abuse of generic oxymorphone ER and oxymorphone immediate-release (IR) products.




	Percocet



	®



	. Launched in 1976, Percocet



	®



	 is approved for the treatment of moderate-to-moderately severe pain.




	Voltaren



	®





	Gel.


	 On March 4, 2008, the Company entered into a License and Supply Agreement with and among Novartis AG and Novartis Consumer Health, Inc. (the


	2008 Voltaren



	®



	 Gel Agreement


	) to obtain the exclusive U.S. marketing rights for the prescription medicine Voltaren



	®



	 Gel. On December 11, 2015, the Company, Novartis AG and Sandoz entered into a new License and Supply Agreement (the


	2015 Voltaren



	®



	 Gel Agreement


	) providing Endo with exclusive U.S. marketing and license rights to commercialize Voltaren



	®



	 Gel and the authorized generic version of Voltaren



	®



	 Gel through June 30, 2023. Voltaren



	®



	 Gel received regulatory approval in October 2007 from the FDA, becoming the first topical prescription treatment for the relief of joint pain of osteoarthritis in the knees, ankles, feet, elbows, wrists, and hands and became the first new product approved in the U.S. for osteoarthritis since 2001. It was the first prescription topical osteoarthritis treatment to have proven its effectiveness in both the knees and joints of the hands through clinical trials. Voltaren



	®



	 Gel delivers effective pain relief with a favorable safety profile as its systemic absorption is


	94%


	 less than the comparable oral diclofenac treatment. It is now the most prescribed FDA-approved topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) for the relief of osteoarthritis pain.

	Select Products in Development




	U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals




	Our primary approach to generic pharmaceutical product development is to target high-barrier-to-entry generic products, including first-to-file or first-to-market opportunities. Our potential first-to-file and first-to-market opportunities account for approximately one-third of our pipeline of ANDAs. We expect that these potential first-to-file and first-to-market opportunities to result in products that are either exclusive or have two or fewer competitors when launched, which we believe tends to lead to more sustainable market share and profitability for our product portfolio.




	As of December 31, 2016, we had over


	200


	 products in our pipeline, which included approximately


	120


	 ANDAs pending with the FDA representing approximately


	$32.0 billion


	 of combined annual sales for the corresponding branded products in 2016, including


	35


	 potential first-to-file and


	four


	 first-to-market opportunities.




	U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals




	XIAFLEX



	®



	 (collagenase clostridium histolyticum or CCH) is currently approved and marketed in the U.S. for the treatment of both DC and PD (two separate indications). We are progressing the cellulite development program following meetings held with the FDA in December 2014 and a subsequent follow-up meeting in December 2015. In addition, our Phase 2b study was initiated and completed and the results were released in November 2016. An End of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA occurred in early 2017 and we will continue to work with the FDA in advance of initiating our Phase 3 clinical trials. We also have the right to further develop XIAFLEX



	®



	 for additional indications, including Dupuytren’s Nodules, Adhesive Capsulitis and Lateral Hip Fat, Plantar Fibromatosis and human and canine lipomas.




	International Pharmaceuticals




	We have submitted applications for regulatory approval of various products in our international markets. In addition, RLX030 (serelaxin) is currently undergoing human clinical trials. RLX030 is a novel treatment for acute heart failure and Phase II and III studies suggested RLX030 helped patients with acute heart failure live longer. Trial results are expected in the second quarter of 2017.








	Competition




	Generic Pharmaceuticals




	In the generic pharmaceutical market, we face intense competition from other generic drug manufacturers, brand name pharmaceutical companies through authorized generics, existing brand equivalents and manufacturers of therapeutically similar drugs. Our major competitors in the generics market, including Teva, Mylan, Sandoz and Impax Laboratories, Inc. (Impax), vary by specific product.




	Our primary strategy is to compete in the generic product market with a focus on high-value, first-to-file or first-to-market opportunities, regardless of therapeutic category, and products that present significant barriers to entry for reasons such as complex formulation or regulatory or legal challenges. By specializing in high-barrier-to-entry products, we endeavor to market more profitable and longer-lived products relative to commodity generic products. We believe that our competitive advantages include our integrated team-based approach to product development that combines our formulation, regulatory, legal, manufacturing and commercial capabilities; our ability to introduce new generic equivalents for brand-name drugs; our quality and cost-effective production; our ability to meet customer expectations; and the breadth of our existing generic product portfolio offering.




	We make a significant portion of our sales to a relatively small number of drug wholesalers and retail drug store chains. These customers play a key role in the distribution chain of our pharmaceutical products. Drug wholesalers and retail drug store chains have undergone, and are continuing to undergo, significant consolidation, which has resulted in these groups gaining additional purchasing leverage that has increased the pricing pressures on our business. Additionally, the emergence of large buying groups representing independent retail pharmacies and other drug distributors, and the prevalence and influence of managed care organizations and similar institutions, enable those groups to demand larger price discounts on our products. For example, there has been a recent trend of large retail customers forming partnerships with large wholesalers, such as the alliances between Walgreens and AmerisourceBergen Corporation, between Rite Aid and McKesson Drug Company and between CVS and Cardinal Health. As a result of these alliances, as well as the consolidation among wholesale distributors and the growth of large retail drug store chains, a small number of purchasers control a significant share of purchases and have gained more purchasing power that has heightened competition among generic drug producers for the business of this consolidated customer base.








	11









	Table of Contents









	Newly introduced generic products with limited or no other generic competition typically garner higher prices relative to commoditized generic products. At the expiration of any statutory generic exclusivity period, other generic distributors may enter the market, resulting in significant price declines. Consequently, the maintenance of profitable operations in generic pharmaceuticals depends, in part, on our continuing ability to select, develop, procure regulatory approvals of, overcome legal challenges to, launch and commercialize new generic products in a timely and cost efficient manner and to maintain efficient, high quality manufacturing capabilities. We also have diverse manufacturing capabilities covering almost all generic presentations, such as solid oral dose, gels, liquids, nasal sprays, ophthalmics, films, transdermal patches and injectable products.




	Branded Pharmaceuticals




	The branded pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive. Our products compete with products manufactured by many other companies in highly competitive markets throughout the U.S. and internationally primarily through our Paladin, Somar and Litha businesses. Our competitors vary depending upon therapeutic and product categories. Competitors include many of the major brand name and generic manufacturers of pharmaceuticals. With respect to branded pharmaceuticals, our competitors, including


	Abbott Laboratories (Abbott), Allergan plc (Allergan), Purdue Pharma, L.P. (Purdue), Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc (Jazz), Shire plc (Shire), Horizon Pharma plc (Horizon), and Mallinckrodt plc (Mallinckrodt), among others


	, vary depending on product category, dosage strength and drug-delivery systems.




	We compete principally through targeted product development and our acquisition and in-licensing strategies. The competitive landscape in the acquisition and in-licensing of pharmaceutical products has intensified in recent years as there has been a reduction in the number of compounds available and an increase in the number of companies and the collective resources bidding on available assets. In addition to product development and acquisitions, other competitive factors in the pharmaceutical industry include product efficacy, safety, ease of use, price, demonstrated cost-effectiveness, marketing effectiveness, service, reputation and access to technical information.




	The competitive environment of the branded product business requires us to continually seek out technological innovations and to market our products effectively. However, some of our current branded products face competition not only from other brands, but also from generic versions. Generic versions are generally significantly less expensive than branded versions, and, where available, may be required in preference to the branded version under third-party reimbursement programs, or substituted by pharmacies. If competitors introduce new products, delivery systems or processes with therapeutic or cost advantages, our products can be subject to progressive price reductions or decreased volume of sales, or both. Most new products that we introduce must compete with other products already on the market or products that are later developed by competitors. Manufacturers of generic pharmaceuticals typically invest far less in research and development than research-based pharmaceutical companies and therefore can price their products significantly lower than branded products. Accordingly, when a branded product loses its market exclusivity, it normally faces intense price competition from generic forms of the product. To successfully compete for business with managed care and pharmacy benefits management organizations, we must often demonstrate that our products offer not only medical benefits but also cost advantages as compared with other forms of care.




	We are aware of certain competitive activities involving OPANA



	®



	 ER and other products. For a description of these competitive activities, including the litigation related to Paragraph IV Certification Notices, see


	Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies


	 in the


	Consolidated Financial Statements


	, included in


	Part IV, Item 15 of this report "Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules"


	.








	Seasonality




	Although our business is affected by the purchasing patterns and concentration of our customers, our business is not materially impacted by seasonality.

	Major Customers




	We primarily sell our generic and branded pharmaceuticals to wholesalers, drug store chains, supermarket chains, mass merchandisers, distributors, mail order accounts, hospitals and government agencies. Our wholesalers and distributors purchase products from us and, in turn, supply products to retail drug store chains, independent pharmacies and managed health care organizations. Customers in the managed health care market include health maintenance organizations, nursing homes, hospitals, clinics, pharmacy benefit management companies and mail order customers. Total revenues from customers that accounted for

	U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals


	,


	U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals


	, and


	International Pharmaceuticals


	 segments.




	As a result of consolidation among wholesale distributors as well as rapid growth of large retail drug store chains, a small number of large wholesale distributors control a significant share of the market, and the number of independent drug stores and small drug store chains has decreased. Some wholesale distributors have demanded that pharmaceutical manufacturers, including us, enter into distribution service agreements (DSAs) pursuant to which the wholesale distributors provide the pharmaceutical manufacturers with specific services, including the provision of periodic retail demand information and current inventory levels and other information. We have entered into certain of these agreements.




	Revenue related to independent specialty pharmacies during the year ended December 31, 2016 was approximately 4% of the Company’s overall 2016 revenue.

	The effect of these issued patents is that they provide us with patent protection for the claims covered by the patents. The coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued. Accordingly, we do not know whether any of the applications we acquire or license will result in the issuance of patents, or, if any patents are issued, whether they will provide significant proprietary protection or will be challenged, circumvented or invalidated. Because unissued U.S. patent applications are maintained in secrecy for a period of eighteen months and U.S. patent applications filed prior to November 29, 2000 are not disclosed until such patents are issued, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending patent applications. Moreover, we may have to participate in interference and other inter parties proceedings declared by the PTO to determine priority of invention, or in opposition proceedings in a foreign patent office, either of which could result in substantial cost to us, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. There can be no assurance that any patents, if issued, will be held valid by a court of competent jurisdiction. An adverse outcome could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require disputed rights to be licensed from third parties or require us to cease using such technology.




	We believe that our patents, the protection of discoveries in connection with our development activities, our proprietary products, technologies, processes and know-how and all of our intellectual property are important to our business. All of our branded products and certain generic products, such as Endocet



	®



	 and Endodan



	®



	 are sold under trademarks. To achieve a competitive position, we rely on trade secrets, non-patented proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation, where patent protection is not believed to be appropriate or attainable. In addition, as outlined above, we have a number of patent licenses from third parties, some of which may be important to our business. See


	Note 11. License and Collaboration Agreements


	 in the


	Consolidated Financial Statements


	, included in


	Part IV, Item 15 of this report "Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules"


	. There can be no assurance that any of our patents, licenses or other intellectual property rights will afford us any protection from competition.




	We rely on confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and other parties to protect, among other things, trade secrets and other proprietary technology. There can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop equivalent proprietary information or that other third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and other intellectual property.




	We may find it necessary to initiate litigation to enforce our patent rights, to protect our intellectual property or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation is costly and time-consuming, and there can be no assurance that our litigation expenses will not be significant in the future or that we will prevail in any such litigation. See

	Governmental Regulation




	United States Food and Drug Administration and Drug Enforcement Administration




	In the United States, the development, testing, manufacture, holding, packaging, labeling, distribution, marketing, and sales of our products and our ongoing product development activities are subject to extensive and rigorous government regulation. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern or influence the testing, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products. Noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in fines, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production and/or distribution, injunctions, refusal of the government to enter into supply contracts or to approve NDAs, ANDAs and Biologics License Applications (BLAs), civil penalties and criminal prosecution.




	FDA approval is typically required before any new drug can be marketed. An NDA or BLA is a filing submitted to the FDA to obtain approval of new chemical entities and other innovations for which thorough applied research is required to demonstrate safety and effectiveness in use. The process generally involves:













	•






	Completion of preclinical laboratory and animal testing and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations;
















	•






	Submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin in the U.S.;
















	•






	Approval by an independent institutional review board (IRB) before each trial may be initiated, and continuing review during the trial;
















	•






	Performance of human clinical trials, including adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices (GCPs) to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each intended use;
















	•






	Submission of an NDA or BLA to the FDA;
















	•






	Satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the product’s manufacturing processes and facility or facilities to assess compliance with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations, and/or review of the Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC) section of the NDA or BLA to require that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality, purity and potency;











	14









	Table of Contents


















	•






	Satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable; and
















	•






	Approval by the FDA of the NDA or BLA.







	Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, although the phases may overlap.













	•






	Phase I generally involves testing the product for safety, adverse effects, dosage, tolerance, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and other elements of clinical pharmacology.
















	•






	Phase II trials typically involve a small sample of the intended patient population to assess the efficacy of the compound for a specific indication, to determine dose tolerance and the optimal dose range as well as to gather additional information relating to safety and potential adverse effects.
















	•






	Phase III trials are undertaken in an expanded patient population at typically dispersed study sites, in order to determine the overall risk-benefit ratio of the compound and to provide an adequate basis for product labeling.







	Each trial is conducted in accordance with certain standards under protocols that detail the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used to monitor safety and efficacy criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.




	Data from preclinical testing and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA in an NDA or BLA for marketing approval and to foreign government health authorities in a marketing authorization application, consistent with each health authority’s specific regulatory requirements. Clinical trials are also subject to regulatory inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities to confirm compliance with applicable regulatory standards. The process of completing clinical trials for a new drug may take many years and require the expenditures of substantial resources. See


	Item 1A. Risk Factors


	 - “


	The pharmaceutical industry is heavily regulated, which creates uncertainty about our ability to bring new products to market and imposes substantial compliance costs on our business


	,” for further discussion on FDA approval. As a condition of approval, the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may require further studies, including Phase IV post-marketing studies or post-marketing data reporting. Results of post-marketing programs may limit or expand the further marketing of the products.




	For some drugs, the FDA may require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS), which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or other elements to make certain safe use. In February 2009, the FDA sent letters to manufacturers of certain opioid drug products, indicating that these drugs will be required to have a REMS designed to reduce risks and improve the safe use of certain opioid drug products. Three products sold by Endo were included in the list of affected opioid drugs: OPANA



	®



	 ER, morphine sulfate ER and oxycodone ER. In 2011, the FDA sent another letter requiring that the manufacturers of these drugs develop and submit to the FDA a post-market REMS plan. The FDA approved a class-wide extended-release/long-acting REMS in July 2012. The goal of this REMS is to reduce serious adverse outcomes resulting from inappropriate prescribing, misuse and abuse of extended-release or long-acting opioid analgesics while maintaining patient access to pain medications. Since that 2009 letter and the 2012 REMS, the company began selling BELBUCA™, and acquired the products fentanyl transdermal system and oxymorphone hydrochloride through its subsidiary Par, all of which are subject to the 2012 REMS. In December 2016, Endo announced that it was returning BELBUCA



	TM



	to BDSI. The REMS includes a Medication Guide, Elements to Assure Safe Use and annual REMS Assessment Reports. See


	Item 1A. Risk Factors


	 - “


	The pharmaceutical industry is heavily regulated, which creates uncertainty about our ability to bring new products to market and imposes substantial compliance costs on our business


	,” for further discussion.  In recent years, the FDA has taken steps to reduce the maximum strength of acetaminophen in prescription combination drug products to help reduce or prevent the risk of liver injury from an unintentional overdose of acetaminophen. Among the Company’s products impacted by the FDA’s actions were three branded combination drug pain relief products: Percocet



	®



	, Endocet



	®



	 and Zydone



	®



	; and the generic combination drug pain relief products: butalbital/acetaminophen/caffeine, hydrocodone/acetaminophen and oxycodone/acetaminophen.




	In most instances, FDA approval of an ANDA is required before a generic equivalent of an existing or reference-listed drug can be marketed. The ANDA process is abbreviated in that the FDA waives the requirement of conducting complete preclinical and clinical studies and generally instead relies principally on bioequivalence studies. Bioequivalence generally involves a comparison of the rate of absorption and levels of concentration of a generic drug in the body with those of the previously approved drug. When the rate and extent of absorption of systemically acting test and reference drugs are considered the same under the bioequivalence requirement, the two drugs are considered bioequivalent and are generally regarded as therapeutically equivalent, meaning that a pharmacist can substitute the product for the reference-listed drug. Under certain circumstances, an ANDA may also be submitted for a product authorized by approval of an ANDA suitability petition. Such petitions may be submitted to secure authorization to file an ANDA for a product that differs from a previously approved drug in active ingredient, route of administration, dosage form or strength. In September 2007 and July 2012, Congress re-authorized pediatric testing legislation, which now requires ANDAs approved via the suitability petition route to conduct pediatric testing. The timing of final FDA approval of ANDA applications depends on a variety of factors, including whether the applicant challenges any listed patents for the drug and whether the manufacturer of the reference listed drug is entitled to one or more statutory exclusivity periods, during which the FDA is prohibited from approving generic products. In certain circumstances, a regulatory exclusivity period can extend beyond the life of a patent, and thus block ANDAs from being approved on the patent expiration date.

	Certain of our products are or in the future could be regulated and marketed as biologic products pursuant to BLAs. Our BLA-licensed products were licensed based on a determination by the FDA of safety, purity, and potency as required under the Public Health Service Act (PHSA). Although the ANDA framework referenced above does not apply to generics of BLA-licensed biologics, in 2010, Congress enacted the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCIA), as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), which amended the PHSA to create an abbreviated licensure pathway for products deemed to be biosimilar to or interchangeable with FDA-licensed reference biological products. Under the BPCIA, following the expiration of a 12-year reference exclusivity period, FDA may license under section 351(k) of the PHSA a biologic that it determines is biosimilar to or interchangeable with a reference product licensed under section 351(a) of the PHSA. Biosimilarity is defined to mean that the section 351(k) product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the section 351(k) product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity, and potency of the product. To be considered interchangeable, a product must be biosimilar to the reference product, be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient, and, if administered more than once to an individual, the risks in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between use of the product and its reference product is not greater than the risk of using the reference product without such alternation or switch.




	Once any reference exclusivity period for our BLA-licensed biologics expires, FDA may approve under section 351(k) of the PHSA another company’s BLA for a biosimilar or interchangeable version of our product. Although licensure of a biosimilar or interchangeable under section 351(k) is generally expected to require less than the full complement of product-specific preclinical and clinical data required for innovator products licensed under section 351(a), FDA has considerable discretion over the kind and amount of scientific evidence required to demonstrate biosimilarity and interchangeability, and the agency has yet to issue regulations setting forth specific criteria for licensure of biosimilar or interchangeable products.




	Based on scientific developments, post-market experience, or other legislative or regulatory changes, the current FDA standards of review for approving new pharmaceutical products are sometimes more stringent than those that were applied in the past, including to certain opioid products. As a result, the FDA does not have as extensive safety databases on these products as on some products developed more recently. Accordingly, we believe the FDA has expressed an intention to develop such databases for certain of these products, including many opioids.




	The 21st Century Cures Act (Cures Act) was signed into law on December 13, 2016. The Cures Act includes various provisions to accelerate the development and delivery of new treatments, such as those intended to expand the types of evidence manufacturers may submit to support FDA drug approval, to encourage patient-centered drug development, to liberalize the communication of healthcare economic information (HCEI) to payers, and to create greater transparency with regard to manufacturer expanded access programs. Central to the Cures Act are provisions that enhance and accelerate FDA’s processes for reviewing and approving new drugs and supplements to approved new drug applications (NDAs). These include, but are not limited to, provisions that (i) require FDA to establish a program to evaluate the potential use of real world evidence to help to support the approval of a new indication for an approved drug and to help to support or satisfy post-approval study requirements, (ii) provide that FDA may rely upon qualified data summaries to support the approval of a supplemental application with respect to a qualified indication for an already approved drug, (iii) require FDA to issue guidance for purposes of assisting sponsors in incorporating complex adaptive and other novel trial designs into proposed clinical protocols and applications for new drugs, and (iv) require FDA to establish a process for the qualification of drug development tools for use in supporting or obtaining FDA approval for or investigational use of a drug.




	The Cures Act also includes $1 billion in new funding to address what the Act refers to as the “opioid abuse crisis.” Specifically, the Cures Act authorizes the awarding of grants to states for the purpose of addressing opioid abuse within each state, with preference to be given to states with an incidence or prevalence of opioid use disorders that is substantially higher relative to other states. Funding would be provided for states to supplement opioid abuse prevention and treatment activities, such as improving prescription drug monitoring programs, implementing prevention activities, training for health care providers, and expanding access to opioid treatment programs. States receiving such grants would be required to report on activities funded by the grant in the substance abuse block grant report.

	We cannot determine what effect changes in the FDA’s laws or regulations (including legal or regulator interpretations), when and if promulgated, or upcoming advisory committee meetings, may have on our business in the future. Changes could, among other things, require expanded or different labeling, additional testing, the recall or discontinuance of certain products, and additional record keeping. Such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See


	Item 1A. Risk Factors


	 - “


	The pharmaceutical industry is heavily regulated, which creates uncertainty about our ability to bring new products to market and imposes substantial compliance costs on our business


	,” for further discussion. In September 2013, the FDA announced class-wide safety labeling changes and new post-market study requirements for all extended-release and long-acting (ER/LA) opioids. Among other things, the updated indication states that because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, even at recommended doses, and because of the greater risks of overdose and death, these drugs should be reserved for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are ineffective, not tolerated, or would be otherwise inadequate to provide sufficient management of pain; ER/LA opioid analgesics are not indicated for as-needed pain relief. The FDA is also requiring drug companies that make these products to conduct further studies and clinical trials to further assess the known serious risks of misuse, abuse, increased sensitivity to pain (hyperalgesia), addiction, overdose, and death. It is not presently known what impact, if any, these changes to the indications for use or results from the post-marketing studies may have on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.




	A sponsor of an NDA is required to identify in its application any patent that claims the drug or a use of the drug subject to the application. Upon NDA approval, the FDA lists these patents in a publication referred to as the Orange Book. Any person that files a Section 505(b)(2) NDA must make a certification in respect to listed patents, the type of NDA that may rely upon the data in the application for which the patents are listed, or an ANDA to secure approval of a generic version of this first, or listed drug. The FDA may not approve such an application for the drug until expiration of the listed patents unless (1) the generic applicant certifies that the listed patents are invalid, unenforceable or not infringed by the proposed generic drug and gives notice to the holder of the NDA for the listed drug of the basis upon which the patents are challenged, and (2) the holder of the listed drug does not sue the later applicant for patent infringement within 45 days of receipt of notice. Under the current law, if an infringement suit is filed, the FDA may not approve the later application until the earliest of: 30 months after submission; entry of an appellate court judgment holding the patent invalid, unenforceable or not infringed; such time as the court may order; or the patent expires.




	One of the key motivators for challenging patents is the 180-day market exclusivity period vis-á-vis other generic applicants granted to the developer of a generic version of a product that is the first to have its application accepted for filing by the FDA and whose filing includes a certification that the applicable patent(s) are invalid, unenforceable and/or not infringed (a Paragraph IV certification) and that prevails in litigation with the manufacturer of the branded product over the applicable patent(s). Under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (2003 Medicare Act), with accompanying amendments to the Hatch-Waxman Act (Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act), this marketing exclusivity would begin to run upon the earlier of the commercial launch of the generic product or upon an appellate court decision in the generic company’s favor. In addition, the holder of the NDA for the listed drug may be entitled to certain non-patent exclusivity during which the FDA cannot approve an application for a competing generic product or 505(b)(2) NDA product.




	The FDA enforces regulations to require that the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, packing and holding of drugs conform to cGMPs. The cGMP regulations the FDA enforces are comprehensive and cover all aspects of manufacturing operations. Compliance with the regulations requires a continuous commitment of time, money and effort in all operational areas.




	The FDA conducts pre-approval inspections of facilities engaged in the development, manufacture, processing, packing, testing and holding of the drugs subject to NDAs and ANDAs. In addition, manufacturers of both pharmaceutical products and active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) used to formulate the drug also ordinarily undergo a pre-approval inspection. Failure of any facility to pass a pre-approval inspection will result in delayed approval and would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.




	The FDA also conducts periodic inspections of drug facilities to assess the cGMP status of marketed products. Following such inspections, the FDA may issue an untitled letter as an initial correspondence that cites violations that do not meet the threshold of regulatory significance for a Warning Letter. FDA guidelines also provide for the issuance of Warning Letters for violations of “regulatory significance” for which the failure to adequately and promptly achieve correction may be expected to result in an enforcement action. Finally, the FDA could issue a Form 483 Notice of Inspectional Observations, which could cause us to modify certain activities identified during the inspection. If the FDA were to find serious cGMP non-compliance during such an inspection, it could take regulatory actions that could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Imported API and other components needed to manufacture our products could be rejected by U.S. Customs. In respect to domestic establishments, the FDA could initiate product seizures or request or in some instances require product recalls and seek to enjoin or otherwise limit a product’s manufacture and distribution. In certain circumstances, violations could support civil penalties and criminal prosecutions. In addition, if the FDA concludes that a company is not in compliance with cGMP requirements, sanctions may be imposed that include preventing that company from receiving the necessary licenses to export its products and classifying that company as an unacceptable supplier, thereby disqualifying that company from selling products to federal agencies.

	Certain of our subsidiaries sell products that are “controlled substances” as defined in the CSA and implementing regulations, which establish certain security and record keeping requirements administered by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). The DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances, with Schedule I and II substances considered to present the highest risk of substance abuse and Schedule V substances the lowest risk. The active ingredients in some of our current products and products in development, including oxycodone, oxymorphone, buprenorphine, morphine, fentanyl and hydrocodone, are listed by the DEA as Schedule II or III substances under the CSA. Consequently, their manufacture, shipment, storage, sale and use are subject to a high degree of regulation. Since October 2014, hydrocodone combination products have been rescheduled by the DEA as Schedule II, which imposes additional access restrictions of these products and could ultimately impact our sales.




	The DEA limits the availability of the active ingredients used in many of our current products and products in development, as well as the production of these products, and we, or our contract manufacturing organizations, must annually apply to the DEA for procurement and production quotas in order to obtain and produce these substances. As a result, our quotas may not be sufficient to meet commercial demand or complete clinical trials. Moreover, the DEA may adjust these quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether or not to make such adjustments. See


	Item 1A. Risk Factors


	 - “


	The DEA limits the availability of the active ingredients used in many of our current products and products in development, as well as the production of these products, and, as a result, our procurement and production quotas may not be sufficient to meet commercial demand or complete clinical trials


	,” for further discussion on DEA regulations. To meet its responsibilities, the DEA conducts periodic inspections of registered establishments that handle controlled substances. Annual registration is required for any facility that manufactures, tests, distributes, dispenses, imports or exports any controlled substance. The facilities must have the security, control and accounting mechanisms required by the DEA to prevent loss and diversion of controlled substances. Failure to maintain compliance can result in enforcement action that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations, or initiate proceedings to revoke or restrict those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could eventuate in criminal proceedings.




	Individual states also regulate controlled substances, and we, as well as our third-party API suppliers and manufacturers, are subject to such regulation by several states with respect to the manufacture and distribution of these products.




	Government Benefit Programs




	As described further in Item 1A. Risk Factors, statutory and regulatory requirements for Medicaid, Medicare, TRICARE and other government healthcare programs govern access and provider reimbursement levels, and provide for other cost-containment measures such as requiring pharmaceutical companies to pay rebates or refunds for certain sales of products reimbursed by such programs, or subjecting sales of their products to certain price ceilings. In addition to the cost-containment measures described in Item 1A. Risk Factors, a final rule promulgated and reissued by the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) in October 2010 subjects drug sales to retail pharmacies under the TRICARE Retail Pharmacy Program to certain price ceilings. Specifically, under the final rule, manufacturers are required, among other things, to pay refunds for prescriptions filled beginning on January 28, 2008 and extending to future periods based on the applicable ceiling price limits. Beginning in the first quarter of 2017, a provision in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 will also require drug manufacturers to pay additional rebates to State Medicaid programs if the prices of their non-innovator drugs rise at a rate faster than inflation (as continues to be the case for innovator products).




	The federal and/or state governments may continue to enact measures in the future aimed at containing or reducing payment levels for prescription pharmaceuticals paid for in whole or in part with government funds. We cannot predict the nature of this or other such measures or their impact on our profitability and cash flows. These efforts could, however, have material consequences for the pharmaceutical industry and the Company.




	From time to time, legislative changes are made to government healthcare programs that impact our business. Congress continues to examine various Medicare and Medicaid policy proposals that may result in a downward pressure on the prices of prescription drugs in these programs. See


	Item 1A. Risk Factors


	 - “


	The availability of third party reimbursement for our products is uncertain, and thus we may find it difficult to maintain current price levels. Additionally, the market may not accept those products for which third party reimbursement is not adequately provided


	,” for further discussion on Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements.




	In March 2010, President Obama signed into law PPACA that has made major changes to the healthcare system. One such change is the requirement that pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded prescription drugs must pay an annual fee to the federal government. Each individual pharmaceutical manufacturer must pay a prorated share of the total industry fee (the fee is $3 billion for 2016, $4 billion for 2017 and $4.1 billion for 2018, decreasing to $2.8 billion for years thereafter) based on the dollar value of its branded prescription drug sales to specified federal programs. PPACA also expanded health insurance coverage to many previously uninsured Americans, through a combination of federal subsidies for lower-income individuals who enrolled in health plans through health insurance exchanges and enabling states to expand Medicaid eligibility with the federal government paying a high share of the cost.








	18









	Table of Contents









	Following the November 2016 U.S. elections, uncertainty exists about the future of this insurance coverage expansion; the current executive branch administration and congressional leaders have expressed interest in repealing these PPACA provisions and replacing them with alternatives that may be less costly and provide state Medicaid programs and private health plans more flexibility. If PPACA is repealed and/or replaced in whole or in part, it is possible that many of the reforms implemented as part of PPACA, including those affecting the pharmaceutical industry, may be repealed or amended as a result.




	Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws




	We are subject to various federal, state and local laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry, violations of which can lead to civil and criminal penalties, including fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. These laws are potentially applicable to us as both a manufacturer and a supplier of products reimbursed by federal healthcare programs, and they also apply to hospitals, physicians and other potential purchasers of our products.




	The federal Anti-Kickback Statute (42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b(b)) prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Remuneration is not defined in the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, coupons, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payments, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. Under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the applicable criminal healthcare fraud statutes contained within 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b a person or entity need not have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim, including items or services resulting from a violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b, constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act (discussed below) or the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes fines against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented claims to a federal healthcare program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute and implementing regulations provide for certain exceptions for “safe harbors” for certain discounting, rebating, or personal services arrangements, among other things. However, the lack of uniform court interpretation of the Anti-Kickback Statute makes compliance with the law difficult. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute can result in significant criminal fines, exclusion from participation in Medicare and Medicaid, and follow-on civil litigation, among other things, for both entities and individuals.




	Other federal healthcare fraud-related laws also provide criminal liability for violations. The Criminal Healthcare Fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1347 prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers. Federal criminal law at 18 U.S.C. § 1001, among other sections, prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. See


	Item 1A. Risk Factors


	 - “


	We are subject to various regulations pertaining to the marketing of our products and services


	,” for further discussion on the Anti-Kickback Statute.




	The civil False Claims Act and similar state laws impose liability on any person or entity who, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act and similar state laws allow a private individual to bring civil actions on behalf of the federal or state government and to share in any monetary recovery. The Federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act and similar state laws impose reporting requirements for various types of payments to physicians and teaching hospitals. Failure to comply with required reporting requirements under these laws could subject manufacturers and others to substantial civil money penalties. In addition, government entities and private litigants have asserted claims under state consumer protection statutes against pharmaceutical and medical device companies for alleged false or misleading statements in connection with the marketing, promotion and/or sale of pharmaceutical and medical device products, including state investigations of the Company regarding the Company’s vaginal mesh devices and investigations and litigation by certain government entities regarding the Company’s marketing of opioid products.




	International Regulations




	Our growing international operations have increased our interaction with regulatory authorities in other countries and made the Company subject to laws and regulations that differ from those under which the Company operates in the United States. In most cases, these regulatory agencies evaluate and monitor the safety, efficacy and quality of pharmaceutical products, govern the approval of clinical trials and product registrations, and regulate pricing and reimbursement. Many of these markets have differing product preferences and requirements, and operate in an environment of government-mandated, cost-containment programs, including price controls. Several governments have placed restrictions on physician prescription levels and patient reimbursements, emphasized greater use of generic drugs and enacted across-the-board price cuts as methods of cost control.




	Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained for a product, approval of the product by comparable regulatory authorities of other countries must be obtained prior to marketing the product in those countries. The approval process may be more or less rigorous from country to country, and the time required for approval may be longer or shorter than that required in the United States.

	Service Agreements




	We contract with various third parties to provide certain critical services including manufacturing, supply, warehousing, distribution, customer service, certain financial functions, certain research and development activities and medical affairs.




	For a complete description of our significant manufacturing, supply and other service agreements, see


	Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies


	 in the


	Consolidated Financial Statements


	, included in


	Part IV, Item 15 of this report "Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules"


	.




	We primarily purchase our raw materials for the production and development of our products in the open market from third party suppliers. However, some raw materials are only available from one source. We attempt, when possible, to mitigate our raw material supply risks through inventory management and alternative sourcing strategies. We are required to identify the suppliers of all raw materials for our products in the drug applications that we file with the FDA. If the raw materials from an approved supplier for a particular product become unavailable, we would be required to qualify a substitute supplier with the FDA, which would likely interrupt manufacturing of the affected product. See


	Item 1A. Risk Factors


	 for further discussion on the risks associated with the sourcing of our raw materials.








	License & Collaboration Agreements and Acquisitions




	We continue to seek to enhance our product line and develop a balanced portfolio of differentiated products through product acquisitions and in-licensing, or acquiring licenses to products, compounds and technologies from third parties. The Company enters into strategic alliances and collaborative arrangements with third parties, which give the Company rights to develop, manufacture, market and/or sell pharmaceutical products, the rights to which are primarily owned by these third parties. These alliances and arrangements can take many forms, including licensing arrangements, co-development and co-marketing agreements, co-promotion arrangements, research collaborations and joint ventures. Such alliances and arrangements enable us to share the risk of incurring all research and development expenses that do not lead to revenue-generating products; however, because profits from alliance products are shared with the counter-parties to the collaborative arrangement, the gross margins on alliance products are generally lower, sometimes substantially so, than the gross margins that could be achieved had the Company not opted for a development partner. For a full discussion, including agreement terms and status, see our disclosures in


	Note 5. Acquisitions


	 and


	Note 11. License and Collaboration Agreements


	 in the


	Consolidated Financial Statements


	, included in


	Part IV, Item 15 of this report "Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules"


	.








	Environmental Matters




	Our operations are subject to substantial federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other matters, the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of, and exposure to, hazardous substances. Violation of these laws and regulations, which frequently change, can lead to substantial fines and penalties. Many of our operations require environmental permits and controls to prevent and limit pollution of the environment. We believe that our facilities and the facilities of our third party service providers are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and we do not believe that future compliance will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

	Risk Factors




	We operate in a highly competitive industry.




	The pharmaceutical industry is intensely competitive, and we face competition in our branded and generic pharmaceutical business. In addition to product development, safety, efficacy, commercialization, marketing and promotion, other competitive factors include product quality and price, reputation, service and access to scientific and technical information. Many of our competitors, including Abbott, Allergan, Purdue, Jazz, Shire, Horizon, Mallinckrodt, Teva, Mylan, Sandoz and Impax, among others, may have greater resources than we do and we cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of competitors’ products. Furthermore, recent trends in this industry are toward further market consolidation of large drug companies into a smaller number of very large entities, further concentrating financial, technical and market strength and increasing competitive pressure in the industry. It is possible that our competitors may make greater research and development investments and have more efficient or superior processes and systems and that their new products may make our products or technologies uncompetitive or obsolete. Furthermore, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection and may establish collaborative arrangements for competitive products or programs. If we fail to compete successfully, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.




	Our branded products face competition from generic versions. Generic versions are generally significantly cheaper than branded versions and, where available, may be required or encouraged in place of the branded version under third-party reimbursement programs, or substituted by pharmacies for branded versions by law. The entrance of generic competition to our branded products generally reduces our market share and adversely affects our profitability and cash flows. Further, certain Asian and other overseas generic competitors may be able to produce products at costs lower than the costs of domestic manufacturers. If we experience substantial competition from Asian or other overseas generic competitors with lower production costs, our profit margins will suffer. In addition, certain of our branded products are not protected by patent rights or have limited patent life and will soon lose patent protection. Loss of patent protection for a branded product typically is followed promptly by generic substitutes. As a result, sales of many of these branded products may decline or stop growing over time. Generic competition with our branded products has had and will continue to have a material adverse effect on the net sales and profitability of our branded products.




	In addition, our generics business faces competition from brand-name pharmaceutical companies, which have taken aggressive steps to thwart or delay competition from generic equivalents of their brand-name products. The actions taken by competing brand name pharmaceutical companies may increase the costs and risks associated with our efforts to introduce generic products and may delay or prevent such introduction altogether.




	Our sales may also suffer as a result of changes in consumer demand for our products, including those related to fluctuations in consumer buying patterns tied to seasonality or the introduction of new products by competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial conditions and cash flows.




	If generic manufacturers use litigation and regulatory means to obtain approval for generic versions of our branded drugs, our sales may suffer.




	Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) can approve an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) for a generic bioequivalent version of a previously approved drug, without requiring the ANDA applicant to undertake the full clinical testing necessary to obtain approval to market a new drug. In place of such clinical studies, an ANDA applicant usually needs only to submit data demonstrating that its generic product is bioequivalent to the branded product.

	Various generic manufacturers have filed ANDAs seeking FDA approval for generic versions of certain of our key pharmaceutical products, including but not limited to Lidoderm



	®



	, both formulations of OPANA



	®



	 ER, Aveed



	®



	 and Megace


	 ES



	®



	. In connection with such filings, these manufacturers have challenged the validity and/or enforceability of one or more of the underlying patents protecting our products. In the case of Lidoderm



	®



	 and Megace


	 ES



	®



	, we no longer have patent protection in the markets where we sell these products. Our revenues from Lidoderm



	®



	 have been negatively affected by Actavis’s September 2013 launch and Mylan’s August 2015 launch of their lidocaine patch 5%, generic versions of Lidoderm



	®



	, and we anticipate that these revenues could decrease further should one or more additional generic versions launch. With respect to OPANA



	®



	 ER, Aveed



	®



	 and other branded pharmaceutical products, it has been and continues to be our practice to vigorously defend and pursue all available legal and regulatory avenues in defense of the intellectual property rights protecting our products. Despite our efforts to defend our products, litigation is inherently uncertain, and we cannot predict the timing or outcome of our efforts. If we are not successful in defending our intellectual property rights or opt to settle, or if a product’s marketing exclusivity rights expire or become otherwise unenforceable, our competitors could ultimately launch generic versions of our products, which could significantly decrease our revenues and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows as well as our share price. For a complete description of the related legal proceedings, see


	Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies


	 in the


	Consolidated Financial Statements


	, included in


	Part IV, Item 15 of this report "Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules"


	. As a result, there are currently ongoing legal proceedings brought by us and/or our subsidiaries, and in certain cases our third party partners, against manufacturers seeking FDA approval for generic versions of our products.




	If we fail to obtain exclusive marketing rights for our generic pharmaceutical products or fail to introduce these generic products on a timely basis, our revenues, gross margin and operating results may decline.




	The Hatch-Waxman amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act provide for a period of 180 days of marketing exclusivity for a generic version of a previously approved drug for any applicant that is first-to-file an ANDA containing a certification of invalidity, non-infringement or unenforceability related to a patent listed with respect to the corresponding brand-name drug (commonly referred to as a “Paragraph IV certification”). A large portion of our revenues for our U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals segment have been derived from the sales of generic drugs during such 180-day marketing exclusivity period permitted under the Hatch-Waxman Act and from the sale of other generic products for which there otherwise is limited competition. ANDAs that contain Paragraph IV certifications challenging patents, however, generally become the subject of patent litigation that can be both lengthy and costly. There is no certainty that we will prevail in any such litigation, that we will be the first-to-file and be granted the 180-day marketing exclusivity period, or, if we are granted the 180-day marketing exclusivity period, that we will not forfeit such period. Even where we are awarded marketing exclusivity, we may be required to share our exclusivity period with other ANDA applicants who submit Paragraph IV certifications. In addition, brand-name pharmaceutical companies often authorize a generic version of the corresponding brand-name drug to be sold during any period of marketing exclusivity that is awarded (described further below). Furthermore, timely commencement of the litigation by the patent owner imposes an automatic stay of ANDA approval by the FDA for 30 months, unless the case is decided in the ANDA applicant’s favor during that period. Finally, if the court decision is adverse to the ANDA applicant, the ANDA approval will be delayed until the challenged patent expires, and the applicant will not be granted the 180-day marketing exclusivity.




	The future profitability of our U.S. Generic Pharmaceutical segment depends, to a significant extent, upon our ability to introduce, on a timely basis, new generic products that are either the first-to-market (or among the first-to-market) or that otherwise can gain significant market share during the 180-day marketing period as permitted by the Hatch-Waxman Act. Our ability to timely bring our products to market is dependent upon, among other things, the timing of regulatory approval of our products, which to a large extent is outside of our control, as well as the timing of competing products. Our revenues and future profitability are dependent, in large part, upon our ability or the ability of our development partners to file, timely and effectively, ANDAs with the FDA or to enter into contractual relationships with other parties that have obtained marketing exclusivity. No assurances can be given that we will be able to develop and introduce commercially successful products in the future within the time constraints necessary to be successful. If we or our development partners are unable to continue to timely and effectively file ANDAs with the FDA or to partner with other parties that have obtained marketing exclusivity, our revenues and operating results may decline significantly and our prospects and business may be materially adversely affected.

	We may be the subject of product liability claims or product recalls, and we may be unable to obtain or maintain insurance adequate to cover potential liabilities.




	Our business exposes us to significant potential risk from product liability claims, other significant litigation matters, government investigations or product recalls, including, but not limited to, such matters associated with the testing, manufacturing, marketing and sale of our products. We have been in the past, and continue to be, subject to various product liability cases, other litigations and government investigations. In addition to direct expenditures for damages, settlement and defense costs, there is a possibility of adverse publicity, loss of revenues and disruption of business as a result of product liability claims or other litigation matters. Some plaintiffs have received substantial damage awards in some jurisdictions against pharmaceutical and/or medical device companies based upon claims for injuries allegedly caused by the use of their products. In addition, in the age of social media, plaintiffs’ attorneys have a wide variety of tools to advertise their services and solicit new clients for litigation. Thus, we could expect that any significant product liability litigation or mass tort in which we are a defendant will have a larger number of plaintiffs than such actions have seen historically because of the increasing use of wide-spread and media-varied advertising. In addition, it may be necessary for us to voluntarily or mandatorily recall or withdraw products that do not meet approved specifications or which subsequent data demonstrate may be unsafe or ineffective or misused. Any such recall or withdraw could result in adverse publicity, costs connected to the recall and loss of revenue. If we are found liable on a product liability claim or series of claims, defaults could be declared under our debt agreements, we could suffer reputational damage, and we could incur losses, any of which could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.




	Our pharmaceutical and medical device products may cause, or may appear to cause, serious adverse side effects or potentially dangerous drug interactions if misused, improperly prescribed or subject to faulty surgical technique. For example, we and/or certain of our subsidiaries, have been named as defendants in multiple lawsuits in various federal and state courts alleging personal injury resulting from use of transvaginal surgical mesh products designed to treat pelvic organ prolapse and stress urinary incontinence. Through our Astora Women’s Health Business (Astora), we and certain plaintiffs’ attorneys representing mesh-related product liability claimants have entered into various Master Settlement Agreements (MSAs) regarding settling up to approximately 


	49,000


	 filed and unfiled mesh claims handled or controlled by the participating attorneys. These MSAs, which were executed at various times since June 2013, were entered into solely by way of compromise and settlement and are not in any way an admission of liability or fault by us and/or any of our subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2016, our product liability accrual for vaginal mesh cases totaled 


	$963.1 million


	 for all known claims for which a liability is probable. We may be subject to additional liabilities arising out of these claims, and are responsible for the cost of managing these claims. In addition to claims covered by MSAs, we are currently aware of approximately


	9,700


	 claims that have been filed, asserted or that we believe are likely to be asserted that have not been accrued for because we lack sufficient information to determine whether any potential loss is probable. In addition, there may be other claims asserted in the future. It is currently not possible to estimate the number or validity of any such future claims. Although we believe there is a reasonable possibility that a loss in excess of the amount recognized exists, we are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss in excess of the amount accrued at this time.




	We cannot confirm to you that we will be able to obtain or maintain product liability insurance in the future on acceptable terms or with adequate coverage against potential liabilities or other losses such as the cost of a recall if any claim is brought against us, regardless of the success or failure of the claim. For example, we no longer have product liability insurance to cover the claims in connection with the mesh-related litigation described above. Additionally, we may be limited by the surviving insurance policies of our acquired subsidiaries, which may not be adequate to cover against potential liabilities or other losses. The failure to generate sufficient cash flow or to obtain other financing could affect our ability to pay the amounts due under those liabilities not covered by insurance. See


	Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies


	 in the


	Consolidated Financial Statements


	, included in


	Part IV, Item 15 of this report "Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules"


	 for further discussion of our product liability claims.




	Our ability to protect and maintain our proprietary and licensed third party technology, which is vital to our business, is uncertain.




	Our success, competitive position and future income will depend in part on our ability to obtain and protect patent rights relating to the technologies, processes and products we have developed and are currently developing and may develop in the future. Our policy is to seek patent protection for technologies, processes and products we own and to enforce the intellectual property rights we own and license. We cannot confirm to you that patent applications we submit and have submitted will result in patents being issued. If an invention qualifies as a joint invention, the joint inventor may have rights in the invention and we cannot confirm to you that the joint inventor will protect the intellectual property rights to the joint invention. We cannot confirm to you that a third party will not infringe upon, design around or develop uses not covered by any patent issued or licensed to us or that these patents will otherwise be commercially viable. In this regard, the patent position of pharmaceutical compounds and compositions is particularly uncertain. Even issued patents may later be modified or revoked by the PTO, by analogous foreign offices or in legal proceedings. Upon the expiration or loss of necessary intellectual property protection for a product, others may manufacture and distribute our patented products, which will result in a loss of a significant portion of our sales of that product.

	In addition, our success, particularly in our branded businesses, depends in part on the ability of our partners and suppliers to obtain, maintain and enforce patents, and protect trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, and other intellectual property and proprietary information. Our ability to commercialize any branded product successfully will largely depend upon our or any partner’s or supplier’s ability to obtain and maintain patents and trademarks of sufficient scope to lawfully prevent third-parties from developing and/or marketing infringing products.




	We cannot confirm to you as to the degree of protection any patents will afford, including whether the protection obtained will be of sufficient breadth and degree to protect our commercial interests in all the countries where we conduct business.






	Furthermore, we cannot confirm to you that our products will not infringe the patents or other intellectual property rights held by third parties. If we infringe the intellectual property rights of others, we could lose our right to develop, manufacture or sell products or we could be required to pay monetary damages or royalties to license proprietary rights from third parties. An adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or a failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing or selling our products.




	The Company also relies on trade secrets and other un-patented proprietary information, which it generally seeks to protect by confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with its employees, consultants, advisors and partners. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide the Company with an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure. In addition, if the Company’s employees, scientific consultants or partners develop inventions or processes that may be applicable to the Company’s products under development, such inventions and processes will not necessarily become the Company’s property, but may remain the property of those persons or their employers.




	Our competitors or other third parties may allege that we are infringing their intellectual property, forcing us to expend substantial resources in litigation, the outcome of which is uncertain. Any unfavorable outcome of such litigation, including losses related to “at-risk” product launches, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.




	Companies that produce branded pharmaceutical products routinely bring litigation against ANDA or similar applicants that seek regulatory approval to manufacture and market generic forms of their branded products alleging patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. Patent holders may also bring patent infringement suits against companies that are currently marketing and selling approved generic products. Litigation often involves significant expense and can delay or prevent introduction or sale of our generic products. If patents are held valid, enforceable and infringed by our products, we would, unless we could obtain a license from the patent holder, need to delay selling our corresponding generic product and, if we are already selling our product, cease selling and potentially destroy existing product stock.




	There may be situations in which we may make business and legal judgments to market and sell products that are subject to claims of alleged patent infringement prior to final resolution of those claims by the courts, based upon our belief that such patents are invalid, unenforceable, or are not infringed by our marketing and sale of such products. This is referred to in the pharmaceutical industry as an “at-risk” launch. The risk involved in an at-risk launch can be substantial because, if a patent holder ultimately prevails against us, the remedies available to such holder may include, among other things, damages measured by the profits lost by the patent holder, which can be significantly higher than the profits we make from selling the generic version of the product. Moreover, if a court determines that such infringement is willful, the damages could be subject to trebling. We could face substantial damages from adverse court decisions in such matters. We could also be at risk for the value of such inventory that we are unable to market or sell.




	Agreements between branded pharmaceutical companies and generic pharmaceutical companies are facing increased government scrutiny in the U.S. and abroad.




	We are involved in numerous patent litigations in which generic companies challenge the validity or enforceability of our products’ listed patents and/or the applicability of these patents to the generic applicant’s products. Likewise, our U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals segment is also involved in patent litigations in which we challenge the validity or enforceability of innovator companies’ listed patents and/or their applicability to our generic products. Therefore, settling patent litigations has been and is likely to continue to be part of our business. Parties to such settlement agreements in the U.S., including us, are required by law to file them with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the FTC) and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (DOJ) for review. The FTC has publicly stated that, in its view, such settlement agreements may violate the antitrust laws. In some instances, the FTC has brought actions against brand and generic companies that have entered into such agreements. Accordingly, we may receive formal or informal requests from the FTC for information about a particular settlement agreement, and there is a risk that the FTC may commence an action against us alleging violation of the antitrust laws.

	In addition, some members of Congress have proposed legislation that would limit the types of settlement agreements generic manufacturers can enter into with brand companies. In 2013, the Supreme Court, in


	FTC v. Actavis


	, determined that reverse payment patent settlements between generic and brand companies should be evaluated under the rule of reason, but provided limited guidance beyond the selection of this standard. Because the Supreme Court did not articulate the full range of criteria upon which a determination of legality of such settlements would be based or provide guidance on the precise circumstances under which such settlements would always qualify as legal, there may be extensive litigation over what constitutes a reasonable and lawful patent settlement between a brand and generic company. We are subject to multiple lawsuits purporting to be class actions brought by direct and indirect payers alleging that our settlement agreements respectively with Watson regarding the Lidoderm

	 ER patent litigation, were unlawful in violation of federal antitrust laws, as well as various state laws.




	We have significant goodwill and other intangible assets. Consequently, potential impairment of goodwill and other intangibles may significantly impact our profitability.




	Goodwill and other intangibles represent a significant portion of our assets. As of


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	, goodwill and other intangibles comprised approximately


	74%


	 and


	78%


	, respectively, of our total assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets are subject to an impairment analysis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Additionally, goodwill and indefinite-lived assets are subject to an impairment test at least annually. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recorded asset impairment charges of


	$3,781.2 million


	,


	$1,140.7 million


	 and


	$22.5 million


	, respectively, which related primarily to goodwill and other intangible assets. The procedures and assumptions used in our goodwill and intangible assets impairment testing, and the results of our testing, are discussed in


	Item 7 of this report "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"


	 under the captions “


	CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES


	” and “


	RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


	”.




	Events giving rise to impairment of goodwill or intangible assets are an inherent risk in the pharmaceutical industry and often cannot be predicted. As a result of the significance of goodwill and other intangible assets, our results of operations and financial position in a future period could be negatively impacted should additional impairments of our goodwill or other intangible assets occur.




	We are subject to various regulations pertaining to the marketing of our products and services


	.




	We are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse involving the marketing and pricing of our products and services, including prohibitions on the offer of payment or acceptance of kickbacks or other remuneration for the purchase of our products and services, including inducements to potential patients to request our products and services and inducements to healthcare professionals to prescribe and use our products. Additionally, product promotion, educational activities, support of continuing medical education programs, and other interactions with healthcare professionals must be conducted in a manner consistent with the FDA regulations and the Anti-Kickback Statute. The Anti-Kickback Statute, with certain exceptions or exemptions published by the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS-OIG), prohibits persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute also carry potential federal False Claims Act liability. Additionally, many states have adopted laws similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute, without identical exceptions or exemptions. Some of these state prohibitions apply to referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Any such new regulations or requirements may be difficult and expensive for us to comply with, may delay our introduction of new products, may adversely affect our total revenues and may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.




	Sanctions for violating these laws include criminal penalties and civil sanctions and possible exclusion from federal funded healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid as well as potential liability under the False Claims Act and applicable state false claims acts. There can be no assurance that our practices will not be challenged under these laws in the future, that changes in these laws or interpretation of these laws would not give rise to new challenges of our practices, or that any such challenge would not have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. Law enforcement agencies sometimes initiate investigations into sales, marketing and/or pricing practices based on preliminary information or evidence, and such investigations can be and often are closed without any enforcement action. Nevertheless, these types of investigations and any related litigation can result in: (i) large expenditures of cash for legal fees, payment of penalties, and compliance activities; (ii) limitations on operations; (iii) diversion of management resources; (iv) injury to our reputation; and (v) decreased demand for our products.

	In addition, our company is subject to statutory and regulatory restrictions on the promotion of uses of prescription drugs or devices that are not cleared or approved by the FDA. Although the FDA does not regulate a physician’s choice of medications, treatments or product uses, the FDCA and FDA regulations and guidance significantly restrict the ability of pharmaceutical and medical device companies to communicate with patients, physicians, and other third-parties about unapproved or uncleared product uses. FDA, FTC, the HHS-OIG, the DOJ and various state Attorneys General actively enforce state and federal prohibitions on the promotion of unapproved uses, as well as prohibitions against promotional practices deemed false or misleading. A company that is found to have improperly promoted its products under these laws may be subject to significant liability, including significant administrative, civil, and criminal sanctions, including but not limited to significant civil damages, criminal fines, and exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal healthcare programs. Applicable laws governing product promotion also provide for administrative, civil, and criminal liability for individuals, including, in some circumstances, potential strict vicarious liability. Conduct giving rise to such liability could also form the basis for private civil litigation by third-party payers or other persons allegedly harmed by such conduct.




	We have established and implemented a corporate compliance program designed to prevent, detect, and correct violations of state and federal healthcare laws, including laws related to advertising and promotion of our drugs and devices. Nonetheless, the FDA, FTC, HHS-OIG, the DOJ and/or the state Attorneys General, and 


	qui tam


	 relators may take the position that we are not in compliance with such requirements, and, if such non-compliance is proven, the Company and, in some cases, individual employees, may be subject to significant liability, including the aforementioned administrative, civil, and criminal sanctions.




	Furthermore, in February 2014, we entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) with the U.S. Department of Justice and a Corporate Integrity Agreement (CIA) with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to resolve allegations regarding the promotion of Lidoderm



	®



	. In March 2013, our subsidiary, Par, entered into a CIA and a Plea Agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice to resolve allegations regarding the promotion of Megace ES



	®



	. Those agreements place certain obligations on us related to the marketing of our branded pharmaceutical products and our healthcare regulatory compliance program, including reporting requirements to the U.S. government, detailed requirements for our compliance program, code of conduct, and policies and procedures, and the requirement to engage an Independent Review Organization. We have implemented procedures and practices to comply with the CIA, including the engagement of an Independent Review Organization. In the event we breach the DPA, the Plea Agreement, and/or the CIA, there is a risk the government would seek remedies provided for in those agreements, including instituting criminal prosecution against us, seeking to impose stipulated penalties, or seeking to exclude us from participation in Federal health care programs.




	The pharmaceutical industry is heavily regulated, which creates uncertainty about our ability to bring new products to market and imposes substantial compliance costs on our business


	.




	Governmental authorities such as the FDA impose substantial requirements on the development, manufacture, holding, labeling, marketing, advertising, promotion, distribution and sale of therapeutic pharmaceutical products through lengthy and detailed laboratory and clinical testing and other costly and time-consuming procedures. In addition, before obtaining regulatory approvals for certain generic products, we must conduct limited bioequivalence studies and other research to show comparability to the branded products. A failure to obtain satisfactory results in required pre-marketing trials may prevent us from obtaining required regulatory approvals. The FDA may also require companies to conduct post-approval studies and post-approval surveillance regarding their drug products and to report adverse events.




	Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the sale of any of our new product candidates, we must demonstrate through preclinical studies and clinical trials that the product is safe and effective for each intended use. Preclinical and clinical studies may fail to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of a product. Likewise, we may not be able to demonstrate through clinical trials that a product candidate’s therapeutic benefits outweigh its risks. Even promising results from preclinical and early clinical studies do not always accurately predict results in later, large scale trials. A failure to demonstrate safety and efficacy could or would result in our failure to obtain regulatory approvals. Clinical trials can be delayed for reasons outside of our control, which can lead to increased development costs and delays in regulatory approval. For example, there is substantial competition to enroll patients in clinical trials, and such competition has delayed clinical development of our products in the past. For example, patients may not enroll in clinical trials at the rate expected or patients may drop out after enrolling in the trials or during the trials. In addition, we rely on collaboration partners that may control or make changes in trial protocol and design enhancements, or encounter clinical trial compliance-related issues, which may also delay clinical trials. Product supplies may be delayed or be insufficient to treat the patients participating in the clinical trials, or manufacturers or suppliers may not meet the requirements of the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, such as those relating to Current Good Manufacturing Practices. We also may experience delays in obtaining, or we may not obtain, required initial and continuing approval of our clinical trials from institutional review boards. We cannot confirm to you that we will not experience delays or undesired results in these or any other of our clinical trials.








	27









	Table of Contents









	We cannot confirm to you that the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies will approve, clear for marketing or certify any products developed by us or that such approval will not subject the marketing of our products to certain limits on indicated use. The FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may not agree with our assessment of the clinical data or they may interpret it differently. Such regulatory authorities may require additional or expanded clinical trials. Any limitation on use imposed by the FDA or delay in or failure to obtain FDA approvals or clearances of products developed by us would adversely affect the marketing of these products and our ability to generate product revenue, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.




	In addition, with respect specifically to pharmaceutical products, the submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) or ANDA to the FDA with supporting clinical safety and efficacy data, for example, does not guarantee that the FDA will grant approval to market the product. Meeting the FDA’s regulatory requirements to obtain approval to market a drug product, which varies substantially based on the type, complexity and novelty of the pharmaceutical product, typically takes years and is subject to uncertainty.




	Additional delays may result if an FDA Advisory Committee or other regulatory authority recommends non-approval or restrictions on approval. Although the FDA is not required to follow the recommendations of its Advisory Committees, it usually does. A negative Advisory Committee meeting could signal a lower likelihood of approval, although the FDA may still end up approving our application. Regardless of an Advisory Committee meeting outcome or the FDA’s final approval decision, public presentation of our data may shed positive or negative light on our application. With respect to our Supplemental New Drug Application for OPANA



	®



	 ER, the FDA has scheduled a Joint Meeting of the Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee and the Anesthetic and Analgesic Drug Products Advisory Committee in March 2017, to discuss pre- and post-marketing data about the abuse of OPANA



	®



	 ER and the overall risk-benefit of this product. The Advisory Committees also will discuss abuse of generic oxymorphone ER and oxymorphone immediate-release (IR) products. The Advisory Committees will likely make recommendations to the FDA as to whether additional measures should be taken to control the abuse potential of these products, including a possible recommendation to remove these products from U.S. markets.




	Some drugs are available in the United States that are not the subject of an FDA-approved NDA. In 2011, the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (“CDER”) Office of Compliance modified its enforcement policy with regard to the marketing of such “unapproved” marketed drugs. Under CDER’s revised guidance, the FDA encourages manufacturers to obtain NDA approvals for such drugs by requiring unapproved versions to be removed from the market after an approved version has been introduced, subject to a grace period at the FDA’s discretion. This grace period is intended to allow an orderly transition of supply to the market and to mitigate any potential related drug shortage. Depending on the length of the grace period and the time it takes for subsequent applications to be approved, this may result in a period of de facto market exclusivity to the first manufacturer that has obtained an approved NDA for the previously unapproved marketed drug. We may seek FDA approval for certain unapproved marketed drug products through the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. Even if we receive approval for an NDA under Section 505(b)(2), the FDA may not take timely enforcement action against companies marketing unapproved versions of the drug; therefore, we cannot be sure that that we will receive the benefit of any de facto exclusive marketing period or that we will fully recoup the expenses incurred to obtain an approval. In addition, certain competitors and others have objected to the FDA’s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2). If the FDA’s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2) is successfully challenged, this could delay or even prevent the FDA from approving any NDA that we submit under Section 505(b)(2).




	Moreover, even if our product candidates are approved under Section 505(b)(2), the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the products may be marketed or to other conditions of approval, or may contain requirements for costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the products.




	The ANDA approval process for a new product varies in time, generally requiring a minimum of 10 months following submission of the ANDA to FDA, but could also take several years from the date of application. The timing for the ANDA approval process for generic products is difficult to estimate and can vary significantly. ANDA approvals, if granted, may not include all uses (known as indications) for which a company may seek to market a product.




	Further, once a product is approved or cleared for marketing, failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in, among other things, suspensions or withdrawals of approvals or clearances, seizures or recalls of products, injunctions against the manufacture, holding, distribution, marketing and sale of a product, and civil and criminal sanctions. Furthermore, changes in existing regulations or the adoption of new regulations could prevent us from obtaining, or affect the timing of, future regulatory approvals or clearances. Meeting regulatory requirements and evolving government standards may delay marketing of our new products for a considerable period of time, impose costly procedures upon our activities and result in a competitive advantage to larger companies that compete against us.




	Based on scientific developments, post-market experience, or other legislative or regulatory changes, the current FDA standards of review for approving new pharmaceutical products, or new indications or uses for approved or cleared products, are sometimes more stringent than those that were applied in the past.








	28









	Table of Contents









	Some new or evolving FDA review standards or conditions for approval or clearance were not applied to many established products currently on the market, including certain opioid products. As a result, the FDA does not have as extensive safety databases on these products as on some products developed more recently. Accordingly, we believe the FDA has expressed an intention to develop such databases for certain of these products, including many opioids. In particular, the FDA has expressed interest in specific chemical structures that may be present as impurities in a number of opioid narcotic active pharmaceutical ingredients, such as oxycodone, which based on certain structural characteristics and laboratory tests may indicate the potential for having mutagenic effects. FDA has required, and may continue to require, more stringent controls of the levels of these impurities in drug products for approval.




	Also, the FDA may require labeling revisions, formulation or manufacturing changes and/or product modifications for new or existing products containing such impurities. The FDA’s more stringent requirements, together with any additional testing or remedial measures that may be necessary, could result in increased costs for, or delays in, obtaining approval for certain of our products in development. Although we do not believe that the FDA would seek to remove a currently marketed product from the market unless such mutagenic effects are believed to indicate a significant risk to patient health, we cannot make any such assurance.




	In May of 2016, an FDA advisory panel recommended mandatory training of all physicians who prescribe opioids on the risks of prescription opioids. In 2016, the CDC also issued a guideline for prescribing opioids for chronic pain that provides recommendations for primary care clinicians who are prescribing opioids for chronic pain outside of active cancer treatment, palliative care, and end-of-life care. In addition, state health departments and boards of pharmacy have authority to regulate distribution and may modify their regulations with respect to prescription narcotics in an attempt to curb abuse. In either case, any such new regulations or requirements may be difficult and expensive for us to comply with, may delay our introduction of new products, may adversely affect our total revenues and may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.




	The FDA has the authority to require companies to undertake additional post-approval studies to assess known or signaled safety risks and to make any labeling changes to address those risks. The FDA also can require companies to formulate approved Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) to confirm a drug’s benefits outweigh its risks. For example, in 2011, we, along with other manufacturers of long-acting and extended-release opioid drug products, received a letter from the FDA requiring that we develop and submit to the FDA a post-market REMS plan for our OPANA



	®



	 ER, morphine sulfate ER, and oxycodone ER drug products to require that training is provided to prescribers of these products, and that information is provided to prescribers that they can use in counseling patients about the risks and benefits of opioid drug use. In December 2011, the FDA approved our interim REMS for OPANA



	®



	 ER, which was subsequently superseded by the class-wide extended-release/long-acting REMS approved in July 2012. The goal of this REMS is to reduce serious adverse outcomes resulting from inappropriate prescribing, misuse and abuse of extended-release or long-acting opioid analgesics while maintaining patient access to pain medications. The REMS includes a Medication Guide, Elements to Assure Safe Use and annual REMS Assessment Reports.




	The FDA’s exercise of its authority under the FFDCA could result in delays or increased costs during product development, clinical trials and regulatory review, increased costs to comply with additional post-approval regulatory requirements and potential restrictions on sales of approved products. Foreign regulatory agencies often have similar authority and may impose comparable requirements and costs. Post-marketing studies and other emerging data about marketed products, such as adverse event reports, may also adversely affect sales of our products. Furthermore, the discovery of significant safety or efficacy concerns or problems with a product in the same therapeutic class as one of our products that implicate or appear to implicate the entire class of products could have an adverse effect on sales of our product or, in some cases, result in product withdrawals. The FDA has continuing authority over the approval of an NDA or ANDA and may withdraw approval if, among other reasons, post-marketing clinical or other experience, tests or data show that a drug is unsafe for use under the conditions upon which it was approved, or if FDA determines that there is a lack of substantial evidence of the drug’s efficacy under the conditions described in its labeling. Furthermore, new data and information, including information about product misuse or abuse at the user level, may lead government agencies, professional societies, practice management groups or patient or trade organizations to recommend or publish guidance or guidelines related to the use of our products, which may lead to reduced sales of our products.




	The FDA and the DEA have important and complementary responsibilities with respect to our business. The FDA administers an application and post-approval monitoring process to confirm that products that are available in the market are safe, effective and consistently of uniform, high quality. The DEA administers registration, drug allotment and accountability systems to satisfy against loss and diversion of controlled substances. Both agencies have trained investigators that routinely, or for cause, conduct inspections, and both have authority to seek to enforce their statutory authority and regulations through administrative remedies as well as civil and criminal enforcement actions.








	29









	Table of Contents









	The FDA regulates and monitors the quality of drug clinical trials to provide human subject protection and to support marketing applications. The FDA may place a hold on a clinical trial and may cause a suspension or withdrawal of product approvals if regulatory standards are not maintained. The FDA also regulates the facilities, processes, and procedures used to manufacture and market pharmaceutical products in the U.S. Manufacturing facilities must be registered with the FDA and all products made in such facilities must be manufactured in accordance with the latest cGMP regulations, which are enforced by the FDA. Compliance with clinical trial requirements and cGMP regulations requires the dedication of substantial resources and requires significant expenditures. In the event an approved manufacturing facility for a particular drug is required by the FDA to curtail or cease operations, or otherwise becomes inoperable, or a third party contract manufacturing facility faces manufacturing problems, obtaining the required FDA authorization to manufacture at the same or a different manufacturing site could result in production delays, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.




	The FDA is authorized to perform inspections of U.S. and foreign facilities under the FFDCA. At the end of such an inspection, FDA could issue a Form 483 Notice of Inspectional Observations, which could cause us to modify certain activities identified during the inspection. Following such inspections, the FDA may issue an untitled letter as an initial correspondence that cites violations that do not meet the threshold of regulatory significance of a Warning Letter. FDA guidelines also provide for the issuance of Warning Letters for violations of “regulatory significance” for which the failure to adequately and promptly achieve correction may be expected to result in an enforcement action. FDA also may issue Warning Letters and untitled letters in connection with events or circumstances unrelated to an FDA inspection.




	Similar to other healthcare companies, during 2016, our facilities, in multiple countries, across the full range of our business units, were subject to routine and new-product related inspections by the FDA, MHRA, HPRA and Health Canada. Some of these inspections resulted in non-critical inspection observations (including FDA Form 483 observations). We have responded to all inspection observations within the required time frame and have implemented, or are continuing to implement, the corrective action plans as agreed with the relevant regulatory agencies.




	Many of our core products contain controlled substances. The stringent DEA regulations on our use of controlled substances include restrictions on their use in research, manufacture, distribution and storage. A breach of these regulations could result in imposition of civil penalties, refusal to renew or action to revoke necessary registrations, or other restrictions on operations involving controlled substances. In addition, failure to comply with applicable legal requirements subjects the manufacturing facilities of our subsidiaries and manufacturing partners to possible legal or regulatory action, including shutdown. Any such shutdown may adversely affect their ability to supply us with product and thus, our ability to market affected products. This could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and competitive position. See also the risk described under the caption “The DEA limits the availability of the active ingredients used in many of our current products and products in development, as well as the production of these products, and, as a result, our procurement and production quotas may not be sufficient to meet commercial demand or complete clinical trials.” In addition, we are subject to the Federal Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA). The U.S. government has enacted DSCSA which requires development of an electronic pedigree to track and trace each prescription drug at the salable unit level through the distribution system, which will be effective incrementally over a 10-year period. Compliance with DSCSA and future U.S. federal or state electronic pedigree requirements may increase our operational expenses and impose significant administrative burdens.




	We cannot determine what effect changes in regulations or legal interpretations or requirements by the FDA or the courts, when and if promulgated or issued, may have on our business in the future. Changes could, among other things, require different labeling, monitoring of patients, interaction with physicians, education programs for patients or physicians, curtailment of necessary supplies, or limitations on product distribution. These changes, or others required by the FDA or DEA could have an adverse effect on the sales of these products. The evolving and complex nature of regulatory science and regulatory requirements, the broad authority and discretion of the FDA and the generally high level of regulatory oversight results in a continuing possibility that, from time to time, we will be adversely affected by regulatory actions despite our ongoing efforts and commitment to achieve and maintain full compliance with all regulatory requirements.




	The success of our acquisition and licensing strategy is subject to uncertainty and any completed acquisitions or licenses may reduce our earnings, be difficult to integrate, not perform as expected or require us to obtain additional financing.




	We regularly evaluate selective acquisitions and look to continue to enhance our product line by acquiring rights to additional products and compounds. Such acquisitions may be carried out through corporate acquisitions, asset acquisitions, licensing and joint venture arrangements or by acquiring other companies. However, we cannot confirm to you that we will be able to complete acquisitions that meet our target criteria on satisfactory terms, if at all. In particular, we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates. In addition, any acquisition of assets and rights to products and compounds may fail to accomplish our strategic objective and may not perform as expected. Further, if we are unable to maintain, on commercially reasonable terms, product, compound or other licenses that we have acquired, our ability to develop or commercially exploit our products may be inhibited. In order to continue to develop and broaden our product range we must compete to acquire these assets. Our competitors may have greater resources than us and therefore be better able to complete acquisitions or may cause the ultimate price we pay for acquisitions to increase. If we fail to achieve our acquisition goals, our growth may be limited.

	In addition to the risks related to acquisition of assets and products, acquisitions of companies may expose us to additional risks, which are beyond our control, and may have a material adverse effect on our profitability and cash flows. The combination of two independent businesses is a complex, costly and time-consuming process. As a result, we may be required to devote significant management attention and resources to the integration of an acquired business into our practices and operations. Any integration process may be disruptive and, if implemented ineffectively, may restrict the realization of the full expected benefits.




	In addition, any acquisitions we make may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses and loss of customer relationships. The difficulties of combining operations of companies include, among others:













	•






	diversion of management’s attention to integration matters;
















	•






	difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects from the combination of the businesses;
















	•






	difficulties in the integration of operations and systems;
















	•






	difficulties in conforming standards, controls, procedures and accounting and other policies, business cultures and compensation structures between the companies;
















	•






	difficulties in the assimilation of employees;
















	•






	difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex company;
















	•






	challenges in retaining existing customers and obtaining new customers;
















	•






	potential unknown liabilities or larger liabilities than projected, adverse consequences and unforeseen increased expenses associated with the merger; and
















	•






	difficulties in coordinating a geographically dispersed organization.







	The benefits of a merger are also subject to a variety of other factors, many of which are beyond our ability to control, such as changes in the rate of economic growth in jurisdictions in which the combined company will do business, the financial performance of the combined business in various jurisdictions, currency exchange rate fluctuations, and significant changes in trade, monetary or fiscal policies, including changes in interest rates, and tax law of the jurisdictions in which the combined company will do business. The impact of these factors, individually and in the aggregate, is difficult to predict, in part because the occurrence of the events or circumstances described in such factors may be interrelated, and the impact to the combined company of the occurrence of any one of these events or circumstances could be compounded or, alternatively, reduced, offset, or more than offset, by the occurrence of one or more of the other events or circumstances described in such factors.




	In addition, based on current acquisition prices in the pharmaceutical industry, acquisitions could decrease our net income per share and add significant intangible assets and related amortization or impairment charges. Our acquisition strategy may require us to obtain additional debt or equity financing, resulting in leverage, increased debt obligations as compared to equity, or dilution of ownership. We may not be able to finance acquisitions on terms satisfactory to us.




	We may decide to sell assets, which could adversely affect our prospects and opportunities for growth.




	We may from time to time consider selling certain assets if (i) we determine that such assets are not critical to our strategy or (ii) we believe the opportunity to monetize the asset is attractive or for various other reasons, including for the reduction of indebtedness. We have explored and will continue to explore the sale of certain non-core assets. Although our expectation is to engage in asset sales only if they advance or otherwise support our overall strategy, any such sale could reduce the size or scope of our business, our market share in particular markets or our opportunities with respect to certain markets, products or therapeutic categories. As a result, any such sale could have an adverse effect on our business, prospects and opportunities for growth, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.




	Our growth and development will depend on developing, commercializing and marketing new products, including both our own products and those developed with our collaboration partners. If we do not do so successfully, our growth and development will be impaired.




	Our future revenues and profitability will depend, to a significant extent, upon our ability to successfully commercialize new branded and generic pharmaceutical products protected by patent or statutory authority in a timely manner. As a result, we must continually develop, test and manufacture new products, which must meet regulatory standards to receive requisite marketing authorizations. Products we are currently developing may or may not receive the regulatory approvals or clearances necessary for us to market them. Furthermore, the development and commercialization process is time-consuming and costly, and we cannot confirm to you that any of our products, if and when developed and approved, can be successfully commercialized.




	In addition, risks associated with developing, commercializing and marketing new products are beyond our control. For example, some of our collaboration partners may decide to make substantial changes to a product’s formulation or design, may experience financial difficulties or may have limited financial resources. Any of the foregoing may delay the development, commercialization and/or marketing of new products. In addition, if a co-developer on a new product terminates our collaboration agreement or does not perform under the agreement, we may experience delays and additional costs in developing and marketing that product.

	We conduct research and development of medical and technological products to enable us to manufacture and market pharmaceutical products in accordance with specific government regulations. Much of our drug development effort is focused on technically difficult-to-formulate products and/or products that require advanced manufacturing technology. Typically, expenses related to research, development and regulatory approval of compounds for our branded pharmaceutical products are significantly greater than those expenses associated with generic products. As we continue to develop new products, our research expenses will likely increase. Because of the inherent risk associated with research and development efforts in the healthcare industry, particularly with respect to new drugs, our research and development expenditures may not result in the successful regulatory approval and introduction of new pharmaceutical products. Also, after we submit a regulatory application, the relevant governmental health authority may require that we conduct additional studies, including, studies to assess the product’s interaction with alcohol. As a result, we may be unable to reasonably predict the total research and development costs to develop a particular product.




	The availability of third party reimbursement for our products is uncertain, and thus we may find it difficult to maintain current price levels. Additionally, the market may not accept those products for which third party reimbursement is not adequately provided


	.




	Our ability to commercialize our products depends, in part, on the extent to which reimbursement for the costs of these products is available from government healthcare programs, such as Medicaid and Medicare, private health insurers and others. We cannot be certain that, over time, third party reimbursements for our products will be adequate for us to maintain price levels sufficient for realization of an appropriate return on our investment. Government payers, private insurers and other third party payers are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by (1) limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement (including adjusting co-pays) for products approved for marketing by the FDA, (2) refusing, in some cases, to provide any coverage for uses of approved products for indications for which the FDA has not granted marketing approval and (3) requiring or encouraging, through more favorable reimbursement levels or otherwise, the substitution of generic alternatives to branded products.




	We may experience pricing pressure on the price of our products due to social or political pressure to lower the cost of drugs, which would reduce our revenue and future profitability.




	We may experience downward pricing pressure on the price of our products due to social or political pressure to lower the cost of drugs, which would reduce our revenue and future profitability. Recent events have resulted in increased public and governmental scrutiny of the cost of drugs, especially in connection with price increases following companies’ acquisition of the rights to certain drug products. In particular, U.S. federal prosecutors have issued subpoenas to pharmaceutical companies seeking information about drug pricing practices. In addition, the U.S. Senate is publicly investigating a number of pharmaceutical companies relating to drug-price increases and pricing practices. Our revenue and future profitability could be negatively affected if these inquiries were to result in legislative or regulatory proposals that limit our ability to increase the prices of our products.




	In addition, in September 2016, a group of U.S. Senators introduced legislation that would require pharmaceutical manufacturers to justify price increases of more than 10% in a 12-month period, and a large number of individual States have introduced legislation aimed at drug pricing regulation, transparency or both. Our revenue and future profitability could be negatively affected by the passage of these laws or similar federal or state legislation. Pressure from social activist groups and future government regulations may also put downward pressure on the price of drugs, which could result in downward pressure on the prices of our products in the future.




	Our business is highly dependent upon market perceptions of us, our brands, and the safety and quality of our products, and may be adversely impacted by negative publicity or findings.




	Market perceptions of us are very important to our business, especially market perceptions of our company and brands and the safety and quality of our products. If we, our partners and suppliers, or our brands suffer from negative publicity, or if any of our products or similar products which other companies distribute are subject to market withdrawal or recall or are proven to be, or are claimed to be, ineffective or harmful to consumers, then this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.




	For example, the pharmaceutical drug supply has been increasingly challenged by the vulnerability of distribution channels to illegal counterfeiting and the presence of counterfeit products in a growing number of markets and over the Internet. Third parties may illegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of our products that do not meet the rigorous manufacturing and testing standards that our products undergo. Counterfeit products are frequently unsafe or ineffective, and can be potentially life-threatening. Counterfeit medicines may contain harmful substances, the wrong dose of API or no API at all. However, to distributors and users, counterfeit products may be visually indistinguishable from the authentic version.

	In addition, negative posts or comments about us on any social networking web site could seriously damage our reputation. The inappropriate use of certain social media vehicles could cause brand damage or information leakage or could lead to legal implications from the improper collection and/or dissemination of personally identifiable information or the improper dissemination of material non-public information.




	We are dependent on market perceptions, and negative publicity associated with product quality, patient illness, or other adverse effects resulting from, or perceived to be resulting from, our products, or our partners’ and suppliers’ manufacturing facilities, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.




	Our reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and other governmental drug pricing programs are complex and may involve subjective decisions. Any failure to comply with those obligations could subject us to penalties and sanctions.




	We are subject to federal and state laws prohibiting the presentation (or the causing to be presented) of claims for payment (by Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payers) that are determined to be false or fraudulent, including presenting a claim for an item or service that was not provided. These false claims statutes include the federal civil False Claims Act, which permits private persons to bring suit in the name of the government alleging false or fraudulent claims presented to or paid by the government (or other violations of the statutes) and to share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. Such suits, known as


	qui tam


	 actions, have increased significantly in the healthcare industry in recent years. These actions against pharmaceutical companies, which do not require proof of a specific intent to defraud the government, may result in payment of fines to and/or administrative exclusion from the Medicare, Medicaid, and/or other government healthcare programs.




	We are subject to laws that require us to enter into a Medicaid Drug Rebate Agreement and a 340B Pharmaceutical Pricing Agreement as a condition for having our products eligible for payment under Medicare Part B and Medicaid. We have entered into such agreements. In addition, we are required to report certain pricing information to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) on a periodic basis to allow for accurate determination of rebates owed under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Agreement, of ceiling prices under the 340B program and certain other government pricing arrangements, and of reimbursement rates for certain drugs paid under Medicare Part B. On February 1, 2016, CMS issued a Final Rule implementing the Medicaid Drug Rebate provisions incorporated into the PPACA, effective April 1, 2016 in most instances. Implementation of the Final Rule required operational adjustments by us in order to maintain compliance with applicable law. Changes included in the Final Rule revised how manufacturers calculate Average Manufacturer Price (AMP) and Best Price and also affect the quarterly amounts that we owe to state Medicaid programs through the Medicaid Drug Rebate program. Also, CMS made changes with respect to how certain products are categorized for purposes of the Medicaid Drug Rebate program (i.e., single source, innovator multiple source, or non-innovator multiple source), which could affect the rebate calculation methodology, and thus the level of rebates incurred for affected products. In addition, CMS finalized its proposal to change the reimbursement metrics upon which Medicaid agencies are required to reimburse for covered outpatient drugs. The new reimbursement structure could adversely affect providers’ reimbursement for our products, and thus could adversely affect sales of our products. The Final Rule also expanded the scope of the Medicaid Drug Rebate program to apply to U.S. Territories, effective April 1, 2020, which will require operational adjustments and may result in additional rebate liability. Finally, CMS withdrew its proposed definition of “line extension” set forth in the 2012 proposed rule regarding the Medicaid Drug Rebate program and opened a new 60-day comment period soliciting views on how to interpret the relevant PPACA provisions. Additional operational adjustments and financial implications may result upon CMS’ finalization of “line extension” provisions.




	We and other pharmaceutical companies have been defendants in a number of lawsuits filed by various government entities, alleging generally that we and numerous other pharmaceutical companies reported false pricing information in connection with certain drugs that are reimbursable by state Medicaid programs, which are partially funded by the federal government. There is a risk the Company will be subject to similar investigations or litigations in the future and that the Company will suffer adverse decisions or verdicts of substantial amounts or that the Company will enter into monetary settlements. Any unfavorable outcomes as a result of such future litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.




	There is additional uncertainty surrounding the healthcare insurance coverage mandate that went into effect in the U.S. in 2015 and continued into 2016. Employers may seek to reduce costs by reducing or eliminating employer group healthcare plans or transferring a greater portion of healthcare costs to their employees. Job losses or other economic hardships may also result in reduced levels of coverage for some individuals, potentially resulting in lower levels of healthcare coverage for themselves or their families. These economic conditions may affect patients’ ability to afford healthcare as a result of increased co-pay or deductible obligations, greater cost sensitivity to existing co-pay or deductible obligations, lost healthcare insurance coverage or for other reasons. We believe such conditions could lead to changes in patient behavior and spending patterns that negatively affect usage of certain of our products, including some patients delaying treatment, rationing prescription medications, leaving prescriptions unfilled, reducing the frequency of visits to healthcare facilities, utilizing alternative therapies, or foregoing healthcare insurance coverage. Such changes may result in reduced demand for our products, which could materially and adversely affect the sales of our products, our business and results of operations.

	Our customer concentration may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.




	We primarily sell our products to a limited number of wholesale drug distributors and large pharmacy chains. In turn, these wholesale drug distributors and large pharmacy chains supply products to pharmacies, hospitals, governmental agencies and physicians. In addition, this distribution network is continuing to undergo significant consolidation marked by mergers and acquisitions among wholesale drug distributors and large pharmacy chains. We expect that consolidation of wholesale drug distributors and large pharmacy chains will increase pricing and other competitive pressures on pharmaceutical companies, including us. Total revenues from customers who accounted for 10% or more of our total revenues during the three years ended December 31 are as follows:

	Revenues from these customers are included within our U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals, U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals and International Pharmaceuticals segments. If we were to lose the business of any of these customers, or if any were to experience difficulty in paying us on a timely basis, our total revenues, profitability and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.




	We are currently dependent on outside manufacturers for the manufacture of a significant amount of our products; therefore, we have and will continue to have limited control of the manufacturing process and related costs. Certain of our manufacturers currently constitute the sole source of one or more of our products.




	Third party manufacturers currently manufacture a significant amount of our products pursuant to contractual arrangements. Certain of our manufacturers currently constitute the sole source of our products. For example, Teikoku is our sole source of Lidoderm



	®



	 and Grünenthal GmbH (Grünenthal) is our sole source for one of our formulations of OPANA



	®



	 ER. Because of contractual restraints and the lead-time necessary to obtain FDA approval, and possibly DEA registration, of a new manufacturer, replacement of any of these manufacturers may be expensive and time consuming and may cause interruptions in our supply of products to customers. As a result, any such delay could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.




	Because many of our products are manufactured by third parties, we have a limited ability to control the manufacturing process or costs related to the process. Increases in the prices we pay our manufacturers, interruptions in our supply of products or lapses in quality could adversely impact our margins, profitability and cash flows. We are reliant on our third party manufacturers to maintain the facilities at which they manufacture our products in compliance with FDA, DEA, state and local regulations. If they fail to maintain compliance with FDA, DEA or other critical regulations, they could be ordered to cease manufacturing, or product may be recalled, which would have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Additionally, if any facility that manufactures our products experiences a natural disaster, we could experience a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition to FDA and DEA regulation, violation of standards enforced by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and their counterpart agencies at the state level could slow down or curtail operations of third party manufacturers.




	In addition, we may consider entering into additional manufacturing arrangements with third party manufacturers. In each case, we will incur significant costs in obtaining the regulatory approvals and taking other necessary steps to begin commercial production by these manufacturers. If the market for the products manufactured by these third parties substantially contracts or disappears, we will continue to be financially obligated under these contracts. Such an obligation could have a material adverse effect on our business.

	We are dependent on third parties to supply all raw materials used in our products and to provide services for certain core aspects of our business. Any interruption or failure by these suppliers, distributors and collaboration partners to meet their obligations pursuant to various agreements with us could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.




	We rely on third parties to supply all raw materials used in our products. In addition, we rely on third party suppliers, distributors and collaboration partners to provide services for certain core aspects of our business, including manufacturing, warehousing, distribution, customer service support, medical affairs services, clinical studies, sales and other technical and financial services. All third party suppliers and contractors are subject to FDA, and very often DEA, requirements. Our business and financial viability are dependent on the continued supply of goods and services by these third party suppliers, the regulatory compliance of these third parties, and on the strength, validity and terms of our various contracts with these third party manufacturers, distributors and collaboration partners. Any interruption or failure by our suppliers, distributors and collaboration partners to meet their obligations pursuant to various agreements with us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, we have entered into minimum purchase requirement contracts with some of our third party raw material suppliers. If the market for the products that utilize these raw materials substantially contracts or disappears, we will continue to be financially obligated under these contracts and meeting such obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business.




	We are dependent upon third parties to provide us with various estimates as a basis for our financial reporting. While we undertake certain procedures to review the reasonableness of this information, we cannot obtain absolute assurance over the accounting methods and controls over the information provided to us by third parties. As a result, we are at risk of them providing us with erroneous data which could have a material adverse impact on our business and or reporting.




	If our manufacturing facilities are unable to manufacture our products or the manufacturing process is interrupted due to failure to comply with regulations or for other reasons, it could have a material adverse impact on our business.




	If any of our manufacturing facilities fail to comply with regulatory requirements or encounter other manufacturing difficulties, it could adversely affect our ability to supply products. All facilities and manufacturing processes used for the manufacture of pharmaceutical products are subject to inspection by regulatory agencies at any time and must be operated in conformity with cGMP and, in the case of controlled substances, DEA regulations. Compliance with the FDA’s cGMP and DEA requirements applies to both drug products seeking regulatory approval and to approved drug products. In complying with cGMP requirements, pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities must continually expend significant time, money and effort in production, record-keeping and quality assurance and control so that their products meet applicable specifications and other requirements for product safety, efficacy and quality. Failure to comply with applicable legal requirements subjects our manufacturing facilities to possible legal or regulatory action, including shutdown, which may adversely affect our ability to supply the product. Were we not able to manufacture products at our manufacturing facilities because of regulatory, business or any other reasons, the manufacture and marketing of these products would be interrupted. This could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operation, financial condition, cash flows and competitive position.




	For example, our Horsham facility and the facilities of the manufacturer that we are in the process of qualifying as an alternate manufacturer for XIAFLEX



	®



	 (such manufacturer, the “Proposed Alternate Manufacturer” and such facility, the “Proposed Alternate Facility”) are subject to such regulatory requirements and oversight. If we or the Proposed Alternate Manufacturer fail to comply with cGMP requirements, we may not be permitted to sell our products or may be limited in the jurisdictions in which we are permitted to sell them. Further, if an inspection by regulatory authorities indicates that there are deficiencies, including non-compliance with regulatory requirements, we could be required to take remedial actions, stop production or close our Horsham facility or the Proposed Alternate Facility, which would disrupt the manufacturing processes, limit the supplies of XIAFLEX



	®



	 and delay clinical trials and subsequent licensure, and/or limit the sale of commercial supplies. In addition, future noncompliance with any applicable regulatory requirements may result in refusal by regulatory authorities to allow use of XIAFLEX



	®



	 in clinical trials, refusal of the government to allow distribution of XIAFLEX



	®



	 within the U.S. or other jurisdictions, criminal prosecution and fines, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, prohibitions or limitations on the commercial sale of products, refusal to allow the entering into of federal and state supply contracts, and follow-on civil litigation.

	The DEA limits the availability of the active ingredients used in many of our current products and products in development, as well as the production of these products, and, as a result, our procurement and production quotas may not be sufficient to meet commercial demand or complete clinical trials


	.




	The DEA regulates chemical compounds as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances, with Schedule I substances considered to present the highest risk of substance abuse and Schedule V substances the lowest risk. The active ingredients in some of our current products and products in development, including oxycodone, oxymorphone, buprenorphine, morphine, fentanyl, and hydrocodone, are listed by the DEA as Schedule II or III substances under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970. Consequently, their manufacture, shipment, storage, sale and use are subject to a high degree of regulation. For example, generally, all Schedule II drug prescriptions must be signed by a physician, physically presented to a pharmacist and may not be refilled without a new prescription.




	Furthermore, the DEA limits the availability of the active ingredients used in many of our current products and products in development and sets a quota on the production of these products. We, or our contract manufacturing organizations, must annually apply to the DEA for procurement and production quotas in order to obtain these substances and produce our products. As a result, our procurement and production quotas may not be sufficient to meet commercial demand or to complete clinical trials. Moreover, the DEA may adjust these quotas from time to time during the year. Any delay or refusal by the DEA in establishing our quotas, or modification of our quotas, for controlled substances could delay or result in the stoppage of our clinical trials or product launches, or could cause trade inventory disruptions for those products that have already been launched, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.




	If we are unable to retain our key personnel, and continue to attract additional professional staff, we may be unable to maintain or expand our business.




	Because of the specialized scientific nature of our business, our ability to develop products and to compete with our current and future competitors will remain highly dependent, in large part, upon our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific, technical and commercial personnel. The loss of key scientific, technical and commercial personnel or the failure to recruit additional key scientific, technical and commercial personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business. While we have consulting agreements with certain key individuals and institutions and have employment agreements with our key executives, we cannot confirm to you that we will succeed in retaining personnel or their services under existing agreements. There is intense competition for qualified personnel in the areas of our activities, and we cannot confirm to you that we will be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business.




	The trading prices of our securities may be volatile, and your investment in our securities could decline in value.




	The market prices for securities of pharmaceutical companies in general have been highly volatile and may continue to be highly volatile in the future. For example, in 2016, our ordinary shares traded between


	$12.56


	 and


	$61.14


	 per share on the NASDAQ. The following factors, in addition to other risk factors described in this section, may cause the market value of our securities to fluctuate:













	•






	FDA approval or disapproval of any of the drug applications we have submitted;
















	•






	the success or failure of our clinical trials;

	Our operations could be disrupted if our information systems fail, if we are unsuccessful in implementing necessary upgrades or if we are subject to cyber-attacks.




	Our business depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications systems and networks, hardware and software systems and our other information technology. We collect and maintain information, which includes confidential and proprietary information as well as personal information regarding our customers and employees, in digital form. Data maintained in digital form is subject to risk of cyber-attacks, which are increasing in frequency and sophistication. Cyber-attacks could include the deployment of harmful malware, viruses, worms and other means to affect service reliability and threaten data confidentiality, integrity and availability. Despite our efforts to monitor and safeguard our systems to prevent data compromise, the possibility of a future data compromise cannot be eliminated entirely, and risks associated with intrusion, tampering, and theft remain. In addition, we do not have insurance coverage with respect to system failures or cyber-attacks. If our systems were to fail or we are unable to successfully expand the capacity of these systems, or we are unable to integrate new technologies into our existing systems, our operations and financial results could suffer.




	We also have outsourced significant elements of our operations to third parties, some of which are outside the U.S., including significant elements of our information technology infrastructure, and as a result we are managing many independent vendor relationships with third parties who may or could have access to our confidential information. The size and complexity of our information technology systems, and those of our third party vendors with whom we contract, make such systems potentially vulnerable to service interruptions. The size and complexity of our and our vendors’ systems and the large amounts of confidential information that is present on them also makes them potentially vulnerable to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees, partners or vendors, or from attacks by malicious third parties.




	The Company and its vendors’ sophisticated information technology operations are spread across multiple, sometimes inconsistent platforms, which pose difficulties in maintaining data integrity across systems. The ever-increasing use and evolution of technology, including cloud-based computing, creates opportunities for the unintentional or improper dissemination or destruction of confidential information stored in the Company’s systems.




	Foreign regulatory requirements vary, including with respect to the regulatory approval process, and failure to obtain regulatory approval or maintain compliance with requirements in foreign jurisdictions would prevent or impact the marketing of our products in those jurisdictions.




	We have worldwide intellectual property rights to market many of our products and product candidates and intend to seek approval to market certain of our products outside of the U.S. Approval of a product by the regulatory authorities of foreign countries must be obtained prior to manufacturing or marketing that product in those countries. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing and the time required to obtain such approval may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. The non-U.S. regulatory approval process includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval set forth herein. Approval by the FDA does not secure approval by the regulatory authorities of any other country, nor does the approval by foreign regulatory authorities in one country secure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or the FDA.




	Outside of the U.S., regulatory agencies generally evaluate and monitor the safety, efficacy and quality of pharmaceutical products and devices and impose regulatory requirements applicable to manufacturing processes, stability testing, record keeping and quality standards, among others. These requirements vary across jurisdiction. In certain countries, including emerging and developing markets, the applicable health care and drug regulatory regimes are continuing to evolve and new requirements may be implemented. Ensuring and maintaining compliance with these evolving requirements is and will continue to be difficult, time-consuming and costly. If we fail to comply with these regulatory requirements or fail to obtain and maintain required approvals, our target market will be reduced and our ability to generate revenue from abroad will be adversely affected.




	Our Astora subsidiary could be adversely affected by special risks and requirements related to its previous business of manufacturing medical products.




	Our Astora subsidiary is subject to various risks and requirements associated with it previously being a medical equipment manufacturer, which could have adverse effects. These include the following:













	•






	potential and actual product liability claims for any defective or allegedly defective goods that are distributed; and
















	•






	increased government scrutiny and/or potential claims regarding the marketing of medical devices.

	We are subject to health information privacy and data protection laws that include penalties for noncompliance.




	We are subject to a number of privacy and data protection laws and regulations globally. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data security continues to evolve. There has been increased attention to privacy and data security issues in both developed and emerging markets with the potential to affect directly our business.  This includes federal and state laws and regulations in the United States as well as in Europe and other markets.  There has also been increased enforcement activity in the United States particularly related to data security breaches. A violation of these laws or regulations could subject us to penalties, fines and/or possible exclusion from Medicare or Medicaid. Such sanctions could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.




	The expanding nature of our business in global markets exposes us to risks associated with adapting to emerging markets and taking advantage of growth opportunities.




	The globalization of our business, including in Latin America, South Africa and Canada, may expose us to increased risks associated with conducting business in emerging markets. Any difficulties in adapting to emerging markets could impair our ability to take advantage of growth opportunities in these regions and a decline in the growth of emerging markets could negatively affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.




	The expansion of our activities in emerging markets may further expose us to more volatile economic conditions and political instability. We also face competition from companies that are already well established in these markets. Our inability to adequately respond to the unique characteristics of these markets, particularly with respect to their regulatory frameworks, the difficulties in recruiting qualified personnel, potential exchange controls, weaker intellectual property protection, higher crime levels and corruption and fraud, could have a material adverse effect on our business.




	Our policies and procedures, which are designed to help us, our employees and agents comply with various laws and regulations regarding corrupt practices and anti-bribery, cannot guarantee protection against liability for actions taken by businesses in which we invest. Failure to comply with domestic or international laws could result in various adverse consequences, including possible delay in the approval or refusal to approve a product, recalls, seizures, withdrawal of an approved product from the market, or the imposition of criminal or civil sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties.




	In addition, differences in banking systems and business cultures could have an adverse effect on the efficiency of internal controls over financial reporting matters. Given the significant learning curve to fully understand the emerging markets’ business, operating environment and the quality of controls in place, we may not be able to adequately assess the efficiency of internal controls over financial reporting or the effects of the laws and requirements of the local business jurisdictions.




	Many jurisdictions require specific permits or business licenses, particularly if the business is considered foreign. These requirements may affect our ability to carry out our business operations in emerging markets.




	Our international operations could expose us to various risks, including risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.




	In


	2016


	,


	7.0%


	 of our total revenues were from sources outside the U.S. Some of these sales were to governmental entities and other organizations with extended payment terms. A number of factors, including differing economic conditions, changes in political climate, differing tax regimes, changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, and political or economic instability in the countries where we do business, could affect payment terms and our ability to collect foreign receivables. We have little influence over these factors and changes could have a material adverse impact on our business. In particular, the risk of a debt default by one or more European countries and related European or national financial restructuring efforts may cause volatility in the value of the Euro. In addition, foreign sales are influenced by fluctuations in currency exchange rates, primarily the Canadian dollar, Euro, South African rand, Mexican peso, British pound and Australian dollar.




	We face risks relating to the expected exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union.




	On June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom held a remain-or-leave referendum on the United Kingdom’s membership within the European Union, the result of which favored the Brexit. A process of negotiation will likely determine the future terms of the United Kingdom’s relationship with the European Union, as well as whether the United Kingdom will be able to continue to benefit from the European Union’s free trade and similar agreements. The timing of the Brexit and potential impact of Brexit on our market share, sales, profitability and results of operations is unclear. Depending on the terms of Brexit, economic conditions in the United Kingdom, the European Union and global markets may be adversely affected by reduced growth and volatility. The uncertainty before, during and after the period of negotiation is also expected to have a negative economic impact and increase volatility in the markets, particularly in the Eurozone. Such volatility and negative economic impact could, in turn, adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

	The risks of selling and shipping products and of purchasing products across international borders may adversely impact our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.




	The sale and shipping of our products and services across international borders is subject to extensive U.S. and foreign governmental trade regulations, such as various anti-bribery laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, export control laws, customs and import laws, and anti-boycott laws. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in significant criminal, civil and administrative penalties, including, but not limited to, imprisonment of individuals, fines, denial of export privileges, seizure of shipments, restrictions on certain business activities, and exclusion or debarment from government contracting. Also, the failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could result in the disruption of our shipping and sales activities.




	In addition, some countries in which our subsidiaries sell products are, to some degree, subject to political, economic and/or social instability. Our non-U.S. sales operations expose us and our representatives, agents and distributors to risks inherent in operating in non-U.S. jurisdictions. These risks include:













	•






	the imposition of additional U.S. and non-U.S. governmental controls or regulations;
















	•






	the imposition of costly and lengthy new export licensing requirements;
















	•






	the imposition of U.S. and/or international sanctions against a country, company, person or entity with whom the company does business that would restrict or prohibit continued business with the sanctioned country, company, person or entity;
















	•






	economic and political instability or disruptions, including local and regional instability, or disruptions due to natural disasters, such as severe weather and geological events, disruptions due to civil unrest and hostilities, rioting, military activity, terror attacks or armed hostilities;
















	•






	changes in duties and tariffs, license obligations and other non-tariff barriers to trade;
















	•






	the imposition of new trade restrictions;
















	•






	imposition of restrictions on the activities of foreign agents, representatives and distributors;
















	•






	foreign tax authorities imposing significant fines, penalties and additional taxes;
















	•






	pricing pressure that we may experience internationally;
















	•






	laws and business practices favoring local companies;
















	•






	difficulties in enforcing or defending intellectual property rights; and
















	•






	exposure to different legal and political standards due to our conducting business in several foreign countries.







	We cannot provide assurance that one or more of these factors will not harm our business. Additionally, we are experiencing fluidity in regulatory and pricing trends as a result of the PPACA and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. Any material decrease in our non-U.S. sales would adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.




	We have substantial amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under such indebtedness, which may require us to refinance all or part of our then outstanding indebtedness. Any refinancing of this substantial indebtedness could be at significantly higher interest rates. Despite our current level of indebtedness, we may still be able to incur substantially more indebtedness. This could increase the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness.




	We currently have a substantial amount of indebtedness. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, we have total debt of approximately


	$8.40 billion


	 in aggregate principal amount. Our substantial indebtedness may:













	•






	make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments on our indebtedness;
















	•






	limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes;
















	•






	limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes;
















	•






	expose us to the risk of rising interest rates with respect to the borrowings under our credit facility, which are at variable rates of interest;
















	•






	require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments;
















	•






	limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;
















	•






	place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and
















	•






	increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions.











	39









	Table of Contents









	If we are unable to pay amounts due under our outstanding indebtedness, or to fund other liquidity needs, such as future capital expenditures, we may be required to refinance all or part of our then existing indebtedness, sell assets, reduce or delay capital expenditures or seek to raise additional capital, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Any refinancing of this substantial indebtedness could be at significantly higher interest rates, which will depend on the conditions of the markets and our financial condition at such time. In addition, we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. If new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we and our subsidiaries now face could intensify.




	Covenants in our debt agreements restrict our business in many ways, a default of which may result in acceleration of certain of our indebtedness.




	We are subject to various covenants in the instruments governing our debt that limit our ability and/or our restricted subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things:




	•


	incur or assume liens or additional debt or provide guarantees in respect of obligations of other persons;




	•


	issue redeemable stock and preferred stock;




	•


	pay dividends or distributions or redeem or repurchase capital stock;




	•


	prepay, redeem or repurchase debt;




	•


	make loans, investments and capital expenditures;




	•


	enter into agreements that restrict distributions from our subsidiaries;




	•


	sell assets and capital stock of our subsidiaries;




	•


	enter into certain transactions with affiliates; and




	•


	consolidate or merge with or into, or sell substantially all of our assets to, another person.




	A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our indebtedness. If there were an event of default under any of the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness, the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately, terminate all commitments to extend further credit, enforce liens against the assets securing or otherwise supporting the debt and pursue other legal remedies. The instruments governing our debt contain cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions that may cause all of the debt issued under such instruments to become immediately due and payable as a result of a default under an unrelated debt instrument. An event of default or an acceleration under one debt agreement could cause a cross-default or cross-acceleration of other debt agreements. We cannot confirm to you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments if the obligations thereunder were accelerated upon an event of default. We may need to conduct asset sales or elect to pursue other alternatives, including proceedings under applicable insolvency laws relating to some or all of our business. Any or all of the above could have a material adverse effect on our business, financing activities, financial conditions and operations. For a description of our indebtedness, see


	Note 13. Debt

	Consolidated Financial Statements


	, included in


	Part IV, Item 15 of this report "Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules"


	.




	The IRS may not agree with the conclusion that we should be treated as a non-U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes following the Paladin transaction.




	Although we are incorporated in Ireland, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) may assert that we should be treated as a U.S. corporation (and, therefore, a U.S. tax resident) for U.S. federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 7874 of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code). A corporation is generally considered a tax resident in the jurisdiction of its organization or incorporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Because we are an Irish incorporated entity, we would generally be classified as a non-U.S. corporation (and, therefore, a non-U.S. tax resident) under these rules. Section 7874 provides an exception pursuant to which a non-U.S. incorporated entity may, in certain circumstances, be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.




	Under Section 7874, we would be treated as a non-U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes if the former shareholders of EHSI owned immediately after the Paladin transaction (within the meaning of Section 7874) less than 80% (by both vote and value) of Endo shares by reason of holding shares in EHSI (the ownership test). The former EHSI shareholders owned less than 80% (by both vote and value) of the shares in Endo after the Paladin merger by reason of their ownership of shares in EHSI. As a result, under current law, we are expected to be treated as a non-U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. There is limited guidance regarding the application of Section 7874 of the Code, including with respect to the provisions regarding the application of the ownership test. Our obligation to complete the Paladin transactions was conditional upon its receipt of a Section 7874 opinion from our counsel, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP (Skadden), dated as of the closing date of the Paladin transaction and subject to certain qualifications and limitations set forth therein, to the effect that Section 7874 of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder should not apply in such a manner so as to cause Endo to be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes from and after the closing date. However, an opinion of tax counsel is not binding on the IRS or a court. Therefore, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not take a position contrary to Skadden’s Section 7874 opinion or that a court will not agree with the IRS in the event of litigation.

	The effective rate of taxation upon our results of operations is dependent on multi-national tax considerations.




	We earn a portion of our income outside the United States. That portion of our earnings is taxed at the more favorable rates applicable to the activities undertaken by our subsidiaries outside of the United States. Our effective income tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws, the outcome of income tax audits, and repatriation of earnings from our subsidiaries for which we have not provided for taxes. Cash repatriations are subject to restrictions in certain jurisdictions and may be subject to withholding and other taxes. We are subject to the examination of our tax returns and tax arrangements by the IRS and other tax and governmental authorities. For example, our transfer pricing has been the subject of IRS audits, and may be the subject of future audits by the IRS or other tax authorities, and we may be subject to tax assessments or the reallocation of income among our subsidiaries. We regularly assess all of these matters to determine the adequacy of our tax provisions, which are subject to significant discretion. Although we believe our tax provisions are adequate, the final determination of tax audits and any related disputes could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of audits and disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements for the period or periods for which the applicable final determinations are made.




	Future changes to U.S. and non-U.S. tax laws could materially adversely affect us.




	Under current law, we are expected to be treated as a non-U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, changes to the rules in Section 7874 of the Code or regulations promulgated thereunder or other guidance issued by the Treasury or the IRS could adversely affect our status as a non-U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and any such changes could have prospective or retroactive application to us, EHSI, and/or their respective shareholders and affiliates. Consequently, there can be no assurance that there will not exist in the future a change in law that might cause us to be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, including with retroactive effect.




	In addition, recent U.S. legislative proposals would expand the scope of U.S. corporate tax residence and limit deductibility of interest and/or other payments made by our U.S. subsidiaries to non-U.S. persons from which we currently benefit. If such a change in law were enacted, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements.




	Further, the U.S. Congress, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, the European Commission and other Government agencies in jurisdictions where we and our affiliates do business have had an extended focus on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations and there are several current legislative proposals that, if enacted, would substantially change the taxation of multinational corporations. One example is in the area of “base erosion and profit shifting,” where payments are made between affiliates from a jurisdiction with high tax rates to a jurisdiction with lower tax rates. As a result, the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate could change on a prospective or retroactive basis, and any such changes could increase our effective tax rate, materially adversely impacting our financial statements and cash flows from operations.




	We may not be able to successfully maintain our low tax rates, which could adversely affect our businesses and financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.




	We are incorporated in Ireland and also maintain subsidiaries in, amongst other jurisdictions, the United States, Canada, Mexico, India, Bermuda, the United Kingdom, Luxembourg, and South Africa. The IRS and other taxing authorities may challenge intercompany arrangements. Responding to or defending such a challenge could be expensive, consume time and other resources, and divert management’s attention. We cannot predict whether taxing authorities will conduct an audit challenging our tax positions, the cost involved in responding to and defending any such audit and resulting litigation, or the outcome. If we are unsuccessful, we may be required to pay taxes for prior periods, interest, fines or penalties, and may be obligated to pay increased taxes in the future, any of which could require us to reduce our operating expenses, decrease efforts in support of our products or seek to raise additional funds, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial statements, results of operations and growth prospects.




	Our ability to use U.S. tax attributes to offset U.S. taxable income may be limited.




	Existing and future tax laws and regulations may limit our ability to use U.S. tax attributes, including net operating losses, to offset U.S. taxable income. For a period of time following the 2014 Paladin transaction, Section 7874 precludes our U.S. affiliates from utilizing U.S. tax attributes to offset taxable income if we complete certain transactions with related non-U.S. subsidiaries. In addition, the U.S. Treasury Department recently issued new temporary and proposed regulations related to corporate inversions and earnings stripping. The limitations on the use of certain tax attributes and deductions in these regulations are in addition to existing rules that could impose more restrictive limitations in the event that cumulative changes in our stock ownership within a three-year period exceed certain thresholds. Such changes or the adoption of additional limitations could impact our overall utilization of deferred tax assets, potentially resulting in a material adverse impact to our financial statements and cash flows from operations.

	Any attempts to take us over will be subject to Irish Takeover Rules and subject to review by the Irish Takeover Panel.




	We are subject to Irish Takeover Rules, under which our board of directors (Board of Directors) will not be permitted to take any action which might frustrate an offer for our ordinary shares once it has received an approach which may lead to an offer or has reason to believe an offer is imminent.




	If pharmaceutical companies are successful in limiting the use of generics through their legislative, regulatory and other efforts, our sales of generic products may suffer.




	Many pharmaceutical companies increasingly have used state and federal legislative and regulatory means to delay generic competition. These efforts have included:













	•






	pursuing new patents for existing products which may be granted just before the expiration of earlier patents, which could extend patent protection for additional years;
















	•






	using the Citizen Petition process (e.g., under 21 C.F.R. s. 10.30) to request amendments to FDA standards;
















	•






	attempting to use the legislative and regulatory process to have drugs reclassified or rescheduled or to set definitions of abuse deterrent formulations to protect brand company patents and profits; and
















	•






	engaging in state-by-state initiatives to enact legislation that restricts the substitution of some generic drugs.







	If pharmaceutical companies or other third parties are successful in limiting the use of generic products through these or other means, our sales of generic products may decline. If we experience a material decline in generic product sales, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows will suffer.




	We have limited experience in manufacturing biologic products and may encounter difficulties in our manufacturing processes, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or delay or disrupt manufacture of those of our products that are reliant upon our manufacturing operations.




	The manufacture of biologic products requires significant expertise and capital investment. Although our subsidiary, Auxilium, leased its facilities in Horsham, Pennsylvania in order to have direct control over the manufacturing of the active ingredient of XIAFLEX



	®



	, we have limited experience in manufacturing XIAFLEX



	®



	 or any other biologic product. Biologics such as XIAFLEX



	®



	 require processing steps that are highly complex and generally more difficult than those required for most chemical pharmaceuticals. In addition, TESTOPEL



	®



	 is manufactured using a unique, proprietary process. If our manufacturing processes at the Rye, New York facility or Horsham facility are disrupted, it may be difficult to find alternate manufacturing sites. We may encounter difficulties with the manufacture of the active ingredient of XIAFLEX



	®



	 or TESTOPEL



	®



	, which could delay, disrupt or halt our manufacture of XIAFLEX



	®



	 and TESTOPEL



	®



	, respectively, require write-offs which may affect our financial results, result in product recalls or product liability claims or otherwise materially affect our results of operations.

	On April 28, 2015, our Board of Directors resolved to approve a share buyback program (the 2015 Share Buyback Program), authorizing the Company to redeem in the aggregate up to


	$2.5 billion


	 of its outstanding ordinary shares. In accordance with Irish Law and the Company’s Articles of Association, all ordinary shares redeemed shall be cancelled upon redemption. Redemptions under this program may be made from time to time in open market or negotiated transactions or otherwise, as determined by the Transactions Committee of the Board of Directors. This program does not obligate the Company to redeem any particular amount of ordinary shares. Future redemptions, if any, will depend on factors such as levels of cash generation from operations, cash requirements for investment in the Registrant's business, repayment of future debt, if any, the then current share price, market conditions, legal limitations and other factors. The 2015 Share Buyback Program may be suspended, modified or discontinued at any time. During November 2015, the Company repurchased 4.4 million ordinary shares totaling $250.0 million, not including related fees.

	EXECUTIVE SUMMARY




	Endo International plc is an Ireland-domiciled, global specialty pharmaceutical company focused on generic and branded pharmaceuticals. We aim to be the premier partner to healthcare professionals and payment providers, delivering an innovative suite of generic and branded drugs to meet patients’ needs. This executive summary provides highlights from the results of operations that follow:













	•






	Total revenues in


	2016




	increase


	d


	23%


	 to


	$4,010.3 million


	 from


	2015


	. This revenue


	increase


	 was primarily attributable to revenues related to our September 2015 acquisition of Par Pharmaceutical Holdings, Inc. (Par). The


	increase


	 was partially offset by decreased revenues for certain products in our


	U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals


	 segment, driven mainly by


	decrease

	revenues related to generic competition and decreased revenues from our legacy


	U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals


	 segment as a result of competitive pressure on commoditized generic products.
















	•






	Gross margin for


	2016




	decrease


	d to


	34%


	 from


	36%


	 in


	2015


	. This decrease was primarily attributable to the mix of revenue being more heavily weighted toward lower margin generic pharmaceutical product sales as compared to the higher margin branded products, increased intangible asset amortization of


	$315.1 million


	 for


	2016


	 and charges to increase excess inventory reserves.
















	•






	Asset impairment charges


	 in


	2016


	 increased to


	$3,781.2 million


	 compared to


	$1,140.7 million


	 in


	2015


	 driven primarily by goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges in our Generics, Paladin, Litha, and Somar reporting units.
















	•






	During the


	year


	 ended


	December 31, 2016


	, the Company recognized an income tax


	benefit


	 of


	$700.1 million


	 on


	$3,923.9 million


	 of


	loss from continuing operations before income tax


	, compared to


	$1,137.5 million


	 of tax


	benefit


	 on


	$1,437.9 million


	 of


	loss from continuing operations before income tax


	 during the comparable


	2015


	 period. During the


	year


	 ended


	December 31, 2016


	, the Company completed a legal entity restructuring as part of its continuing integration of its business. This resulted in the realization of a $636.1 million tax


	benefit


	 arising from an outside basis difference that was reduced by a $394.6 million charge for the establishment of a valuation allowance on a portion of the Company’s U.S. deferred tax assets. The tax benefit for the comparable


	2015


	 period was primarily related to losses from continued operations combined with benefits resulting from the expected realization of deferred tax assets for certain components of the Company’s AMS business arising from tax refunds relating to the carryback of net operating losses.
















	•






	Loss from continuing operations for 2016 increased to


	$3,223.8 million


	 from


	$300.4 million


	 for the year ended December 31,


	2015


	, primarily attributable to the goodwill and intangible asset impairments noted above.

	CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES




	To understand our financial statements, it is important to understand our critical accounting estimates. The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (U.S. GAAP) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates and assumptions are required in the determination of revenue recognition and sales deductions for estimated chargebacks, rebates, sales incentives and allowances, certain royalties, distribution service fees, returns and allowances. Significant estimates and assumptions are also required when determining the fair value of financial instruments, the valuation of long-lived assets, income taxes, contingencies and stock-based compensation. Some of these judgments can be subjective and complex, and consequently, actual results may differ from these estimates. For any given individual estimate or assumption made by us, there may also be other estimates or assumptions that are reasonable. Although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable, they are based upon information available at the time the estimates and assumptions were made. Actual results may differ significantly from our estimates.




	We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: (1) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and (2) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Our most critical accounting estimates are described below:




	Revenue recognition




	Pharmaceutical Products




	Our net pharmaceutical product sales consist of revenues from sales of our pharmaceutical products, less estimates for chargebacks, rebates, sales incentives and allowances, certain royalties, distribution service fees, returns and allowances as well as fees for services. We recognize revenue for product sales when title and risk of loss has passed to the customer, which is typically upon delivery to the customer, when estimated provisions for revenue reserves are reasonably determinable, and when collectability is reasonably confirmed. Revenue from the launch of a new or significantly unique product may be deferred until such time that the product has achieved market acceptance. For these products, revenue is typically recognized based on dispensed prescription data and other information obtained prior to and during the period following launch.




	Decisions made by wholesaler customers and large retail chain customers regarding the levels of inventory they hold (and thus the amount of product they purchase from us) can materially affect the level of our sales in any particular period and thus may not correlate to the number of prescriptions written for our products based on external third-party data. We believe that speculative buying of product, particularly in anticipation of possible price increases, has been the historical practice of many pharmaceutical wholesalers. Our wholesaler customers, as well as others in the industry, structure their arrangements where they charge a fee for their services. Accordingly, we have entered into distribution service agreements (DSAs) with certain of our significant wholesaler customers. These agreements obligate the wholesalers to provide us with specific services, including the provision of periodic retail demand information and current inventory levels for our branded products held at their warehouse locations; additionally, under these DSAs, the wholesalers have agreed to manage the variability of their purchases and inventory levels within specified limits based on product demand.




	We received information from certain of our wholesaler customers about the quantities of inventory they held for our generic and branded products. Based on this information, which we have not independently verified, we believe that inventory related to our generic and branded products held at these wholesalers is within a reasonable range as compared to historical wholesaler held inventory amounts and to expected demand for each respective product market at


	December 31, 2016


	. We also estimated inventory quantities held at other wholesalers based on buying patterns and believe these levels are within reasonable ranges at


	December 31, 2016


	. In addition, we evaluated market conditions for products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other third party sell-through, as well as internally-generated information to assess factors that could impact expected product demand as of December 31, 2016.

	Table of Contents









	Sales deductions




	When we recognize revenue from the sale of our products, we simultaneously record an adjustment to revenue for estimated chargebacks, rebates, sales incentives and allowances, certain royalties, DSA fees, returns and allowances. These provisions, as described in greater detail below, are estimated based on historical experience, estimated future trends, estimated customer inventory levels, current contract sales terms with our direct and indirect customers and other competitive factors. If the assumptions we used to calculate these adjustments do not appropriately reflect future activity, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be materially impacted. The following table presents the activity and ending balances, excluding Discontinued operations and assets and liabilities held for sale, for our product sales provisions for the three years ended

	Returns and Allowances




	Our provision for returns and allowances consists of our estimates of future product returns, pricing adjustments and delivery errors. Consistent with industry practice, we maintain a return policy that allows our customers to return product within a specified period of time both prior and subsequent to the product’s expiration date. Our return policy generally allows customers to receive credit for expired products within six months prior to expiration and within one year after expiration. The primary factors we consider in estimating our potential product returns include:













	•






	the shelf life or expiration date of each product;
















	•






	historical levels of expired product returns;
















	•






	external data with respect to inventory levels in the wholesale distribution channel;
















	•






	external data with respect to prescription demand for our products; and
















	•






	estimated returns liability to be processed by year of sale based on analysis of lot information related to actual historical returns.







	In determining our estimates for returns and allowances, we are required to make certain assumptions regarding the timing of the introduction of new products and the potential of these products to capture market share. In addition, we make certain assumptions with respect to the extent and pattern of decline associated with generic competition. To make these assessments, we utilize market data for similar products as analogs for our estimations. We use our best judgment to formulate these assumptions based on past experience and information available to us at the time. We continually reassess and make the appropriate changes to our estimates and assumptions as new information becomes available to us.








	52









	Table of Contents









	Our estimate for returns and allowances may be impacted by a number of factors, but the principal factor relates to the level of inventory in the distribution channel. When we are aware of an increase in the level of inventory of our products in the distribution channel, we consider the reasons for the increase to determine if the increase may be temporary or other-than-temporary. Increases in inventory levels assessed as temporary will not result in an adjustment to our provision for returns and allowances. Other-than-temporary increases in inventory levels, however, may be an indication that future product returns could be higher than originally anticipated and, accordingly, we may need to adjust our estimate for returns and allowances. Some of the factors that may be an indication that an increase in inventory levels will be temporary include:













	•






	recently implemented or announced price increases for our products; and
















	•






	new product launches or expanded indications for our existing products.







	Conversely, factors that may be an indication that an increase in inventory levels will be other-than-temporary include:













	•






	declining sales trends based on prescription demand;
















	•






	recent regulatory approvals to shorten the shelf life of our products, which could result in a period of higher returns related to older product with the shorter shelf life;
















	•






	introduction of new product or generic competition;
















	•






	increasing price competition from generic competitors; and
















	•






	recent changes to the National Drug Codes (NDCs) of our products, which could result in a period of higher returns related to product with the old NDC, as our customers generally permit only one NDC per product for identification and tracking within their inventory systems.







	Rebates




	We establish contracts with wholesalers, chain stores and indirect customers that provide for rebates, sales incentives, DSA fees, and other allowances. Some customers receive rebates upon attaining established sales volumes. We estimate rebates, sales incentives and other allowances based upon the terms of the contracts with our customers, historical experience, estimated inventory levels of our customers and estimated future trends. Our rebate programs can generally be categorized into the following four types:













	•






	direct rebates;
















	•






	indirect rebates;
















	•






	managed care rebates; and
















	•






	Medicaid and Medicare Part D rebates.







	Direct rebates are generally rebates paid to direct purchasing customers based on a percentage applied to a direct customer’s purchases from us, including DSA fees paid to wholesalers under our DSA’s, as described above. Indirect rebates are rebates paid to indirect customers which have purchased our products from a wholesaler under a contract with us.




	We are subject to rebates on sales made under governmental and managed-care pricing programs. In estimating our provisions for these types of rebates, we consider relevant statutes with respect to governmental pricing programs and contractual sales terms with managed-care providers and group purchasing organizations. Starting in 2011, as a result of the implementation of certain provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), we are required to provide a 50% discount on our brand-name drugs to patients who fall within the Medicare Part D coverage gap, also referred to as the donut hole. We estimate an accrual for Managed Care, Medicaid, Medicare Part D and Coverage Gap rebates as a reduction of revenue at the time product sales are recorded. These rebate reserves are estimated based upon the historical utilization levels, historical payment experience, historical relationship to revenues, estimated future trends, and include an estimate of outstanding claims for end-customer sales that occurred but for which the related claim has not been billed and an estimate for future claims that will be made when inventory in the distribution channel is sold through to plan participants. Changes in the level of utilization of our products through private or public benefit plans and group purchasing organizations will affect the amount of rebates that we owe.




	We participate in state government-managed Medicaid programs, as well as certain other qualifying federal and state government programs whereby discounts and rebates are provided to participating government entities. Medicaid rebates are amounts owed based upon contractual agreements or legal requirements with public sector (Medicaid) benefit providers, after the final dispensing of the product by a pharmacy to a benefit plan participant. Medicaid reserves are based on expected payments, which are driven by patient usage, contract performance, as well as field inventory that will be subject to a Medicaid rebate. Medicaid rebates are typically billed up to 180 days after the product is shipped, but can be as much as 270 days after the quarter in which the product is dispensed to the Medicaid participant. In addition to the estimates mentioned above, our calculation also requires other estimates, such as estimates of sales mix, to determine which sales are subject to rebates and the amount of such rebates. Periodically, we adjust the Medicaid rebate provision based on actual claims paid. Due to the delay in billing, adjustments to actual claims paid may incorporate revisions of this provision for several periods. Medicaid pricing programs involve particularly difficult interpretations of statutes and regulatory guidance, which are complex and thus our estimates could differ from actual experience.

	We continually update these factors based on new contractual or statutory requirements and significant changes in sales trends that may impact the percentage of our products subject to rebates.




	Chargebacks




	The provision for chargebacks is one of the most significant estimates used in the recognition of our revenue. We market and sell products directly to wholesalers, distributors, warehousing pharmacy chains, and other direct purchasing groups. We also market products indirectly to independent pharmacies, non-warehousing chains, managed care organizations, and group purchasing organizations, collectively referred to as indirect customers. We enter into agreements with some indirect customers to establish contract pricing for certain products. These indirect customers then independently select a wholesaler from which to purchase the products at these contracted prices. Alternatively, we may pre-authorize wholesalers to offer specified contract pricing to other indirect customers, including government entities. Under either arrangement, we provide credit to the wholesaler for any difference between the contracted price with the indirect customer and the wholesaler’s invoice price. Such credit is called a chargeback. The primary factors we consider in developing and evaluating our provision for chargebacks include:













	•






	the average historical chargeback credits;
















	•






	estimated future sales trends; and
















	•






	an estimate of the inventory held by our wholesalers, based on internal analysis of a wholesaler’s historical purchases and contract sales.







	Other sales deductions




	We offer certain of our customers prompt pay cash discounts. Provisions for prompt pay discounts are estimated and recorded at the time of sale. We estimate provisions for cash discounts based on contractual sales terms with customers, an analysis of unpaid invoices and historical payment experience. Estimated cash discounts have historically been predictable and less subjective due to the limited number of assumptions involved, the consistency of historical experience and the fact that we generally settle these amounts within 30 to 60 days.




	Shelf-stock adjustments are credits issued to our customers to reflect decreases in the selling prices of our products. These credits are customary in the industry and are intended to reduce a customer’s inventory cost to better reflect current market prices. The determination to grant a shelf-stock credit to a customer following a price decrease is at our discretion rather than contractually required. The primary factors we consider when deciding whether to record a reserve for a shelf-stock adjustment include:













	•






	the estimated number of competing products being launched as well as the expected launch date, which we determine based on market intelligence;
















	•






	the estimated decline in the market price of our product, which we determine based on historical experience and customer input; and
















	•






	the estimated levels of inventory held by our customers at the time of the anticipated decrease in market price, which we determine based upon historical experience and customer input.







	Valuation of long-lived assets




	Long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, licenses, developed technology, trade names and patents are assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the forecasted undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset. In the event the carrying value of the asset exceeds its undiscounted future cash flows and the carrying value is not considered recoverable, impairment may exist. An impairment loss, if any, is measured as the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value, generally based on a discounted future cash flow method, independent appraisals or preliminary offers from prospective buyers. An impairment loss would be recognized in the


	Consolidated Statements of Operations


	 in the period that the impairment occurs. As a result of the significance of our amortizable intangibles, any recognized impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.




	During 2016, we recorded intangible asset impairments of


	$1,105.2 million


	. These impairment charges were based on fair value estimates determined using discounted cash flow models. The discounted cash flow models include assumptions related to product revenue, growth rates and operating margin and are based on management’s annual and ongoing forecasting, budgeting and planning processes and represent our best estimate of future product cash flows. These estimates are subject to the economic environment in which our segments operate, demand for our products and competitor actions. The use of different assumptions would increase or decrease our estimated discounted future cash flows and the resulting estimated fair value of these intangible assets causing an increase or decrease in the respective intangible asset impairment charge. The discount rates applied to these estimated cash flows ranged from


	8.5%


	 to


	11.0%


	.

	Events giving rise to impairment are an inherent risk in the pharmaceutical industry and cannot be predicted. Factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under-performance of a product line in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets.




	Our reviews of long-lived assets during the three years ended


	December 31, 2016


	 resulted in certain asset impairment charges, which are described in


	Note 10. Goodwill and Other Intangibles


	 in the


	Consolidated Financial Statements


	, included in


	Part IV, Item 15 of this report "Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules"


	.




	License Rights -


	 The cost of licenses are either expensed immediately or, if capitalized, are recorded at fair value and amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives ranging from


	3


	 to


	15


	 years, with a weighted average useful life of approximately


	12 years


	. We determine amortization periods for licenses based on our assessment of various factors impacting estimated useful lives and cash flows of the acquired rights. Such factors include the expected launch date of the product, the strength of the intellectual property protection of the product and various other competitive, developmental and regulatory issues, and contractual terms. Significant changes to any of these factors may result in a reduction in the useful life of the asset and an acceleration of related amortization expense, which could cause our operating income, net income and net income per share to decrease. The value of these licenses is subject to continuing scientific, medical and marketplace uncertainty.




	Trade Names -


	 Acquired trade names are recorded at fair value upon acquisition and, if deemed to have definite lives, are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives of approximately


	12 years


	. We determine amortization periods for trade names based on our assessment of various factors impacting estimated useful lives and cash flows from the acquired assets. Such factors include the strength of the trade name and our plans regarding the future use of the trade name. Significant changes to any of these factors may result in a reduction in the useful life of the asset and an acceleration of related amortization expense, which could cause our operating income, net income and net income per share to decrease.




	Developed Technology -


	 Acquired developed technology is recorded at fair value upon acquisition and is amortized using the economic benefit model or the straight-line method, over the estimated useful life ranging from


	1


	 to


	20


	 years for our intangibles, with a weighted average useful life of approximately


	11 years


	. We determine amortization periods and method of amortization for developed technology based on our assessment of various factors impacting estimated useful lives and timing and extent of estimated cash flows of the acquired assets. Such factors include the strength of the intellectual property protection of the product and various other competitive and regulatory issues, and contractual terms. Significant changes to any of these factors may result in a reduction in the useful life of the asset and an acceleration of related amortization expense, which could cause our operating income, net income and net income per share to decrease. Amortization expense is not recorded on assets held for sale. The value of these assets is subject to continuing scientific, medical and marketplace uncertainty.




	Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets




	As of 


	December 31, 2016


	 and 


	2015


	, goodwill and other intangibles comprised approximately 


	74%


	 and


	78%


	, respectively, of our total assets.




	Endo tests goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. Our annual assessment is performed as of October 1



	st



	. The goodwill test consists of a Step I analysis that requires a comparison between the respective reporting unit’s fair value and carrying amount. A Step II analysis would be required if the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than its carrying amount. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, an impairment does not exist and no further analysis is required. The indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test consists of a one-step analysis that compares the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. For the purpose of the October 1,


	2016


	 annual goodwill impairment test, the Company had


	five


	 operating segments and reporting units: (1) Branded, (2) Generics, (3) Paladin, (4) Litha, and (5) Somar.




	The fair values of our reporting units are determined using an income approach that utilizes a discounted cash flow model, or, where appropriate, a market approach, or a combination thereof. The discounted cash flow models are dependent upon our estimates of future cash flows and other factors. Our estimates of future cash flows involve assumptions concerning (i) future operating performance, including future sales, long-term growth rates, operating margins, variations in the amount and timing of cash flows and the probability of achieving the estimated cash flows and (ii) future economic conditions, all which may differ from actual future cash flows. These assumptions are based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represent Level 3 measurements within the fair value hierarchy. Estimated future cash flows are discounted to present value using a market participant, weighted average cost of capital. The financial and credit market volatility directly impacts certain inputs and assumptions used to develop the weighted average cost of capital such as the risk-free interest rate, industry beta, debt interest rate, and our market capital structure. Therefore, changes in these assumptions may affect our fair value estimate and the result of the impairment test. The discount rates applied to the estimated cash flows for our October 1,


	2016


	 annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment test ranged from


	8.5%


	 to


	11.0%


	, depending on the overall risk associated with the particular assets and other market factors. We believe the discount rates and other inputs and assumptions are consistent with those that a market participant would use.








	55









	Table of Contents









	Assumptions related to revenue, growth rates and operating margin are based on management’s annual and ongoing forecasting, budgeting and planning processes and represent our best estimate of the future results of operations across the company as of that point in time. These estimates are subject to many assumptions, such as the economic environment in which our segments operate, demand for our products and competitor actions. The use of different assumptions would increase or decrease our estimated discounted future cash flows and the resulting estimated fair value of our reporting units, and could result in the fair value of a reporting unit being less than its carrying value in the first step of the impairment test.




	In order to assess the reasonableness of the calculated fair values of our reporting units, we also compare the sum of the reporting units’ fair values to Endo’s market capitalization and calculate an implied control premium (the excess sum of the reporting unit’s fair values over the market capitalization) or an implied control discount (the excess sum of total invested capital over the sum of the reporting unit’s fair values). The Company evaluates the implied control premium or discount by comparing it to control premiums or discounts of recent comparable market transactions, as applicable. If the control premium or discount is not reasonable in light of comparable recent transactions, or recent movements in the Company’s share price, we reevaluate the fair value estimates of the reporting units by adjusting discount rates and/or other assumptions. This re-evaluation could correlate to different implied fair values for certain or all of the Company’s reporting units.




	As a result of our annual goodwill test performed as of October 1



	st



	, 2016, the Company recorded pre-tax, non-cash impairment charges relating to our Generics, Paladin, Litha and Somar reporting units for an aggregate total of


	$2,674.5 million


	. For a complete description of goodwill impairment charges recorded for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, refer to


	Note 10. Goodwill and Other Intangibles


	 in the


	Consolidated Financial Statements


	, included in


	Part IV, Item 15 of this report "Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules"


	. The Generics reporting unit represented


	$2,342.5 million


	 of the total goodwill charge. A 50 basis point increase in the assumed discount rate utilized or a 1% decrease in the annual growth rate would have increased our Generics reporting unit goodwill impairment charge by approximately


	$440 million


	 and


	$400 million


	, respectively.




	Our annual goodwill test for the U.S. Branded reporting unit indicated the fair value exceeded its carrying value; therefore, an impairment charge was not required as of October 1



	st



	, 2016. An increase of 50 basis points to our assumed discount rate used in testing this reporting unit would not have changed the results of our analysis. In addition, a 10% reduction of annual cash flows used in testing the U.S. Branded reporting unit would not have changed the results of our analysis.




	Changes to assumptions used to determine fair value, including, but not limited to, projections of future cash flows and our weighted average cost of capital, or significant declines in our stock price could result in additional non-cash impairment charges to goodwill or other long-lived assets, which could be material. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, our combined goodwill and intangible assets balance is approximately


	$10.6 billion


	.




	Acquisition-related in-process research and development




	Acquired businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that the purchase price be allocated to the net assets acquired at their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Amounts allocated to acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D) are recorded to the balance sheet at the date of acquisition based on their relative fair values. The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact our results of operations.




	There are several methods that can be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. For intangible assets, including IPR&D, we typically use the income method. This method starts with our forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows. These cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method or other methods include: the amount and timing of projected future cash flows; the amount and timing of projected costs to develop the IPR&D into commercially viable products; the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows; and the assessment of the asset’s life cycle and the competitive trends impacting the asset, including consideration of any technical, legal, regulatory, or economic barriers to entry, as well as expected changes in standards of practice for indications addressed by the asset.




	Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment, as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives. Acquired IPR&D is designated as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until the associated research and development activities are completed or abandoned.

	Income taxes




	Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect our best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous other foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense for financial statement purposes. Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements that result in future taxable or deductible amounts. In assessing the ability to realize deferred tax assets, we consider future taxable income by tax jurisdiction and tax planning strategies. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to equal an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In projecting future taxable income, we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future earnings within a specific jurisdiction’s pretax operating income adjusted for material changes in business operations. The assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses.




	Future changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities. The calculation of our tax liabilities often involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. A benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes. We first record unrecognized tax benefits as liabilities and then adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available at the time of establishing the liability. Because of the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which new information is available.




	We consider the earnings of the majority of our subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested within their country of incorporation on the basis of estimates that future cash generation will be sufficient to meet future cash needs and our specific plans for reinvestment of those subsidiary earnings. Should we decide to repatriate earnings, we would need to adjust our income tax provision in the period we determined that the earnings will no longer be indefinitely invested outside the relevant tax jurisdiction.




	Contingencies




	The Company is subject to various patent, product liability, government investigations and other legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. The factors we consider in developing our contingent accruals for product liability litigation and other contingent liability items include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation, the nature and the number of other similar current and past litigation cases, the nature of the product and the current assessment of the science subject to the litigation, and the likelihood of the conditions of settlement being met. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, the Company has accrued


	$1,015.9 million


	, of which


	$963.1 million


	 relates to vaginal mesh cases, for all known claims for which a liability is probable. In addition to claims covered by MSAs, we are currently aware of approximately


	9,700


	 claims that have been filed, asserted or that we believe are likely to be asserted that have not been accrued for because we lack sufficient information to determine whether any potential loss is probable. In addition, there may be other claims asserted in the future. It is currently not possible to estimate the number or validity of any such claims. Although we believe there is a reasonable possibility that a loss in excess of the amount recognized exists, we are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss in excess of the amount recognized at this time.




	Our vaginal mesh accrual is primarily based on Master Settlement Agreements (MSAs) between AMS and certain plaintiffs’ counsel representing mesh-related product liability claimants. AMS has agreed to settle up to approximately


	49,000


	 filed and unfiled mesh claims handled or controlled by the participating counsel. All MSAs are subject to a process that includes guidelines and procedures for administering the settlements and the release of funds. In certain cases, the MSAs provide for the creation of Qualified Settlement Funds into which funds may be deposited pursuant to certain schedules set forth in those agreements. All MSAs have participation thresholds regarding the claims represented by each law firm party to the MSA. If certain participation thresholds are not met, then we will have the right to terminate the settlement with that law firm. We expect that valid claims under the MSAs will continue to be settled. However, we intend to vigorously contest pending and future claims that are invalid, for which settlement is unable to be reached or that are in excess of the maximum claim amounts under the applicable MSAs.








	57









	Table of Contents









	In order to evaluate whether a claim is probable of a loss, we must obtain and evaluate certain information pertaining to each individual claim, including but not limited to the following items: the name and social security number of the plaintiff, evidence of an AMS implant, the date of implant, the date the claim was first asserted to AMS and medical records establishing the injury alleged. Without access to and review of at least this information, we are not in a position to determine a claim’s validity or whether a loss is probable. Further, the timing and extent to which we obtain this information and our evaluation thereof, is often impacted by items outside of our control, including, without limitation, the normal cadence of the litigation process and the provision of claim information to us by plaintiff’s counsel. We will continue to monitor the situation, and, if appropriate, we will make further adjustments to our product liability accrual based on new information. We intend to continue exploring all options as appropriate in our best interests, and depending on developments, there is a possibility that we will suffer adverse decisions or verdicts of substantial amounts, or that we will enter into additional monetary settlements. Any unfavorable outcomes as a result of such litigation or settlements with respect to any asserted or unasserted claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.




	During 2015, the Company sold the Men’s Health and Prostate Health business to Boston Scientific Corporation and subsequently wound down the remaining Astora business during 2016, and therefore, the litigation expense and legal defense costs specifically attributable to the vaginal mesh cases has been included in Discontinued operations, net of tax in the


	Consolidated Statements of Operations


	 for all periods presented. The Company is responsible for all known pending and estimated future claims related to vaginal mesh cases.




	Contingent accruals are recorded with a corresponding charge to


	Litigation-related and other contingencies, net


	 in the Consolidated Statements of Operations when the Company determines that a loss related to a litigation matter is both probable and reasonably estimable. Due to the fact that legal proceedings and other contingencies are inherently unpredictable, our assessments involve significant judgments regarding future events. As of the date of this report, we believe that the current product liability accrual includes all known claims for which liability is probable.




	Legal fees and other expenses related to litigation are expensed as incurred and included in Selling, general and administrative expenses.

	d


	27%


	 to


	$2,635.0 million


	 from


	2015


	. These increases were primarily attributable to increased costs related to our acquisition of Par, including intangible asset amortization, and increased charges related to excess inventory reserves of approximately


	$36 million


	. These inventory charges were primarily due to the underperformance of certain products and the planned discontinuance of several products as part of the 2016


	U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals


	 restructuring initiative announced in May 2016. Gross margins for

	d to


	34%


	 from


	36%


	 in

	. These decreases were primarily attributable to the mix of revenue being more heavily weighted toward lower margin generic pharmaceutical product sales as compared to the higher margin branded products, increased intangible asset amortization of


	$315.1 million


	 for


	2016

	. This


	increase


	 was primarily a result of incremental employee, facility and other selling, general and administrative expenses related to the acquisition of Par. In addition, we implemented several restructuring initiatives during 2016, including the


	2016 U.S Generic Pharmaceuticals Restructuring


	 and the


	2016 U.S. Branded Pharmaceutical Restructuring


	, which resulted in charges of


	$17.0 million


	 and


	$16.5 million


	, respectively. These


	increase

	Our primary


	U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals


	 R&D efforts are focused on high-barrier-to-entry generic products, including first-to-file or first-to-market opportunities that are difficult to formulate, difficult to manufacture or face complex legal and regulatory challenges. We believe products with these characteristics will face a lesser degree of competition and therefore provide longer product life cycles and higher profitability than commodity generic products. In


	2016


	 and


	2015


	, our direct R&D expense related to generics totaled


	$128.3 million


	 and


	$58.4 million


	, respectively. The increase in expense is a result of the Par acquisition and additional investments in expanding our research and development and manufacturing capabilities.




	The


	increase


	 in


	U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals


	 expenses in


	2016


	 was primarily attributable to costs incurred related to the development of XIAFLEX

	Asset impairment charges


	 in

	$3,781.2 million


	 compared to


	$1,140.7 million


	 in


	2015


	. The following items were the significant drivers of impairment charges:




	Goodwill




	As part of our annual goodwill impairment test, we concluded that the carrying value of our U.S. Generics, Paladin, Somar and Litha reporting units exceeded their respective estimated fair values and recorded goodwill impairment charges of


	$2,342.5 million


	,


	$272.6 million


	,


	$33.0 million


	 and


	$26.3 million


	, respectively. The impairments were a result of a combination of factors, including increased buying power from the continued consolidation of our generic business customer base, a significant change in the value derived from the level and frequency of anticipated pricing opportunities in the future and increased levels of competition, particularly in our U.S. Generics reporting unit, due to the entry of new low cost competitors and accelerated FDA ANDA approvals. Consequently, we lowered our projected revenue growth rates and profitability levels as part of our fourth quarter company-wide strategic forecasting process. These external dynamics were exacerbated by an increase in the risk factor included in the discount rate used to calculate the U.S. Generics discounted cash flows from the date of our last interim test. The increase in the discount rate was due to the implied control premium resulting from recent trading values of our stock. On a combined basis, these factors reduced the resulting estimated fair value of our reporting units.

	Given the results of our intangible asset assessment during the third quarter of 2015 for STENDRA



	®



	and certain testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) products, we initiated an interim goodwill impairment analysis of our Urology, Endocrinology and Oncology (UEO) reporting unit as of September 30, 2015. As a result of this interim analysis, we determined that the net book value of our UEO reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value. We prepared this analysis on a preliminary basis to estimate the amount of a provisional impairment charge as of September 30, 2015, and determined that an impairment was probable and reasonably estimable. We performed the preliminary fair value assessments taking into consideration a number of factors, based upon the latest available information, including the preliminary results of a hypothetical purchase price allocation. As a result of the preliminary analysis, during the three months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded a provisional pre-tax, non-cash impairment charge of 


	$680.0 million


	 in the 


	Consolidated Statements of Operations


	, representing the difference between the estimated implied fair value of the UEO reporting unit’s goodwill and its respective net book value. We completed our UEO goodwill impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of 2015 and reduced the provisional pre-tax, non-cash impairment charge by


	$6.5 million


	, for a net, pre-tax, non-cash impairment charge during the year ended


	December 31, 2015


	 of


	$673.5 million


	.




	As part of the 2015 annual goodwill impairment test, we recorded a pre-tax, non-cash impairment charge of 


	$85.8 million


	 in the 


	Consolidated Statements of Operations


	 during the fourth quarter of 2015, representing the difference between the estimated implied fair value of the Paladin reporting unit’s goodwill and its respective net book value, primarily due to the loss of exclusivity on certain products sold in Canada.




	Intangible Assets




	U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals Segment




	During the three months ended March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016, we identified certain market conditions impacting the commercial potential of certain indefinite and definite-lived intangible assets in our


	U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals


	 segment. Accordingly, we tested these assets for impairment and determined that the carrying value of certain of these assets was no longer fully recoverable, resulting in pre-tax, non-cash asset impairment charges of


	$29.3 million


	 and


	$40.0 million


	 during the first and second quarters of 2016, respectively. In addition, during the first quarter of 2016, we recognized pre-tax, non-cash asset impairment charges of


	$100.3 million


	 related to the 2016


	U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals


	 restructuring initiative, which resulted from the discontinuation of certain commercial products and the abandonment of certain IPR&D projects. See


	Note 4. Restructuring


	 in the


	Consolidated Financial Statements


	, included in


	Part IV, Item 15 of this report "Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules"


	 for discussion of our material restructuring initiatives. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we recognized pre-tax, non-cash intangible asset impairment charges of


	$507.2 million


	 in our


	U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals


	 business resulting from certain market conditions, including higher than expected erosion rates in the


	U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals


	 base business due to price erosion and increased competition, that impacted the commercial potential of definite and indefinite-lived intangible assets.




	During the year ended December 31, 2015, we identified certain market conditions impacting the commercial potential of certain indefinite and definite-lived intangible assets in our


	U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals


	 segment. Accordingly, we tested these assets for impairment and determined that the carrying value of certain of these assets was no longer fully recoverable, resulting in pre-tax, non-cash asset impairment charges of 


	$70.2 million


	,


	$72.4 million


	 and


	$38.4 million


	, respectively, during the second, third and fourth quarters of 2015.




	U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals Segment




	As a result of unfavorable formulary changes and generic competition for sumatriptan, we experienced a downturn in the performance of our Sumavel



	®



	 DosePro



	®



	 (Sumavel



	®



	) product, a needle-free delivery system for sumatriptan acquired from Zogenix, Inc. in 2014. As a result of this underperformance, we concluded during the third quarter of 2016 that an impairment assessment was required to evaluate the recoverability of Sumavel



	®



	. After performing this assessment, we recorded a pre-tax, non-cash impairment charge of


	$72.8 million


	 during the three months ended September 30, 2016, representing a full impairment of the intangible asset. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we recognized pre-tax, non-cash intangible asset impairment charges of


	$37.6 million


	 in our


	U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals


	 segment resulting primarily from the termination of our BELBUCA



	TM



	 product and the return of this product to BDSI.




	During the year ended December 31, 2015, a sustained downturn in the short-acting TRT market caused underperformance across several of our TRT products, including Testim



	®



	 and Natesto™. In addition, we also experienced underperformance with respect to STENDRA



	®



	. As a result of this underperformance and a re-alignment of investment priorities towards higher growth and higher value assets such as XIAFLEX



	®



	, we concluded during the third quarter of 2015 that an impairment assessment was required to evaluate the recoverability of certain definite-lived intangible assets associated with these products. After performing this assessment, we recorded a pre-tax, non-cash impairment charge of approximately


	$152.0 million


	 during the third quarter of 2015, representing a full impairment of our Natesto™ intangible asset and a partial impairment of our Testim



	®



	 and STENDRA



	®



	 intangible assets. As a result of providing written notice to VIVUS Inc. on December 30, 2015 that we were terminating the STENDRA



	®



	 License Agreement effective June 30, 2016, we recorded an additional pre-tax, non-cash impairment charge of approximately


	$9.5 million


	, representing the remaining carrying amount of our STENDRA



	®



	 intangible asset. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2015, we determined that the fair value of certain U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals IPR&D assets were less than their respective carrying amounts, and we recorded a pre-tax, non-cash impairment charge of


	$5.5 million


	 representing the full carrying amount of the assets.

	International Pharmaceuticals Segment




	During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we determined that we would not pursue commercialization of a product in certain international markets. Accordingly, we tested the definite-lived intangible asset associated with this product for impairment and determined that the carrying value was no longer fully recoverable, resulting in pre-tax, non-cash asset impairment charge of


	$16.2 million


	 during the third quarter of 2016. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we recognized pre-tax, non-cash intangible asset impairment charges of


	$285.5 million


	 in our


	International Pharmaceuticals


	 segment resulting from certain market conditions impacting the commercial potential of definite and indefinite-lived intangible assets.




	As part of our definite-lived intangible asset impairment review processes for 2015, we recorded pre-tax, non-cash impairment charges of approximately


	$14.6 million


	 in our


	International Pharmaceuticals


	 segment, representing the difference between the carrying amount of certain intangible assets and their estimated fair value.

	 was primarily driven by lower acquisition-related and integration costs of


	$106.6 million


	 associated with our Auxilium and Par acquisitions, which closed in 2015. This decrease was partially offset by


	$23.8 million


	 of expense for 2016, compared to a benefit of


	$65.6 million


	 for


	2015


	, resulting from changes in the fair value of contingent consideration. The adjustments to contingent consideration were due to changes in market conditions impacting the commercial potential of the underlying products.

	Discontinued operations, net of tax


	.


	 As a result of our decision to sell our AMS business and wind down our Astora business, together comprising the entirety of our former Devices segment, the operating results of this business are reported as


	Discontinued operations, net of tax


	 in the

	, net of tax, in


	2015


	.




	The change during


	2016


	 was mainly due to a decrease in charges relating to mesh litigation of


	$1,087.6 million


	, a decrease in asset impairment charges of


	$209.4 million


	 and a reduction of income tax expense of


	$157.4 million


	 derived from tax expense recorded as part of the divestiture of the Men’s Health and Prostate Health businesses in the third quarter of 2015, offset partially by a full valuation allowance recorded on certain of our U.S. net deferred tax assets in 2016, a decrease in income from operations resulting from the sale of the Men’s Health and Prostate Health components in the third quarter of 2015 and a gain on the sale of the Men’s Health and Prostate Health components noted above of approximately 


	$13.6 million


	 during the third quarter of 2015.

	 Outlook




	We estimate that our


	2017


	 total revenues will be between


	$3.45 billion


	 and


	$3.60 billion


	. This estimate reflects an anticipated decline in our


	U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals


	 segment driven by a decline in the base business partially offset by growth in our Sterile Injectables and new launch revenues; a decline in our


	U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals


	 segment resulting from the annualization of the loss of exclusivity for Voltaren



	®



	 Gel and Frova



	®



	and the continued decline in the legacy pain portfolio, partially offset by the growth of XIAFLEX



	®



	and our other Specialty business products; and the divestiture of the South African Litha Healthcare Group Limited and competitive pressures in our


	International Pharmaceuticals


	 segment. The Company anticipates improved margins in 2017 driven by product rationalization in our


	U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals


	 segment and targeted cost reductions in selling, general and administrative expenses. We will continue to invest in XIAFLEX



	®



	 and other core products to position the Company for long-term success. There can be no assurance that we will achieve these results.

	Our primary U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals R&D efforts are focused on high-barrier-to-entry generic products, including first-to-file or first-to-market opportunities that are difficult to formulate, difficult to manufacture or face complex legal and regulatory challenges. We believe products with these characteristics will face a lesser degree of competition and therefore provide longer product life cycles and higher profitability than commodity generic products. In


	2015


	 and


	2014


	, our direct R&D expense related to generics totaled


	$58.4 million


	 and


	$32.1 million


	, respectively. The increase in expense is a result of the Par acquisition and additional investments in expanding our research and development and manufacturing capabilities.




	The


	decrease


	 in


	U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals


	 expenses in


	2015


	 was primarily attributable to


	$30.0 million


	 in milestone charges incurred during


	2014


	 related to the achievement of certain BELBUCA™ clinical milestones and decreases in other branded pharmaceutical product expenses. We undertook initiatives in 2014 to optimize commercial spend and refocus our research and development efforts on progressing late-stage pipeline and maximizing value of marketed products. On June 2, 2014, we completed the sale of our branded pharmaceutical drug discovery platform to Asana BioSciences, LLC (Asana), an independent member of the Amneal Alliance of Companies. The sale included multiple early-stage drug discovery and development candidates in a variety of therapeutic areas, including oncology, pain and inflammation, among others. In addition, on November 4, 2014 we sold most of the assets and intellectual property of our second generation implantable drug technology to Braeburn Pharmaceuticals (Braeburn), excluding the existing implant platform used for our two marketed histrelin-containing products, Vantas



	®



	 and Supprelin



	®



	.




	As part of the Auxilium acquisition, we acquired Auxilium’s licensed right to cover certain XIAFLEX



	®



	 indications. As a result, we have incurred related early-stage and middle-stage development expenses for these XIAFLEX



	®



	 indications.

	$37.1 million


	, compared to

	Asset impairment charges

	$1,140.7 million


	, compared to


	$22.5 million


	 in


	2014


	.




	This


	increase


	 primarily relates to 2015 pre-tax, non-cash impairment charges of


	$673.5 million


	 and


	$85.8 million


	, for the former UEO and Paladin reporting units, respectively, representing the difference between the estimated implied fair value of the former UEO and Paladin reporting units’ goodwill and their respective net book value. Goodwill in our former UEO reporting unit, prior to the impairments, was approximately


	$915 million


	 with approximately


	$815 million


	 stemming from the Paladin and Auxilium acquisitions. We assigned the goodwill arising from the Paladin acquisition to multiple reporting units across each of our reportable segments. This assignment was based on the relative incremental benefit expected to be realized by each impacted reporting unit. The level of goodwill created by the Paladin and Auxilium acquisitions was impacted by the increase in our share price from the acquisition announcement date to the date the acquisition closed. During 2015, our revised expectations of certain TRT products and other elements of the UEO business due to current and expected market conditions coupled with the new investment opportunities resulting from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of BELBUCA™ and other strategic priorities resulted in a shift in investment strategy.  As a result of these factors, there was a decline in the fair value of the former UEO reporting unit. Goodwill in our Paladin reporting unit, prior to the impairments, was approximately


	$520 million


	. In addition to the goodwill impairment charges, during 2015 we also recorded pre-tax, non-cash impairment charges of


	$370.6 million


	 on certain intangible assets primarily from our


	U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals


	 and


	U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals


	 segments.




	The amounts incurred during 2014 related primarily to a charge of


	$12.3 million


	 to fully impair a license intangible asset related to OPANA



	®



	 ER as well as charges of


	$4.3 million


	 to completely write off certain miscellaneous property, plant and equipment. These impairment charges were recorded because we determined the carrying amounts of these assets were no longer recoverable.




	Acquisition-related and integration items


	.


	Acquisition-related and integration items


	 in


	2015

	$105.3 million


	 in expense, compared to


	$77.4 million


	 in expense in


	2014


	. During 2015, we recorded


	$65.6 million


	 of income, net, resulting from the change in the fair value of certain contingent consideration. The change in contingent consideration is due to certain market conditions impacting the commercial potential of the underlying products. This income was partially offset by an increase in overall acquisition-related and integration costs associated with our acquisition of Auxilium, which closed during the first quarter of 2015, and acquisition of Par, which closed during the third quarter of 2015.

	Fluctuations in foreign currency rates are primarily driven by our increased global presence subsequent to the acquisitions of Paladin and Somar as well as foreign currency rate movements. In


	2015


	, we recognized an other-than-temporary impairment of our Litha joint venture investment totaling


	$18.9 million


	, reflecting the excess carrying value of this investment over its estimated fair value. In addition, we incurred


	$78.4 million


	 during 2015 related to unused commitment fees primarily associated with financing for the Par acquisition.




	Income tax (benefit) expense


	.


	 In


	2015


	, we recognized an income tax


	benefit


	 of


	$1,137.5 million


	 on


	$1,437.9 million


	 of


	loss from continuing operations before income tax


	, compared to


	$38.3 million


	 of tax expense on


	$99.9 million


	 of


	income from continuing operations before income tax


	 in

	. The effective income tax rate was


	79.1%


	 in benefit on the current period


	loss from continuing operations before income tax


	 in


	2015


	, compared to an effective income tax rate of


	38.3%


	 in expense on


	income from continuing operations before income tax


	 in


	2014


	. Our tax rate is affected by recurring items, such as tax rates in Non-U.S. jurisdictions as compared to the Notional U.S. federal statutory tax rate, and the relative amount of income earned in those various jurisdictions. It is also impacted by discrete items that may occur in any given year, but are not consistent from year to year. The following items had the most significant impact on the difference between the notional U.S. statutory federal income tax rate and our effective tax rate:




	2015:













	•






	$786.1 million


	 net tax benefit or a


	54.7%


	 rate benefit associated with the recognition of outside basis differences in certain subsidiaries.
















	•






	$359.5 million


	 net tax benefit or a


	25.0%


	 rate benefit associated with our geographical mix of earnings. No provision has been made for Irish taxes, as the majority of our undistributed foreign earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested outside of Ireland.
















	•






	$278.3 million


	 tax expense or


	19.4%


	 rate charge resulting from the non-deductible portion of impaired goodwill.







	2014:













	•






	$52.5 million


	 net tax benefit or a


	52.3%


	 rate benefit associated with our geographical mix of earnings. No provision has been made for Irish taxes, as the majority of our undistributed foreign earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested outside of Ireland.
















	•






	$16.3 million


	 tax expense or a


	16.4%


	 rate charge associated with the PPACA.
















	•






	$15.4 million


	 tax expense or a


	15.4%


	 rate charge associated with the excise tax incurred in connection with our business combination with Paladin.
















	•






	$10.1 million


	 tax expense or a


	10.1%


	 rate charge associated with U.S. state income taxes net of the U.S. federal tax benefit.
















	•






	$5.9 million


	 tax expense or a


	5.9%


	 rate charge associated with the non-deductible portion of our acquisition costs pertaining to our business combination with Paladin and our acquisition of Somar.
















	•






	$5.5 million


	 tax expense or a


	5.4%


	 rate charge associated with the loss of our prior year domestic manufacturing deduction benefit pursuant to our 2014 U.S. net operating loss carryback claim.

	Part IV, Item 15 of this report "Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules"


	.




	Discontinued operations, net of tax


	.


	 As a result of our decision to sell our AMS business, which comprises the entirety of our former Devices segment, as well as our February 2014 sale of our HealthTronics business, the operating results of these businesses are reported as


	Discontinued operations, net of tax


	 in the


	Consolidated Statements of Operations


	 for all periods presented. The results of our discontinued operations totaled


	$1,194.9 million


	 of


	loss


	, net of tax, in


	2015


	 compared to


	$779.8 million


	 of


	loss


	, net of tax, in


	2014


	.




	The fluctuation in Discontinued operations in


	2015


	 compared to


	2014


	 was mainly related to a decrease in income tax benefit of


	$282.7 million


	, an increase in impairment charges of 


	$230.7 million


	 and a decrease in income from operations due to the sale of the Men’s Health and Prostate Health components. The decrease in income tax expense benefit relates to the tax impact of the underlying differences between book and tax basis of the underlying assets sold as part of the transactions in 2014 and 2015. These fluctuations were partially offset by a decrease in expense associated with mesh-related product liability claimants of


	$165.6 million


	 and a gain on the sale of the Men’s Health and Prostate Health components of approximately


	$13.6 million


	 in


	2015


	.

	Business Segment Results Review




	The three reportable business segments in which we operate are: (1)


	U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals


	, (2) 


	U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals


	 and (3)


	International Pharmaceuticals


	. These segments reflect the level at which the chief operating decision maker regularly reviews financial information to assess performance and to make decisions about resources to be allocated. Each segment derives revenue from the sales or licensing of its respective products and is discussed in more detail below.

	We evaluate segment performance based on each segment’s


	adjusted income from continuing operations before income tax


	, a financial measure not determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which we define as


	loss from continuing operations before income tax


	 and before


	certain upfront and milestone payments to partners; acquisition-related and integration items, including transaction costs, earn-out payments or adjustments, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration and bridge financing costs; cost reduction and integration-related initiatives such as separation benefits, retention payments, other exit costs and certain costs associated with integrating an acquired company’s operations; excess costs that will be eliminated pursuant to integration plans; asset impairment charges; amortization of intangible assets; inventory step-up recorded as part of our acquisitions; certain non-cash interest expense; litigation-related and other contingent matters and gains or losses from early termination of debt; foreign currency gains or losses on intercompany financing arrangements; and certain other items


	.




	Certain of the corporate general and administrative expenses incurred by us are not attributable to any specific segment. Accordingly, these costs are not allocated to any of our segments and are included in the results below as Corporate unallocated. Our consolidated adjusted income from continuing operations before income tax is equal to the combined results of each of its segments less these unallocated corporate costs.




	We refer to


	adjusted income from continuing operations before income tax


	 in making operating decisions because we believe it provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance. For instance, we believe that this measure facilitates its internal comparisons to our historical operating results and comparisons to competitors’ results. We believe this measure is useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency related to supplemental information used in our financial and operational decision-making. In addition, we have historically reported similar financial measures to our investors and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our current financial reporting. Further, we believe that


	adjusted income from continuing operations before income tax


	 may be useful to investors as we are aware that certain of our significant shareholders utilize


	adjusted income from continuing operations before income tax


	 to evaluate our financial performance. Finally,


	adjusted income from continuing operations before income tax


	 is utilized in the calculation of adjusted diluted income per share, which is used by the Compensation Committee of Endo’s board of directors in assessing the performance and compensation of substantially all of our employees, including our executive officers.




	There are limitations to using financial measures such as


	adjusted income from continuing operations before income tax


	. Other companies in our industry may define


	adjusted income from continuing operations before income tax


	 differently than we do. As a result, it may be difficult to use


	adjusted income from continuing operations before income tax


	 or similarly named adjusted financial measures that other companies may use to compare the performance of those companies to our performance. Because of these limitations,


	adjusted income from continuing operations before income tax


	 is not intended to represent cash flow from operations as defined by U.S. GAAP and should not be used as alternatives to net income as indicators of operating performance or to cash flows as measures of liquidity. We compensate for these limitations by providing reconciliations of our


	total segment adjusted income from continuing operations before income tax


	 to our consolidated


	loss from continuing operations before income tax


	, which is determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and included in our


	Consolidated Statements of Operations


	.

	d


	13%


	 to


	$1,230.1 million


	 from


	2015


	. This


	increase


	 was attributable to approximately


	$629.4 million


	 in revenue during


	2016


	 as a result of the acquisition of Par, partially offset by


	a decrease as a result of competitive pressure on commoditized generic products


	.




	Net sales of


	Sterile Injectables


	 in


	2016




	increase


	d


	393%


	 to


	$530.8 million


	 from


	2015


	. This


	increase


	 was attributable to a full year of revenues from the acquisition of Par, which was acquired in September 2015.


	Sterile Injectables


	 include net sales of Vasostrict



	®



	, the first and only vasopressin injection with a New Drug Application (NDA) approved by the FDA, which was


	$343.5 million


	 in


	2016


	. In June 2016, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued Endo a new Vasostrict



	®



	 patent, which has an expiration date of January 30, 2035. Any Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) applicant seeking FDA approval for a generic version of Vasostrict



	®



	prior to expiration of the patent has to notify Par of its ANDA filing before it can obtain FDA approval. Any ANDA filer whose application was not received prior to submission of the new patent information would be subject to a 30-month stay of marketing approval by the FDA upon the initiation of Hatch-Waxman litigation by Par against the ANDA filer.

	 to


	$803.7 million


	 from


	2015


	. This


	increase


	 was primarily attributable to launch products from the Par acquisition, partially offset by increased competitive pressure on patches, ophthalmics and other alternative doses. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we launched Ezetimibe tablets (generic version of Zetia



	®



	), which is a first-to-file product with an associated brand value of approximately


	$2.6 billion


	, and Quetiapine ER tablets (generic version of Seroquel



	®



	 XR), which is a first-to-file product with an associated brand value of approximately


	$1.3 billion

	d


	30%


	 to


	$87.6 million


	 from


	2015


	. This


	decrease


	 was attributable to volume decreases resulting from generic competition partially offset by an increase in price. Actavis plc (Actavis) (now Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (Teva)), launched a generic form of Lidoderm



	®



	 in September 2013, our U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals segment launched its authorized generic of Lidoderm



	®



	 in May 2014, and Mylan, Inc. (Mylan) launched a generic form of Lidoderm



	®



	 in August 2015. To the extent additional competitors are able to launch generic versions of Lidoderm



	®



	, our revenues could decline further.

	 ER in


	2016




	decrease


	d


	10%


	 to


	$158.9 million


	 from

	. Net sales continue to be impacted by competing generic versions of the INTAC



	®



	 technology formulation of OPANA



	®



	 ER, which launched beginning in early 2013. To the extent additional competitors are able to launch generic versions of the INTAC



	®



	 technology formulation of OPANA



	®



	 ER, our revenues could decline further. The FDA has announced an upcoming Advisory Committee for Opana



	®



	 ER and oxymorphone for March 2017. The Advisory Committee will likely discuss pre- and post-marketing data about the abuse of OPANA



	®



	 ER, and the overall risk-benefit of this product. The Advisory Committee will also discuss abuse of generic oxymorphone ER and oxymorphone immediate-release (IR) products.

	. This


	decrease


	 was primarily attributable to the March 2016 launch of Amneal Pharmaceuticals LLC’s generic equivalent of Voltaren



	®



	 Gel and our launch of the authorized generic of Voltaren



	®



	 Gel in July 2016. Subject to FDA approval, it is possible one or more additional competing generic products could potentially enter the market, which could negatively impact future sales of Voltaren

	. The


	decrease


	 was primarily attributable to decreased Frova

	revenues related to generic competition, partially offset by the acquisitions of Auxilium, which we acquired on


	January 29, 2015


	 and other branded products acquired with Par.

In addition, the Generics business benefited from new product launches, an increase in demand for generic pain products and certain sales incentives offered to customers in the fourth quarter of 2015 in anticipation of additional competitive entrants expected in early 2016. This benefit was partially offset by increased pricing pressures due to increased competition across pain and commoditized products within the legacy Qualitest business.

	We have historically had broad access to financial markets that provide liquidity.


	Cash and cash equivalents


	, which primarily consisted of bank deposits, time deposits and money market accounts, totaled


	$517.3 million


	 at


	December 31, 2016


	 compared to


	$272.3 million


	 at


	December 31, 2015


	.




	We expect cash generated from operations together with our cash, cash equivalents and the revolving credit facilities to be sufficient to cover cash needs for working capital and general corporate purposes, certain contingent liabilities, payment of contractual obligations, principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, capital expenditures, ordinary share repurchases and any regulatory and/or sales milestones that may become due over the next year. However, on a longer term basis, we may not be able to accurately predict the effect of certain developments on the rate of sales growth, such as the degree of market acceptance, patent protection and exclusivity of our products, the impact of competition, the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts and the outcome of our current efforts to develop, receive approval for and successfully launch our product candidates. Additionally, we may not be successful in implementing, or may face unexpected changes or expenses in connection with our strategic direction, including the potential for opportunistic corporate development transactions. Any of the above could adversely affect our future cash flows. We may need to obtain additional funding for future transactions, to repay our outstanding indebtedness, or for our future operational needs, and we cannot be certain that funding will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Any issuances of equity securities or convertible securities could have a dilutive effect on the ownership interest of our current shareholders and may adversely impact net income per share in future periods. An acquisition may be accretive or dilutive and, by its nature, involves numerous risks and uncertainties. As a result of any acquisition efforts, if any, we are likely to experience significant charges to earnings for merger and related expenses (whether or not the acquisitions are consummated) that may include transaction costs, closure costs or costs of restructuring activities.




	We consider the undistributed earnings from the majority of our subsidiaries as of


	December 31, 2016


	 to be indefinitely reinvested outside of Ireland and, accordingly, neither income tax nor withholding taxes have been provided thereon. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, indefinitely reinvested earnings were approximately


	$157.3 million


	. We have historically repatriated funds on a tax-free basis to our parent company for stock repurchases and to our Irish and Luxembourg financing companies to repay debt. Accordingly, we do not anticipate incurring tax in deploying funds to satisfy liquidity needs arising in the ordinary course of our business.




	Borrowings


	.


	At


	December 31, 2016


	, the Company’s indebtedness includes a credit agreement with combined outstanding principal borrowings of


	$3,713.9 million


	 and additional availability of approximately


	$997.4 million


	 under the revolving credit facilities.




	The credit agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants that the Company believes to be usual and customary for a senior secured credit facility. The negative covenants include, among other things, limitations on capital expenditures, asset sales, mergers and acquisitions, indebtedness, liens, dividends, investments and transactions with the Company’s affiliates. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, we were in compliance with all such covenants. In addition, on an annual basis commencing with the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company is required to perform a calculation of excess cash flow (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement), which may result in an accelerated payment of the principal amount. The excess cash flow calculation for the year ended December 31, 2016 did not result in an excess payment.




	At


	December 31, 2016


	, the Company’s indebtedness includes senior notes with aggregate principal amounts totaling


	$4.7 billion


	. These notes mature between 2022 and 2025, subject to earlier repurchase or redemption in accordance with the terms of the respective indentures. Interest rates on these notes range from


	5.375%


	 to


	7.25%


	. These notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company’s subsidiaries and are issued or guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis, as applicable, by all of our significant subsidiaries (other than Astora, Somar and Litha) and certain of our other subsidiaries, except for the 7.25% Senior Notes due 2022, which are issued by Endo Health Solutions Inc. and guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the guarantors named in the Fifth Supplemental Indenture relating to such notes (see Exhibit 4.4 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K).




	The indentures governing our various senior notes contain affirmative and negative covenants that the Company believes to be usual and customary for senior unsecured indentures. The negative covenants, among other things, restrict the Company’s ability and the ability of its restricted subsidiaries to incur certain additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock, make restricted payments, sell certain assets, agree to any restrictions on the ability of restricted subsidiaries to make payments to us, create certain liens, merge, consolidate, or sell substantially all of the Company’s assets, or enter into certain transactions with affiliates. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, we were in compliance with all covenants.




	Credit ratings.


	The Company’s corporate credit ratings assigned by Moody’s Investors Service and Standard & Poor’s are 


	B1


	 with a


	negative


	 outlook and 


	B+


	 with a


	negative


	 outlook, respectively.

	. Since


	December 31, 2015


	, our current assets have decreased by


	$863 million


	. Changes in current assets impacting working capital were largely driven by a


	$197 million


	 decrease in inventories resulting from continued amortization of inventory step-up related to our recent business acquisitions and excess inventory reserves recorded during the


	year ended December 31, 2016


	 and a


	$304 million


	 net differential between cash distributions made from the QSFs to mesh-related product liability claimants and cash distributions into the QSFs. The remaining changes in current assets did not have a significant impact on working capital. Since


	December 31, 2015


	, our current liabilities have decreased by


	$840 million


	. Changes in current liabilities impacting working capital were driven largely by a


	$591 million


	 decrease in the current portion of our legal settlement accrual as a result of cash distributions made from the QSFs of


	$1.1 billion


	 during 2016, partially offset by


	$549 million


	 of our long-term legal settlement accrual shifting into short-term between 2015 and 2016. In addition, accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased by approximately


	$56 million


	, primarily associated with decreased gross to net reserves in our


	U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals


	 business. The remaining changes in current liabilities did not have a significant impact on working capital.

	Research and development


	.


	 Over the past few years, we have incurred significant expenditures related to conducting clinical studies to develop new products and expand the value of our existing products beyond what is currently approved in their respective labels.




	As part of the Auxilium acquisition, the Company acquired Auxilium’s licensed right to cover certain XIAFLEX



	®



	 indications. As a result, the Company has incurred related early-stage and middle-stage development expenses for these XIAFLEX



	®



	 indications.




	We expect to incur research and development expenditures relative to the development and advancement of our current generic and branded product pipeline and any additional product candidates we may add via license, acquisition or organically. There can be no assurance the results of any ongoing or future nonclinical or clinical trials related to these projects will be successful, that additional trials will not be required, that any drug, product or indication under development will receive regulatory approval in a timely manner or at all, or that such drug, product or indication could be successfully manufactured in accordance with current good manufacturing practices for the geographies where the products are approved, successfully marketed in a timely manner, or at all, or that we will have sufficient funds to develop or commercialize any of our products.




	Manufacturing, supply and other service agreements.


	 Certain of our subsidiaries contract with various third party manufacturers, suppliers and service providers to provide raw materials used in our subsidiaries’ products and semi-finished and finished goods, as well as certain packaging, labeling, customer service support, warehouse and distribution services. These contracts include agreements with Novartis Consumer Health, Inc., Novartis AG and Sandoz, Inc. (collectively, Novartis), Teikoku Seiyaku Co., Ltd., Noramco, Inc., Grünenthal GmbH and Jubilant HollisterStier Laboratories LLC. If, for any reason, our subsidiaries are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of any of the finished goods or raw materials or components required for their products needed to conduct their business, it could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.




	License and collaboration agreements.


	 Our subsidiaries have agreed to certain contingent payments in certain license, collaboration and other agreements. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon the achievement of certain developmental, regulatory, commercial and/or other milestones. Due to the fact that it is uncertain if and when these milestones will be achieved, such contingencies have not been recorded in our


	Consolidated Balance Sheets


	. In addition, under certain arrangements, we or our subsidiaries may have to make royalty payments based on a percentage of future sales of the products in the event regulatory approval for marketing is obtained. From a business perspective, we view these payments favorably as they signify that the products are moving successfully through the development phase toward commercialization.




	Acquisitions.


	Going forward, our primary focus will be on organic growth. However, we may consider and, as appropriate, make acquisitions of other businesses, products, product rights or technologies. Our cash reserves and other liquid assets may be inadequate to consummate such acquisitions and it may be necessary for us to issue ordinary shares or raise substantial additional funds in the future to complete future transactions. In addition, as a result of any acquisition efforts, we are likely to experience significant charges to earnings for merger and related expenses (whether or not our efforts are successful) that may include transaction costs, closure costs or costs of restructuring activities.




	Legal proceedings.


	 We are subject to various patent, product liability, government investigations and other legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. Accruals are recorded when we determine that a loss related to a litigation matter is both probable and reasonably estimable. Due to the fact that legal proceedings and other contingencies are inherently unpredictable, our assessments involve significant judgments regarding future events.

	(1)






	Includes minimum cash payments related to principal associated with our indebtedness. A discussion of such indebtedness is included above under the caption “


	Borrowings


	”.
















	(2)






	These amounts represent future cash interest payments related to our existing debt obligations based on fixed and variable interest rates specified in the associated debt agreements. Payments related to variable debt are based on applicable rates at


	December 31, 2016


	 plus the specified margin in the associated debt agreements for each period presented.
















	(3)






	Includes minimum cash payments related to certain fixed assets, primarily related to technology. In addition, includes minimum cash payments related to the direct financing arrangement for our U.S. headquarters in Malvern, Pennsylvania. We have agreed to sublease a portion of the Malvern facility, equal to approximately


	90,000


	 square feet, through December 31, 2024. We will receive approximately


	$20.0 million


	 in minimum rental payments over the remaining term of the sublease, which is not included in the table above.
















	(4)






	Includes minimum cash payments related to our leased automobiles, machinery and equipment and facilities not included in capital lease obligations. Under the terms of our leases for our former headquarters in Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania, the former Auxilium headquarters in Chesterbrook, Pennsylvania, and the former AMS headquarters in Eden Prairie, Minnesota, we are required to continue to pay all future minimum lease payments to the landlord. We have agreed to sublease the entire Chadds Ford facility through March 31, 2018 and the entire Eden Prairie facility through December 21, 2020. We will receive approximately


	$2.8 million


	 in minimum rental payments over the remaining terms of the subleases, which is not included in the table above.
















	(5)






	Purchase obligations are enforceable and legally binding obligations for purchases of goods and services including minimum inventory contracts.
















	(6)






	The amount included above represents contractual payments for mesh-related product liability settlements pursuant to existing Master Settlement Agreements (MSAs) and reflect the earliest date that a settlement payment could be due and the largest amount that could be due on that date. These matters are described in more detail in


	Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies


	 of the


	Consolidated Financial Statements


	 of


	Part IV, Item 15 of this report "Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules"


	.
















	(7)






	Other obligations and commitments include agreements to purchase third-party assets, products and services and other minimum royalty obligations.
















	(8)






	Total does not include contractual obligations already included in current liabilities on our


	Consolidated Balance Sheets


	, except for current portion of long-term debt, short-term capital lease obligations, short-term royalty obligations and the current portion of the mesh-related product liability or certain purchase obligations, which are discussed below.







	For purposes of the table above, obligations for the purchase of goods or services are included only for significant noncancelable purchase orders at least one year in length that are enforceable, legally binding and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions and the timing of the obligation. Our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are typically fulfilled by our suppliers within a relatively short period. At


	December 31, 2016


	, we have open purchase orders that represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements that are not included in the table above. In addition, we do not include collaboration agreements and potential payments under those agreements or potential payments related to contingent consideration.








	78









	Table of Contents









	As of


	December 31, 2016


	, our liability for unrecognized tax benefits amounted to


	$443.6 million


	 (including interest and penalties). Due to the nature and timing of the ultimate outcome of these uncertain tax positions, we cannot make a reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payments. Therefore, our liability has been excluded from the above contractual obligations table.




	Fluctuations.


	Our quarterly results have fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate. These fluctuations may be due to the timing of new product launches, purchasing patterns of our customers, market acceptance of our products, the impact of competitive products and pricing, asset impairment charges, litigation related charges, restructuring costs, including separation benefits, business combination transaction costs, upfront, milestone and certain other payments made or accrued pursuant to licensing agreements and changes in the fair value of financial instruments and contingent assets and liabilities recorded as part of a business combination. Further, a substantial portion of our total revenues are through three wholesale drug distributors who in turn supply our products to pharmacies, hospitals and physicians. Accordingly, we are potentially subject to a concentration of credit risk with respect to our trade receivables.




	Growth opportunities.


	 We continue to evaluate growth opportunities including investments, licensing arrangements, acquisitions of product rights or technologies and businesses, and strategic alliances and promotional arrangements which could require significant capital resources. We continue to focus our business development activities on further diversifying our revenue base through product licensing and company acquisitions, as well as other opportunities to enhance shareholder value. Through execution of our business strategy we focus on developing new products both internally and with contract and collaborative partners; expanding our product lines by acquiring new products and technologies, increasing revenues and earnings through sales and marketing programs for our innovative product offerings and effectively using our resources; and providing additional resources to support our businesses.




	Non-U.S. operations.


	 Fluctuations in foreign currency rates resulted in a net


	loss


	 of


	$3.0 million


	 in


	2016


	. This compares to a net


	gain


	 of


	$23.1 million


	 in


	2015


	 and a net


	gain


	 of


	$10.1 million


	 in


	2014


	.




	Inflation.


	We do not believe that inflation had a material adverse effect on our financial statements for the periods presented.




	Off-balance sheet arrangements.


	We have no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K.








	Item 7A.


	    


	Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk






	Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the financial markets, including interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.




	Interest Rate Risk




	Our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our variable rate indebtedness associated with the term loan portion and revolving credit facilities portion of our credit agreement. To the extent we utilize amounts under our term loans and revolving credit facilities, we would be exposed to additional interest rate risk. At


	December 31, 2016


	, our term loans include principal amount of floating-rate debt of


	$3.7 billion


	. We had no principal amounts of floating-rate debt outstanding on our revolving credit facilities as of


	December 31, 2016


	. Borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and our Term Loan A facility bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). In addition, borrowings under our Term Loan B facility bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus LIBOR, subject to a LIBOR floor of 0.75%. A hypothetical 1% increase in LIBOR over the 0.75% floor would result in


	$37.1 million


	 in incremental annual interest expense.




	As of


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	, we had no other assets or liabilities with significant interest rate sensitivity.




	Investment Risk




	At


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	, we had immaterial investments in available-for-sale securities, primarily associated with equity securities of publicly traded companies. Any decline in value below our original investments will be evaluated to determine if the decline in value is considered temporary or other-than-temporary. An other-than-temporary decline in fair value would be included as a charge to earnings.




	Foreign Currency Exchange Risk




	We operate and transact business in various foreign countries and are therefore subject to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The Company manages this foreign currency risk, in part, through operational means including managing foreign currency revenues in relation to same currency costs as well as managing foreign currency assets in relation to same currency liabilities. The Company is also exposed to the potential earnings effects from intercompany foreign currency assets and liabilities that arise from normal trade receivables and payables and other intercompany loans. These subsidiaries’ financial statements are remeasured into their respective functional currencies using current or historical exchange rates. Such remeasurement adjustments could have an adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations.








	79









	Table of Contents









	All assets and liabilities of our international subsidiaries, which maintain their financial statements in local currency, are translated to U.S. dollars at period-end exchange rates. Translation adjustments arising from the use of differing exchange rates are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders’ equity. Gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and short term inter-company receivables from foreign subsidiaries are included in


	Other (income) expense, net


	.




	Fluctuations in foreign currency rates resulted in a net


	loss


	 of


	$3.0 million


	 in


	2016


	. This compares to a net


	gain


	 of


	$23.1 million


	 in


	2015


	 and a net


	gain


	 of


	$10.1 million


	 in


	2014


	.




	Based on the Company’s significant foreign currency denominated intercompany loans existing at


	December 31, 2016


	, we estimate that a 10% appreciation or depreciation in the underlying currencies of our foreign currency denominated intercompany loans, relative to the U.S. Dollar, would result in approximately


	$7.0 million


	 in incremental foreign currency gains or losses, respectively.




	Inflation




	We do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on our revenues or operations.

	(d) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting




	There have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

	Other Information




	On February 27, 2017, the Company’s subsidiaries, Endo Luxembourg Finance Company I S.à r.l., Endo Luxembourg Finance Company II S.à r.l. and Endo Ventures Limited (collectively, the Endo Parties), entered into a Sale Agreement (the Sale Agreement) with Acino Pharma Limited (Acino) to sell all of the securities of Litha Healthcare Group Proprietary Limited, including its issued ordinary shares and intercompany notes, and certain other Sub-Sahara Africa related assets, including license rights.




	Under the terms of the Sale Agreement, Acino will pay an aggregate purchase price of


	$100 million


	 subject to certain cash and working capital adjustments as described in the Sale Agreement. If, and to the extent that, as at the closing date, certain events as more fully described in the Sale Agreement have not occurred, then a portion of the aggregate purchase price will be withheld by Acino and/or paid into escrow with a third party escrow agent who will hold such amount until the occurrence of certain trigger events as more fully described in the Sale Agreement.




	The Sale Agreement contains certain customary representations and warranties and certain customary covenants, including, but not limited to, covenants not to compete and not to solicit. The Sale Agreement also provides that the Endo Parties will indemnify Acino for losses arising from certain breaches of the Sale Agreement and for certain other matters as more fully described in the Sale Agreement.

	Table of Contents









	The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2017, pending customary regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. The parties have also agreed to enter into related ancillary agreements, including a restructuring agreement, a transition services agreement and an escrow agreement.




	The forgoing description of the Sale Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Sale Agreement itself. A copy of the Sale Agreement will be filed as an exhibit to the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, expected to be filed no later than May 10, 2017.

	2014




	NOTE 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION




	The accompanying Condensed Financial Statements of Endo International plc (referred to in these Condensed Financial Statements as the Parent Company) have been prepared on a parent-only basis. Under this basis of presentation, the Parent Company’s investments in its consolidated subsidiaries are presented under the equity method of accounting.




	As of December 31 of each of the years presented in these Condensed Financial Statements, the Parent Company has intercompany balances with its equity method subsidiaries. Additionally, during each of the years presented in these Condensed Financial Statements, the Parent Company has engaged in transactions with its equity method subsidiaries. In connection with these transactions, there are frequent cash movements between the Parent Company and these subsidiaries, certain of which are structured and accounted for as dividends. Transactions between Endo International plc and its consolidated subsidiaries, which are eliminated in our Consolidated Financial Statements, are presented in these Condensed Financial Statements.




	NOTE 2. DIVIDENDS RECEIVED




	Endo International plc received dividends of


	$54.8 million


	 and


	$250.0 million


	 in 2016 and 2015, respectively, from its consolidated subsidiaries. Endo International plc received


	no


	 dividends in 2014 from its consolidated subsidiaries.




	NOTE 3. PAYABLE TO SUBSIDIARIES




	On February 28, 2014, Endo International plc issued


	$24.7 million


	 in aggregate principal amount of a non-interest bearing note to one of its equity method subsidiaries. The loan is due upon the earlier of the expiration date of


	five


	 years from the issuance date or upon written demand by the subsidiary.




	NOTE 4. GUARANTEES




	In accordance with the provisions of Section 357 of the Companies Act 2014, the Parent Company has guaranteed the liabilities of certain of its Irish subsidiaries in respect of the year ended December 31, 2015 in order to avail of the exemption from the filing provisions under Section 347 of the Companies Act 2014. These Irish subsidiaries are Endo Ventures Limited and Endo DAC.




	The Parent Company is also a guarantor on both Dublin leases at Minerva House and Simmonscourt House, respectively, both with an address at Simmonscourt Road, Dublin 4, Ireland.

	MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING




	The management of


	Endo International plc


	 is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.


	Endo International plc


	‘s internal control over financial reporting was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.




	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.




	Endo International plc


	‘s management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of


	December 31, 2016


	. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in


	Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013)


	. Based on our assessment we determined that, as of


	December 31, 2016


	, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.




	Endo International plc’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued its report on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of


	December 31, 2016

	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM




	To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of


	Endo International plc


	:




	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements


	listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1)


	present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of


	Endo International plc


	 and its subsidiaries at


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	December 31, 2015


	, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended


	December 31, 2016


	 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedules


	listed in the index


	appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of


	December 31, 2016


	, based on criteria established in


	Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)


	 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedules, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedules and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.




	A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.




	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

	ENDO INTERNATIONAL PLC




	NOTES TO


	CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	FOR THE YEARS ENDED


	DECEMBER 31, 2016


	, 2015 AND 2014








	NOTE 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS




	Endo International plc is an Ireland-domiciled, global specialty pharmaceutical company focused on generic and branded pharmaceuticals. We aim to be the premier partner to healthcare professionals and payment providers, delivering an innovative suite of generic and branded drugs to meet patients’ needs. Unless otherwise indicated or required by the context, references throughout to “Endo,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us” refer to financial information and transactions of Endo International plc and its consolidated subsidiaries thereafter. The accompanying


	Consolidated Financial Statements


	 of


	Endo International plc


	 and its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with United States (U.S.) generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).








	NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES




	Consolidation and Basis of Presentation—


	The


	Consolidated Financial Statements


	 include the accounts of wholly owned subsidiaries after the elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions.




	Reclassifications—


	Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.




	The Company has modified its presentation of accounts payable and accrued expenses that had been in effect prior to December 31, 2016. The Company has combined amounts related to accounts payable and accrued expenses in its


	Consolidated Balance Sheets


	 and


	Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows


	. The Company has applied this change retrospectively to all periods presented.




	Use of Estimates—


	The preparation of our


	Consolidated Financial Statements


	 in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the


	Consolidated Financial Statements


	 and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates and assumptions are required in the determination of revenue recognition and sales deductions for estimated chargebacks, rebates, sales incentives and allowances, certain royalties, distribution service fees, returns and allowances. Significant estimates and assumptions are also required when determining the fair value of certain financial instruments, the valuation of long-lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets, goodwill, income taxes, contingencies and share-based compensation. Some of these judgments can be subjective and complex, and, consequently, actual results may differ from these estimates. Our estimates often are based on complex judgments, probabilities and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. For any given individual estimate or assumption made by us, there may also be other estimates or assumptions that are reasonable.




	We regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions using historical experience and other factors, including the economic environment. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, our estimates and assumptions may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, or unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause us to change those estimates and assumptions. Market conditions, such as illiquid credit markets, volatile equity markets, dramatic fluctuations in foreign currency rates and economic downturn, can increase the uncertainty already inherent in our estimates and assumptions. We adjust our estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances indicate the need for change. Those changes generally will be reflected in our


	Consolidated Financial Statements


	 on a prospective basis. It is possible that other professionals, applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances, could develop and support a range of alternative estimated amounts. We also are subject to other risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from estimated amounts, such as changes in the healthcare environment, competition, litigation, legislation and regulations.




	Customer, Product and Supplier Concentration—


	We primarily sell our generic and branded pharmaceuticals to wholesalers, drug store chains, supermarket chains, mass merchandisers, distributors, mail order accounts, hospitals and government agencies. Our wholesalers and distributors purchase products from us and, in turn, supply products to retail drug store chains, independent pharmacies and managed health care organizations. Customers in the managed health care market include health maintenance organizations, nursing homes, hospitals, clinics, pharmacy benefit management companies and mail order customers. Total revenues from direct customers that accounted for


	10%


	 or more of our total consolidated revenues during the years ended December 31 are as follows:

	No products accounted for


	10%


	 or more of our total revenues during the years ended


	December 31, 2016


	,


	2015


	 or


	2014


	.




	We have agreements with Novartis Consumer Health, Inc., Novartis AG, Sandoz, Inc., (collectively, Novartis) Teikoku Seiyaku Co., Ltd. (Teikoku), Noramco, Inc. (Noramco), Grünenthal GmbH (Grünenthal) and Jubilant HollisterStier Laboratories LLC (JHS), among others, for the manufacture and supply of several of our existing pharmaceutical products. See


	Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies


	 for further information.




	Revenue Recognition—




	Pharmaceutical Products




	Our net pharmaceutical product sales consist of revenues from sales of our pharmaceutical products, less estimates for chargebacks, rebates, sales incentives and allowances, certain royalties, distribution service fees, returns and allowances as well as fees for services. We recognize revenue for product sales when title and risk of loss has passed to the customer, which is typically upon delivery to the customer, when estimated provisions for revenue reserves are reasonably determinable, and when collectability is reasonably confirmed. Revenue from the launch of a new or significantly unique product may be deferred until such time that the product has achieved market acceptance. For these products, revenue is typically recognized based on dispensed prescription data and other information obtained prior to and during the period following launch.




	Sales Deductions—


	When we recognize net sales from the sale of our pharmaceutical products, we record an adjustment to revenue for estimated revenue reserves. These provisions are estimated based on historical experience, estimated future trends, estimated customer inventory levels, current contract sales terms with our direct and indirect customers and other competitive factors. If the assumptions we used to calculate these adjustments do not appropriately reflect future activity, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be materially impacted.




	Research and Development (R&D)—


	Expenditures for research and development are expensed as incurred. In addition to upfront and milestone payments, total R&D expenses include the costs of discovery research, preclinical development, early- and late-clinical development and drug formulation, as well as clinical trials, medical support of marketed products, other payments under third-party collaborations and contracts and other costs. R&D spending also includes enterprise-wide costs which support our overall R&D infrastructure. Property, plant and equipment that are acquired or constructed for research and development activities and that have alternate future uses are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis. Upfront and milestone payments made to third parties in connection with agreements with third parties are generally expensed as incurred up to the point of regulatory approval. Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are generally capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related product. Amounts capitalized for such payments are included in Other intangibles, net in the


	Consolidated Balance Sheets


	.




	Cash and Cash Equivalents—


	The Company considers all highly liquid money market instruments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. At


	December 31, 2016


	, cash equivalents were deposited in financial institutions and consisted of immediately available fund balances and time deposits. The Company maintains its cash deposits and cash equivalents with well-known and stable financial institutions.




	Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents—


	Cash and cash equivalents that are restricted as to withdrawal or use under the terms of certain contractual agreements are recorded in Restricted cash and cash equivalents in the


	Consolidated Balance Sheets


	. At


	December 31, 2016


	, restricted cash and cash equivalents totaled


	$282.1 million


	, of which


	$276.0 million


	 is held in Qualified Settlement Funds (QSFs) for mesh product liability settlement agreements. The restricted cash related to QSFs are for payments related to the Company’s vaginal mesh liability. See


	Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies


	 for further information relating to the vaginal mesh liability. At


	December 31, 2015


	, restricted cash and cash equivalents totaled


	$585.4 million


	, of which


	$579.0 million


	 was held in QSFs for mesh product liability settlement agreements.




	Marketable Securities—


	The Company has equity securities, which consist of investments in the stock of publicly traded companies. For additional information see


	Note 7. Fair Value Measurements


	.




	Accounts Receivable—


	Accounts receivable are stated at their net realizable value. The allowance for doubtful accounts against gross accounts receivable reflects the best estimate of probable losses inherent in the receivables portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other currently available information. In addition, accounts receivable is reduced by certain sales deduction reserves where we have the right of offset with the customer.




	Concentrations of Credit Risk


	—Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, marketable debt securities and accounts receivable. We invest our excess cash in high-quality, liquid money market instruments and time deposits maintained by major U.S. banks and financial institutions. We have not experienced any losses on our cash equivalents.




	We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally do not require collateral. We have no history of significant losses from uncollectible accounts. Approximately


	84%


	 and


	77%


	 of our gross trade accounts receivable balance represent amounts due from


	three


	 customers at


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	, respectively.








	F-12









	Table of Contents









	We do not expect our current or future credit risk exposures to have a significant impact on our operations. However, there can be no assurance that our business will not experience any adverse impact from credit risk in the future.




	Inventories—


	Inventories consist of finished goods held for distribution, raw materials and work-in-process. Our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out method. We write-down inventories to net realizable value based on forecasted demand and market conditions, which may differ from actual results. Inventory that is in excess of the amount expected to be sold within one year is classified as long-term inventory and is recorded in Other Assets in the 


	Consolidated Balance Sheets


	.




	Property, plant and equipment—


	Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Major improvements are capitalized, while routine maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Costs incurred on assets under construction are capitalized as construction is in progress. Depreciation is computed over the estimated useful life of the related assets on a straight-line basis. Leasehold improvements and capital lease assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the terms of their respective leases. Depreciation is not recorded on assets held for sale. Gains and losses on disposals are included in


	Other (income) expense, net


	 in the


	Consolidated Statements of Operations


	.




	Depreciation is based on the following estimated useful lives, as of


	December 31, 2016


	:

























	 






	Range of Useful Lives, from:








	Buildings






	10 years






	to






	40 years








	Machinery and equipment






	2 years






	to






	20 years








	Leasehold improvements






	2 years






	to






	20 years








	Computer equipment and software






	2 years






	to






	7 years









	Assets under capital lease






	Shorter of useful life or lease term








	Furniture and fixtures






	3 years






	to






	10 years









	Computer Software—


	The Company capitalizes certain costs incurred in connection with obtaining or developing internal-use software, including external direct costs of material and services, and payroll costs for employees directly involved with the software development. Capitalized software costs are included in




	Property, plant and equipment, net in the


	Consolidated Balance Sheets


	 and amortized beginning when the software project is substantially complete and the asset is ready for its intended use. Costs incurred during the preliminary project stage and post-implementation stage, as well as maintenance and training costs, are expensed as incurred.




	Lease Accounting—


	The Company accounts for operating lease transactions by recording rent expense on a straight-line basis over the expected life of the lease, commencing on the date it gains possession of leased property. The Company includes tenant improvement allowances and rent holidays received from landlords and the effect of any rent escalation clauses as adjustments to straight-line rent expense over the expected life of the lease.




	Capital lease transactions are reflected as a liability at the inception of the lease based on the present value of the minimum lease payments or, if lower, the fair value of the property. Assets under capital leases are recorded in Property, plant and equipment, net in the


	Consolidated Balance Sheets


	 and depreciated in a manner similar to other Property, plant and equipment.




	Certain construction projects may be accounted for as direct financing arrangements, whereby the Company records, over the construction period, the full cost of the asset in Property, plant and equipment, net in the


	Consolidated Balance Sheets


	. A corresponding liability is also recorded, net of leasehold improvements paid for by the Company, and is amortized over the expected lease term through monthly rental payments using an effective interest method. Assets recorded under direct financing arrangements are depreciated over the lease term.




	License Rights—


	The cost of licenses are either expensed immediately or, if capitalized, are recorded at cost, less accumulated amortization and are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives ranging from


	3 years


	 to


	15 years


	, with a weighted average useful life of approximately


	12 years


	. We determine amortization periods for licenses based on our assessment of various factors impacting estimated useful lives and cash flows of the acquired rights. Such factors include the expected launch date of the product, the strength of the intellectual property protection of the product and various other competitive, developmental and regulatory issues, and contractual terms. Significant changes to any of these factors may result in a reduction in the useful life of the asset and an acceleration of related amortization expense, which could cause our operating income, net income and net income per share to decrease.








	F-13









	Table of Contents









	Trade names—


	Acquired trade names are recorded at fair value upon acquisition and, if deemed to have definite lives, are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives of approximately


	12 years


	. We determine amortization periods for trade names based on our assessment of various factors impacting estimated useful lives and cash flows from the acquired assets. Such factors include the strength of the trade name and our plans regarding the future use of the trade name. Significant changes to any of these factors may result in a reduction in the useful life of the asset and an acceleration of related amortization expense, which could cause our operating income, net income and net income per share to decrease.




	Developed Technology—


	Acquired developed technology is recorded at fair value upon acquisition and is amortized using the economic benefit model or the straight-line method, over the estimated useful life ranging from


	1 year


	 to


	20 years


	 for our intangibles relating to continuing operations, with a weighted average useful life of approximately


	11 years


	. We determine amortization periods and method of amortization for developed technology based on our assessment of various factors impacting estimated useful lives and timing and extent of estimated cash flows of the acquired assets. Such factors include the strength of the intellectual property protection of the product and various other competitive and regulatory issues, and contractual terms. Significant changes to any of these factors may result in a reduction in the useful life of the asset and an acceleration of related amortization expense, which could cause our operating income, net income and net income per share to decrease. Amortization expense is not recorded on assets held for sale. The value of these assets is subject to continuing scientific, medical and marketplace uncertainty.




	Long-Lived Asset Impairment Testing


	—Long-lived assets, which include property, plant and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets, are assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. The impairment testing involves comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the forecasted undiscounted future cash flows generated by that asset. In the event the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows generated by that asset and the carrying amount is not considered recoverable, an impairment exists. An impairment loss is measured as the excess of the asset’s carrying amount over its fair value. An impairment loss is recognized in net income in the period that the impairment occurs.




	In-Process Research and Development Assets (IPR&D)—


	The fair value of IPR&D acquired in a business combination is determined based on the present value of each research project’s projected cash flows using an income approach. Future cash flows are predominately based on the net income forecast of each project, consistent with historical pricing, margins and expense levels of similar products. Revenues are estimated based on relevant market size and growth factors, expected industry trends, individual project life cycles and the life of each research project’s underlying patent. In determining the fair value of each research project, expected cash flows are adjusted for the technical and regulatory risk of completion.




	IPR&D is initially capitalized and considered indefinite-lived intangible assets subject to annual impairment reviews. The reviews, which occur annually or more frequently upon the occurrence of certain events, requires the determination of the fair value of the respective intangible assets. If the fair value of the intangible assets is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. For those assets that reach commercialization, the assets are amortized over the expected useful lives.




	Goodwill—


	Goodwill, which represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired, is carried at cost. Goodwill is not amortized; rather, it is subject to a periodic assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test. Goodwill is assessed for impairment on an annual basis, as of October 1st of each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The impairment model requires a two-step method for determining goodwill impairment. In the first step, we determine the fair value of our reporting units using an appropriate valuation methodology. If the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we would then perform the second step of the impairment test which requires allocation of the reporting unit’s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities using the acquisition method prescribed under authoritative guidance for business combinations. Any residual fair value is allocated to goodwill. An impairment charge is recognized only when the implied fair value of our reporting unit’s goodwill is less than its carrying amount.




	Contingencies—


	The Company is subject to various patent challenges, product liability claims, government investigations and other legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. Legal fees and other expenses related to litigation are expensed as incurred and included in Selling, general and administrative expenses or Discontinued operations, net of tax in the


	Consolidated Statements of Operations


	. Contingent accruals and legal settlements are recorded with a corresponding charge to


	Litigation-related and other contingencies, net


	 or Discontinued operations, net of tax in the


	Consolidated Statements of Operations


	 when the Company determines that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. Due to the fact that legal proceedings and other contingencies are inherently unpredictable, our assessments involve significant judgment regarding future events. The Company records a receivable from its product liability insurance carriers only when the resolution of any dispute has been reached and realization of the potential claim for recovery is considered probable.








	F-14









	Table of Contents









	Contingent Consideration


	—Certain of the Company’s business acquisitions involve the potential for future payment of consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of operational and commercial milestones and royalty payments on future product sales. The fair value of contingent consideration liabilities is determined at the acquisition date using unobservable inputs. These inputs include the estimated amount and timing of projected cash flows, the probability of success (achievement of the contingent event) and the risk-adjusted discount rate used to present value the probability-weighted cash flows. Subsequent to the acquisition date, at each reporting period, the contingent consideration liability is remeasured at current fair value with changes recorded in earnings. Changes in any of the inputs may result in a significantly different fair value adjustment.




	Share Repurchases—


	The Company accounts for the repurchase of ordinary shares at par value. Under applicable Irish law, ordinary shares repurchased are retired and not displayed separately as treasury stock. Upon retirement of the ordinary shares, the Company records the difference between the weighted average cost of such ordinary shares and the par value of the ordinary shares as an adjustment to Accumulated deficit in the


	Consolidated Balance Sheets


	.




	Advertising Costs—


	Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the


	Consolidated Statements of Operations


	 and amounted to


	$47.9 million


	,


	$57.9 million


	 and


	$28.1 million


	 for the years ended


	December 31, 2016


	,


	2015


	 and


	2014


	, respectively.




	Cost of Revenues


	—Cost of revenues includes all costs directly related to bringing both purchased and manufactured products to their final selling destination. It includes purchasing and receiving costs, direct and indirect costs to manufacture products, including direct materials, direct labor, and direct overhead expenses necessary to acquire and convert purchased materials and supplies into finished goods. Cost of revenues also includes royalties paid or owed by Endo on certain in-licensed products, inspection costs, depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, warehousing costs, freight charges, costs to operate our equipment, and other shipping and handling activity.




	Share-Based Compensation—


	Share-based compensation for employees and non-employee directors is measured at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period. Share-based compensation expense is reduced for estimated future forfeitures. These estimates are revised in future periods if actual forfeitures differ from the estimates. Changes in forfeiture estimates impact compensation expense in the period in which the change in estimate occurs.




	Foreign Currency Translation—


	The Company's operations utilize the U.S. dollar (USD) or local currency as the functional currency, where applicable. The company identifies its separate and distinct foreign entities and groups the foreign entities into two categories: 1) extension of the parent (USD functional currency) and 2) self-contained (local functional currency). If a foreign entity does not align with either category, factors are evaluated and a judgment is made to determine the functional currency.




	For foreign entities where the USD is the functional currency, all foreign currency-denominated asset and liability amounts are re-measured into USD at end-of-period exchange rates, except for inventories, prepaid expenses, property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets, which are re-measured at historical rates. Foreign currency income and expenses are re-measured at average exchange rates in effect during the year, except for expenses related to balance sheet amounts re-measured at historical exchange rates. Exchange gains and losses arising from re-measurement of foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities are included in income in the period in which they occur.




	For foreign entities where the local currency is the functional currency, assets and liabilities denominated in local currencies are translated into USD at end-of-period exchange rates and the resultant translation adjustments are reported, net of their related tax effects, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in equity. Assets and liabilities denominated in other than the local currency are re-measured into the local currency prior to translation into USD and the resultant exchange gains or losses are included in income in the period in which they occur. Income and expenses are translated into USD at average exchange rates in effect during the period.




	Income Taxes—


	The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company records net deferred tax assets to the extent it believes these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such a determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies and results of recent operations. In the event that the Company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, the Company would make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income tax.

	The Company records uncertain tax positions in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 740, Income Taxes, on the basis of a two-step process whereby the Company first determines whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position and then measures those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold. The Company recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than


	50%


	 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the income tax expense line in the accompanying


	Consolidated Statements of Operations


	. Accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the


	Consolidated Balance Sheets


	.




	Comprehensive Income—


	Comprehensive income includes all changes in equity during a period except those that resulted from investments by or distributions to a company’s shareholders. Other comprehensive income or loss refers to revenues, expenses, gains and losses that are included in comprehensive income, but excluded from net income as these amounts are recorded directly as an adjustment to shareholders’ equity.




	Recent Accounting Pronouncements




	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards update (ASU) No. 2014-09, 


	“Revenue from Contracts with Customers”


	(ASU 2014-09). ASU 2014-09 represents a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which a company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU sets forth a new five-step revenue recognition model which replaces the prior revenue recognition guidance in its entirety and is intended to eliminate numerous industry-specific pieces of revenue recognition guidance that have historically existed. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, “


	Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date,”


	 which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year, but permits companies to adopt one year earlier if they choose (i.e., the original effective date). As such, ASU 2014-09 will be effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. In March and April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08


	“Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Consideration (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)”


	 and ASU No. 2016-10


	“Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing,”


	respectively


	,


	which clarifies the guidance on reporting revenue as a principal versus agent, identifying performance obligations and accounting for intellectual property licenses. In addition, in May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12


	“Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606):




	Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients,”


	which amends certain narrow aspects of Topic 606, and in December 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-20


	“Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers,”


	 which amends certain narrow aspects of Topic 606.




	The Company will adopt the new revenue recognition standards on January 1, 2018. The Company has established a cross-functional implementation team consisting of representatives from across its business segments. The Company is currently in the process of performing a diagnostic assessment of the impact of the standard on its contract portfolio by reviewing the Company’s current accounting policies and practices to identify potential differences that would result from applying the requirements of the new standard to its revenue contracts. In addition, during 2017 the Company plans to identify and implement, if necessary, appropriate changes to its business processes, systems and controls to support recognition and disclosure under the new standard. The implementation team intends to report the findings and progress of the project to the Company’s management and the Audit Committee throughout the remainder of 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2014-09 on the Company’s consolidated results of operations and financial position. In addition, the two permitted transition methods under the new standard are the full retrospective method, in which case the standard would be applied to each prior reporting period presented and the cumulative effect of applying the standard would be recognized at the earliest period shown, or the modified retrospective method, in which case the cumulative effect of applying the standard would be recognized at the date of initial application. The Company is currently evaluating which transition method it will elect.




	In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, “


	Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory”


	 (ASU 2015-11). ASU 2015-11 states that an entity should measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. For public entities, ASU 2015-11 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments in this update should be applied prospectively and early application is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2015-11 to impact the Company’s consolidated results of operations and financial position.




	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “


	Leases (Topic 842)


	” (ASU 2016-02). ASU 2016-02 establishes the principles to report transparent and economically neutral information about the assets and liabilities that arise from leases. This guidance results in a more faithful representation of the rights and obligations arising from operating and capital leases by requiring lessees to recognize the lease assets and lease liabilities that arise from leases in the statement of financial position and to disclose qualitative and quantitative information about lease transactions, such as information about variable lease payments and options to renew and terminate leases. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-02 on the Company’s consolidated results of operations and financial position.

	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09


	“Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting”


	 (ASU 2016-09). ASU 2016-09 changes how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees including: (a) requiring all income tax effects of awards to be recognized in the income statement, rather than in additional paid in capital, when the awards vest or are settled, (b) eliminating the requirement that excess tax benefits be realized before companies can recognize them, (c) requiring companies to present excess tax benefits as an operating activity on the statement of cash flows rather than as a financing activity, (d) increasing the amount an employer can withhold to cover income taxes on awards and still qualify for the exception to liability classification for shares used to satisfy the employer’s statutory income tax withholding obligation, (e) requiring an employer to classify the cash paid to a tax authority when shares are withheld to satisfy its statutory income tax withholding obligation as a financing activity on its statement of cash flows and (f) electing whether to account for forfeitures of share-based payments by (1) recognizing forfeitures of awards as they occur or (2) estimating the number of awards expected to be forfeited and adjusting the estimate when it is likely to change, as is currently required. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company will adopt the new guidance on a prospective basis on January 1, 2017. The Company expects the primary impact of adoption to be the recognition of excess tax benefits and deficiencies within income taxes on continuing operations rather than within additional paid-in capital. If we had adopted the updated guidance in 2016, our income tax benefit would have decreased by


	$0.7 million


	, our effective tax rate would have decreased by a negligible amount and our diluted earnings per share attributable to Endo International plc shareholders in 2016 would not have changed. In addition, upon adoption the Company will retrospectively adopt the provision of this guidance related to changes to the statement of cash flows in any of the periods presented. The table below presents the effect on the Company’s consolidated statement of cash flows for each of the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. These amounts are not necessarily indicative of amounts that the Company will recognize in future years related to the excess income tax benefits or deficiencies nor the cash paid for withholding taxes.

	The Company expects to continue estimating forfeitures to determine the amount of compensation cost to be recognized in each period. None of the other provisions in this amended guidance are expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.




	In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15 “Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments” (ASU 2016-15). ASU 2016-15 addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing diversity in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period but all of ASU 2016-15 must be adopted in the same period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-15 on the Company’s consolidated statement of cash flows.




	In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16 “


	Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory


	” (ASU 2016-16). ASU 2016-16 states that an entity should recognize the income tax consequences when an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory occurs. ASU 2016-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted as long as it is adopted in the first interim period of a fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company completed a legal entity restructuring as part of its continuing integration of its acquired businesses that was accounted for as an intra-entity transfer of assets. As a result, the Company recorded a current deferred charge of


	$34.3 million


	 and a non-current deferred charge of


	$348.8 million


	 in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2016 within Prepaid expenses and other current assets and Other assets, respectively. The impact of adopting the accounting guidance would be the elimination of approximately


	$25 million


	 of the current deferred charge and all of the non-current deferred charge as an adjustment to retained earnings. Additionally, upon adoption, the Company would record additional net long-term deferred tax assets offset by a corresponding valuation allowance.

	In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18 “


	Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) - Restricted Cash


	” (ASU 2016-18). ASU 2016-18 states that a statement of cash flows should explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. Therefore, amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-18 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period, and all updates should be applied using a retrospective transition method. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-18 on the Company’s consolidated statement of cash flows.




	In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01


	“Business Combinations (Topic 805) - Clarifying the Definition of a Business”


	 (ASU 2017-01). ASU 2017-01 clarifies the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. The amendments in this update provide a screen to determine when an integrated set of assets and activities (collectively referred to as a “set”), is not a business. The screen requires that when substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired (or disposed of) is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets, the set is not a business. This screen reduces the number of transactions that need to be further evaluated. ASU 2017-01 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those periods. The amendments in this update should be applied prospectively on or after the effective date. Early application of the amendments in this update is allowed as follows: 1) for transactions for which the acquisition date occurs before the issuance date or effective date of the amendments, only when the transaction has not been reported in financial statements that have been issued or made available for issuance; 2) for transactions in which a subsidiary is deconsolidated or a group of assets is derecognized that occur before the issuance date or effective date of the amendments, only when the transaction has not been reported in financial statements that have been issued or made available for issuance. The Company plans to early adopt this new standard as of January 1, 2017 and expects that ASU 2017-01 will result in fewer Company transactions meeting the definition of a business.




	In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04


	“Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Accounting for Goodwill Impairment”


	 (ASU 2017-04). ASU 2017-04 simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. In computing the implied fair value of goodwill under Step 2, an entity had to perform procedures to determine the fair value at the impairment testing date of its assets and liabilities (including unrecognized assets and liabilities) following the procedure that would be required in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Instead, under ASU 2017-04, an entity should perform its annual or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Additionally, an entity should consider income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable. ASU 2017-04 is effective for annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and an entity should apply the amendments of ASU 2017-04 on a prospective basis. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. The Company plans to adopt this standard as of January 1, 2017 and will eliminate Step 2 from its goodwill tests.








	NOTE 3. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND HELD FOR SALE




	American Medical Systems




	On


	February 24, 2015


	, the Company’s Board of Directors (Board of Directors) approved a plan to sell the Company’s American Medical Systems Holdings, Inc. (AMS) business, which comprised the entirety of our former Devices segment. The AMS business was comprised of the Men’s Health and Prostate Health business as well as the Women’s Health business (referred to herein as Astora). On August 3, 2015, the Company sold the Men’s Health and Prostate Health business to Boston Scientific Corporation (Boston Scientific) for


	$1.65 billion


	, with


	$1.60 billion


	 paid upfront in cash and


	$50.0 million


	 in cash contingent on Boston Scientific achieving certain product revenue milestones in the Men’s Health and Prostate Health business in 2016. The milestones related to the


	$50.0 million


	 contingent payment were not achieved. In addition, Boston Scientific paid


	$60.0 million


	 in exchange for


	60,000


	 shares of AMS Series B Non-Voting Preferred Stock (the Series B Senior Preferred Stock) sold by our subsidiary Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. (EPI). On December 11, 2015, the Company repurchased the Series B Senior Preferred Stock from Boston Scientific Corporation for


	$61.6 million


	.








	F-18









	Table of Contents









	In addition to selling the Men’s Health and Prostate Health business in 2015, as of December 31, 2015 and continuing into 2016, the Company was actively pursuing a sale of Astora with the Company in active negotiations with multiple potential buyers. The majority of the remaining assets and liabilities of the AMS business, which were related to Astora, were classified as held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of


	December 31, 2015


	 in the Company’s Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on February 29, 2016. Certain of AMS’s assets and liabilities, primarily with respect to its product liability accrual related to vaginal mesh cases, the related QSFs and certain intangible and fixed assets, were not classified as held for sale based on management’s expectation that these assets and liabilities would remain with the Company.




	On February 24, 2016, the Board of Directors resolved to wind-down Astora as it did not align with the Company’s strategic direction and to reduce Astora’s exposure to mesh-related product liability. Astora conducted a wind-down process to transition physicians to alternative products during the first quarter of 2016. Astora ceased business operations on March 31, 2016. As a result, as of


	March 31, 2016


	 and periods thereafter, the remaining assets and liabilities of the AMS business, which were related to the Astora business, were no longer classified as held for sale in the


	Consolidated Balance Sheets


	. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Company also reclassified the Astora assets and liabilities previously presented as held for sale as of December 31, 2015 to held and used on its


	Consolidated Balance Sheets


	.




	The operating results of the AMS business are reported as


	Discontinued operations, net of tax


	 in the


	Consolidated Statements of Operations


	 for all periods presented.




	In connection with classifying AMS as held for sale during 2015, the Company was required to compare the estimated fair values of the underlying disposal groups, less the costs to sell, to the respective carrying amounts. As a result of this analysis, the Company recorded a combined asset impairment charge of


	$222.8 million


	 during the three months ended March 31, 2015, which was classified as Discontinued operations, net of tax in the


	Consolidated Statements of Operations


	. We estimated the fair value of the Men’s Health and Prostate Health division based on the agreed-upon purchase price with Boston Scientific. The fair value of Astora was estimated based on contemporaneous expressions of interest from third parties. Subsequently, at the time of the sale of the Men’s Health and Prostate Health component in August 2015, the Company recorded a gain based on the difference between the net proceeds received and the net book value of the assets sold of approximately


	$13.6 million


	, which included an adjustment of


	$25.7 million


	 relating to amounts transferred from foreign currency translation adjustments and included in the determination of net income for the period as a result of the sale, which decreased the gain. This amount is included in


	Discontinued operations, net of tax


	 in the


	Consolidated Statements of Operations


	 for the


	year ended December 31, 2015


	.




	During the three months ended September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2015, the Company compared the estimated fair value of Astora, less the costs to sell, to its respective carrying amount. As a result of these analyses, the Company recorded total additional asset impairment charges of


	$7.9 million


	 for the year ended December 31, 2015, which were classified as Discontinued operations, net of tax in the


	Consolidated Statements of Operations


	.




	In addition, as a result of determining that the sale of the AMS disposal groups was probable as of December 31, 2015, the Company re-assessed its permanent reinvestment assertion for certain components of the AMS business and recognized a corresponding tax benefit of


	$161.8 million


	 during the


	year ended December 31, 2015


	, which was recorded as Income tax benefit (a component of


	(loss) income


	 from continuing operations) in the


	Consolidated Statements of Operations


	. In addition, due to the overall differences between the book and tax basis of the underlying assets sold during the third quarter of 2015, the Company recognized a tax benefit of


	$157.4 million


	 during the


	year ended December 31, 2015


	, from Discontinued operations.




	As a result of the Astora wind-down initiative announced in the first quarter of 2016, the Company incurred asset impairment charges of


	$21.3 million


	 during the


	year ended December 31, 2016


	. See below for discussion of our material wind-down initiatives.

	Astora Restructuring




	The Astora wind-down process includes a restructuring initiative implemented during the three months ended March 31, 2016, which includes the reduction of the Astora workforce consisting of approximately


	250


	 employees. Under this restructuring initiative, separation costs are expensed over the requisite service period, if any, while retention is being expensed ratably over the respective retention period.




	As a result of the Astora restructuring initiative, the Company incurred expenses of


	$60.9 million


	 during the year ended


	December 31, 2016


	 consisting of


	employee separation and other benefit-related costs


	, asset impairment charges, contract termination charges and other general restructuring costs. There were


	no


	 restructuring expenses related to this initiative during the year ended


	December 31, 2015


	. The Company anticipates there will be


	no


	 significant additional pre-tax restructuring expenses related to


	employee separation and other benefit-related costs


	, contract termination charges and other restructuring costs. The majority of these actions were completed as of September 30, 2016 and substantially all cash payments will be made by June 30, 2017. These restructuring costs are included in Discontinued operations in the


	Consolidated Statements of Operations


	.

	NOTE 4. RESTRUCTURING




	U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals


	 Restructuring




	2015 U.S Generic Pharmaceuticals Restructuring




	In connection with the acquisition of Par Pharmaceutical Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries (together herein Par) on


	September 25, 2015


	, we implemented cost-rationalization and integration initiatives to capture operating synergies and generate cost savings across the Company. These measures included realigning the Company’s


	U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals


	 segment sales, sales support, management activities and staffing, which resulted in separation benefits to certain


	U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals


	 employees. The cost reduction initiatives included a reduction in headcount of approximately


	6%


	 of the


	U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals


	 workforces. Under this restructuring initiative (the 2015


	U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals


	 restructuring initiative), separation costs are expensed over the requisite service period, if any, while retention is expensed ratably over the respective retention period.




	As a result of the 2015


	U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals


	 restructuring initiative, the Company incurred restructuring expenses of


	$5.0 million


	 and


	$23.6 million


	 during the


	years


	 ended


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	, respectively, consisting of


	employee separation and other benefit-related costs


	. The Company does not anticipate any further restructuring expenses related to


	employee separation and other benefit-related costs


	. These actions were completed by October 31, 2016. In addition, the Company anticipates there will be additional restructuring expenses of approximately


	$2.5 million


	 related to accelerated depreciation on certain assets. These restructuring costs are allocated to the


	U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals


	 segment, and are primarily included in


	Selling, general and administrative


	 expenses in the


	Consolidated Statements of Operations


	.




	The liability related to the 2015


	U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals


	 restructuring initiative totaled


	$3.3 million


	 and


	$17.9 million


	 at


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	, respectively. At


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	, this liability is included in


	Accounts payable and accrued expenses

	2016 U.S Generic Pharmaceuticals Restructuring






	As part of the ongoing


	U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals


	 integration efforts, in May 2016 we announced a restructuring initiative to optimize our product portfolio and rationalize our manufacturing sites to expand product margins (the 2016


	U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals


	 restructuring initiative). These measures include certain cost savings initiatives, including a reduction in headcount and the disposal of our Charlotte, North Carolina manufacturing facility (the Charlotte facility). On October 31, 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell the Charlotte facility for proceeds of


	$14 million


	. The Company recorded an impairment charge of


	$6.9 million


	 during the fourth quarter of 2016 related to fixed assets associated with the sale. The transaction closed in January 2017 and the assets and liabilities of the Charlotte facility were classified as held for sale in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of


	December 31, 2016


	.




	As a result of the 2016


	U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals


	 restructuring initiative, the Company has incurred total restructuring expenses of


	$173.9 million


	 through


	December 31, 2016


	 and expects to incur additional restructuring-related expenses of approximately


	$1.0 million


	 consisting of accelerated depreciation,


	employee separation and other benefit-related costs


	 and certain other charges. The Company anticipates these actions will be completed by September 2017, with substantially all cash payments made by the end of 2017. Under this restructuring initiative, separation costs are expensed ratably over the requisite service period, as applicable.




	Restructuring charges of


	$173.9 million


	 recorded during the year ended


	December 31, 2016


	, consisted of certain intangible asset impairment charges of


	$107.2 million


	, charges to increase excess inventory reserves of


	$33.3 million


	, charges relating to


	employee separation and other benefit-related costs


	 of


	$17.0 million


	, accelerated depreciation of


	$10.2 million


	 and other charges of


	$6.2 million


	. These charges are included in the


	U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals


	 segment and are included in Asset impairment charges, Cost of revenues, and

	 expenses in the

	2016 U.S. Branded Pharmaceutical Restructuring




	In December 2016, the Company announced that it was terminating its worldwide license and development agreement with BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc. (BDSI) for BELBUCA™ and returning the product to BDSI. This transaction closed on January 6, 2017. As a result of this announcement and a comprehensive assessment of its product portfolio, the Company restructured its U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals segment sales organization during the fourth quarter of 2016 (the 2016 U.S. Branded restructuring initiative). This restructuring was comprised of certain cost savings initiatives, including the elimination of an approximate


	375


	-member U.S. Branded pain field sales force and the termination of certain contracts. The Company’s legacy pain portfolio products will be managed as mature brands going forward.




	As a result of the 2016 U.S. Branded restructuring initiative, the Company incurred total pre-tax charges of approximately


	$61.5 million


	 during the fourth quarter of 2016. These charges consisted of a non-cash intangible asset impairment charge of approximately


	$36.8 million


	, employee separation and other benefit-related costs of


	$16.5 million


	, early contract termination fees of


	$5.2 million


	, and


	$3.0 million


	 of inventory write-offs. These actions were completed by


	December 31, 2016


	 and substantially all of the cash payments are anticipated to be made by the end of 2017. These charges are included in the U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals segment and are included in Asset impairment charges, Cost of revenues, and


	Selling, general and administrative


	 expenses in the


	Consolidated Statements of Operations


	. The Company does not anticipate there will be additional material pre-tax restructuring expenses related to this initiative.




	The liability related to the 2016 U.S. Branded Pharmaceutical restructuring initiative totaled


	$21.8 million


	 at

	Auxilium Restructuring




	In connection with the acquisition of Auxilium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (subsequently converted to Auxilium Pharmaceuticals LLC hereafter referred to as Auxilium) on


	January 29, 2015


	, the Company implemented cost-rationalization and integration initiatives to capture operating synergies and generate cost savings across the Company (the Auxilium restructuring initiative). These measures included realigning our sales, sales support, management activities and staffing, which included separation benefits to former Auxilium employees, in addition to the closing of duplicative facilities. The cost reduction initiatives included a reduction in headcount of approximately


	40%


	 of the former Auxilium workforce. For former Auxilium employees that agreed to continue employment with the Company for a merger transition period, the separation costs payable upon completion of their retention period were expensed over their respective retention period.








	F-23









	Table of Contents









	As a result of the Auxilium restructuring initiative, the Company incurred restructuring expenses of


	$41.9 million


	 during the year ended December 31, 2015, consisting of


	$26.7 million


	 of employee severance and other benefit-related costs. The expenses were also attributable to certain charges related to our Auxilium subsidiary’s former corporate headquarters in Chesterbrook, Pennsylvania, including


	$7.0 million


	 of asset impairment charges on certain related leasehold improvements during the first quarter of 2015, and


	$7.9 million


	 recorded upon the facility’s cease use date, representing the liability for our remaining obligations under the respective lease agreement, net of estimated sublease income, during the first quarter of 2015. These restructuring costs are included in the


	U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals


	 segment, and are primarily included in


	Selling, general and administrative


	 costs and expenses in the


	Consolidated Statements of Operations


	. There were no expenses associated with this restructuring for the year ended December 31, 2016 and the Company does not anticipate any additional pre-tax restructuring expenses.

	January 2017 Restructuring




	On January 26, 2017, the Company announced a restructuring initiative implemented as part of its ongoing organizational review (the January 2017 restructuring initiative). This restructuring is intended to further integrate, streamline and optimize the Company’s operations by aligning certain corporate and R&D functions with its recently restructured U.S. Generics Pharmaceutical and U.S. Branded Pharmaceutical business units in order to create efficiencies and cost savings.




	As part of this restructuring, the Company will undertake certain cost reduction initiatives, including a reduction of approximately


	90


	 positions of its workforce, primarily related to corporate and U.S. Branded Pharmaceutical R&D functions in Malvern, PA and Chestnut Ridge, NY, a streamlining of general and administrative expenses, an optimization of commercial spend and a refocusing of research and development efforts. The Company expects to incur cash charges of approximately


	$15 million


	 to


	$20 million


	 of employee separation and other benefit-related costs in connection with the January 2017 restructuring initiative. Substantially all of these cash payments are anticipated to be made by the end of 2017 and the Company anticipates that substantially all of the actions associated with this restructuring will be completed by the end of April 2017. Under this restructuring, separation costs are expensed over the requisite service period, if any, while retention costs are expensed ratably over the respective retention period. There were 


	no


	 expenses recorded for the year ended December 31, 2016 related to the January 2017 restructuring initiative.

	The fair values of the developed technology and IPR&D assets were estimated using a discounted present value income approach. Under this method, an intangible asset’s fair value is equal to the present value of the incremental after-tax cash flows (excess earnings) attributable solely to the intangible asset over its remaining useful life. To calculate fair value, the Company used cash flows discounted at rates ranging from


	9%


	 to


	10.5%


	, which were considered appropriate given the inherent risks associated with each type of asset. The Company believes that the level and timing of cash flows appropriately reflect market participant assumptions.




	The goodwill recognized is attributable primarily to strategic and synergistic opportunities related to existing pharmaceutical businesses, the assembled workforce of Par and other factors. At the acquisition date, approximately


	$34.2 million


	 of goodwill was expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.




	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are related primarily to the difference between the book basis and tax basis of identifiable intangible assets and inventory step-up.

	®



	 Gel and to launch an authorized generic of Voltaren



	®



	 Gel effective July 1, 2016. Pursuant to the


	2015 Voltaren

	 Gel Agreement


	, the former 2008 Voltaren



	®



	 Gel Agreement expired on June 30, 2016 in accordance with its terms.




	The Company is accounting for this transaction as a business combination as of the effective date in accordance with the relevant accounting literature. The Company acquired the product for consideration of approximately


	$162.7 million


	, consisting of an upfront payment of


	$16.2 million


	 and contingent cash consideration with an acquisition-date fair value of approximately


	$146 million


	, including the impact of a measurement period adjustment recorded during the fourth quarter of 2016. See


	Note 7. Fair Value Measurements


	 for further discussion of this contingent consideration. See


	Note 11. License and Collaboration Agreements


	 for further discussion of the License and Supply Agreement.




	The preliminary fair values of the net identifiable assets acquired totaled approximately

	NOTE 6. SEGMENT RESULTS




	The reportable business segments in which the Company operates are: (1) 


	U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals


	, (2)


	U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals


	 and (3)


	International Pharmaceuticals


	. These segments reflect the level at which the chief operating decision maker regularly reviews financial information to assess performance and to make decisions about resources to be allocated. Each segment derives revenue from the sales or licensing of its respective products and is discussed in more detail below.








	F-29









	Table of Contents









	We evaluate segment performance based on each segment’s


	adjusted income from continuing operations before income tax


	, which we define as


	loss from continuing operations before income tax


	 before


	certain upfront and milestone payments to partners; acquisition-related and integration items, including transaction costs, earn-out payments or adjustments, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration and bridge financing costs; cost reduction and integration-related initiatives such as separation benefits, retention payments, other exit costs and certain costs associated with integrating an acquired company’s operations; excess costs that will be eliminated pursuant to integration plans; asset impairment charges; amortization of intangible assets; inventory step-up recorded as part of our acquisitions; certain non-cash interest expense; litigation-related and other contingent matters and gains or losses from early termination of debt; foreign currency gains or losses on intercompany financing arrangements; and certain other items


	.




	Certain of the corporate general and administrative expenses incurred by the Company are not attributable to any specific segment. Accordingly, these costs are not allocated to any of the Company’s segments and are included in the results below as “Corporate unallocated.” The Company’s consolidated adjusted income from continuing operations before income tax is equal to the combined results of each of its segments less these unallocated corporate costs.

	NOTE 7. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS




	Financial Instruments




	The financial instruments recorded in our


	Consolidated Balance Sheets


	 include cash and cash equivalents (including money market funds and time deposits), restricted cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, marketable securities, equity and cost method investments, accounts payable and accrued expenses, acquisition-related contingent consideration and debt obligations. Included in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents are money market funds representing a type of mutual fund required by law to invest in low-risk securities (for example, U.S. government bonds, U.S. Treasury Bills and commercial paper). Money market funds pay dividends that generally reflect short-term interest rates. Due to their short-term maturity, the carrying amounts of non-restricted and restricted cash and cash equivalents (including money market funds and time deposits), accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair values.




	Fair value guidance establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include:













	•






	Level 1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
















	•






	Level 2—Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
















	•






	Level 3—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.







	Marketable Securities




	Equity securities consist of investments in the stock of publicly traded companies, the values of which are based on quoted market prices and thus represent Level 1 measurements within the above-defined fair value hierarchy. These securities are not held to support current operations and are therefore classified as non-current assets. Equity securities are included in


	Marketable securities


	 in our


	Consolidated Balance Sheets


	 at


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	.




	At the time of purchase, we classify our marketable securities as either available-for-sale securities or trading securities, depending on our intent at that time. Available-for-sale and trading securities are carried at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses recorded within other comprehensive income or net income, respectively. The Company reviews unrealized losses associated with available-for-sale securities to determine the classification as a “temporary” or “other-than-temporary” impairment. A temporary impairment results in an unrealized loss being recorded in other comprehensive income. An impairment that is viewed as other-than-temporary is recognized in net income. The Company considers various factors in determining the classification, including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than the Company’s cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer or investee, and the Company’s ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.








	F-32









	Table of Contents









	Loans Receivable






	We did not have any loans receivable as of December 31, 2016. Our loans receivable at December 31, 2015 related primarily to loans totaling


	$14.1 million


	 to our joint venture investment owned through our Litha subsidiary. The joint venture investment is further described below. The majority of this amount was secured by certain of the assets of our joint venture. The fair values of these loans were based on anticipated cash flows, which approximated the carrying amount, and were classified in Level 2 measurements in the fair value hierarchy. The Company classified these loans receivable as Assets held for sale as of


	December 31, 2015


	 in its


	Consolidated Balance Sheets


	.




	Equity and Cost Method Investments




	As of


	December 31, 2016


	, the Company has investments that it accounts for using the equity or cost method of accounting totaling


	$9.1 million


	. The Company divested a joint venture investment owned through its Litha subsidiary during the three months ended March 31, 2016. The Company classified this joint venture investment as Assets held for sale as of


	December 31, 2015


	 in its


	Consolidated Balance Sheets


	.




	During the three months ended June 30, 2015, the Company recognized an other-than-temporary impairment of its Litha joint venture investment totaling


	$18.9 million


	, reflecting the excess carrying value of this investment over its estimated fair value. To estimate the fair value of this joint venture investment, the Company relied primarily on a market approach based on the terms of the announced divestiture of that investment.




	With respect to its other equity or cost method investments, which are included in Other Assets in the Company’s


	Consolidated Balance Sheets


	 at


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	, the Company did


	no


	t recognize any other-than-temporary impairments. The Company considered various factors, including the operating results of its equity method investments and the lack of an unrealized loss position on its cost method investments.




	Acquisition-Related Contingent Consideration




	The fair value of contingent consideration liabilities is determined using unobservable inputs; hence these instruments represent Level 3 measurements within the above-defined fair value hierarchy. These inputs include the estimated amount and timing of projected cash flows, the probability of success (achievement of the contingent event) and the risk-adjusted discount rate used to present value the probability-weighted cash flows. Subsequent to the acquisition date, at each reporting period, the contingent consideration liability is remeasured at current fair value with changes recorded in earnings. See Recurring Fair Value Measurements below for additional information on acquisition-related contingent consideration.




	Recurring Fair Value Measurements




	The Company’s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	 were as follows (in thousands):

	(1) The components of inventory shown in the table above are net of allowance for obsolescence.




	Inventory that is in excess of the amount expected to be sold within one year, which relates primarily to XIAFLEX



	®



	 inventory, is classified as long-term inventory and is not included in the table above. At


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	,


	$22.9 million


	 and


	$24.9 million


	, respectively, of long-term inventory was included in Other assets in the


	Consolidated Balance Sheets


	.




	The Company capitalizes inventory costs associated with certain generic products prior to regulatory approval and product launch, when it is reasonably certain, based on management’s judgment of future commercial use and net realizable value, that the pre-launch inventories will be saleable. The determination to capitalize is made once the Company (or its third party development partners) has filed an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) that has been acknowledged by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as containing sufficient information to allow the FDA to conduct its review in an efficient and timely manner and management is reasonably certain that all regulatory and legal requirements will be cleared. This determination is based on the particular facts and circumstances relating to the expected FDA approval of the generic drug product being considered, and accordingly, the time frame within which the determination is made varies from product to product. The Company could be required to write down previously capitalized costs related to pre-launch inventories upon a change in such judgment, or due to a denial or delay of approval by regulatory bodies, or a delay in commercialization, or other potential factors. As of


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	, the Company had approximately


	$16.8 million


	 and


	$12.0 million


	, respectively, in inventories related to generic products that were not yet available to be sold.

	Endo tests goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. Our annual assessment is performed as of October 1st.




	As part of the annual and interim goodwill and intangible asset impairment assessments, the Company estimates the fair values of its reporting units using an income approach that utilizes a discounted cash flow model, or, where appropriate, a market approach, or a combination thereof. The discounted cash flow models are dependent upon the Company’s estimates of future cash flows and other factors. These estimates of future cash flows involve assumptions concerning (i) future operating performance, including future sales, long-term growth rates, operating margins, variations in the amount and timing of cash flows and the probability of achieving the estimated cash flows and (ii) future economic conditions. These assumptions are based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represent Level 3 measurements within the fair value hierarchy. The discount rates applied to the estimated cash flows for the Company’s October 1,


	2016


	,


	2015


	 and


	2014


	 annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment test ranged from


	8.5%


	 to


	11.0%


	, from


	9.0%


	 to


	16.0%


	 and from


	8.5%


	 to


	15.5%


	, respectively, depending on the overall risk associated with the particular assets and other market factors. The Company believes the discount rates and other inputs and assumptions are consistent with those that a market participant would use. Any impairment charges resulting from the annual and interim goodwill and intangible asset impairment assessments are recorded to Asset impairments charges on the Company’s


	Consolidated Statements of Operations


	.




	Goodwill




	Results of 2016 Goodwill Impairment Testing




	As part of its annual goodwill impairment test, the Company concluded that the carrying value of its U.S. Generics, Paladin, Somar and Litha reporting units exceeded their respective estimated fair values and recorded goodwill impairment charges of


	$2,342.5 million


	,


	$272.6 million


	,


	$33.0 million


	 and


	$26.3 million


	, respectively. The impairments were a result of a combination of factors, including increased buying power from the continued consolidation of the Company’s generic business customer base, a significant change in the value derived from the level and frequency of anticipated pricing opportunities in the future and increased levels of competition, particularly in the Company’s U.S. Generics reporting unit, due to the entry of new low cost competitors and accelerated FDA ANDA approvals. Consequently, the Company lowered its projected revenue growth rates and profitability levels as part of its fourth quarter company-wide strategic forecasting process.








	F-40









	Table of Contents









	These external dynamics were exacerbated by an increase in the risk factor included in the discount rate used to calculate the U.S. Generics discounted cash flows from the date of the Company’s last interim test. The increase in the discount rate was due to the implied control premium resulting from recent trading values of the Company’s stock. On a combined basis, these factors reduced the resulting estimated fair value of the Company’s reporting units.




	As of


	December 31, 2016


	, the remaining balance of goodwill for the Company’s U.S. Generics, U.S. Branded, Paladin, Somar and Litha reporting units was


	$3,531.3 million


	,


	$1,009.2 million


	,


	$166.4 million


	,


	$22.5 million


	 and


	zero


	, respectively.




	Results of 2015 Goodwill Impairment Testing




	Given the results of our intangible asset assessment during the third quarter of 2015 for STENDRA



	®



	and certain testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) products, the Company initiated an interim goodwill impairment analysis of our Urology, Endocrinology and Oncology (UEO) reporting unit as of September 30, 2015. As a result of this interim analysis, the Company determined that the net book value of our UEO reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value. The Company prepared this analysis on a preliminary basis to estimate the amount of a provisional impairment charge as of September 30, 2015, and determined that an impairment was probable and reasonably estimable. The preliminary fair value assessments were performed by the Company taking into consideration a number of factors, based upon the latest available information, including the preliminary results of a hypothetical purchase price allocation. As a result of the preliminary analysis, during the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded a provisional pre-tax, non-cash impairment charge of 


	$680.0 million


	 in the 


	Consolidated Statements of Operations


	, representing the difference between the estimated implied fair value of the UEO reporting unit’s goodwill and its respective net book value.




	The Company completed its UEO goodwill impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of 2015 and reduced the provisional pre-tax, non-cash impairment charge by


	$6.5 million


	, for a net, pre-tax, non-cash impairment charge during the year ended


	December 31, 2015


	 of


	$673.5 million


	. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company combined certain resources within the Branded business and management realigned how they review the segment’s performance. As a result, we determined that our Pain and UEO reporting units should be combined into one Branded reporting unit for purposes of testing goodwill as of October 1, 2015. In addition to testing the Pain and UEO reporting units separately for goodwill impairment as of October 1, 2015, the Company also tested the combined Branded reporting unit for impairment. The impairment tests did not result in any additional charge for the quarter ended


	December 31, 2015


	. As of


	December 31, 2015


	, the remaining balance of goodwill for the Branded reporting unit was approximately


	$1,002.8 million


	.




	As part of the annual goodwill impairment test, the Company recorded a pre-tax, non-cash impairment charge of 


	$85.8 million


	 in the 


	Consolidated Statements of Operations


	 during the fourth quarter of 2015, representing the difference between the estimated implied fair value of the Paladin reporting unit’s goodwill and its respective net book value, primarily due to the loss of exclusivity on certain products sold in Canada. As of


	December 31, 2015


	, the remaining balance of goodwill for the Paladin reporting unit was approximately


	$420.4 million


	.




	Intangible Assets




	A summary of significant other intangible asset impairment charges by reportable segment for the three years ended


	December 31, 2016


	 is included below.




	U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals Segment




	During the three months ended March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the Company identified certain market and regulatory conditions impacting the commercial potential of certain indefinite and definite-lived intangible assets in our


	U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals


	 segment. Accordingly, we tested these assets for impairment and determined that the carrying value of certain of these assets was no longer fully recoverable, resulting in pre-tax, non-cash asset impairment charges of


	$29.3 million


	 and


	$40.0 million


	 during the first and second quarters of 2016, respectively. In addition, during the first quarter of 2016, the Company recognized pre-tax, non-cash asset impairment charges of


	$100.3 million


	 related to the 2016


	U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals


	 restructuring initiative, which resulted from the discontinuation of certain commercial products and the abandonment of certain IPR&D projects. See


	Note 4. Restructuring


	 for discussion of our material restructuring initiatives. During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company recognized pre-tax, non-cash intangible asset impairment charges of


	$507.2 million


	 in our


	U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals


	 resulting from certain market conditions, including price erosion and increased competition, impacting the commercial potential of definite and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including higher than expected erosion rates in the


	U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals


	 base business.




	During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company identified certain market and regulatory conditions impacting the commercial potential of certain indefinite and definite-lived intangible assets in our


	U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals


	 segment. Accordingly, we tested these assets for impairment and determined that the carrying value of certain of these assets was no longer fully recoverable, resulting in pre-tax, non-cash asset impairment charges of 


	$70.2 million


	,


	$72.4 million


	 and


	$38.4 million


	, respectively, during the second, third and fourth quarters of 2015.

	Table of Contents









	U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals Segment




	As a result of unfavorable formulary changes and generic competition for sumatriptan, the Company has experienced a downturn in the performance of its Sumavel



	®



	 DosePro



	®



	 (Sumavel



	®



	) product, a needle-free delivery system for sumatriptan acquired from Zogenix, Inc. in 2014. As a result of this underperformance, the Company concluded during the third quarter of 2016 that an impairment assessment was required to evaluate the recoverability of Sumavel



	®



	. After performing this assessment, we recorded a pre-tax, non-cash impairment charge of


	$72.8 million


	 during the three months ended September 30, 2016, representing a full impairment of the intangible asset. During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company recognized pre-tax, non-cash intangible asset impairment charges of


	$37.6 million


	 in our


	U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals


	 segment resulting primarily from the termination of our BELBUCA



	TM



	 product and the return of this product to BDSI.




	During the year ended December 31, 2015, a sustained downturn in the short-acting TRT market caused underperformance across several of our TRT products, including Testim



	®



	 and Natesto™. In addition, we also experienced underperformance with respect to STENDRA



	®



	. As a result of this underperformance and a re-alignment of investment priorities towards higher growth and higher value assets such as XIAFLEX



	®



	, the Company concluded during the third quarter of 2015 that an impairment assessment was required to evaluate the recoverability of certain definite-lived intangible assets associated with these products. After performing this assessment, we recorded a pre-tax, non-cash impairment charge of approximately


	$152.0 million


	 during the third quarter of 2015, representing a full impairment of our Natesto™ intangible asset and a partial impairment of our Testim



	®



	 and STENDRA



	®



	 intangible assets. As a result of the Company providing written notice to VIVUS Inc. on December 30, 2015 that we were terminating the STENDRA



	®



	 License Agreement effective June 30, 2016, we recorded an additional pre-tax, non-cash impairment charge of approximately


	$9.5 million


	, representing the remaining carrying amount of our STENDRA



	®



	 intangible asset. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2015, we determined that the fair value of certain U.S. Branded Pharmaceuticals IPR&D assets were less than their respective carrying amounts, and we recorded a pre-tax, non-cash impairment charge of


	$5.5 million


	 representing the full carrying amount of the assets.




	As part of the 2014 year-end financial close and reporting process, the Company concluded that an impairment assessment was required to evaluate the recoverability of a definite-lived license intangible asset related to OPANA



	®



	 ER. After performing these assessments, we recorded a pre-tax, non-cash impairment charge of


	$12.3 million


	, representing the remaining carrying amount of this asset.




	International Pharmaceuticals Segment




	During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company determined that it would not pursue commercialization of a product in certain international markets. Accordingly, we tested the definite-lived intangible asset associated with this product for impairment and determined that the carrying value was no longer fully recoverable, resulting in pre-tax, non-cash asset impairment charge of


	$16.2 million


	 during the third quarter of 2016. During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company recognized pre-tax, non-cash intangible asset impairment charges of


	$285.5 million


	 in our


	International Pharmaceuticals


	 segment resulting from certain market conditions impacting the commercial potential of definite and indefinite-lived intangible assets.




	As part of our definite-lived intangible asset impairment review processes for 2015, the Company recorded pre-tax, non-cash impairment charges of approximately


	$14.6 million


	 in our


	International Pharmaceuticals


	 segment, representing the difference between the carrying amount of certain intangible assets and their estimated fair value.

	 Gel Agreement


	, the former 2008 Voltaren

	Under the 2008 Voltaren



	®



	 Gel Agreement, which was effective through June 30, 2016, the Company agreed (i) to make certain guaranteed minimum annual royalty payments beginning in the fourth year of the 2008 Voltaren

	®



	 Gel Agreement terminated as of the date of the launch of the generic equivalent product by Amneal. In addition, the Company’s obligation to make the 2015 Guaranteed Minimum Annual Royalty Payment also terminated.




	Strakan International Limited




	In August 2009, we entered into a License and Supply Agreement with Strakan International Limited, a subsidiary of ProStrakan Group plc. (ProStrakan), which was subsequently acquired by Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co. Ltd., for the exclusive right to commercialize Fortesta



	®



	 Gel in the U.S. (the ProStrakan Agreement). Fortesta



	®



	 Gel is a patented 2% testosterone transdermal gel for testosterone replacement therapy in male hypogonadism. A metered dose delivery system permits accurate dose adjustment to increase the ability to individualize patient treatment.




	The Company received FDA approval for Fortesta



	®



	 Gel in December 2010, which triggered a one-time approval milestone to ProStrakan for


	$12.5 million


	. The approval milestone was recorded as an intangible asset and is being amortized into Cost of revenues on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life. An additional milestone payment of


	$5.0 million


	 was triggered during the fourth quarter of 2015 pursuant to the terms of the ProStrakan Agreement. The milestone was recorded as an intangible asset and is being amortized into Cost of revenue. ProStrakan could potentially receive up to approximately


	$150.0 million


	 in additional payments linked to the achievement of future commercial milestones related to Fortesta



	®



	 Gel.




	ProStrakan will exclusively supply Fortesta



	®



	Gel to Endo at a supply price based on a percentage of annual net sales subject to a minimum floor price as defined in the ProStrakan Agreement. Endo may terminate the ProStrakan Agreement upon


	six months


	 prior written notice at no cost to the Company.




	Grünenthal GmbH




	In December 2007, we entered into a License, Development and Supply Agreement (the Grünenthal Agreement) with Grünenthal for the exclusive clinical development and commercialization rights in Canada and the U.S. for an oral formulation of OPANA



	®



	 ER, with INTAC



	®



	 technology. In December 2011, the FDA approved a formulation of OPANA



	®



	 ER with INTAC



	®



	 technology, which is called OPANA



	®



	 ER.




	In the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company capitalized a one-time approval milestone to Grünenthal for


	$4.9 million


	. We are amortizing this intangible asset into Cost of revenues over its estimated useful life. In the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company recorded an additional


	$10.4 million


	 as Cost of Revenues related to a commercial milestone. Additional amounts of approximately


	€53.9 million


	 (approximately


	$56.7 million


	 at


	December 31, 2016


	) may become due upon achievement of additional future predetermined regulatory and commercial milestones. Endo will also make payments to Grünenthal based on net sales of any such product or products commercialized under this agreement, including the formulation of OPANA



	®



	 ER approved by the FDA in December 2011.

	Effective December 19, 2012, the Company and Grünenthal amended the Grünenthal Agreement whereby the Company became responsible for planning of packaging of finished product and certain other routine packaging quality obligations and Grünenthal agreed to reimburse the Company for the third-party costs incurred related to packaging as well as pay the Company a periodic packaging fee. The amendment also changed certain of the terms with respect to the floor price required to be paid by the Company in consideration for product supplied by Grünenthal. On February 18, 2014, the Company and Grünenthal amended the Grünenthal Agreement to define the responsibilities of the parties for certain additional clinical work to be performed for OPANA

	BioSpecifics Technologies Corp.




	The Company, through an affiliate, is party to a development and license agreement, as amended (the BioSpecifics Agreement) with BioSpecifics Technologies Corp. (BioSpecifics). The BioSpecifics Agreement was originally entered into in June 2004 to obtain exclusive worldwide rights to develop, market and sell certain products containing BioSpecifics’ enzyme, which we refer to as XIAFLEX



	®



	. The Company’s licensed rights concern the development and commercialization of products, other than dermal formulations labeled for topical administration, and currently, the Company’s licensed rights cover the indications of Dupuytren’s Contracture (DC), Dupuytren’s Nodules, Peyronie’s Disease (PD), Adhesive Capsulitis, cellulite, canine lipomas, Plantar Fibromatosis and Lateral Hip Fat. Auxilium may further expand the BioSpecifics Agreement, at its option, to cover other indications as they are developed by the Company or BioSpecifics.




	Under the BioSpecifics Agreement, we are responsible, at our own cost and expense, for developing the formulation and finished dosage form of products and arranging for the clinical supply of products. BioSpecifics is currently conducting exploratory clinical trials evaluating XIAFLEX



	®



	 as a treatment for a number of conditions, including lipomas in humans and uterine fibroids. The Company has the option to license development and marketing rights to these indications based on a full analysis of the data from the clinical trials, which would transfer responsibility for the future development costs to the Company and trigger opt-in payments and potential future milestone and royalty payments to BioSpecifics.




	The BioSpecifics Agreement extends, on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis, for the longer of the patent life, the expiration of any regulatory exclusivity period or twelve years from the effective date. Either party may terminate the BioSpecifics Agreement as a result of the other party’s breach or bankruptcy. We may terminate the BioSpecifics Agreement with 90 days’ written notice.




	We must pay BioSpecifics on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis a specified percentage within a range of


	5%


	 to


	15%


	 of net sales for products covered by the BioSpecifics Agreement. This royalty applies to net sales by the Company or its sublicensees, including Asahi Kasei Pharma Corporation (Asahi Kasei) and Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB (Sobi). We are also obligated to pay a percentage of any future regulatory or commercial milestone payments received from such sublicensees. In addition, the Company and its affiliates pay BioSpecifics an amount equal to a specified mark-up on certain cost of goods related to supply of XIAFLEX



	®



	 (which mark-up is capped at a specified percentage within the range of


	5%


	 to


	15%


	 of the cost of goods of XIAFLEX



	®



	) for products sold by the Company and its affiliates.




	XIAFLEX



	®



	 Out-license Agreements




	We are party to certain out-licensing agreements with Asahi Kasei and Sobi (the XIAFLEX



	®



	 Sublicensees), pursuant to which the XIAFLEX



	®



	 Sublicensees have marketing, development and/or commercial rights for XIAFLEX



	®



	 and XIAPEX



	®



	 (the European Union trade name for XIAFLEX



	®



	) in a variety of countries outside of the U.S. The applicable royalty percentages related to these agreements increase from tier to tier upon the achievement of a specified threshold of aggregate annual net sales of the licensed product and may decrease if a generic is marketed in the applicable territory. Pursuant to each of these out-licensing agreements, the Company will be responsible for all clinical and commercial drug manufacturing and supply and, in certain cases, for development costs.




	The Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare approved XIAFLEX



	®



	 for manufacturing and marketing in Japan on July 3, 2015 for the indication of Dupuytren's Contracture with a palpable cord and was subsequently listed on the Japanese National Health Insurance drug price standard on August 31, 2015. The Company’s partner, Asahi Kasei Pharma Corporation, commercially launched the product in Japan in September 2015. Under the terms of the Asahi Kasei agreement, Endo received a


	$20.0 million


	 gross milestone payment in October 2015 as a result of the first commercial sale of XIAFLEX



	®



	 in Japan. The Company is recognizing the


	$20.0 million


	 of milestone revenue on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the license agreement.




	We were party to an out-licensing agreement with Actelion Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (Actelion) to develop, supply and commercialize XIAFLEX



	®



	 in Canada and Australia. On July 1, 2016, the parties mutually agreed to terminate the collaboration for Canada and agreed upon certain transition services to be provided by Actelion until approval of the transfer of the drug identification number by the regulatory authority in Canada to the Company. For Australia, the collaboration agreement remained in effect until a new agreement was finalized. In consideration for the rights returned to the Company by Actelion, Endo made a cash payment of


	$5.5 million


	 in July 2016 to terminate the agreement and the transaction was treated as an asset acquisition. For Australia, we entered into a new out-licensing agreement with Actelion Pharmaceuticals Australia PTY in December 2016, pursuant to which Actelion obtained marketing and commercial rights for XIAFLEX



	®



	 in Australia and New Zealand.

	BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc.




	The Company was party to a worldwide license and development agreement with BDSI for the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize BELBUCA™ (buprenorphine HCl) Buccal Film. The NDA for BELBUCA™ was submitted in December 2014 and accepted by the FDA in February 2015. On October 23, 2015, the FDA approved BELBUCA™ for the management of severe pain and BELBUCA™ became commercially available in the U.S. during February 2016. As a result of the FDA approval of BELBUCA™, the Company capitalized a one-time approval milestone payment to BioDelivery for


	$44.0 million


	 in the fourth quarter of 2015.




	In December 2016, Endo announced that it was returning BELBUCA



	TM



	to BDSI and this transaction closed on January 6, 2017. As a result of this announcement, the Company incurred restructuring and impairment charges during the fourth quarter of 2016 (Refer to

	The fair value of the Company’s long-term debt is estimated using the quoted market prices for the same or similar debt issuances. Based on this valuation methodology, we determined these debt instruments represent Level 2 measurements within the fair value hierarchy.




	Pursuant to the terms of the credit agreements and indentures governing our various debt instruments, certain subsidiaries of Endo International plc, known as restricted subsidiaries, are subject to various restrictions limiting their ability to transfer funds to Endo International plc. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, net assets of our restricted subsidiaries comprised more than


	95%


	 of the Company’s consolidated total net assets, after intercompany eliminations.




	Credit Facility




	Upon closing of the Paladin acquisition on February 28, 2014, certain subsidiaries of the Company entered into a credit agreement (the 2014 Credit Agreement) with Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, as administrative agent, collateral agent, issuing bank and swingline lender and certain other lenders, which provided for a


	five


	-year senior secured term loan A facility in an aggregate principal amount of


	$1.1 billion


	 (the 2014 Term Loan A Facility), a


	seven


	-year senior secured term loan B facility in an aggregate principal amount of


	$425.0 million


	 (the 2014 Term Loan B Facility), and a


	five


	-year revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of


	$750.0 million


	 (the 2014 Revolving Credit Facility). The 2014 Credit Agreement was entered into to refinance certain of our existing indebtedness, including our prior credit facility, and for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions.




	In June 2015, certain subsidiaries of the Company entered into Amendment No. 1 to Credit Agreement (Amendment No. 1), with Deutsche Bank and certain other lenders, pursuant to which we amended the 2014 Credit Agreement to, among other things, (i) permit the acquisition by Endo Designated Activity Company, formerly known as Endo Limited (Endo DAC) or its affiliates of Par and (ii) permit an incremental revolving facility in an aggregate principal amount of


	$250.0 million


	 (the Incremental Revolving Facility), and


	one


	 or more incremental term B loan facilities in an aggregate principal amount up to


	$5.0 billion


	, in each case, in connection with the Par acquisition. Loans incurred under the 2014 Term Loan A Facility, the 2014 Term Loan B Facility and the Incremental Term Loan B Facility (as defined below) are recorded net of the unamortized portion of the original purchaser’s discount. This discount is amortized to interest expense over the term of the Amended Credit Agreement (as defined below).




	Simultaneously with the closing of the Par acquisition, on September 25, 2015, we entered into the Incremental Amendment to Credit Agreement, with Deutsche Bank and certain other lenders (the Incremental Amendment), pursuant to which we (i) increased our revolving capacity to


	$1.0 billion


	 pursuant to the Incremental Revolving Facility (ii) incurred an incremental term loan B facility (the Incremental Term Loan B Facility) in an aggregate principal amount of


	$2.8 billion


	 (together with the Incremental Revolving Facility, the Par Incremental Facilities) and (iii) repaid in full the amount outstanding under the 2014 Term Loan B Facility. We refer to the 2014 Credit Agreement, as amended by Amendment No. 1 and the Incremental Amendment, and as further amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified, as the Amended Credit Agreement.




	Borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and our Term Loan A facility bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). In addition, borrowings under our Term Loan B facility bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus LIBOR, subject to a LIBOR floor of


	0.75%


	.




	We have


	$997.4 million


	 of remaining credit available through the revolving credit facilities as of


	December 31, 2016


	.




	In January 2017, certain subsidiaries of the Company entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Credit Agreement (Amendment No. 2), with Deutsche Bank and certain other lenders, pursuant to which we amended the 2014 Credit Agreement to clarify certain definitions of Excess Cash Flow and Excess Cash Payment Date.




	In addition to the Incremental Revolving Facility and the Incremental Term Loan B Facility, the Amended Credit Agreement also permits us to obtain (i) incremental revolving and/or term loan commitments of


	$1.0 billion


	 plus (ii) an unlimited amount of incremental revolving and/or term loan commitments if the Secured Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement), at the time of incurrence of such incremental commitments and after giving effect thereto on a pro forma basis, is less than or equal to


	3.00 to 1.00


	 (assuming for purposes of such calculation that any incremental revolving commitments incurred at the time of such calculation are fully drawn and without netting cash proceeds of any incremental facilities or, in lieu of loans under any incremental facilities, pari passu or junior secured or unsecured notes or junior secured term loans) from one or more of the existing lenders (or their affiliates) or other lenders (with the consent of the administrative agent) and, subject to compliance by the borrowers with the documentation and other requirements under the Amended Credit Agreement, without the need for consent from any of the existing lenders under the Amended Credit Agreement (other than those existing lenders that have agreed to provide such incremental facilities).




	The Amended Credit Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants that the Company believes to be usual and customary for a senior secured credit facility. The negative covenants include, among other things, limitations on capital expenditures, asset sales, mergers and acquisitions, indebtedness, liens, dividends, investments and transactions with the Company’s affiliates. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, we were in compliance with all such covenants. In addition, on an annual basis commencing with the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company is required to perform a calculation of excess cash flow (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement), which may result in an accelerated payment of the principal amount. The excess cash flow calculation for the year ended December 31, 2016 did not result in an excess payment.

	NOTE 14. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES




	Manufacturing, Supply and Other Service Agreements




	Our subsidiaries contract with various third party manufacturers, suppliers and service providers to provide raw materials used in our subsidiaries’ products and semi-finished and finished goods, as well as certain packaging, labeling services, customer service support, warehouse and distribution services. These contracts include agreements with Novartis, Teikoku, Noramco, Grünenthal and JHS, among others. If, for any reason, we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of any of the finished goods or raw materials or components required for our products or services needed to conduct our business, it could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.




	In addition to the manufacturing and supply agreements described above, we have agreements with various companies for clinical development services. Although we have no reason to believe that the parties to these agreements will not meet their obligations, failure by any of these third parties to honor their contractual obligations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

	 Gel Agreements.




	Teikoku Seiyaku Co., Ltd.




	Under the terms of the Company's agreement (the Teikoku Agreement) with Teikoku, a Japanese manufacturer, Teikoku manufactures Lidoderm



	®



	 at its


	two


	 Japanese facilities, located on adjacent properties, for commercial sale by the Company in the U.S. The Company also has an option to extend the supply area to other territories. The Company amended the Teikoku Agreement on April 24, 2007, January 6, 2010, November 1, 2010 and February 25, 2015 (together, the Amended Agreement). The material components of the Amended Agreement are as follows:













	•






	The Company agreed to issue firm purchase orders for a minimum number of patches per year through 2017, representing the noncancelable portion of the Amended Agreement. There is a lower minimum purchase requirement in effect subsequent to 2017. The Company has met its minimum purchase requirement for 2016.
















	•






	Teikoku agreed to fix the supply price of Lidoderm



	®



	 for a period of time after which the price will be adjusted at future certain dates based on a price index defined in the Amended Agreement.
















	•






	Following cessation of the Company’s obligation to pay royalties to Hind Healthcare Inc. (Hind) under the Sole and Exclusive License Agreement dated as of November 23, 1998, as amended, between Hind and the Company (the Hind Agreement), the Company began to pay to Teikoku annual royalties based on annual net sales of Lidoderm



	®



	.
















	•






	The Amended Agreement will not expire until December 31, 2021, unless terminated in accordance with its terms. After December 31, 2021, the Amended Agreement shall be automatically renewed on the first day of January each year unless terminated in accordance with its terms.
















	•






	Either party may terminate the Amended Agreement, following a


	45


	-day cure period, in the event that the Company fails to issue firm purchase orders for the annual minimum quantity for each year after 2017.
















	•






	The Company is the exclusive licensee for any authorized generic for Lidoderm



	®



	until the later of August 15, 2017 or the date of the first commercial sale of the second non-Teikoku generic version of Lidoderm



	®



	.







	Amounts purchased pursuant to the Teikoku Agreement, as amended, were


	$37.5 million


	,


	$48.3 million


	 and


	$45.1 million

	On November 23, 2011, the Company’s obligation to pay royalties to Hind under the Hind Agreement ceased. Accordingly, on November 23, 2011, pursuant to the terms of the Teikoku Agreement, the Company began to incur royalties to Teikoku based on annual net sales of Lidoderm



	®



	. The royalty rate is


	6%


	 of branded Lidoderm



	®



	 net sales. Additionally, in May 2014, we launched an authorized generic lidocaine patch 5% (referred to as Lidoderm



	®



	 authorized generic) and began to incur royalties on net sales of the authorized generic. During the years ended


	December 31, 2016


	,


	2015


	 and


	2014


	, we recorded


	$16.5 million


	,


	$17.8 million

	Noramco, Inc.




	Under the terms of our agreement (the Noramco Agreement) with Noramco, Noramco manufactures and supplies to us certain narcotic active drug substances, in bulk form, for inclusion in our controlled substance pharmaceutical products. There are no minimum annual purchase commitments under the Noramco Agreement; however, we are required to purchase from Noramco a fixed percentage of our annual requirements of each narcotic active drug substance covered by the Noramco Agreement. The purchase price for these substances is equal to a fixed amount, adjusted on an annual basis based on volume. In July 2016, the Company sent a notice of non-renewal to Noramco which will result in the agreement being terminated as of April 2017. The Company is not subject to any penalties as a result of this termination.




	Pursuant to the terms of the Noramco Agreement, the Company made payments to Noramco during the


	years


	 ended


	December 31, 2016


	,


	2015


	 and

	Grünenthal GmbH




	Pursuant to the terms of the Company’s December 2007 License, Development and Supply Agreement with Grünenthal (the Grünenthal Agreement), Grünenthal agreed to manufacture and supply to the Company a formulation of OPANA



	®



	 ER with INTAC



	®



	 technology based on a supply price equal to a certain percentage of net sales of OPANA



	®



	 ER, subject to a floor price. In the first quarter of 2012, we began production of the formulation of OPANA



	®



	 ER with INTAC



	®



	 technology at a third party manufacturing facility managed by Grünenthal. The Grünenthal Agreement will expire on the later of (i) the 15th anniversary of the date of first commercial sale of the product, (ii) the expiration of the last issued patent in the territory claiming or covering products or (iii) the expiration of exclusivity granted by the FDA for the last product developed under the Grünenthal Agreement. Either party may terminate the Grünenthal Agreement in certain circumstances upon providing sufficient written notice to the other party. Effective December 19, 2012, the Company and Grünenthal amended the Grünenthal Agreement whereby the Company became responsible for the planning of packaging of finished product and certain other routine packaging quality obligations and Grünenthal agreed to reimburse the Company for the third-party costs incurred related to packaging as well as pay the Company a periodic packaging fee. The amendment also changed certain of the terms with respect to the floor price required to be paid by the Company in consideration for product supplied by Grünenthal. On February 18, 2014, the Company and Grünenthal amended the Grünenthal Agreement to define the responsibilities of the parties for certain additional clinical work to be performed for OPANA



	®



	 ER.




	The Company’s supply payments made to Grünenthal pursuant to the Grünenthal Agreement are recorded in Cost of revenues in our


	Consolidated Statements of Operations

	Legal Proceedings and Investigations




	We and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in various claims, legal proceedings, internal and governmental investigations (collectively, proceedings) that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business, including, among others, those relating to product liability, intellectual property, regulatory compliance and commercial matters. While we cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings and we intend to defend vigorously our position, an adverse outcome in any of these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our current and future financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Matters that are not being disclosed herein are, in the opinion of our management, immaterial both individually and in the aggregate with respect to our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. If and when such matters, in the opinion of our management, become material either individually or in the aggregate, we will disclose such matters.




	As of


	December 31, 2016


	, our reserve for loss contingencies totaled


	$1,015.9 million


	, of which


	$963.1 million


	 relates to our product liability accrual for vaginal mesh cases. Although we believe there is a reasonable possibility that a loss in excess of the amount recognized exists, we are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss in excess of the amount recognized at this time.




	Product Liability




	We and certain of our subsidiaries have been named as defendants in numerous lawsuits in various U.S. federal and state courts, as well as in Canada and other countries, alleging personal injury resulting from the use of certain products of our subsidiaries. These matters are described below in more detail.




	We believe that certain settlements and judgments, as well as legal defense costs, relating to certain product liability matters are or may be covered in whole or in part under our product liability insurance policies with a number of insurance carriers. In certain circumstances, insurance carriers reserve their rights to contest or deny coverage. We intend to contest vigorously any and all such disputes with our insurance carriers and to enforce our rights under the terms of our insurance policies. Accordingly, we will record receivables with respect to amounts due under these policies only when the resolution of any dispute has been reached and realization of the potential claim for recovery is considered probable. Amounts recovered under our product liability insurance policies will likely be less than the stated coverage limits and may not be adequate to cover damages and/or costs relating to claims. In addition, there is no guarantee that insurers will pay claims or that coverage will otherwise be available.




	Vaginal Mesh Cases.


	In October 2008, the FDA issued a Public Health Notification (October 2008 Public Health Notification) regarding potential complications associated with transvaginal placement of surgical mesh to treat pelvic organ prolapse (POP) and stress urinary incontinence (SUI). The notification provided recommendations and encouraged physicians to seek specialized training in mesh procedures, to advise their patients about the risks associated with these procedures and to be diligent in diagnosing and reporting complications.




	In July 2011, the FDA issued an update to the October 2008 Public Health Notification regarding mesh to further advise the public and the medical community of the potential complications associated with transvaginal placement of surgical mesh to treat POP and SUI. In the July 2011 update, the FDA stated that adverse events are not rare. Furthermore, the FDA questioned the relative effectiveness of transvaginal mesh as a treatment for POP as compared to non-mesh surgical repair. The July 2011 notification continued to encourage physicians to seek specialized training in mesh procedures, to consider and to advise their patients about the risks associated with these procedures and to be diligent in diagnosing and reporting complications. In January 2016, the FDA issued a statement reclassifying surgical mesh for transvaginal POP repair from Class II to Class III. Surgical mesh for SUI repair remains a Class II device.




	In January 2012, the FDA ordered manufacturers of transvaginal surgical mesh used for POP and of single incision mini-slings for urinary incontinence, such as our AMS subsidiary, to conduct post-market safety studies and to monitor adverse event rates relating to the use of these products. The FDA agreed to place


	16


	 AMS study orders on hold for a variety of reasons. AMS commenced


	three


	 of these post-market study orders. However, due to the wind-down of the Astora business in 2016, AMS notified the FDA of its termination of these studies and the FDA has confirmed closure of those studies.




	Since 2008, we and certain of our subsidiaries, including AMS and/or Astora, have been named as defendants in multiple lawsuits in the U.S. in various state and federal courts, including a multidistrict litigation (MDL) in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia (MDL No. 2325), in Canada, where various class action and individual complaints are pending, and in other countries alleging personal injury resulting from the use of transvaginal surgical mesh products designed to treat POP and SUI. Plaintiffs in these suits allege various personal injuries including chronic pain, incontinence and inability to control bowel function and permanent deformities, and seek compensatory and punitive damages, where available.








	F-49









	Table of Contents









	We and certain plaintiffs’ counsel representing mesh-related product liability claimants have entered into various Master Settlement Agreements (MSAs) and other settlement agreements regarding settling up to approximately


	49,000


	 filed and unfiled mesh claims handled or controlled by the participating counsel for an aggregate total of approximately


	$2.8 billion


	. These MSAs, which were executed at various times since June 2013, were entered into solely by way of compromise and settlement and are not in any way an admission of liability or fault by us or any of our subsidiaries. All MSAs are subject to a process that includes guidelines and procedures for administering the settlements and the release of funds. In certain cases, the MSAs provide for the creation of QSFs into which funds may be deposited pursuant to certain schedules set forth in those agreements. All MSAs have participation thresholds regarding the claims represented by each law firm party to the MSA. If certain participation thresholds are not met, then we will have the right to terminate the settlement with that law firm. In addition, one agreement gives us a unilateral right of approval regarding which claims may be eligible to participate under that settlement. To the extent fewer claims than are authorized under an agreement participate, the total settlement payment under that agreement will be reduced by an agreed-upon amount for each such non-participating claim. Funds deposited in QSFs are included in restricted cash and cash equivalents in the


	Consolidated Balance Sheets


	.




	Distribution of funds to any individual claimant is conditioned upon the receipt of documentation substantiating the validity of the claim, a full release and a dismissal of the entire action or claim as to all AMS parties and affiliates. Prior to receiving funds, an individual claimant is required to represent and warrant that liens, assignment rights or other claims identified in the claims administration process have been or will be satisfied by the individual claimant. Confidentiality provisions apply to the amount of settlement awards to participating claimants, the claims evaluation process and procedures used in conjunction with award distributions, and the negotiations leading to the settlements.




	We expect that valid claims under the MSAs will continue to be settled. However, we intend to vigorously contest pending and future claims that are invalid, for which settlement is unable to be reached or that are in excess of the maximum claim amounts under the applicable MSAs. In addition to claims covered by MSAs, we are currently aware of approximately


	9,700


	 claims that have been filed, asserted or that we believe are likely to be asserted that have not been accrued for because we lack sufficient information to determine whether any potential loss is probable. In addition, there may be other claims asserted in the future. It is currently not possible to estimate the number or validity of any such future claims.




	In order to evaluate whether a claim is probable of a loss, we must obtain and evaluate certain information pertaining to each individual claim, including but not limited to the following items: the name and social security number of the plaintiff, evidence of an AMS implant, the date of implant, the date the claim was first asserted to AMS and medical records establishing the injury alleged. Without access to and review of at least this information and the opportunity to evaluate it, we are not in a position to determine a claim’s validity or whether a loss is probable. Further, the timing and extent to which we obtain this information and our evaluation thereof, is often impacted by items outside of our control, including, without limitation, the normal cadence of the litigation process and the provision of claim information to us by plaintiff’s counsel.




	We will continue to monitor the situation, and, if appropriate, we will make further adjustments to our product liability accrual based on new information. We intend to continue exploring all options as appropriate in our best interests, and depending on developments, there is a possibility that we will suffer adverse decisions or verdicts of substantial amounts, or that we will enter into additional monetary settlements. Any unfavorable outcomes as a result of such litigation or settlements with respect to any asserted or unasserted claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.




	As of the date of this report, we believe that the current product liability accrual includes all known claims for which liability is probable.

	We expect to fund the payments under all current settlement agreements over the course of 2017. As the funds are disbursed out of the QSFs from time to time, the product liability accrual will be reduced accordingly with a corresponding reduction to restricted cash and cash equivalents. In addition, we may pay cash distributions to settle disputes separate from the QSFs, which will also decrease the product liability accrual and decrease cash and cash equivalents.




	We were contacted in October 2012 regarding a civil investigation initiated by a number of state attorneys general into mesh products, including transvaginal surgical mesh products designed to treat POP and SUI. In November 2013, we received a subpoena relating to this investigation from the state of California, and we have subsequently received additional subpoenas from other states. We are currently cooperating with this investigation. At this time, we cannot predict or determine the outcome of this investigation or reasonably estimate the amount or range of amounts of fines or penalties, if any, that might result from a settlement or an adverse outcome from this investigation.




	Testosterone Cases.


	We and certain of our subsidiaries, including Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. (EPI) and Auxilium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (subsequently converted to Auxilium Pharmaceuticals, LLC and hereinafter referred to as Auxilium), along with other pharmaceutical manufacturers, have been named as defendants in lawsuits alleging personal injury resulting from the use of prescription medications containing testosterone, including Fortesta



	®



	 Gel, Delatestryl



	®



	, Testim



	®



	, TESTOPEL



	®



	, Aveed



	®



	 and Striant



	®



	. Plaintiffs in these suits allege various personal injuries, including pulmonary embolism, stroke and other vascular and/or cardiac injuries and seek compensatory and/or punitive damages, where available. In June 2014, an MDL was formed to include claims involving all testosterone replacement therapies filed against EPI, Auxilium, and other manufacturers of such products, and certain transferable cases pending in federal court were coordinated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois as part of MDL No. 2545. In addition, litigation has also been filed against EPI in the Court of Common Pleas for Philadelphia County and in certain other state courts. Litigation similar to that described above may also be brought by other plaintiffs in various jurisdictions, and we expect cases brought in federal court to be transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois as tag-along actions to MDL No. 2545. However, we cannot predict the timing or outcome of any such litigation, or whether any such additional litigation will be brought against us. We intend to contest the litigation vigorously and to explore all options as appropriate in our best interests. As of


	February 21, 2017


	, approximately


	1,200


	 cases are currently pending against us; some of which may have been filed on behalf of multiple plaintiffs. The first MDL trial against Auxilium involving Testim



	®



	is set to begin in November 2017, the first trial against Auxilium in the Court of Common Pleas for Philadelphia County involving Testim



	®



	 is set to begin in January 2018; and the first MDL trial against EPI involving Fortesta



	®



	is set to begin in September 2018.




	In November 2015, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois entered an order granting defendants’ motion to dismiss claims involving certain testosterone products that were approved pursuant to ANDAs, including TESTOPEL



	®



	. Plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration and clarification of this order. In March 2016, the District Court granted plaintiffs’ motion in part and entered an order permitting certain claims to go forward to the extent they are based on allegations of fraudulent off-label marketing.




	In November 2014, a civil class action complaint was filed in the U.S. District for the Northern District of Illinois against EPI, Auxilium, and various other manufacturers of testosterone products on behalf of a proposed class of health insurance companies and other third party payors that had paid for certain testosterone products, alleging that the marketing efforts of EPI, Auxilium, and other defendant manufacturers with respect to certain testosterone products constituted racketeering activity in violation of 18 U.S.C. §1962(c), and other civil Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act claims. Further, the complaint alleged that EPI, Auxilium, and other defendant manufacturers violated various state consumer protection laws through their marketing of certain testosterone products and raised other state law claims. In March 2015, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint and plaintiffs responded by filing amended complaints, which defendants also moved to dismiss. In February 2016, the District Court granted in part and denied in part defendants’ motion to dismiss. The District Court declined to dismiss plaintiffs’ claims for conspiracy to commit racketeering activity in violation of 18 U.S.C. §1962(d) and claims for negligent misrepresentation. In April 2016, plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint, which defendants moved to dismiss in June 2016. In August 2016, the court denied the motion to dismiss and we filed a response to the third amended complaint in September 2016. In October 2015, a similar civil class action complaint was filed against EPI and other defendant manufacturers in the U.S. District for the Northern District of Illinois. Similar litigation may be brought by other plaintiffs.

	Unapproved Drug Litigation




	In September 2013, the State of Louisiana filed a petition for damages against certain of our subsidiaries, EPI and Generics Bidco I, LLC, and over


	50


	 other pharmaceutical companies alleging the defendants or their subsidiaries marketed products that were not approved by the FDA. See


	State of Louisiana v. Abbott Laboratories, Inc., et al


	., C624522 (19th Jud. Dist. La.). The State of Louisiana sought damages, fines, penalties, attorneys’ fees and costs under various causes of action. In October 2015, the District Court ordered judgment for defendants on their exception for no right of action. The State of Louisiana appealed that decision and in October 2016, the Louisiana Court of Appeals, First Circuit, issued a decision affirming the dismissal as to certain counts and reversing the dismissal as to others. The State filed a petition for rehearing, which was denied by the court in December 2016. Both sides have applied to Louisiana Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari to review the First Circuit’s decision.

	Opioid-Related Litigations, Subpoenas and Document Requests




	In June 2014, Corporation Counsel for the City of Chicago filed suit in Illinois state court against multiple defendants, including our subsidiaries, Endo Health Solutions Inc. (EHSI) and EPI, for alleged violations of city ordinances and other laws relating to defendants’ alleged opioid sales and marketing practices. In June 2014, the case was removed to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. In December 2014, defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint and in May 2015, the District Court issued an order granting that motion in part, dismissing the case as to EHS and EPI. In August 2015, plaintiff filed its second amended complaint against multiple defendants, including EPI and EHSI. In November 2015, defendants moved to dismiss the second amended complaint. In September 2016, the District Court granted in part and denied in part defendants’ motions to dismiss and provided plaintiff an opportunity to amend its complaint. Plaintiff filed the third amended complaint in October 2016. In December 2016, defendants moved to dismiss the re-pled claims in the third amended complaint, and filed their answers as to the claims not previously dismissed by the Court.




	In May 2014, a lawsuit was filed in California Superior Court (Orange County) in the name of the People of the State of California, acting by and through County Counsel for Santa Clara County and the Orange County District Attorney, against multiple defendants, including our subsidiaries EHSI and EPI (with EPI being added as part of the first amended complaint in June 2014). The complaint asserts violations of California’s statutory Unfair Competition and False Advertising laws, as well as asserting a claim for public nuisance, based on alleged misrepresentations in connection with sales and marketing of opioids, including OPANA



	®



	. Plaintiff seeks declaratory relief, restitution, civil penalties (including treble damages), abatement, an injunction, and attorneys’ fees and costs. Defendants, which include our subsidiaries, filed various motions attacking the pleadings, including one requesting that the Superior Court refrain from proceeding under the doctrines of primary jurisdiction and equitable abstention. That motion was granted in August 2015, and the case was stayed pending further proceedings and findings by the FDA. In June 2016, plaintiffs filed a motion to lift the stay and to amend the complaint. Defendants, including EHSI and EPI, opposed that motion. Following a hearing in July 2016, the court provided plaintiffs an opportunity to seek leave to file another amended complaint. In August 2016, plaintiffs filed a renewed motion to lift the stay and amend the complaint. In October 2016, the court granted, in part, plaintiffs’ renewed motion to lift the stay and the plaintiffs filed their third amended complaint. Defendants’ response to the third amended complaint is not due at this time.




	In December 2015, a lawsuit was filed in the Chancery Court of the First Judicial District of Hinds County, Mississippi by the State of Mississippi against multiple defendants, including our subsidiaries EHSI and EPI. The complaint alleges violations of Mississippi’s Consumer Protection Act and various other claims arising out of defendants’ alleged opioid sales and marketing practices. Plaintiff seeks declaratory relief, restitution, civil penalties, abatement, an injunction, and attorneys’ fees and costs. In March 2016, defendants moved to dismiss the complaint and to transfer the case from Hinds County to Rankin County. The motion to transfer was denied in February 2017. The motion to dismiss remains pending.

	®



	 ER. We were cooperating with the State of New Hampshire Office of the Attorney General in its investigation until we learned it was being assisted by outside counsel hired on a contingent fee basis. The New Hampshire Attorney General initiated an action in the Superior Court for the State of New Hampshire to enforce the subpoena despite this contingent fee arrangement, and we (along with other companies that had received similar subpoenas) responded by filing a motion for protective order to preclude the use of contingent fee counsel. In addition, we filed a separate motion seeking declaratory relief. In March 2016, the Superior Court granted the motion for protective order on the grounds that the contingent fee agreement was invalid as


	ultra vires


	 and that the office of the Attorney General had acted outside of its statutory authority in entering into the agreement with the contingent fee counsel. In April 2016, both the New Hampshire Attorney General and the companies that received subpoenas from the New Hampshire Attorney General, including EHSI and EPI, appealed, in part, the March 2016 Superior Court order to the New Hampshire Supreme Court. Those appeals are pending. In April 2016, the New Hampshire Attorney General also entered into a new agreement with outside counsel. In response, the companies that received a subpoena from the New Hampshire Attorney General, including EHSI and EPI, moved to enforce a part of the protective order issued by the Superior Court in March 2016 that is not being appealed by EHSI and EPI. That motion was denied in August 2016.

The County of Suffolk is seeking compensatory damages, interest, costs, disbursements, punitive damages, treble damages, penalties and attorneys’ fees. Defendants, including our subsidiaries, filed motions to dismiss and to stay in January 2017. In February 2017, Broome County, New York, and Erie County, New York, filed similar suits in New York state court.

	Antitrust Litigation and Investigations




	Multiple direct and indirect purchasers of Lidoderm



	®



	 have filed a number of cases against our subsidiary EPI and co-defendants Teikoku Seiyaku Co., Ltd., Teikoku Pharma USA, Inc. (collectively, Teikoku) and Actavis plc and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, Actavis), which was subsequently acquired by Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd and its subsidiaries (collectively, Teva) from Allergan plc (Allergan). Certain of these actions have been asserted on behalf of classes of direct and indirect purchasers, while others are individual cases brought by one or more alleged direct or indirect purchasers. The complaints in these cases generally allege that EPI, Teikoku and Actavis entered into an anticompetitive conspiracy to restrain trade through the settlement of patent infringement litigation concerning U.S. Patent No. 5,827,529 (the ‘529 patent) and other patents. Some of the complaints also allege that Teikoku wrongfully listed the ‘529 patent in the Orange Book as related to Lidoderm



	®



	,






	that EPI and Teikoku commenced sham patent litigation against Actavis and that EPI abused the FDA citizen petition process by filing a citizen petition and amendments solely to interfere with generic companies’ efforts to obtain FDA approval of their versions of Lidoderm



	®



	. The cases allege violations of Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act (15 U.S.C. §§ 1, 2) and various state antitrust and consumer protection statutes as well as common law remedies in some states. These cases generally seek damages, treble damages, disgorgement of profits, restitution, injunctive relief and attorneys’ fees.




	The U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1407, issued an order in April 2014 transferring these cases as


	In Re Lidoderm Antitrust Litigation


	, MDL No. 2521, to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The court granted plaintiffs’ motions for class certification filed on behalf of classes of direct and indirect purchasers in February 2017. Trial is currently scheduled to begin in late 2017. Litigation similar to that described above may also be brought by other plaintiffs in various jurisdictions, and we expect any such cases brought in federal court to be transferred to the Northern District of California as tag-along actions to

(Impax), all of which have been transferred and coordinated for pretrial proceedings in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation. Some of these cases have been filed on behalf of putative classes of direct and indirect purchasers, while others have been filed on behalf of individual retailers or health care benefit plans. These cases generally allege that the agreement reached by EPI and Impax to settle patent infringement litigation concerning multiple patents pertaining to OPANA

	 ER and EPI’s introduction of the re-formulation of OPANA

The complaints allege violations of Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act (15 U.S.C. §§ 1, 2), various state antitrust and consumer protection statutes, as well as state common law. These cases generally seek damages, treble damages, disgorgement of profits, restitution, injunctive relief and attorneys’ fees. In February 2016, the District Court issued orders (i) denying defendants’ motion to dismiss the claims of the direct purchasers, (ii) denying in part and granting in part defendants’ motion to dismiss the claims of the indirect purchasers, but giving them permission to file amended complaints and (iii) granting defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaints filed by certain retailers, but giving them permission to file amended complaints. In response to the District Court’s orders, the indirect purchasers filed an amended complaint to which the defendants filed a renewed motion to dismiss certain claims, and certain retailers also filed amended complaints. The defendants successfully moved to dismiss the indirect purchaser unjust enrichment claims arising under the laws of the states of California, Rhode Island and Illinois. We cannot predict whether or not additional cases similar to those described above will be filed by other plaintiffs or the timing or outcome of any such litigation.

Concurrently with the filing of the FTC’s complaint, Teikoku entered into a consent judgment with the FTC and was dismissed from the case.

	 ER-related claims also sought a declaration that the FTC’s claims are time-barred. In December 2016, the FTC filed a motion to dismiss the declaratory judgment actions for failure to state a claim. In January 2017, the FTC re-filed claims against us, our subsidiary EPI, and other defendants in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California and also filed a joint motion for entry of a Stipulated Order dismissing the claims against us and EPI. The Stipulated Order involves no monetary payment to the FTC and no admission of liability. Under the Stipulated Order, we agreed to dismiss our claims in the declaratory judgment actions, and also agreed to certain covenants relating to the future settlement of patent infringement litigation for a period of


	10


	 years. These covenants, which are consistent with Endo’s current practices in settling patent infringement cases, include a prohibition on agreements that prevent the marketing of authorized generic products or that involve certain payments to generics manufacturers in connection with a later market entry date for their products. The FTC agreed that the prior dismissal of its claims against us in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania will be treated as being with prejudice, that it will bring no other claims against us arising from the Opana

The FTC complaint sought a finding that Par’s settlement agreement violates Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, and a permanent injunction against Par’s ability to engage in certain types of patent settlements in the future. Beginning in February 2009, certain private plaintiffs, including distributors and retailers, filed similar litigation. Generally, the remaining private plaintiff suits seek equitable relief, unspecified damages and costs.

	False Claims Act Litigation




	The Attorneys General of Florida, Indiana and Virginia and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (the USOPM) have issued subpoenas, and the Attorneys General of Michigan, Tennessee, Texas, and Utah have issued CIDs, to our subsidiary, Par, among other companies. The demands generally request documents and information pertaining to allegations that certain of Par’s sales and marketing practices caused pharmacies to substitute ranitidine capsules for ranitidine tablets, fluoxetine tablets for fluoxetine capsules, and two 7.5 mg buspirone tablets for one 15 mg buspirone tablet, under circumstances in which some state Medicaid programs at various times reimbursed the new dosage form at a higher rate than the dosage form being substituted. Par has provided documents in response to these subpoenas to the respective Attorneys General and the USOPM. The aforementioned subpoenas and CIDs culminated in the federal and state law qui tam action brought on behalf of the U.S. and several states by Bernard Lisitza. The complaint was unsealed in August 2011. Lisitza’s corrected second amended complaint generally seeks (i) a finding that defendants violated and be enjoined from future violations of the federal False Claims Act and state false claims acts; (ii) treble damages and maximum civil penalties for each violation of the federal False Claims Act and state false claims acts; (iii) an applicable percentage share of the proceeds; and (iv) expenses, fees, and costs. The U.S. intervened in this action and filed a separate complaint in September 2011, alleging claims for violations of the Federal False Claims Act and common law fraud. The U.S.’s second corrected complaint generally seeks (i) treble damages and civil penalties for violations under the federal False Claims Act and (ii) compensatory and punitive damages for common law fraud. The states of Michigan and Indiana have also intervened as to claims arising under their respective state false claim acts, common law fraud, and unjust enrichment. Michigan’s complaint generally seeks (i) treble damages and civil penalties and (ii) common law compensatory and punitive damages. Indiana’s amended complaint generally seeks treble damages, costs, and attorney’s fees. We intend to vigorously defend this lawsuit. At this time, we are unable to predict the outcome of this matter or the ultimate legal and financial liability, if any, and at this time cannot reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss for this matter, if any.

	 (megestrol acetate oral suspension) Cases




	In September 2011, our subsidiary, Par Pharmaceutical, Inc. (PPI), along with EDT Pharma Holdings Ltd. (Elan) (now known as Alkermes Pharma Ireland Limited), filed a complaint against TWi Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (TWi) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland alleging infringement of U.S. Patent No. 7,101,576 because TWi filed an ANDA with a Paragraph IV certification seeking FDA approval of a generic version of Megace



	®



	 ES. A bench trial was held in October 2013, and in February 2014, the District Court issued a decision in favor of TWi, finding all asserted claims of the 7,101,576 patent invalid for obviousness. Par appealed. In August 2014, the District Court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining TWi’s launch of its generic product pending disposition of the appeal. In December 2014, the Federal Circuit reversed the District Court’s decision, remanding for further findings of fact. In March 2015, the District Court issued another preliminary injunction enjoining TWi’s launch of its generic product pending disposition of the case on remand. In July 2015, the District Court issued a new decision in favor of TWi, finding all of the asserted claims invalid, and TWi launched its generic product. PPI appealed again, and in December 2015, the District Court’s decision in favor of TWi was affirmed without opinion. In February 2016, TWi moved the District Court to recover its lost profits, which TWi alleged in the amount of


	$16 million


	, resulting from the previous injunctions to which the District Court subjected TWi, as well as attorneys’ fees and costs. PPI opposed TWi’s motion. In September 2016, the District Court denied TWi’s motion for attorneys’ fees and costs and granted in part and denied in part TWi’s motion to recover its lost profits, ordering PPI to pay


	$12.7 million


	. On November 21, 2016, PPI paid the judgment and bill of costs to TWi in the amount of


	$12.8 million


	 (including interest), and a Notice of Satisfaction was filed with the Court on November 28, 2016 terminating the case.




	Securities Related Class Action Litigation




	In May 2016, a putative class action entitled


	Craig Friedman v. Endo International plc, Rajiv Kanishka Liyanaarchie de Silva and Suketu P. Upadhyay


	was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York by an individual shareholder on behalf of himself and all similarly situated shareholders. In August 2016, the Steamfitters’ Industry Pension Fund and Steamfitters’ Industry Security Benefit Fund were appointed lead plaintiffs in the action. In October 2016, a second amended complaint was filed, which added Paul Campanelli as a defendant, and we filed a motion to dismiss the case. In response, and without resolving the motion, the Court permitted lead plaintiffs to file a third amended complaint. The lawsuit alleges violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the Company’s revision of its 2016 earnings guidance and certain disclosures about its generics business, the integration of Par and its subsidiaries, certain other alleged business issues and the receipt of a CID from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York regarding contracts with Pharmacy Benefit Managers concerning Frova



	®



	. Lead plaintiffs seek class certification, damages in an unspecified amount and attorneys’ fees and costs. We filed a motion to dismiss the third amended complaint in December 2016. We are unable to predict the outcome of this matter or the ultimate legal and financial liability, if any, and at this time cannot reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, for this matter, but will explore all options as appropriate in our best interests and we intend to defend this lawsuit vigorously.




	In November 2016, a putative class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York by an individual shareholder on behalf of herself and all similarly situated shareholders, bearing the caption


	Doris Shasha v. Endo International plc Company, Rajiv Kanishka Liyanaarchchie De Silva and Suketu P. Upadhyay


	. The lawsuit alleged violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act. It alleged that certain of the Company's public disclosures from September 28, 2015 through November 2, 2016 contained misstatements or omissions, based on news reports of an investigation by the Department of Justice into potential price collusion in the pharmaceutical industry. In November 2016, the plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the case without prejudice.

	In late 2012,

	®



	 ER: Roxane Laboratories, Inc. (Roxane) and Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited, which was acquired by Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (Ranbaxy). Those suits allege infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 7,851,482, 8,309,122, and 8,329,216. In July 2013, Actavis and Roxane were granted FDA approval to market all strengths of their respective non-INTAC

	 ER. A trial in this case was held from March 2015 through April 2015 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. In August 2015, the District Court ruled that all defendants infringed the claims of U.S. Patent Nos. 8,309,122 and 8,329,216. The District Court also ruled that the defendants failed to show that U.S. Patent Nos. 8,309,122 and 8,329,216 were invalid, enjoined the defendants from launching their generic products until the expiration of those patents and directed Actavis to withdraw its generic product within


	60 days


	. In October 2015, the District Court tolled the


	60


	-day period until it decided


	two


	 pending post-trial motions. In April 2016, the District Court issued an order upholding its August 2015 ruling in EPI’s favor and confirming the prior injunction against the manufacture or sale of the generic version of the non-INTAC

	 technology OPANA

	 ER, a highly pure version of the active pharmaceutical ingredient and the release profile of OPANA

	 ER. EPI filed lawsuits against each of these filers in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Each lawsuit was filed within the


	45


	-day deadline to invoke a


	30


	-month stay of FDA approval pursuant to the Hatch-Waxman legislative scheme. A trial in this case was held from March 2015 through April 2015 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against the remaining filers. In August 2015, the District Court issued an Opinion holding that all defendants infringed the claims of U.S. Patent Nos. 8,309,060, 8,309,122 and 8,329,216. The Opinion also held that the defendants had shown that U.S. Patent No. 8,309,060 was invalid, but that the defendants had failed to show that U.S. Patent Nos. 8,309,122 and 8,329,216 were invalid. The District Court also issued an Order enjoining the defendants from launching their generic products until the expiration of U.S. Patent Nos. 8,309,122 and 8,329,216. The defendants filed appeals to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. We intend to continue to vigorously assert our intellectual property and oppose appeals by the defendants. However, there can be no assurance that we and/or Grünenthal will be successful. If we are unsuccessful and Teva, Amneal, ThoRx, Actavis or Impax is able to obtain FDA approval of its product, generic versions of OPANA

	In August 2014 and October 2014, the U.S. Patent Office issued U.S. Patent Nos. 8,808,737 and 8,871,779 respectively, which cover a method of using OPANA

	 technology and non-INTAC

	 ER. Those lawsuits were filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging infringement of these new patents, which expire in 2027 and 2029, respectively. On November 17, 2015, the District Court held the ‘737 patent invalid for claiming unpatentable subject matter. That patent has been dismissed from all suits and the suits administratively closed as to that patent, subject to appeal at the end of the case on the ‘779 patent. Beginning July 11, 2016, a three-day trial was held in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against Teva and Amneal for infringement of the ‘779 patent. In October 2016, the District Court issued an Opinion holding that the defendants infringed the claims of U.S. Patent No. 8,871,779. The Opinion also held that the defendants had failed to show that U.S. Patent No. 8,871,779 was invalid. The District Court issued an Order enjoining the defendants from launching their generic products until the expiration of U.S. Patent No. 8,871,779 in November 2029. A trial for infringement of the ‘799 patent by Actavis was held in February 2017 in the same court (U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware) in front of the same judge.

	Paragraph IV Certification on Fortesta

	 Gel




	In January 2013, EPI and its licensor Strakan Limited received a notice from Watson advising of the filing by Watson of an ANDA for a generic version of Fortesta



	®



	 (testosterone) Gel. In February 2013, EPI filed a lawsuit against Watson in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Marshall division. Because the suit was filed within the


	45


	-day period under the Hatch-Waxman Act for filing a patent infringement action, we believe that it triggered an automatic


	30


	-month stay of approval under the Act. A two-day trial was held on or about February 26 and 27, 2015. In August 2015, the District Court issued an Order holding that the asserted patents are valid and are infringed by Watson’s ANDA. As a result, the District Court ordered that the effective date for the approval of Watson’s ANDA to be the date no sooner than the latest expiration date of the ’913 Patent and the ’865 Patent in November of 2018. Watson filed an appeal in October 2015. In October 2016, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued an opinion upholding the District Court’s decision.

	Other Proceedings and Investigations




	In addition to the above proceedings, proceedings similar to those described above may also be brought in the future. Additionally, we are involved in, or have been involved in, arbitrations or various other proceedings that arise from the normal course of our business. We cannot predict the timing or outcome of these other proceedings. Currently, neither we nor our subsidiaries are involved in any other proceedings that we expect to have a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.




	Leases




	We lease certain fixed assets under capital leases that expire through 2025. We lease automobiles, machinery and equipment and facilities under certain noncancelable operating leases that expire through 2024. These leases are renewable at our option.




	On October 28, 2011, our subsidiary EPI entered into a lease agreement for a new Company headquarters in Malvern, Pennsylvania. The term of this lease is


	12 years


	 and includes


	three


	 renewal options, each for an additional


	60


	-month period. On September 4, 2014, the Company entered into a sublease agreement to lease approximately


	60,000


	 square feet from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2016 increasing to 


	90,000


	 square feet from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2024. We will receive approximately


	$20.0 million


	 in minimum rental payments over the remaining term of the sublease.




	Our lease is accounted for as a direct financing arrangement whereby the Company recorded, over the construction period, the full cost of the asset in Property, plant and equipment, net. A corresponding liability was also recorded, net of leasehold improvements paid for by the Company, and is being amortized over the expected lease term through monthly rental payments using an effective interest method. At December 31, 2016, there was a liability of


	$42.8 million


	 related to this arrangement,


	$4.4 million


	 of which is included in Accounts payable and accrued expenses and


	$38.4 million


	 of which is included in Other liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet.

	Share Repurchase Program




	The Company has broad shareholder authority to conduct share repurchases of its ordinary shares, as our shareholders granted to the Company a general authority (the 2014 Share Buyback Authority) to make overseas market purchases (as defined by section 212 of the Irish Companies Act 1990 (the 1990 Act)) of shares of the Company on such terms and conditions as our Board of Directors may approve, but subject to the provisions of the 1990 Act and certain other provisions.




	Pursuant to the 2014 Share Buyback Authority, in April 2015, our Board of Directors approved a share buyback program (the 2015 Share Buyback Program). The 2015 Share Buyback Program authorized the Company to redeem in the aggregate


	$2.5 billion


	 of its outstanding ordinary shares. As permitted by Irish Law and the Company’s Articles of Association, all ordinary shares redeemed under the 2015 Share Buyback Program shall be cancelled upon redemption.




	In November 2015, the Company entered into a program to repurchase up to


	$250.0 million


	 of its ordinary shares under the 2015 Share Buyback Program. The Company purchased approximately


	4.4 million


	 of its ordinary shares during November 2015 totaling


	$250.0 million


	, not including related fees.








	NOTE 17. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION




	As discussed in


	Note 3. Discontinued Operations and Held for Sale


	, the operating results of the Company’s AMS and Healthtronics businesses are reported as Discontinued operations, net of tax in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented. However, as share-based compensation is not material for these businesses, amounts in this


	Note 17. Share-based Compensation


	 have not been adjusted to exclude the impact of these businesses.




	Stock Incentive Plans




	In June 2015, the Company’s shareholders approved the 2015 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2015 Plan). As of the effective date of the 2015 Plan,


	10.0 million


	 ordinary shares, including the transfer of


	5.0 million


	 ordinary shares available to be granted under the previous 2010 Stock Incentive Plan, were reserved for the granting of stock options (including incentive stock options), stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, performance awards and other share-based awards, which may be issued at the discretion of the Company’s board of directors from time to time. Upon the approval of the 2015 Plan, no additional ordinary shares were to be granted under the previously approved plans, including the Company’s 2000, 2004, 2007, 2010 and Assumed Stock Incentive Plans. All awards previously granted and outstanding under the prior plans remain subject to the terms of those prior plans.




	At


	December 31, 2016


	, approximately


	6.9 million


	 ordinary shares were reserved for future grants under the 2015 Plan. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, stock options, restricted stock awards, performance stock units and restricted stock units have been granted under the stock incentive plans.




	All share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and is recognized as an expense in the income statement over the requisite service period.

	Stock Options




	During the years ended


	December 31, 2016


	,


	2015


	 and


	2014


	, the Company granted stock options to employees of the Company as part of their annual share compensation award and, in certain circumstances, upon their commencement of service with the Company. Employee stock options generally vest ratably, in equal amounts, over a


	three


	 or


	four


	-year service period and expire


	ten


	 years from the grant date. For all of the Company’s share-based compensation plans, the fair value of each option grant was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Black-Scholes utilizes assumptions related to volatility, the risk-free interest rate, the dividend yield (which is assumed to be


	zero


	, as the Company has not paid cash dividends to date and does not currently expect to pay cash dividends) and the expected term of the option. Expected volatilities utilized in the model are based mainly on the historical volatility of the Company’s share price over a period commensurate with the expected life of the share option as well as other factors. The risk-free interest rate is derived from the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. We estimate the expected term of options granted based on our historical experience with our employees’ exercise of stock options and other factors.

	Restricted Stock Units and Performance Share Units




	During the years ended


	December 31, 2016


	,


	2015


	 and


	2014


	, the Company granted restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance share units (PSUs) to employees of the Company as part of their annual share compensation award and, in certain circumstances, equity awards granted upon an employee’s commencement of service with the Company. RSUs vest ratably, in equal amounts, over a


	three


	 or


	four


	-year service period. PSUs vest in full after a


	three


	-year service period and are conditional upon the achievement of performance or market conditions established by the compensation committee of the Board of Directors.




	In 2016, PSU grants are tied to total shareholder return (TSR) relative to the TSR of a selected industry group, with maximum payout levels also based on absolute compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) stock price objectives. Each award covered a


	three


	-year performance cycle. The actual number of shares awarded is adjusted to between


	zero


	 and


	300


	% of the target award amount based upon achievement of pre-determined relative TSR goals. TSR relative to peers is considered a market condition under applicable authoritative guidance.




	Starting in 2014 and continuing in 2015, PSU grants are tied to the attainment of absolute CAGR for the Company’s ordinary share price, which is considered a market condition under applicable authoritative guidance. Each award covers a


	three


	-year performance cycle. The actual number of shares awarded is adjusted to between


	zero


	 and


	300%


	 of the target award amount based upon achievement of pre-determined CAGR goals.




	Also starting in 2014 and continuing in 2015, the Company approved a share matching program (Matched PSUs), which is applicable to certain executive leadership team members. The program allows participants to make a direct investment in Endo ordinary shares during a pre-defined period, which the Company would immediately grant a Matched PSU for each qualifying ordinary share purchased up to the employee’s base salary. The Matched PSUs would vest on the third anniversary of the date issued to the employee if the CAGR of the Company’s ordinary shares is at least


	10%


	 over the


	three


	-year period. This program can be offered on a periodic basis, and the initial offering period was open from November 2014 through December 2015, not including blackout periods.

	Employee Stock Purchase Plan




	The Endo International plc Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) is a Company-sponsored plan that enables employees to voluntarily elect, in advance of any of the four quarterly offering periods ending March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each year, to contribute up to


	10%


	 of their eligible compensation, subject to certain limitations, to purchase ordinary shares at


	90%


	 of the lower of the closing price of Endo ordinary shares on the first or last trading day of each offering period. The maximum number of shares that a participant may purchase in any calendar year is equal to


	$25,000


	 divided by the closing selling price per ordinary share on the first day of the offering period, subject to certain adjustments. Compensation expense is calculated in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance and is based on the share price at the beginning or end of each offering period and the purchase discount. Obligations under the ESPP may be satisfied by the reissuance of treasury stock, by the Company’s purchase of shares on the open market or by the authorization of new shares. The maximum number of shares available under the ESPP, pursuant to the terms of the ESPP plan document, is


	1%


	 of the common shares outstanding on


	April 15, 2011


	 or approximately


	1.2 million


	 shares. The ESPP shall continue in effect until the earlier of (i) the date when no shares are available for issuance under the ESPP, at which time the ESPP shall be suspended pursuant to the terms of the ESPP plan document, or (ii) 


	December 31, 2022


	, unless earlier terminated. The ESPP has been suspended effective January 1, 2017. Compensation expense during the years ended

	A valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all, or a portion of, a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced or increased, or if objective negative evidence, in the form of cumulative losses, is no longer present and additional weight may be given to subjective evidence, such as projections for growth.

	The Company has recorded a valuation allowance against certain jurisdictional net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the valuation allowance was


	$4,841.2 million


	 and


	$427.0 million


	, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company increased its valuation allowance in the amount of


	$4,414.2 million


	 and


	$386.3 million


	, respectively. The net increase in the Company’s valuation allowance as of December 31, 2016 was primarily split into three main components:


	$3,950.1 million


	 related to losses within jurisdictions unable to support recognition of a deferred tax asset with the largest jurisdiction being Luxembourg, where the Company recognized a material loss on its investment in the equity of consolidated subsidiaries,


	$67.1 million


	 relating to state tax benefits and


	$400.8 million


	 related to recording a valuation allowance on U. S. deferred tax assets. The net increase in the Company’s valuation allowance as of December 31, 2015 was primarily split into three main components:


	$14.7 million


	 related to acquisitions,


	$25.9 million


	 relating to state tax benefits, and


	$349.4 million


	 relating to losses within jurisdictions that the Company was unable to support the recognition of a deferred tax asset.

	We have provided income taxes for earnings that are currently distributed as well as the taxes associated with certain earnings that are expected to be distributed in the future. No additional provision has been made for Irish and non-Irish income taxes on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries or for unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to basis differences in investments in subsidiaries, as such earnings are expected to be indefinitely reinvested, the investments are essentially permanent in duration, or we have concluded that no additional tax liability will arise as a result of the distribution of such earnings. As of December 31, 2016, certain subsidiaries had approximately


	$157.3 million


	 of cumulative undistributed earnings that have been retained indefinitely and reinvested in our global operations, including working capital; property, plant and equipment; intangible assets; and research and development activities. A liability could arise if our intention to indefinitely reinvest such earnings were to change and amounts are distributed by such subsidiaries or if such subsidiaries are ultimately disposed. It is not practicable to estimate the additional income taxes related to indefinitely reinvested earnings or the basis differences related to investments in subsidiaries. Our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate cash and cash equivalents that are designated as indefinitely reinvested in order to fund our operations, including investing and financing activities.




	The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to income taxes in the U.S., various states and numerous foreign jurisdictions with varying statutes as to which tax years are subject to examination by the tax authorities. The Company has taken positions on its tax returns that may be challenged by various tax authorities for which reserves have been established for tax-related uncertainties. These accruals for tax-related uncertainties are based on the Company’s best estimate of the potential tax exposures. When particular matters arise, a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved. Favorable resolution of such matters could be recognized as a reduction of the Company’s effective tax rate in the year of resolution. Resolution of any particular issue could increase the effective tax rate and may require the use of cash in the year of resolution.

	The Company records accrued interest as well as penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of the provision for income taxes. As of December 31, 2016, we had recorded


	$19.0 million


	 of accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, all of which was recorded in income taxes. As of December 31, 2015, the balance of accrued interest and penalties was


	$12.7 million


	, all of which was recorded in income taxes. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, we recognized expense of


	$5.1 million


	,


	$1.6 million


	 and


	$4.6 million


	, respectively, related to interest and penalties.




	Our non-U.S. subsidiaries file income tax returns in the countries in which they have operations. Generally, these countries have statutes of limitations ranging from


	three


	 to


	10 years


	. Various non-U.S. subsidiary income tax returns are currently in the process of examination by taxing authorities.




	It is expected that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change during the next twelve months; however, the Company does not anticipate any adjustments that would lead to a material impact on our results of operations or our financial position.

	loss per share


	 data is computed based on the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding and, if there is net income from continuing operations attributable to Endo ordinary shareholders during the period, the dilutive impact of ordinary share equivalents outstanding during the period. Ordinary share equivalents are measured under the treasury stock method.




	All stock options and stock awards were excluded from the diluted share calculation for the years ended


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	2015


	 because their effect would have been anti-dilutive, as the Company was in a loss position. For the year ended December 31, 2014, stock options and stock awards of


	0.7 million


	 were excluded from the diluted share calculation because their effect would have been anti-dilutive.




	The


	1.75%


	 Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due April 15, 2015 were only included in the dilutive net


	loss per share


	 calculations using the treasury stock method during periods in which the average market price of our ordinary shares was above the applicable conversion price of the Convertible Notes, or


	$29.20


	 per share, and the impact would not have been anti-dilutive. In these periods, under the treasury stock method, we calculated the number of shares issuable under the terms of these notes based on the average market price of the shares during the period, and included that number in the total diluted shares outstanding for the period.




	We entered into convertible note hedge and warrant agreements, which have subsequently been settled, that, in combination, had the economic effect of reducing the dilutive impact of the Convertible Notes. However, we separately analyzed the impact of the convertible note hedge and the warrant agreements on diluted weighted average shares outstanding. As a result, the purchases of the convertible note hedges were excluded because their impact would have been anti-dilutive. The treasury stock method was applied when the warrants were in-the-money with the proceeds from the exercise of the warrant used to repurchase shares based on the average share price in the calculation of diluted weighted average shares. Until the warrants were in-the-money, they had no impact to the diluted weighted average share calculation.

	NOTE 21. SAVINGS AND INVESTMENT PLAN AND DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS




	Savings and Investment Plan




	Endo established a defined contribution Savings and Investment Plan (the Endo 401(k) Plan) covering all employees. Employee contributions can be made on a pre-tax basis under section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code). Effective


	January 1, 2014


	, the Company will match


	100%


	 of the first


	3%


	 of eligible cash compensation that a participant contributes to the Endo 401(k) Plan plus


	50%


	 of the next


	2%


	 for a total of up to


	4%


	 of the participants’ contributions subject to limitations under section 401(k) of the Code. Participants are immediately vested with respect to their own contributions and the Company’s matching contributions.




	Costs incurred for contributions made by us to the 401(k) plans amounted to


	$11.5 million


	,


	$8.6 million


	 and


	$7.5 million


	 for the


	years


	 ended


	December 31, 2016


	,


	2015


	 and


	2014


	, respectively.




	Executive Deferred Compensation Plan




	In December 2007, the Board of Directors adopted an executive deferred compensation plan (the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan) and a 401(k) restoration plan (the 401(k) Restoration Plan) both effective as of


	January 1, 2008


	. Both plans cover employees earning over the Internal Revenue Code plan compensation limit, which would include the chief executive officer, chief financial officer and other named executive officers. The Executive Deferred Compensation Plan allows for deferral of up to


	50%


	 of the bonus, with payout to occur as elected, either in a lump sum or in installments, and up to


	100%


	 of restricted stock units granted, with payout to occur either in a lump sum or in installments. Under the 401(k) Restoration Plan the participant may defer the amount of base salary and bonus that would have been deferrable under the Endo 401(k) Plan (up to


	50%


	 of salary and bonus) if not for the qualified plan statutory limits on deferrals and contributions. Payment occurs as elected, either in lump sum or in installments.




	Directors Stock Election Plan




	In December 2007, Endo established a directors stock election plan. The purpose of this plan is to provide non-employee directors the opportunity to have some, or all of their retainer fees delivered in the form of Endo ordinary shares. The amount of shares will be determined by dividing the portion of cash fees elected to be received as shares by the closing price of the shares on the day the payment would have otherwise been paid in cash.










	NOTE 22. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS




	Disposition of Litha Business




	On February 27, 2017, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell Litha to Acino Pharma AG for up to


	$100 million


	 in cash. The purchase price payable at the closing is subject to adjustments, including net working capital and net indebtedness adjustments. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2017 and is subject to customary conditions, including the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting periods under applicable competition laws. The assets and liabilities of the Litha business are classified as held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of


	December 31, 2016


	. Refer to Note 3. Discontinued Operations and Held for Sale for further discussion.

	(b)






	The following individuals cease for any reason to constitute a majority of the number of directors then serving: individuals who, on the date hereof, constitute the Board of Directors and any new director (other than a director whose initial assumption of office is in connection with an actual or threatened election contest, including but not limited to a consent solicitation, relating to the election of directors of the Company) whose appointment or election by the Board of Directors or nomination for election by the Company’s shareholders was approved or recommended by a vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the directors then still in office who either were directors on the date hereof or whose appointment, election or nomination for election was previously so approved or recommended; or





















	(c)






	There is consummated a merger or consolidation of the Company or any direct or indirect subsidiary of the Company with any other corporation or other entity, other than (A) a merger or consolidation which results in (i) the voting securities of the Company outstanding immediately prior to such merger or consolidation continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting securities of the surviving entity or any parent thereof), in combination with the ownership of any trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under an employee benefit plan of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company, at least 60% of the combined voting power of the securities of the Company or such surviving entity or any parent thereof outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation and (ii) the individuals who comprise the Board of Directors
























	immediately prior thereto constituting immediately thereafter at least a majority of the board of directors of the Company, the entity surviving such merger or consolidation or, if the Company or the entity surviving such merger is then a subsidiary, the ultimate parent thereof, or (B) a merger or consolidation effected to implement a recapitalization of the Company (or similar transaction) in which no Person is or becomes the Beneficial Owner, directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company (not including in the securities Beneficially Owned by such Person any securities acquired directly from the Company or its Affiliates) representing 30% or more of the combined voting power of the Company’s then outstanding securities; or


















	(d)






	The shareholders of the Company approve a plan of complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company or there is consummated an agreement for the sale or disposition by the Company of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets (it being conclusively presumed that any sale or disposition is a sale or disposition by the Company of all or substantially all of its assets if the consummation of the sale or disposition is contingent upon approval by the Company’s shareholders unless the Board of Directors expressly determines in writing that such approval is required solely by reason of any relationship between the Company and any other Person or an Affiliate of the Company and any other Person), other than a sale or disposition by the Company of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets to an entity (A) at least 60% of the combined voting power of the voting securities of which are owned by shareholders of the Company in substantially the same proportions as their ownership of the Company immediately prior to such sale or disposition and (B) the majority of whose board of directors immediately following such sale or disposition consists of individuals who comprise the Board of Directors immediately prior thereto.







	For purposes hereof, “Person” shall have the meaning given in Section 3(a)(9) of the Exchange Act, as modified and used in Sections 13(d) and 15(d) thereof, except that such term shall not include (i) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) a trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under an employee benefit plan of the Company or any of its Affiliates, (iii) an underwriter temporarily holding securities pursuant to an offering of such securities, or (iv) a corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by the shareholders of the Company in substantially the same proportions as their ownership of stock of the Company.




	Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) a “Change in Control” shall not be deemed to have occurred by virtue of the consummation of any transaction or series of integrated transactions immediately following which the record holders of Company Stock immediately prior to such transaction or series of transactions continue to have substantially the same proportionate ownership in an entity which owns all or substantially all of the assets of the Company immediately following such transaction or series of transactions and (ii) with respect to any Award that constitutes a deferral of compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, no such Award shall become payable as a result of the occurrence of a Change in Control unless such Change in Control also constitutes a change in the ownership or effective control of the Company or a change in ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Company under Section 409A of the Code.




	For the avoidance of doubt, any one or more of the events described in subparagraphs (a) through (d) may be effected pursuant to (A) a takeover under Irish takeover rules; (B) a





















	compromise or arrangement under Chapter 1 of Part 9 of the Companies Act 2014 of the Republic of Ireland or (C) Chapter 2 of Part 9 of the Companies Act 2014 of the Republic of Ireland.

	Good Reason


	.











	(i) Upon termination of the Participant’s service with the Company and its Subsidiaries by the Company or its Subsidiaries without Cause or by the Participant for “good reason” (or any like term as defined under any employment agreement with the Company or a Subsidiary to which the Participant is a party, as modified below) prior to the TSR Vesting Date, a portion of the Participant's TSR Performance Award shall vest based upon achievement of the TSR Performance Criteria (as defined in


	Exhibit A


	) measured as of the date of the Participant’s termination of service, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full months of the Participant’s service during the TSR Performance Period and the denominator of which is the total number of months in the TSR Performance Period.

If such termination occurs prior to the FCF Vesting Date and prior to the Company’s first approval of estimated Free Cash Flow for the FCF Performance Period in which such termination of service occurs, then the Participant shall not vest in any portion of the FCF Performance Award in respect of the FCF Performance Period in which such termination of service occurs. The vested portion of the FCF Performance Award determined in accordance with the foregoing (plus any portion of the Participant’s FCF Performance Award for which the FCF Performance Criteria (as defined in


	Exhibit B


	) has been achieved in respect of any previously completed FCF Performance Period) shall be settled in shares of Company Stock immediately following such termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing the Committee (or such individual or individuals authorized by the Committee) may, in its discretion, exercise negative discretion to determine payout achievement.  Any portion of the FCF Performance Award that could have been earned in accordance with the provisions of this Section 4(e)(ii) that is not earned as of the date of the Participant’s termination of service shall be immediately forfeited on the date of the Participant’s termination of service.











	(iii) For the purposes of this Section 4(e), for any Participant who is a party to an employment agreement with the Company or a Subsidiary, “good reason” shall also include the Participant's termination of his or her employment within ninety (90) days following the expiration of the employment term of the Participant's employment agreement under circumstances that would have constituted good reason had such termination occurred during the employment term.









	(f)


	Termination of Service for any Other Reason


	. Unless otherwise provided in an





















	individual agreement with the Participant, if the Participant has a termination of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the TSR Vesting Date or the FCF Vesting Date for any reason other than the reasons enumerated in Subparagraphs (a) through (e) above, the Participant’s Performance Award as of the date of termination of service shall be forfeited.











	5.

	. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan, in the event of a Change in Control prior to the TSR Vesting Date or the FCF Vesting Date, as applicable, the provisions of this Section 5 shall apply.

	(b)


	    


	if any portion of the Performance Award is not assumed or substituted in connection with such Change in Control, then the restrictions, deferral limitations, payment conditions, and forfeiture conditions applicable to any portion of the Performance Award shall lapse and:

	(I)






	TSR Performance Criteria


	.









	The Participant will be entitled to receive a number of shares of Company Stock as of the TSR Vesting Date, equal to a multiple of the TSR Target Performance Award achieved based on achievement of targets relating to Relative TSR (the “


	TSR Performance Criteria


	”) as described below for the TSR Performance Period:
























	Relative TSR






	Multiple Applicable to TSR Target Performance Award








	Equal to or above 90



	th



	 percentile






	2








	Equal to or above 80



	th



	 percentile but below 90



	th



	 percentile






	1.61 - 1.80








	Equal to or above 70



	th



	 percentile but below 80

	 percentile






	1.41 - 1.60








	Equal to or above 60



	th



	 percentile but below 70



	th



	 percentile






	1.21 - 1.40








	Equal to or above 50



	th



	 percentile but below 60



	th



	 percentile






	1.00 - 1.20








	Equal to or above 40



	th

	th



	 percentile






	0.5








	Below 40



	th



	 percentile






	0










	In the event that Relative TSR over the TSR Performance Period is negative, the multiple applicable to the TSR Target Performance Award shall not exceed 1.






	 If Relative TSR is equal to or above the 50



	th



	 percentile but below the 90



	th



	 percentile, the Participant will vest in a number of shares of Company Stock that is the mathematical linear interpolation between the number of shares of Company Stock that would vest at the defined ends of the applicable spectrum. No such interpolation shall occur in the event that Relative TSR is below the 50



	th



	 percentile or equal to or above the 90



	th



	 percentile.






	The determination of Relative TSR will be made in the sole discretion of the Committee, after the end of the TSR Performance Period once the applicable year-end audit is available. The Committee has discretion to accelerate the vesting of all or a portion of the Participant’s TSR Performance Award based upon the overall performance of the Company and/or the Participant or based upon any change in business conditions, provided that the exercise of such discretion would not cause a TSR Performance Award that would otherwise be deducible as “performance-based” compensation within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code to become non-deductible.

	EXHIBIT B









	The following exhibit contains the FCF Performance Criteria in respect of 2017, which is the first FCF Performance Period for the 2017 FCF Performance Award.









	The FCF Performance Criteria (including any changes thereto) in respect of future FCF Performance Periods for the 2017 FCF Performance Award shall be communicated to the Participant no later than March 31



	st



	 of the relevant FCF Performance Period.













	(I)






	FCF Performance Criteria


	.









	The Participant will be eligible to earn a number of shares of Company Stock equal to one third (1/3rd) of the number of restricted stock units underlying the target FCF Performance Award multiplied by the multiple applicable to the FCF Performance Award for the FCF Performance Period, which will be based on achievement of a Target relating to Free Cash Flow (the “


	FCF Performance Criteria


	”) and determined in accordance with the below:


























	Free Cash Flow*






	Multiple Applicable to FCF Performance Award for the FCF Performance Period








	Equal to or greater than 112% of Target






	2








	Equal to or greater than 109% of Target but less than 112% of Target






	1.75








	Equal to or greater than 106% of Target but less than 109% of Target






	1.5








	Equal to or greater than 103% of Target but less than 106% of Target






	1.25








	Equal to or greater than 100% of Target but less than 103% of Target






	1








	Equal to or greater than 97% of Target but less than 100% of Target






	0.75








	Equal to or greater than 94% of Target but less than 97% of Target






	0.5








	Less than 94% of Target






	0










	*Free Cash Flow for each FCF Performance Period associated with the 2017 FCF Performance Award must equal or exceed the following minimum Free Cash Flow: 50% of actual annual adjusted net income for the relevant FCF Performance Period.






	If Free Cash Flow is equal to or greater than 94% of Target but below 112% of Target, the Participant will earn a number of shares of Company Stock that is the mathematical linear interpolation between the number of shares of Company Stock that would be earned at the defined ends of the applicable spectrum. No such interpolation shall occur in the event that Free Cash Flow is less than 94% of Target or equal to or greater than 112% of Target.






	The determination of Free Cash Flow will be made in the sole discretion of the Committee, after the end of the applicable FCF Performance Period once the applicable year-end audit is available. The Committee may adjust the FCF Performance Award in a manner approved by the Committee at the time of the grant of the FCF Performance Award. The Committee has discretion to increase the portion of the Participant’s FCF Performance Award earned based upon the overall performance of the Company and/or the Participant or based upon any change in business conditions, provided that the exercise of such discretion does not cause an FCF Performance Award that would otherwise be deducible as “performance-based” compensation within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code to become non-deductible.

	(b)    if the Award is not assumed or substituted in connection with such Change in Control, then the Award shall immediately vest upon the occurrence of the Change in Control.









	6.    


	Change in Control Definition


	. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan, for purposes of this Award Agreement, Change in Control means and shall be deemed to have occurred upon the first of the following events to occur:




	(a) Any “Person” (as defined below) is or becomes the “beneficial owner” (“Beneficial Owner”) within the meaning set forth in Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company (not
















	including in the securities beneficially owned by such Person any securities acquired directly from the Company or its “Affiliates” (as defined in Rule 12b-2 promulgated under Section 12 of the Exchange Act)) representing 30% or more of the combined voting power of the Company’s then outstanding securities, excluding any Person who becomes such a Beneficial Owner in connection with a transaction described in clause (A) of Subparagraph (c) below; or




	(b) The following individuals cease for any reason to constitute a majority of the number of directors then serving: individuals who, on the date hereof, constitute the Board of Directors and any new director (other than a director whose initial assumption of office is in connection with an actual or threatened election contest, including but not limited to a consent solicitation, relating to the election of directors of the Company) whose appointment or election by the Board of Directors or nomination for election by the Company’s shareholders was approved or recommended by a vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the directors then still in office who either were directors on the date hereof or whose appointment, election or nomination for election was previously so approved or recommended; or




	(c) There is consummated a merger or consolidation of the Company or any direct or indirect subsidiary of the Company with any other corporation or other entity, other than (A) a merger or consolidation which results in (i) the voting securities of the Company outstanding immediately prior to such merger or consolidation continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting securities of the surviving entity or any parent thereof), in combination with the ownership of any trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under an employee benefit plan of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company, at least 60% of the combined voting power of the securities of the Company or such surviving entity or any parent thereof outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation and (ii) the individuals who comprise the Board of Directors immediately prior thereto constituting immediately thereafter at least a majority of the board of directors of the Company, the entity surviving such merger or consolidation or, if the Company or the entity surviving such merger is then a subsidiary, the ultimate parent thereof, or (B) a merger or consolidation effected to implement a recapitalization of the Company (or similar transaction) in which no Person is or becomes the Beneficial Owner, directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company (not including in the securities Beneficially Owned by such Person any securities acquired directly from the Company or its Affiliates) representing 30% or more of the combined voting power of the Company’s then outstanding securities; or




	(d) The shareholders of the Company approve a plan of complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company or there is consummated an agreement for the sale or disposition by the Company of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets (it being conclusively presumed that any sale or disposition is a sale or disposition by the Company of all or substantially all of its assets if the consummation of the sale or disposition is contingent upon approval by the Company’s shareholders unless the Board of Directors expressly determines in writing that such approval is required solely by reason of any relationship between the Company and any other Person or an Affiliate of the Company and any other Person), other than a sale or disposition by the Company of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets to an entity (A) at least 60% of the combined voting power of the voting securities of which are owned by shareholders of the Company in substantially the same proportions as their ownership of the Company immediately prior to such sale or disposition and (B) the majority of whose board of directors immediately following such sale or disposition consists of individuals who comprise the Board of Directors immediately prior thereto.




	For purposes hereof, “Person” shall have the meaning given in Section 3(a)(9) of the Exchange Act, as modified and used in Sections 13(d) and 15(d) thereof, except that such term shall not include (i) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) a trustee or other fiduciary holding securities
















	under an employee benefit plan of the Company or any of its Affiliates, (iii) an underwriter temporarily holding securities pursuant to an offering of such securities, or (iv) a corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by the shareholders of the Company in substantially the same proportions as their ownership of stock of the Company.




	Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) a “Change in Control” shall not be deemed to have occurred by virtue of the consummation of any transaction or series of integrated transactions immediately following which the record holders of Company Stock immediately prior to such transaction or series of transactions continue to have substantially the same proportionate ownership in an entity which owns all or substantially all of the assets of the Company immediately following such transaction or series of transactions and (ii) with respect to any Award that constitutes a deferral of compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, no such Award shall become payable as a result of the occurrence of a Change in Control unless such Change in Control also constitutes a change in the ownership or effective control of the Company or a change in ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Company under Section 409A of the Code.




	For the avoidance of doubt, any one or more of the events described in subparagraphs (a) through (d) may be effected pursuant to (A) a takeover under Irish takeover rules; (B) a compromise or arrangement under Chapter 1 of Part 9 of the Companies Act 2014 of the Republic of Ireland or (C) Chapter 2 of Part 9 of the Companies Act 2014 of the Republic of Ireland.




	7.    


	No Shareholder Rights


	. The Participant shall not have any rights of a shareholder with respect to the Award.









	8.    


	Award Agreement Subject to Plan


	. This Award Agreement is made pursuant to all of the provisions of the Plan, which is incorporated herein by reference, and is intended, and shall be interpreted in a manner, to comply therewith. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Award Agreement and the provisions of the Plan, the provisions of the Plan shall govern, except as expressly provided by Paragraph 6 of this Award Agreement.









	9.    


	No Rights to Continuation of Service


	. Nothing in the Plan or this Award Agreement shall confer upon the Participant any right to continue in the employ of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof or shall interfere with or restrict the right of the Company or its shareholders (or of a Subsidiary or its shareholders, as the case may be) to terminate the Participant’s service any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without Cause.









	10.    


	Tax Withholding


	. The Company shall be entitled to require a cash payment by or on behalf of the Participant and/or to deduct from any Award granted hereunder or compensation payable to the Participant any sums required by federal, state or local tax law to be withheld or to satisfy any applicable payroll deductions with respect to the vesting of, lapse of restrictions on, or payment of any Award. A Participant who is an officer or director subject to the provisions of Section 16 of the Exchange Act as of the date of the withholding requirement may satisfy the foregoing requirement by electing to have the Company withhold from delivery shares of Company Stock in accordance with Section 12(b) of the Plan.









	11.    


	Section 409A Compliance


	. The Award is intended to comply with Code Section 409A to the extent subject thereto and shall be interpreted in accordance with Code Section 409A and Department of Treasury regulations and other interpretive guidance issued thereunder, including without limitation any such regulations or other guidance that may be issued after the Date of Grant.
















	Notwithstanding any provision in the Plan or Award Agreement to the contrary, no payment or distribution under this Award Agreement that constitutes an item of deferred compensation under Code Section 409A and becomes payable by reason of the Participant’s termination of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries will be made to the Participant until the Participant’s termination of service constitutes a “separation from service” (as defined in Code Section 409A). For purposes of this Award Agreement, each amount to be paid or benefit to be provided shall be construed as a separate identified payment for purposes of Code Section 409A. If a participant is a “specified employee” (as defined in Code Section 409A), then to the extent necessary to avoid the imposition of taxes under Code Section 409A, such Participant shall not be entitled to any payments upon a termination of his or her service until the earlier of: (i) the expiration of the six (6)-month period measured from the date of such Participant’s “separation from service” or (ii) the date of such Participant’s death. Upon the expiration of the applicable waiting period set forth in the preceding sentence, all payments and benefits deferred pursuant to this Paragraph 11 (whether they would have otherwise been payable in a single lump sum or in installments in the absence of such deferral) shall be paid to such Participant in a lump sum as soon as practicable, but in no event later than sixty (60) calendar days, following such expired period, and any remaining payments due under this Award Agreement will be paid in accordance with the normal payment dates specified for them herein.









	12.    


	Governing Law


	. This Award Agreement shall be governed by, interpreted under, and construed and enforced in accordance with the internal laws, and not the laws pertaining to conflicts or choices of laws, of the State of Delaware applicable to agreements made and to be performed wholly within the State of




	Delaware.









	13.    


	Binding on Successors


	. The terms of this Award Agreement shall be binding upon the Participant and upon the Participant’s heirs, executors, administrators, personal representatives, transferees, assignees and successors in interest, and upon the Company and its successors and assignees, subject to the terms of the Plan.









	14.    


	No Assignment


	. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Award Agreement, neither this Award Agreement nor any rights granted herein shall be assignable by the Participant.









	15.    


	Necessary Acts


	. The Participant hereby agrees to perform all acts, and to execute and deliver any documents that may be reasonably necessary to carry out the provisions of this Award Agreement, including but not limited to all acts and documents related to compliance with federal and/or state securities and/or tax laws and applicable Irish law.









	16.    


	Entire Award Agreement


	. This Award Agreement and the Plan contain the entire agreement and understanding among the parties as to the subject matter hereof.









	17.    


	Headings


	. Headings are used solely for the convenience of the parties and shall not be deemed to be a limitation upon or descriptive of the contents of any such Paragraph.









	18.    


	Counterparts


	. This Award Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original and all of which together shall be deemed to be one and the same instrument.

	23.    


	Severability


	. All the terms and provisions of this Award Agreement are distinct and severable, and if any term or provision is held unenforceable, illegal or void in whole or in part by any court, regulatory authority or other competent authority it shall to that extent be deemed not to form part of this Award Agreement, and the enforceability, legality and validity of the remainder of this Award Agreement will not be affected; if any invalid, unenforceable or illegal provision would be valid, enforceable or legal if some part of it were deleted, the provision shall apply with whatever modification is necessary to make it valid, enforceable and legal.

The Participant acknowledges that s/he has the right to request a list of the names and addresses of any potential recipients of the Information and to review and correct the Information by contacting his/her local human resources representative. The Participant
















	acknowledges that the collection, processing and transfer of the Information is important to Plan administration and that failure to consent to same may prohibit participation in the Plan.

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

Endo to cut 875 jobs and close facilities in Alabama
Endo International PLC  said Friday it was cutting 875 jobs, which is about 18% of its workforce, as part of a restructuring aimed at cutting costs by up to $65 million a year. The pharmaceutical company said it will close manufacturing and distribution facilities in Huntsville, Ala. over the next 12-to-18 months, as a result of declining volumes of commoditized products. Endo expects to record restructuring charges of $325 million, including cash charges of $60 million. "Today's announced action enables a redeployment of investment from commoditized products to more differentiated capabilities and products that represent our core areas of future growth," said Chief Executive Paul Campanelli. The stock, which slipped 0.5% in premarket trade, has tumbled 25.2% year to date through Thursday, while SPDR S&P Pharmaceuticals ETF  has climbed 13.2% and the S&P 500  has gained 10.5%.

Endo will remove opioid from market, following FDA request
Endo International PLC  said on Thursday that it will voluntarily remove the opioid pain medication Opana ER from the market, in response to a Food and Drug Administration request last month. Endo expects an about $20 million pre-tax impairment charge in the second quarter "to write-off the remaining net book value of its Opana ER intangible asset." Opana ER sales amounted to about $160 million last year and nearly $36 million in the first quarter, the company said. Endo also said that it continues to believe in the drug's safety and efficacy when used as intended. Opana ER was reformulated in 2012 to prevent abuse through snorting or injecting. However, the drug was being abused after reformulation via injection, the FDA said in June. Public health consequences of that abuse included a serious outbreak of HIV and Hepatitis C and cases of a harmful blood disorder, the FDA said then. Endo shares declined 2.2% in afternoon trade, compared with a 0.5% decline in the S&P 500 . Shares have declined 1.2% over the last three months, compared with a 2.7% rise in the S&P 500 .

Collegium's stock jumps on belief its opioid drug will get a boost from a rival's woes
Shares of Collegium Pharmaceutical Inc.  shot up 10% in active morning trade Friday, amid expectations that the pain treatment maker will get a big boost from rival Endo International PLC's  misfortune. Late Thursday, the Food and Drug Administration asked Endo to "voluntarily" stop selling its opioid pain medication Opana ER, citing concerns that the drug's benefits may not outweigh the risks, as opioid abuse has reached "crisis" levels. That sent Endo's stock plunging 15%. Janney analyst Ken Trbovich said the removal of Opana ER means the near-500,000 prescriptions filled for the drug in the past year will be transferred to other products like Collegium's Xtampsa. "This provides meaningful potential upside to [Collegium's stock] and it should also help [Collegium's] messaging about Xtampza's superior abuse deterrent features because it highlights the unique nature of each product in the market," Trbovich wrote in a note to clients. Collegium's stock has shed 29.4% year to date, while Endo shares have slumped 28.7% and the S&P 500  has gained 9.2%.

FDA asks Endo to stop selling opioid, in first such move
Endo International  shares plummeted 13.6% after the close Thursday after the Food and Drug Administration said it has asked the company to stop selling its opioid pain medication, reformulated Opana ER. The FDA said that this is the first time it has done something like this with an opioid medication based on concerns about abuse. Opana ER was reformulated in 2012, amid a national opioid crisis that continues to this day, to prevent abuse through snorting or injecting, though the FDA didn't allow the company to label the product as potentially deterring abuse. But postmarketing data for Opana ER showed that abuse of the drug shifted from nasal to injection after reformulation, the FDA said, prompting the regulator to ask Endo to take it off the market. There have been public health consequences associated with injection abuse of the drug, the FDA said, including a serious outbreak of HIV and Hepatitis C and cases of a serious blood disorder. If Endo doesn't voluntarily stop selling Opana ER, the FDA said it plans to withdraw approval for the product. The regulator will continue to examine approved opioid pain medications and "take further actions as appropriate," it said. Endo shares have risen 27.6% over the last three months to $13.78, compared with a 3% rise in the S&P 500 .

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Endo International Plc Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this call may be recorded.
I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference Mr. Steve Mock, SVP, Investor Relations & Corporate Affairs. Please go ahead, sir.
Stephen J. Mock - Endo International Plc
Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss our fourth quarter 2016 financial results. Joining me on today's call are Paul Campanelli, President and Chief Executive Officer of Endo; and Blaise Coleman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
We have prepared a slide presentation to accompany today's webcast, and that presentation, as well as other materials, are posted online in the Investors section at www.endo.com.
I would like to remind you that any forward-looking statements made by management are covered under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and Canadian Securities Litigation Act and are subject to the changes, risks, and uncertainties described in today's press release and in our U.S. and Canadian Securities filings.
In addition, during the course of this call, we may refer to non-GAAP financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and that may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.
Investors are encouraged to review Endo's current report on Form 8-K furnished with the SEC for Endo's reasons for including those non-GAAP financial measures in today's earnings announcement. The reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is contained in our earnings press release issued prior to today's call.
I would now like to turn the call over to Paul.
Paul V. Campanelli - Endo International Plc
Thank you, Steve. Good morning and thank you for joining us for today's call. I presume that most of you have had an opportunity to review the company's earnings press release that we issued earlier this morning.
Let me now turn to our fourth quarter 2016 earnings presentation. On slide two, we begin with a brief agenda for today's call. Now before we commence with the review of Endo's fourth quarter performance, I will first address the activity we have been engaged in since I assumed the role of CEO in late September.
As many of you know, over the past few months, Endo has undertaken an overall assessment of our company's strategy in its asset and product portfolios. Through this assessment, our management team developed a multi-year plan for our company. This necessitated a realistic examination of Endo, our current industry environment and where we are headed over the next several years.
In conjunction with our annual goodwill and in-process R&D impairment testing, we developed a revised company-wide long-term forecast taking into consideration the realities of our current external environment. The revised plan reflects a lower estimated fair value for certain reporting units and intangible assets. This change in estimated fair value ultimately led to significant impairment charges being recorded during the fourth quarter.

Blaise will address these charges in greater detail later on this morning's call. While the impairment charges reflect an accounting valuation of assets acquired in the past, our multi-year plan represents our forward looking strategy. Importantly, we've already begun to execute on a number of our plans, underlying initiatives and priorities.
In this regard, moving to slide three, we have defined three key priorities. The first is to reshape our organization for success. We've put in place a new executive leadership team that possesses a demonstrated track record of success. We have centralized and streamlined Endo's global supply chain, quality and compliance organization in order to create a more cohesive and efficient structure to support both our generics and branded businesses.
Additionally, we announced the restructuring of our corporate and branded pharmaceutical R&D function. Importantly, we named Terry Coughlin to be Endo's Chief Operating Officer. As a result, we now have an operating leader with visibility into all of our business units which we believe will allow us to achieve greater efficiencies and to capitalize on synergistic opportunities between the businesses.
We also believe our new operating model will help enable a new Endo culture focused on execution and accountability. Our second priority is to build our portfolio of capabilities for the future. In doing so, we identified assets in businesses that were no longer core to us and divested them or plan to in the near future, as they no longer align with our go-forward strategy.
We've divested non-core assets such as BELBUCA and restructured Endo's pain franchise to become a highly focused specialty branded business. And today, we announced the divestiture of the South African Litha Healthcare Group. We are investing where we can win and divesting non-core assets. In this context, we have also identified Somar as non-core and we'll be conducting due diligence on divesting Somar in order to focus on regulated markets in developed countries. Both Litha and Somar are good businesses with talented teams, and we appreciate all the contributions they have made to our company. However, they are no longer a good strategic fit for Endo and they are better placed with companies that can provide the attention and resources they deserve.
Lastly, our third priority is to drive margin expansion and de-lever. We will look to drive margin improvements through a culture focused on smart product selection, operational execution, and continuous improvements. In addition to driving margin improvement, de-levering is a priority and we do aspire to de-lever back into the three to four times range over time.
We are not going to put a specific timeframe on we expect to achieve this goal due to the number of uncertainties in the near term that could impact the timing of achieving it. We are committed to taking a highly disciplined approach to capital allocation with the repayment of debt as a top priority after investing in our key growth driver. Through the actions we have already taken to date, we are achieving cost savings that will ultimately result in lower operating expenses, solid EBITDA generation and a significantly improved EBITDA margin percentage starting in 2017.
Moving to slide 4. Today it is Endo's intent to be a highly focused generics and specialty branded pharmaceutical company, delivering high quality medicines to patients through excellence in development, manufacturing and commercialization. Endo will focus on its core assets: a generics business which is the fourth largest in the U.S. based on sales with a growing sterile injectables unit and a promising pipeline of almost 120 ANDAs and a revamped specialty branded business focused on our flagship product XIAFLEX as well as products like SUPPRELIN LA, TESTOPEL and AVEED.

Now moving to slide 5, we'll begin the review of our financial results. Driven by a strong fourth quarter performance, Endo placed at the high end of our guidance range for both revenue and adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter and the year. This performance was driven by our generics business, which benefited from important product launches as well as the continued growth of our XIAFLEX franchise.
On slide 6, you will see a snapshot of our segment revenues for the fourth quarter. Owing to two significant product launches, our U.S. generic pharmaceutical unit represented about 70% of our company's revenue in the fourth quarter.
Turning to slide 7. Our generics business delivered a very strong performance in the quarter, driven by the first to file launches of quetiapine ER, the generic version of SEROQUEL XR in November, and ezetimibe the generic equivalent of ZETIA in December. The successful launches of ezetimibe and quetiapine achieved combined sales approaching $300 million for the quarter.
Ezetimibe represented the largest product launch in Par's history. Our sterile injectables business continues to grow, led again by Vasostrict. In 2016, Vasostrict achieved sales just over $340 million and is Endo's largest selling product. Going forward, sterile injectables will continue as one of Par's areas of strategic focus. We are developing an impressive roster of ANDAs for sterile injection and infusion, having filed five ANDAs for sterile products just in the fourth quarter. We also received approval for our mycophenolate injection ANDA and launched the product in November.
In new launches and alternative dosages, the strong performance was driven by the two product launches we just reviewed. Alternative dosages specifically benefited from the increased sales of potassium chloride liquid and powder. Our base generics business declined approximately 23% compared to fourth quarter 2015 and approximately 30% for the full year 2016 compared to pro-forma 2015, which is in line with the guidance we provided last November.
As we've discussed before, the base business has been impacted by consortium pricing pressures, an evolving consortium structure and additional competitive generic entrants in certain product categories. The fourth quarter base business revenue increased sequentially from the third quarter of 2016. The increase was due to the expected restocking in the quarter.
Slide 8. Finally, as we said last month at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference, we expect our 2017 base business revenue decline to be similar to what we experienced in 2016 or in the low 30% range. In 2017, the underlying rate of base business price erosion is likely to be high single-digit when we exclude the impact of product discontinuances, the full-year impact of prior year competitive events, and the impact of expected new competitive events in 2017.
With that said, we expect our total generics segment to decline in the high single- to low double-digit percentage range in 2017 due to what I just described, partially offset by growth in our sterile injectables and new launch revenues respectively. It is important to note that we expect modest growth in gross margin improvement versus prior year with margins in the high 50% range.
Now moving to slide 9. You will see that in 2016, Par launched approximately 20 new products representing approximately $11 billion in market value according to IMS Health. In addition, we made 27 regulatory submissions including 21 ANDAs. We also successfully rationalized our generics product portfolio with approximately 70 products that provided no profit identified for discontinuance.
In addition, we restructured our manufacturing network including the divestiture of our Charlotte manufacturing facility. As a result, we are on track to realize approximately $75 million in annual net savings in 2017. These savings are higher than previously communicated as we've been able to accelerate and increase the net savings expected to be realized through our restructuring effort. These savings are contributing towards the expected year-over-year improvement in our 2017 adjusted gross margin.

On slide 10, we highlight our full-year 2017 product launch expectation. We expect to file a similar number of ANDAs as we did in 2016. We also expect to launch at least 20 new products in 2017, although none will be of the same magnitude of quetiapine and ezetimibe.
Year-to-date, we have already launched three products: the 25 milligram and 35 milligram strains of dexmethylphenidate ER capsules, for which Par was first to file; itraconazole capsules, and most recently are 505(b)(2) NDA ephedrine sulfate injection. We also received news from the FDA that we can now expect unapproved sources of adrenalin to vacate the market by the second half of the year.
In addition, we continue to have 100% share of the potassium chloride liquid market and have been growing our potassium powder market share nicely. Including Vasostrict, our 505(b)(2) strategy has yielded five products for Par that are all significant contributors to our businesses.
On slide 11, we'll discuss our branded business. Revenues in our U.S. branded pharmaceutical business declined 24% compared to fourth quarter 2015. The decrease in sales was due primarily to the impact of generic erosion on Endo's pain and establish products portfolios, as well as the divestiture of STENDRA.
Brands impacted by continued generic erosion included VOLTAREN GEL, LIDODERM and FROVA. Specialty pharmaceuticals increase 14% in the fourth quarter versus prior year, powered by strong performances from XIAFLEX, and SUPPRELIN LA. Sales of XIAFLEX, our flagship branded product, increased 11% compared to fourth quarter 2015 driven primarily by double-digit demand growth for the product, particularly in Peyronie's disease.
Meanwhile, sales of another core specialty product, SUPPRELIN LA, grew 23% driven in part by continued demand growth. In 2017, we expect our branded revenue to decline in the low- to mid-teen percentage range year-over-year based on the annualized erosion for the products previously discussed, as well as the continued decline of the legacy pain portfolio, partially offset by the growth of XIAFLEX and our other specialty brands. We expect gross margins for the segment to remain in the high 70% range.
Turning to slide 12. For the year, XIAFLEX achieved U.S. sales of $190 million, a 14% increase from 2015 on a pro forma basis. We expect our 2017 specialty business to grow in the high single digits driven primarily by expected high single- to low double-digit growth for XIAFLEX. Only a small portion of the diagnosed patient population for each of the XIAFLEX indications have actually been treated. This represents a very promising opportunity to Endo to increase awareness among patients and extend the product's growth in each of its on-market indications.
Our Q4 2016 branded specialty business performance demonstrates an initial proof point that Endo can win in those strategic core areas that we focus upon and invest in appropriately. As I briefly mentioned earlier, BELBUCA has been returned to BDSI. The pain, opioid market has changed significantly and BELBUCA no longer aligns with Endo's U.S. branded strategy and portfolio prioritization. A portion of the cost savings from the restructuring of our pain business will be redeployed in 2017 to support our core franchises including XIAFLEX, SUPPRELIN LA, and other core branded franchises.
On slide 13, let's now discuss XIAFLEX further. We are very excited about the prospects for XIAFLEX and recognize it to be a very valuable asset. We'll focus our efforts and resources behind XIAFLEX and its approved indications and in pursuing an indication for cellulite following the announcement of positive Phase 2b data last November. Endo is fully committed to obtaining the necessary aesthetics capabilities to be prepared to successfully launch and commercialize XIAFLEX for cellulite. We are in fact preparing for success. As part of the preparation, we intend to maintain what I refer to as our optionality with regard to the cellulite opportunity and its potential commercialization. We will examine and consider all options in our efforts to maximize the value of this opportunity and increase long-term shareholder value.

Moving to slide 14. Let's address international pharmaceuticals. As part of our product-by-product and business-by-business assessment, we made the determination that Litha Healthcare Group and Somar are no longer aligned with the company strategy and do not represent a core areas of focus for Endo. Accordingly, we have entered into an agreement with the Acino to divest Litha and have started due diligent efforts for the potential sale of Somar.
Fourth quarter international revenues of $70 million declined 18% compared to prior year. Paladin's fourth quarter performance actually exceeded our expectations due to delayed competition on certain products. In the fourth quarter, Paladin began to promote XIAFLEX and NUCYNTA in Canada. Paladin also retains Canadian market rights to serelaxin and looks forward to the results of Phase 3 clinical trial later this year.
The decline in emerging market revenues from Litha and Somar were attributable in part to a decrease in Litha revenue as a result of the divestiture of non-core asset in the first quarter of 2016. Somar revenues were impacted by lower demand for certain products in Mexico and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. In 2017, we expect international revenues to decline in the mid to high 20% range, reflecting the divestiture of Litha as well as the competitive pressure discussed earlier for Paladin and the impact of foreign exchange on Somar.
With that, let me turn the call over to Blaise Coleman to further discuss the financial performance of the company in the quarter and our 2017 financial guidance. Blaise?
Blaise Coleman - Endo International Plc
Thank you, Paul and good morning, everyone. First on slide 15, you'll see a snapshot of the fourth quarter GAAP financial results. Paul covered company and segment revenues earlier, so I will not review that here. On a GAAP basis, we had a loss per share of $14.96 in the quarter versus diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.97 in the fourth quarter of 2015. GAAP net loss from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2016 was $3.3 billion compared to GAAP net income from continuing operations of $444 million during the same period in 2015. The $3.3 billion net loss resulted from $3.5 billion goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges recorded during fourth quarter 2016.
Moving to slide 16, as Paul mentioned, during the fourth quarter, the company conducted its annual goodwill and in-process R&D impairment tests and tested several other finite lived intangible assets that had triggering events during the quarter. To test these assets for impairment, the company utilized estimated future cash flows developed as part of our fourth quarter company-wide forecasting process.
The company's revised forecast reflects a change in outlook, primarily for its generics reporting unit reflecting the quickly evolving new realities of the U.S. generics external environment as characterized by increased buying power from the continued consolidation of its customer base, increased levels of competition due to the new low-cost competitors, and accelerated FDA ANDA approvals and a change in the value derived from estimated future pricing levels.
All these factors, coupled with increases in the risk factor included in the discount rate used to calculate the discounted cash flows, have driven a material decrease in the estimated fair value of our generics reporting unit and certain intangible assets. This change in the estimated implied fair value led to the majority of the impairment charges recorded in fourth quarter.
In addition to the impairment charges related to our generics reporting unit, we also had impairment charges related to our international pharmaceutical segment driven by a change in the expected future cash flows from those respective reporting units.

Turning to slide 17, as Paul mentioned, on an adjusted basis, both revenue and adjusted diluted earnings per share are at the high end of our guidance range for the quarter and the year. To summarize the points Paul made earlier, revenue was strong due to the launches of ezetimibe and quetiapine extended release, the continued growth of our sterile injectables business, and double-digit growth for XIAFLEX. Adjusted net income of $396 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.77 increased versus fourth quarter 2015 due to higher revenues and lower operating expenses, especially when viewed as a percent of sales.
Moving to cash and liquidity on slide 18, in fourth quarter 2016, cash flow from operations totaled approximately $81 million. We've also highlighted some of the material items that impacted our cash flow from operations on a quarterly and annual basis.
On slide 19, you will see highlights of our full year 2017 guidance. We expect revenues to be approximately $3.45 billion to $3.6 billion, a low double-digit decline versus 2016 reflective of the pressures in our generics, branded, and international businesses Paul described earlier. Excluding the impact of divestitures and product discontinuations, our forecasted total enterprise revenue decline would be high single-digit. Reported diluted GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations are projected to be between $0.04 and $0.34 and we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be between $3.45 and $3.75. More importantly, we expect adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations to be between $1.5 billion to $1.58 billion representing a significant increase in adjusted EBITDA margin year-over-year reflective of the impact from our ongoing margin enhancement initiatives.
The company's financial guidance is based on the following assumptions: adjusted gross margins of approximately 62% to 63%; adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of revenues to be approximately 22.5% to 23%; adjusted interest expense of approximately $470 million to $480 million; adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 13% to 14% and adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations assumes full-year adjusted diluted shares outstanding of approximately 224 million shares.
Additionally it is important to note that we expect our 2017 cash tax rate to be in the low single digits as a percentage of adjusted pre-tax income. Our guidance assumes that the Litha divestiture announced today closes in the second quarter of 2017. From a P&L phasing perspective, we also expect approximately 53% of our total enterprise full-year revenue to be realized in the first half of the year, mainly due to the exclusivity period of quetiapine and ezetimibe.
We also expect our gross margin percentage in first quarter 2017 to be broadly in line to slightly below fourth quarter 2016 with meaningful improvement during the course of the year based on the favorable shifts in product mix and increased realization of net savings from our recently completed generics manufacturing and restructuring initiatives. Lastly, we anticipate our first quarter 2017 operating expenses to be largely in line with fourth quarter 2016 due to the timing of certain expenses and as our recently announced corporate and R&D restructuring initiatives begin to yield meaningful savings in the second quarter of this year.
Finally on slide 20, we provide our 2016 actual and 2017 estimated cash flow prior to debt payment. We generated approximately $585 million in cash flow prior to debt payment and repaid approximately $330 million in principal in 2016. Fourth quarter 2016 cash flow prior to debt payment was higher than expected, primarily due to a lower use of cash from changes in working capital and a favorable shift in timing of payments into the mesh qualified settlement funds.

As noted in our press release, we ended the fourth quarter with approximately $517 million in unrestricted cash, approximately $276 million in restricted cash and a net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio of approximately 4.6 times. As we look towards 2017, we expect cash flow prior to debt payment in the range of approximately $200 million to $280 million, and estimate ending net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio to be in the high four times range.
With regards to funding Endo's existing mesh obligations, as of September 30, 2016, approximately $930 million of the mesh liability accrual remained to be paid into qualified settlement funds. In the fourth quarter, Endo paid approximately $240 million into the qualified settlement funds. We expect to pay the remaining balance of approximately $690 million in 2016, with the vast majority being paid in the first half of the year. We did not increase our mesh product liability accrual during the fourth quarter and we believe that the current accrual includes all known claims for which liability is probable and estimatable.
More broadly, we continue to execute our legal strategy of litigating claims that are invalid, for which settlement is not able to be reached, or that are in excess of the maximum claim amounts under our master settlement agreements. I note that we recently received varying levels of information supporting an increase in our estimate from approximately 8,000 to 9,700 filed or asserted claims or claims that we believe are likely to be asserted. We have not accrued for these claims because we lack sufficient information to determine if any potential loss is probable.
I point out that the possibility of additional claims has been disclosed by Endo in multiple public filings, and I reiterate today the potential of other claims to be filed or asserted in the future. It is currently not possible, however, to estimate the number or validity of such claims, and Endo will not speculate in that regard or with respect to the overall outcome of the mesh litigation and its impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. This update will be included in our 2016 Form 10-K, and we will continue to update our disclosures as additional information becomes available.
Now, let me turn it back over to Paul. Paul?
Paul V. Campanelli - Endo International Plc
Thank you, Blaise. Moving to slide 21, I want to reiterate and close with our three key priorities. Our 2017 financial guidance clearly reflects that Endo is entering a period of transition. From a company that grew through debt-fueled M&A to one that will primarily focus on organic growth in driving margin improvement through a new Endo culture focused on operational execution. It will take some time to successfully address the challenges that our company faces today, and it will take time to reposition Endo for long-term success. We are ready and we have already begun to meet these challenges and are very excited about our future.
We have a management team with a track record of success. We have the people, products and pipeline in place that we believe will enable us in time to achieve success and create value for our shareholders. There are several reasons why I believe Endo represents an attractive opportunity for long-term investors.
First, we reshaped the organization and have a new execution-focused culture built for sustainability in the future. And finally, we have and will maintain a highly disciplined approach to capital allocation with a commitment to delever over time that has the potential to create value for equity holders. I remain excited and enthusiastic about the opportunity to be leading the new Endo.
I want to thank all of our employees for their hard work, dedication and commitment to the company. This has not been an easy period for them and I am proud of how they've fully embraced the new Endo culture and priorities. We continue to believe that this is a time of significant opportunity for Endo, our employees, the patients we serve and our shareholders.

That concludes our prepared remarks. Let me now turn the call back over the Steve to manage our question-and-answer period. Steve?
Stephen J. Mock - Endo International Plc

Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. Our first question is from the line of Louise Chen of Guggenheim. Your line is open.
Louise Chen - Guggenheim Securities LLC
Hi. Thanks for taking my questions here. So first question I had here was how we think about sales growth longer term. Just curious, given the fact that you've got some exclusive launches in 2017 and then also Vasostrict is a very big product for you. How do we think about growth in 2018 and beyond and any risk to those sales going forward?
And then the second question I had was on Litha and Somar. Can you confirm whether or not those have been removed from the 2017 guidance? Thanks.
Paul V. Campanelli - Endo International Plc
Okay. So Blaise will start with those.
Blaise Coleman - Endo International Plc
Yeah. So Louise, on your second question, Somar is included in the guidance. Litha is included for essentially the first quarter and then we've removed it.
Paul V. Campanelli - Endo International Plc
And Louise, in terms of how we look at the business on a go-forward basis, unfortunately at this time, we're not going to be able to guide beyond where we are in 2017. We have a series of uncertainties that we, in essence we've got to get through. And when you look at 2017, with the launches of ezetimibe and quetiapine, those are going to be tough comparators as we kind of look out into 2018. So with that, we're just going to have to ask for some patience here and we're just focused on 2017 at this point in time.
Louise Chen - Guggenheim Securities LLC
Okay. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question is from David Amsellem of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.
David A. Amsellem - Piper Jaffray & Co.
Thanks. Wanted to get your thoughts, Paul, on the upcoming panel on OPANA ER, what you make of it, what ultimately do you think is the end game for the FDA and really your level of concern, or how should we be concerned about a potential that the product is removed from the market? Thanks.
Paul V. Campanelli - Endo International Plc
Yeah. So David, I think right now, as you know, there's an Adcom on March 13 and 14. It is, in fact, a joint meeting to discuss the risk and benefit of all oxymorphone products, so it's not just OPANA ER. It includes any generic forms of oxymorphone as well. As you can imagine, Endo's always going to be focused on patient safety. That's a top priority, and we're committed really to provide patients – to have a commitment to provide patients with safe and efficacious products for their intended use. So right now, the Adcom is focused on risk-benefit from abuse, so it's a little bit difficult for us to opine in terms of what the end game is with the FDA. I think at this point in time, what we can say is that our studies to date support the safety and efficacy for the intended use of OPANA. We'll know on March 13 and 14 what the potential outcome is. So really, at this point in time, we're prepared to discuss all aspects of our trials but we're in a wait-and-see game until March 13 and 14.
David A. Amsellem - Piper Jaffray & Co.

Thank you. Our next question is from Elliot Wilbur of Raymond James. Your line is open.
Elliot Wilbur - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Thanks. Good morning. Just two questions on the generic business overall. First, Paul, in your deck, I think it's slide eight, the waterfall chart, you talk about 2017 price erosion sort of a high single-digit impact. And basically what I'm looking for is commentary on the actual rate of price erosion exiting 2016 and then what you have embedded in 2017 in terms of just the pure price erosion metric. Obviously we talked before, base business down 23% year-over-year and then just sort of your earlier commentary that it will be down 30%. Obviously there's a fairly big volume impact included in that as well. Just trying to get a sense of what the actual price erosion on the portfolio may be.

And then secondly, with respect to new product launch expectations, I think you talked about approximately 20 launches. How many of those do you actually have a relatively high degree of visibility on in terms of either specific date-certain patent expiration or a settlement? Obviously, the FDA hasn't been doing...
Paul V. Campanelli - Endo International Plc
Okay.
Elliot Wilbur - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Favors for any companies in terms of specialties, generics. Just want to get a sense of the degree of confidence we can have around that level of launches. Thanks.
Paul V. Campanelli - Endo International Plc
So Elliot, what I'll do is I'll give you some visibility really on the new product launches and Blaise will give you a little bit more color on the base erosion, which has about four components of the composition here.
So moving back to like new product launches, as we say – I'm going to go through this pretty slowly so there's no confusion. When we look at new product launches for 2017, we say we have about 20 products. I would tell that we have a fairly high degree of confidence that those are all products that we will be able to deliver on. Now there's always some degrees of uncertainty, but in this case, when we talk about the 20 products, I have pretty good certitude that we're going to execute and we've already launched a series of products up to this point.
When we look at – maybe I'll put a little color on the value. I think that's probably important. When we look at these 20 new products, the value that we should be looking at is about $100 million dollars of true, pure new product launches from a revenue standpoint. So we want to get that out there. But I think it's also important to talk maybe just a little bit of the carryover for our ZETIA and quetiapine because they're so big contributors to what we're doing.
So when you look at those two products, there's going to be a carryover value of about $360 million of those two products. So you've got $100 million of new product launches, true, pure new product launches, about $360 million of carryover products that are ZETIA and quetiapine, and then you should look at about another $100 million dollars of carryover 2016 products into 2017 that are excluding ZETIA and quetiapine. So that should give you full color on how we're looking at 2017.
Now I'll turn it over to Blaise to give you some color on base erosion.
Blaise Coleman - Endo International Plc
Yeah. Elliot, so just to pick up on your questions, when we think about 2016, in terms of from a price volume standpoint, overall we had about 13% price erosion in that 30%. There's two components of that. There's a normal course sort of price erosion and there's price erosion due to new competitor events. And so for a normal course, it was sort of in the mid-single digits, and then the delta was due to competitor events. When we show it now for 2017, on the slide there you see that 9% price erosion. That's very much our normal course price erosion and included in that is obviously our expectations around some additional pressure from the consortiums through the course of the year. There's another element that's embedded in the other blocks in terms of the competitor events that also has a price element to it. And again that – so from a total price erosion standpoint year-over-year, when you take the normal course and then the impact from competitor events, we would also have that in sort of that low double-digit mid-teen range.
Elliot Wilbur - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay.

Thank you. Our next question is from Marc Goodman of UBS. Your line ...
Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC
So Paul once we get rid of the international business, okay, we understand that's happening. And then should we assume that you're done taking a look at the branded products and that what we see today is what we're going to keep? That's really the first question. Second is, can you just give us a flavor for generic gross margins in the quarter? And then third, that was a great explanation for the previous answer. Is there any way you could tease out just how much the consortiums is adding to the pricing pressure? Is it an extra 2% in the year, 3%? Is there any way you could do that, Paul, just for us to understand? Thanks.

Blaise Coleman - Endo International Plc
High level, Marc, we'd say the consortium pricing pressure's probably adding about 3% to 4% about. About, yeah, that'd be generally. And then Marc, maybe I'll just handle your gross margin question. So our generics gross margin for the segment in fourth quarter 2016 was around 55%.
Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC
Yeah.
Paul V. Campanelli - Endo International Plc
And then, Marc, in terms of the big question really in terms of how we're looking at our businesses, I think we've proven and we've shown that we've taken a lot of action here over the last four or five months here with decisions that we've made on the portfolio on facilities and BELBUCA amongst many other things, and really doing this with a new leadership team that's been in place for really probably three or four months.
As we take a step back and look at our total businesses, your question was specifically on the branded side. I think how we're looking at it is, we are considering optionality across really the entire business. Ultimately, we'll need to do what's right for Endo. We are prepared for success both on the generic side and the branded side. So we are putting resources into R&D both from pure generic play, and obviously we're preparing for success in XIAFLEX. But we also have to keep our optionality open. If we can place Endo in a better position down the line, we would just have to always consider that and I think you would expect that from us as normal course. So that's pretty much where we are. We want to keep our options open.
Marc Goodman - UBS Securities LLC
Thanks.
Paul V. Campanelli - Endo International Plc
Okay. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question is from Randall Stanicky of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Randall S. Stanicky - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Great. Thanks. Paul, I just have a couple of quick follow-ups. If the 4Q generic gross margin was 55%, I think you'd pointed to high 50% for 2017. What's driving that and how does some of this base business erosion factor into that, I guess that increase in margin outlook if that is correct? And then secondly, do we have timing around McKesson, Walmart, the bid cycle there? Can you just provide some comments on expectations? And then I have one really quick follow-up after that.
Paul V. Campanelli - Endo International Plc
Okay. So I would say the gross margins that's driving up into the mid-50s. Now Blaise, I would point to the 505(b)(2)s. I think part of that, as you look at the sterile injectables unit, the margins there are very healthy. We've had success with the potassium liquids and powder product. Adrenaline is another product that we've had great success with. So those are, for the most part, the drivers of positive gross margin.
Blaise Coleman - Endo International Plc
The other thing, I would add, Paul is, Randall, as we mentioned in the slides, we'll see about $75 million of savings related to the generic restructuring. That's an incremental $50 million of savings from what we had in 2016. So that's also contributing heavily to the gross margin favorability. So both the product mix that Paul talked about as well as the cost savings initiatives that we have been driving.
Paul V. Campanelli - Endo International Plc
Yeah. And then in terms of the Claris One impact, right now, I would tell you it's a little hard to totally pinpoint the implementation of Claris One. But I would probably – my instinct is telling me somewhere around Q2, maybe Q3.
Randall S. Stanicky - RBC Capital Markets LLC
And that's built into the 3% to 4% impact that you talked about from consortium pressure?
Paul V. Campanelli - Endo International Plc
Yes. When we talk about base erosion similar in 2017 as 2016, we are including the impact of Claris One.

Randall S. Stanicky - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay, great. And then just one clarification. So we talked about on the mesh side, 8,000 cases last year, earlier in year. Can you just update us? What is that outstanding number now in terms of total outstanding mesh cases, and what's the trend been in terms of settlement, just so that we can try to get some better visibility or a handle around where and what really when that's going to resolve?
Paul V. Campanelli - Endo International Plc
Okay. So, so I'm going to pass it over to Blaise, but you're referring to the 8,000 claims that we've increased to 9,700?
Randall S. Stanicky - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Yeah, maybe Blaise, we can talk a little bit about it.
Blaise Coleman - Endo International Plc
Yeah, so Randall, the 9,700 of the non-NSA claims that we've been filed, asserted or that we believe are likely to be asserted that we haven't accrued for, because we can't assess probability of loss at this time. And there's a number of reasons why that can increase. Some of those, and many of those are outside of our control. It has to do with a number of factors including the receipt of new information, and some of that comes in as the end of the tolling agreements are lifted, which really causes the statute of limitations to begin running and requires claimants to file in order to avoid dismissal. There's also the additional advertising by plaintiff attorneys as well as other factors. So all of those things are contributing to us receiving new information that's really leading to the increase to the 9,700.
Randall S. Stanicky - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay, I mean, you don't expect that to – is that 9,700 kind of where you expect that to max out at or are we still seeing claims coming in?
Blaise Coleman - Endo International Plc
Yeah, I mean, Randall, at this time, we don't have any way to predict that.
Randall S. Stanicky - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay, okay. Thanks a lot guys. It's helpful.
Paul V. Campanelli - Endo International Plc

Thank you. Our next question is from Greg Fraser of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Gregory D. Fraser - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Morning, guys. It's Greg Fraser on for Gregg Gilbert. Thanks for the additional color on how to think about the generics business in 2017. That was helpful. I was wondering if you could comment on how much growth you would expect for the injectables business this year, or is that sort of embedded in the other comments that you made?
Paul V. Campanelli - Endo International Plc
It's embedded. Let's see if we can – just bear with us for a second here. We can give you just a little color on growth.
Blaise Coleman - Endo International Plc
Yeah, in terms of growth, we would expect that to be sort of in the high single-digits to low double-digits growth in 2017 for the overall sterile injectables.
Gregory D. Fraser - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Got it. And then a question on cash flow and the $975 million of cash distributions expected to settle mesh claims in 2017. Will there be a tax refund related to those payments? It wasn't clear.
Blaise Coleman - Endo International Plc
Yeah. So, Greg, the way you should think about modeling cash taxes is not to do it at any specific line item, but do it at an enterprise level. So the guidance we gave is that we anticipate that our cash tax rate will be in the low single-digits as a percentage of pre-tax adjusted net income and that's how we would recommend that you model cash taxes.
Gregory D. Fraser - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Will there be a specific refund related to the...
Blaise Coleman - Endo International Plc
Not specific to that, no.
Gregory D. Fraser - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. And then just last quick one. How do we think about R&D spend for the cellulite study that you're going to be starting in the second half? Thank you.

Paul V. Campanelli - Endo International Plc
Well, we are preparing for success. The actual number is about 30-ish, about $30 million, for the clinical trial portion.
Blaise Coleman - Endo International Plc
In 2017.
Paul V. Campanelli - Endo International Plc
In 2017, for the clinical trial portion of cellulite. Okay? Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Schott of JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Dana C. Flanders - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi. Thanks. This is Dana Flanders on for Chris. Just my first question, can you just talk a little bit more about your outlook for your potassium chloride products? And I know you mentioned the incremental opportunity to gain share on the powder. Maybe you can help frame that. And then what are your assumptions around competition in guidance for 2017 on both the liquid and powder? And then I have a quick follow-up.
Paul V. Campanelli - Endo International Plc
Well, regarding both those products, there's no intellectual property holding anybody back from filing it or launching into those products. So I think you just have to assume that generic competition is able to come back into both the liquid and the powder. That said, anyone filing an ANDA would have to go through the standard regulatory process and you'd have to assume probably about a 24-month review, knowing that these NDAs have been approved for more than a year.
So I just caution you on the longevity. So these products have been approved, I believe since 2014, maybe even 2015. Anybody that would file an ANDA, I would not have visibility to that, because they would be filing paragraph probably two. There's no patents associated with these 505(b)(2)s.
But at this point in time, we have 100% of the liquid market and we have much greater than 50% share in the powder market.
Dana C. Flanders - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Oh, great. Okay, great. And my quick follow-up, just can you talk about the interest expense for 2017? I know that came in I think a little bit higher that what we were expecting. And so just what's the average blended interest rate for the company? And just, I guess, help frame your exposure to rising interest rates. Thank you.
Blaise Coleman - Endo International Plc
Yeah. So that's right. We do – just to remind you, about 45% of our debt is variable base debt and we have factored into our guidance increased, in a rate increased environment, have factored that into our thinking. And that's what's really driving the impact you're seeing year-over-year from a interest expense standpoint.

Paul V. Campanelli - Endo International Plc
Yeah. So, Thomas, thank you. At this point in time, we do have a strategy but we're not going to – at this point in time, it just we're not going to elaborate.

Thank you. Our next question is from Gary Nachman of BMO. Your line is open.
Unknown Speaker
Good morning. This is Nicole (52:11) on the line for Gary. Just going back to XIAFLEX, could you describe the Phase 3 program and are you looking to partner that out, or could you ultimately just mark it out yourself?
Paul V. Campanelli - Endo International Plc

Sure. So in terms of the Phase 2 program, the trial had about 375 patients enrolled in it and just from a very – to try to address the question from a very high level, it utilized a primary endpoint that had what was called a two-point improvement in severity from baseline. So it was a internally developed metric with external consultants, that if you as a patient or clinician had seen more than a two-point improvement from baseline, that that would ultimately provide clarity in terms of the direction of the results. This study is really kind of referred to as a photonumeric cellulite severity scale, and the results were discussed with the FDA probably about two, three weeks ago in our end of Phase 2b discussions with the FDA. That meeting went reasonably well. We're pretty excited, and we are preparing for success as we move into Phase 3.
We try not to get too deep into the results because, ultimately, we want to publish the results of the trial. So stay tuned, but we, again, we're planning for success. We're very excited about the outcome of Phase 2b, and we should be preparing for Phase 3 in the Q4 timeframe.

Hi.

Hi, Liav.
Liav Abraham - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc
Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Firstly, could you please just outline the exact contribution from generic SEROQUEL and ZETIA in 2016 in the fourth quarter? And then secondly, just a question on your path to delevering which is, I understand to be a stated goal. I understand that you don't want to provide specific commentary or timelines on how you get there. But perhaps you can help us think about the pushes and pulls as it relates to cash flows in at least post 2017 as you aim to get to that three to four times range.
Paul V. Campanelli - Endo International Plc
So the exact was what, $208 – yeah. So the exact combined for ezetimibe and quetiapine for Q4 was $293 million, Liav.
Liav Abraham - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc
Thanks.
Paul V. Campanelli - Endo International Plc
Okay. And in terms of the push and pulls, I think at this point in time, we're not – we're just not in the position to give specifics. As I mentioned earlier, we've made tremendous progress in a short period of time, but there still is a degree of uncertainties that we need to get our hands wrapped around. So we're just going to ask from some patience. Clearly it's a primary focus and you can see the moves that we're making to put ourselves in a better position for efficiencies and growing, really at the end of the day, growing EBITDA margins.

Thank you. And now we'll take Andrew Finkelstein's question of Susquehanna. Your line is open.
Andrew Finkelstein - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP
Thanks very much for taking the question. Apologies for the delay. I was just hoping you could talk a little bit more – the slides mention a stocking impact in generics in 4Q. I noticed the generics base was up quarter-on-quarter. So if you could talk a little bit about those dynamics. Second, on potassium, you note the lack of exclusivity but do you have any views on the citizen petition that one of your competitors submitted recently, regarding elemental impurities?

And then, just for the generics business more broadly, are there any pipeline products in particular, that should be a focus for people as opportunities either in the second half of this year or as we go into next year? Thanks.
Paul V. Campanelli - Endo International Plc
Sure. So there's three questions there. I'm going to let Blaise answer your first one.
Blaise Coleman - Endo International Plc
Andrew, just in terms of stocking in Q4 in generic, so if we look at total generics, and we're going to exclude quetiapine and ezetimibe because they're just – we had the major launches. Excluding those two products, the overall stocking in our generics business was around $25 million, and then particularly in the base business in fourth quarter, we saw about $12 million of stocking.
Paul V. Campanelli - Endo International Plc
Okay. And then, Andrew, your question regarding the citizens' petition, we believe that ultimately that citizens' petition's not going to have any impact on our ability to sell in terms of opening up competition. And as I mentioned earlier, there isn't anything stopping anyone from filing an ANDA. So when that occurs and the FDA approves somebody, we'll defend our share, as you would expect, as Par-based product.
Regarding the pipeline focus, I think really if you go back in some of the questions that we – sorry some of the commentary around ephedrine and adrenaline, the fact that the FDA's taken action to take the unapproved sources off the market in several months, that's probably where I would focus my attention to in terms of drivers for 2017, ephedrine and adrenaline.

We have an Orange Book patent and to the best of our knowledge, we believe at this point in time that we have not been noticed from any Paragraph IV filers.

Ken Cacciatore - Cowen & Co. LLC
Hey, thanks guys. Just real quick question. Just looking forward to the cellulite Phase 3, just kind of counting out how long would it take. Sounds like it could be on the market around 2020. So just wondering, can you review for us the XIAFLEX intellectual property, when we should expect you have durability for this product too? Thank you.
Paul V. Campanelli - Endo International Plc
So Ken, your assumptions are in the ballpark in terms of timing, assuming success so I probably wouldn't go any deeper than that. In terms of the intellectual property surrounding XIAFLEX, there are a number of – there's a number of patents that have been granted. I would say most notably, there's a 560 patent that expires in 2026, but on top of that, as you would expect, our team is working towards additional patents for end market as well as potential future indication, so work in progress. And then, just keep in mind that it is a BLA and with that comes a series of de facto challenges. This is not something that is easily developed, so we're pretty excited about potential indications and – okay. Okay. All right.

Stephen J. Mock - Endo International Plc
All right. That concludes the Q&A session.
Paul V. Campanelli - Endo International Plc
Okay. So with that, thank you, Steve. As I said, this is a important time for Endo. We appreciate your continued interest and support of the company, and we look forward to providing you with updates as we move forward. Thank you all for joining us in the call today. Thank you, and good bye.

Why Endo International plc (ENDP) Shares Could Remain Range-Bound
 
 Jason Cohen, Editor-July 24, 2017, 3:15 PM EDT

SHARE ON:





 


 


In a research report released Monday, Oppenheimer analyst Derek Archila reiterated a Perform rating on shares of Endo International plc (NASDAQ:ENDP), while estimating fair value of $12-$14 per share. The analyst explained why the stock could remain range-bound in the near to medium term. (To watch Archila’s track record, click here)
Archila wrote, “Our recent analysis of ENDP’s additional unfunded mesh liability and discussion with a legal expert familiar with mass tort/product liability defense ligation supports our view ENDP will remain highly levered (in the 4s) and the company’s turnaround will take several years. While we view any of our potential settlement scenarios for the company’s additional unfunded mesh liability to be manageable, we believe continued pricing pressure in ENDP’s US generics base business, need for additional advertising and promotion spend to support Xiaflex growth and inability to grow through meaningful acquisitions leave ENDP little room for error.”
“Ultimately our estimated mesh liability for ENDP’s additional claims would represent a negative ~$1-2/share impact on our DCF […] We believe shares will remain range-bound until we see the generic pricing environment improve and progress on de-levering its balance sheet.”
Out of the 13 analysts polled in the past 3 months, 3 are bullish on ENDO stock, while 10 remain sidelined. With a return potential of 26%, the stock’s consensus target price stands at $14.64.

Acquisitions[edit]
In 2009, Endo bought Indevus Pharmaceuticals to diversify into endocrinology and oncology.[2] The company entered the male hypogonadism market later in 2010 with Fortesta 2% gel.[2]
In November 2013, Endo agreed to purchase Paladin Labs Inc for about $1.6 billion to gain access to the Canadian market as well as expand into emerging markets.[3][4]
In October 2014, Endo said it would buy Auxilium Pharmaceuticals for $2.6 billion.[5]
In 2015, Endo acquired the specialty generics and sterile injectables company Par Pharmaceutical for $8.05 billion.[6]
Acquisition attempts[edit]
In early 2014, Endo sought to acquire NuPathe, a speciality pharmaceutical developer, for US$105,000,000.[7] However, Teva prevailed in this acquisition with a substantially higher bid.[8]
