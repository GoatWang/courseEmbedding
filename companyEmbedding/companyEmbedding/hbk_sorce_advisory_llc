Dean Piccirillo is a principal, senior financial advisor and client service team director advising HBKS Wealth Advisors clients in the firms Fort Myers and Sarasota, Florida offices. Additionally, Mr. Piccirillo continues to work with a number of families out of the firms offices in his hometown of Erie, Pennsylvania. Mr. Piccirillo directs and works closely with several licensed, credentialed professionals on his client service team to help these high net-worth clients and their families manage their assets and organize their finances to meet their long-term objectives.
In addition to Mr. Piccirillos ongoing consultation work with affluent families, he also directs the HBKS Wealth Advisors Retirement Plan Unit which provides investment consulting services for dozens of corporate, nonprofit and municipal retirement plans. Services offered by this unit include investment advice, monitoring and due diligence for the plans designated investment alternatives, investment education and counseling for plan participants, fee benchmarking services and a variety of other pension consulting services.
Mr. Piccirillo began his career in financial services in 1989 in Erie, Pennsylvania with American Express Financial Advisors. At American Express, he worked as an advisor in the firms Advanced Planner Group before joining The Sorce Financial Group, Inc. in 1995.

This 2001 merger resulted in the creation of HBK Sorce Financial LLC, the predecessor of the firm now known as HBKS Wealth Advisors LLC. In 2007, Mr. Piccirillo returned his attention to working full-time with personal, corporate and institutional clients.
Mr. Piccirillo brings a vast range of experience and expertise to his work helping clients grow and preserve their wealth. His more than 25 years of experience as an advisor to affluent families and business owners along with the leadership and supervisory roles he has held with his firm make him uniquely qualified to advise clients on wealth management, retirement planning, estate planning and business succession matters.

He also holds the Accredited Investment Fiduciary Analyst certification.

Joseph Kloecker offers his clients broad financial expertise amassed over more than 35 years  as a senior financial accounting officer in a large bank and as a financial planning and wealth management professional. Mr. Kloecker has an MBA and is also a CPA. Based in the Erie, Pennsylvania office of HBKS® Wealth Advisors (HBKS), he works exclusively with his clients, many of whom he has known for years through his extensive experience as senior vice president and controller of Northwest Pennsylvanias largest bank and through his varied and significant service to the community in a volunteer capacity.
Upon graduating from Gannon University, he began his accounting career in a staff accounting position at Marine Bank, which ultimately merged with PNC Bank. Marine Bank was the first bank acquired by PNC in the initial phase of deregulation of the banking industry in Pennsylvania. Mr. Kloecker served in a senior capacity for 20 years and was instrumental in the transition to PNC both at the local level and at the PNC Corporate Accounting level. In 1996, he left the bank to join The Sorce Financial Group, now HBKS Wealth Advisors since the firms merger with Hill, Barth & King, LLC, in 2001.
As a senior financial advisor, Mr. Kloecker works holistically with clients helping them preserve and grow wealth, developing investment and wealth protection plans that meet their financial goals and achieve the objectives for themselves and their families provided for by that wealth. His client base is characterized by long-term collaborative relationships. Most of his clients are business people in or near retirement and their families, including many colleagues from his banking days as well as clients introduced to him by HBKS Partners and Staff.
As a CPA, Mr. Kloecker brings a culture of attention to detail and a facility with the complex financial issues that are common to the finances of higher net-worth individuals and their families. He combines the analytical skills gained through his vast depth and breadth of experience with a commitment to personal financial planning and effective client communication and service. As HBKS Wealth Advisors is an independent Registered Investment Advisory firm, Mr. Kloecker and his colleagues provide independent and objective direction to clients.
Mr. Kloecker earned a B.S. in Accounting and an M.B.A. from Gannon University. He has always been very active in the local community, serving in leadership positions for a wide variety of professional and nonprofit organizations.

As principal of HBKS, Mr. Sorce collaborates with the firms partners and senior financial advisors to plan the firms strategic direction. As a senior financial advisor, he leads a team of HBKS licensed advisors and administrators working directly with clients in Pennsylvania, Florida and across the country to plot their financial course and help them achieve their financial objectives.
Mr. Sorce began his career in financial services in 1982 as an advisor with Investor Diversified Services in his hometown of Erie, Penn., where his father had been providing financial advice to Western Pennsylvanians since 1950. He continued with the firm, which was acquired by American Express Financial Group, until 1995, when he and his brother, Christopher N. Sorce, CFP®, also with American Express Financial Group, purchased an historic building in downtown Erie and established their own financial advisory firm. Over the next five years, Mr. Sorce served as president, chief compliance officer and managing principal of HBKS Wealth Advisors, which distinguished itself for an exhaustive planning process and subsequent investment counsel independent of the proprietary product-driven approach typical of large institutional firms.
As developing a sound financial plan for their clients required collaboration with other professional advisors, in particular CPAs, whose direction was critical in addressing the ubiquitous tax ramifications associated with planning and investing, Mr. Sorce spearheaded the Sorce Financial Group merger in 2000 with HBK CPAs & Consultants, one of the nations largest and most prestigious accounting firms. Mr. Sorce is a founding principal and senior financial advisor for the resulting HBKS Wealth Advisors, and continues his work with clients out of his offices in Erie and Pittsburgh.
Widely recognized for his expertise in financial planning and investing, Mr. Sorce is frequently called upon by Pittsburgh and Erie media for insights on local and national financial matters. He hosted the weekly radio call-in show, Money Matters for four years for WLKK-AM and the nightly Money Matters news segment for Eries CBS-affiliate television station. 
Mr. Sorce received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Boston University in 1977, his Certified Financial Planner designation in 1987 from the College for Financial Planning, and his Masters in Financial Services from The American College in 2007. He is active in his professional and local communities, a member of the Financial Planning Association, and past chairman of the St. Vincent Hospital Foundation and past member of the board of directors of Saint Vincent Hospital. He has served on numerous boards throughout his career.

Tax Loss Harvesting: Turning Losses into Gains
01/20/2016  |  Matthew Costigan, CFP®, CPA/PFS
Sometimes even stocks that lose value can make you money. Or at least save you money in the form of very real tax savings.
As a CPA as well as a financial advisor, I look at investing from several different perspectives with the overall goal of enhancing bottom-line returns for my clients. One of the most significant opportunities comes as the year-end approaches and I immerse myself in the art and science of tax planning.
Most people with an investment portfolio find at year-end a substantial tax burden due to realized gains, be they short or long-term gains. Realized gains dont add to the value of your portfolio or put cash in your pocket, but they are nonetheless real, and more importantly, taxable at up to 39.6 percent. They come in several varieties, but the two most frequently encountered are gains from stocks that rose in value during the year and were sold at a profit over the investment cost, and distributions from mutual funds, which almost all mutual funds make at the end of each year.
Realized gains are an annual ritual, even in years when the overall value of your portfolio declines. But even in years when your portfolio has soared, there are always going to be some stocks or mutual funds that decline in value. You might consider these losers, but they also provide opportunities to offset or at least diminish the tax impact of your gains. Here are a few:
Sell off your losses. This is the most simplistic solution. We look for stocks or mutual funds we can sell at losses to offset the winners dollar for dollar. We can buy the same investments back at a later date, but you might also use the opportunity to reposition your portfolio to some extent. Buy-backs must accommodate the IRSs wash-sale rule. Typically, you have to wait 31 days, 61 in some instances, to take the loss. Sometimes you can get around the wash-sale rule by using an ETF to make a tax swap, such as an ETF for a stock or mutual fund, or for another ETF if the two are linked to different indexes.
Sell off more of your losses. You can deduct up to $3,000 of capital losses from other, non-investment income, your ordinary income. And if you can zero out your taxable income and have losses left over, you can carry them forward to offset capital gains or ordinary income the following year.
Have your gains and pay no taxes. If you are in a 15 percent or lower tax bracket, including your capital gains, IRS statutes forgive all taxes on long-term capital gains. Thats right: zero federal tax on your long-term capital gains.
Employing this strategy requires care, because the gains you take might impact other deductions, like healthcare expenditures. Its another aspect of our HBKS tax planning process.
So-called tax loss harvesting is not always the best way to deal with capital gains. You might not want to disturb the balance of your portfolio, even for 31 days. Or you might miss a rally in the issues that you are harvesting losses from. Regardless, from choosing investments to selling investments, decisions should always be made with an eye to your individual bottom-line value, and that always involves considering the tax implications.

Why We Dont Make Market Predictions
01/12/2016  |  Brian Sommers, CFA & Christopher N. Sorce, CFP®

History has shown that it is nearly impossible to determine what the numbers will be tomorrow much less next month or next year.
We are often asked where we believe a certain market or economic indicator is headed. Stocks, bonds, interest rates or Gross Domestic Product — no one can consistently and accurately predict what the future will bring, including the “renowned experts” who want us to believe otherwise. The fact is, history has shown that it is nearly impossible to determine what the numbers will be tomorrow much less next month or next year.
While we understand the desire for forecasts that purport to say where, for example, stocks will be by the end of this year, such predictions, at best, provide only a false sense of certainty. At worst they can do severe damage to an investors long-term financial objectives.
To illustrate the point, look how some infamous recent predictions fared:

Legendary Vanguard founder Jack Bogle should have known better. He has often stated that no one knows where the market is headed. Still, in an interview with Forbes magazine, he said he expected average returns in the domestic stock market to be “about 5 percent annually” from 1999 to 2009. The S&P 500 Index was actually down about 1 percent annually over that decade.
According to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, during testimony on March 28, 2007, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said: “The impact on the broader economy and financial markets of the problems in the subprime market seems likely to be contained.” Then Bernanke told the House Financial Services Committee in July 2008 that “the GSEs (Government-Sponsored Enterprises) are adequately capitalized. They are in no danger of failing.” Of course, neither of these statements turned out to be accurate and the nation suffered the worst financial meltdown since the Great Depression.
On October 6th of 2008 Jim Cramer while live on the “TODAY” television show, said: “I thought about this all weekend. I do not want to say these things on TV. Whatever money you may need for the next five years, please take it out of the stock market right now, this week. I do not believe that you should risk those assets in the stock market right now.” If an investor sold out of an S&P 500 Index fund the next day, he or she would have missed out on a rebound of 79 percent over the next five years.
On March 19 2015, while on CNBCs “Squawk Box”, entrepreneur T. Boone Pickens predicted the price of a barrel of oil would rebound to $70 by the end of the year. The barrel price of Crude Oil ended 2015 at $37.

These are just a few examples of recognized experts making predictions that turn out to be drastically wrong. There are many, many more; even the people who make their living forecasting markets are usually wrong.
In January of each year CNN/Money conducts a survey of 30- to 40 investment strategists and money managers to gauge what they believe the performance of the S&P 500 Index will be that year. Here are the results for the past five years, along with the actual performance of the S&P 500 Index for each year:

The investment strategists and money managers missed the mark by an average of about 12 percent per year. The largest miss came in 2013. In January of that year many investors were very nervous about the prospects for stocks. There were concerns about the high valuation of the stock market, the potential for inflation to heat up, the level of debt the U. S. government had accumulated due to loose monetary policies after the financial crisis, the European sovereign debt crisis and slower growth in emerging markets. Yet the S&P 500 Index rocketed over 32 percent higher.
This is not to say those of us in the investment community lack intelligence. The world in which we live is just highly unpredictable. The HBKS investment team recognizes that in a highly unpredictable environment, it is foolish to predict. Instead, we focus on what we can reasonably expect. We can reasonably expect a certain level of dividends and interest income. We can reasonably expect the stock market to trend upward over the long term.
By focusing on what we can reasonably expect, HBKS Wealth Advisors does not rely on near-term market forecasting in managing client portfolios. Our solution is to develop with each one of our clients a prudent, globally diversified asset allocation designed for the long term. With the targeted asset allocation determined, we can view bouts of volatility as opportunities to rebalance the asset allocation back to our targets.
During periods of market stress, our advice is to stay the course and focus on the long term. Instead of obsessing over the daily news, we believe substantial movement up or down in an asset class can be an opportunity to rebalance your portfolio to take advantage of the eventual move in the opposite direction.
Income, diversification, asset allocation and rebalancing might lack the excitement of the predictions of the so-called experts. But focusing on reasonable expectations and long-term performance seems to us a better approach than trying to guess which turn the markets will take next.
