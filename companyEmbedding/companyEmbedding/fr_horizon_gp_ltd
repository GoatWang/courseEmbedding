Competition and Markets Authority cases






FR Horizon GP Ltd / CHC Helicopter Corporation









From:

Competition and Markets Authority

Published:
3 April 2008
Closed:

              3 April 2008

          
Case type:

Mergers

Case state:

Closed

Market sector:

Transport

Outcome:

Mergers - phase 1 clearance






    OFT closed case: Anticipated acquisition by FR Horizon GP Limited of CHC Helicopter Corporation.
  






Affected market: Helicopter services
No. ME/3575/08
The OFT’s decision on reference under section 33(1) given
on 3 April 2008. Full text of decision published 21 April 2008.
PARTIES
FR Horizon GP Limited (First Reserve) is the controlling company of
a private equity fund advised by First Reserve Corporation: an
investment company focused on the energy industry.
CHC Helicopter Corporation (CHC) is a Canadian company whose shares
are listed on the Toronto and New York stock exchanges. It is one of the
world's largest providers of helicopter services to the global offshore
oil and gas industry.
TRANSACTION
First Reserve - through a Canadian subsidiary, 6922767 Canada, Inc - is
proposing to acquire all the shares in CHC.
JURISDICTION
As a result of this transaction First Reserve and CHC would cease to be
distinct. Given that CHC’s UK turnover exceeds £70 million, the
turnover test in section 23(1)(b) of the Enterprise Act 2002 (the Act)
is consequently satisfied. The OFT therefore believes that it is or may
be the case that arrangements are in progress or in contemplation which,
if carried into effect, will result in the creation of a relevant merger
situation.
The notifying parties submitted a Merger Notice to the OFT on 7 March
2008 and the deadline for a decision is 8 April 2008.
ASSESSMENT
Having consulted customers and competitors as to the nature and scope of
the merging parties’ businesses, the OFT considers, on the basis of the
evidence before it, that there is no horizontal overlap between the
activities of the parties, that there are no vertical links between
them, and that there is also no risk of any conglomerate effects
arising.
Consequently, the OFT does not believe that it is or may be the case
that the merger may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of
competition within a market or markets in the United Kingdom.
DECISION
This merger will therefore not be referred to the Competition Commission
under section 33(1) of the Act.

Guitars from Amazon.comThere’s nothing like new gear to help you get excited about making music. Guitars that want to be picked up and played will motivate you to learn licks faster, write riffs better, and become a more creative musician. If you’re fingering your first chords, or recording your follow up album, your guitars and amps should inspire you to practice and play at your best.From dreadnoughts to parlors, you’ll find acoustic guitars in a huge variety of styles at Amazon.com. We carry popular brands like Martin, Taylor, and Takamine, so no matter what look and feel you’re going for, there’s an acoustic to suit your style. Our product filters can help you track down the perfect instrument. Browse guitars by brand, layout, and even top, back, or neck woods. For warm, folky sounds, many players prefer mahogany, while maple has a brighter, punchy tone. From Chuck Berry to Jack white, electric guitar has been the backbone of rock and roll for decades. Legendary guitars like the Gibson Les Paul and Fender Stratocaster have appeared on countless #1 records, and remain a popular choice today. The variety of options for electric guitars is practically endless. Humbuckers, single coils, Floyd Rose tremolos, and dozens of other features mean there’s an instrument fit for every player. We make it easy to find guitars you’re interested in. Choose the brands, features, and colors you’re interested in, and we’ll show you guitars that match your criteria.All the amplifiers and accessories you need to get the most out of your tone are available at Amazon.com. Our range of amp selection, from 5-watt practice amps and all-tube amps to 100-watt full stacks and everything in between, will have you strumming and shredding to your heart’s content. Whether you’re after a gritty, British tone, or a clean and sparkly American shimmer, we’ve got amps from popular brands like Marshall, Vox, and Fender to help you find the perfect sound. For new guitar players and old pros alike, the excitement of trying out new gear can motivate you creatively and technically. Explore your tone, style, and imagination with guitars and guitar accessories that make you want to grow as a player.

ESP Horizon FR-7 overview




1Description







Styled in a black finish, the E-II Horizon FR-7 is a seven-string electric guitar from ESP featuring an alder body and a sleek, double-cutaway design. Its three-piece maple neck, fashioned in the neck-through-body style, has a 25.5" scale and is fitted with an ebony fingerboard and 24 extra-jumbo frets. The strings are secured by a set of Gotoh locking tuners, along with a Floyd Rose Original locking tremolo bridge.  As for electronics, this Horizon is outfitted with dual EMG 707 humbucking pickups, which provide a balanced and articulate upper register with rich harmonics, and a tight, beefy low-end response for chugging chords and scorching lead breaks. A three-way pickup selector switch, volume knob, and a shared tone knob give you full control over the electronics' various timbres.  Also, with its included hardshell case, you'll be able to take this handsome axe with you wherever you may roam.
