MagicJack Plus Review by WhichVoIP
This section provides an overall summary of our review of the magicJack Plus phone service. Scroll down to read the complete review, including ordering, installation, using the service and returning.
The Good
The magicJack Plus is very simple to acquire, setup and also has three (3) different ways to utilize the service (computer, home phone, and mobile). The biggest plus is the low cost of service, a fraction of a typical landline cost. This device and service lends itself very well for a cheap second line or for people who are not that reliant on a home phone line (e.g. someone who uses their cell phone for most conversations).
The Bad
There is no customer support to call if you have issues but they do have online chat and a knowledgebase. This would be more of a concern for less tech savvy people who like the comfort of knowing that help is just a phone call away. The feature set is minimal compared with other VoIP services available. There are also a few annoying points with the magicJack mobile application.
The Bottom Line

Cost: $39.95 for the magicJack Plus device which includes 6 months free phone service.
Service Plans: Monthly plan costs $5 per month, 6 
			month plan costs $20 every 6 months, 1 year plan costs $35 
			per year and their 5 year plan costs $120 every 5 years.
Extra fees apply for some features (e.g. porting your number) plus applicable regulatory fees and taxes.
Extra fees apply for certain national area codes plus international calling.
MagicJack Go is now available and comes with 1 year 
			of free service included for an up front cost of $59.95

Overall Thoughts
Overlooking the nuances about the magicJack Plus, it is actually quite a neat product. Setting up the device is a little obnoxious but after you survive the deluge of ads, what lies beneath is an acceptable calling solution. Worth considering if you are comfortable with technology and cost is a major driving factor over anything else.

Introduction
A lot of easy-to-use VoIP calling solutions have made their way to the market. A variety of solutions have surfaced both as an attempt to meet the needs of the everyday consumer as well as enterprises. These simple devices and applications allow people with an Internet connection the ability to make a voice call without an actual landline. One very low cost solution is the magicJack Plus.
MagicJack first hit the market in 2007. The original version was a small USB device that plugged directly into a Personal Computer (PC) and allowed a standard telephone to be plugged into the device. It utilizes Voice over IP (VoIP) technology, allowing users to make internet-based phone calls. MagicJack Plus was introduced in 2011 to remove the requirement of connecting directly to a PC, instead connecting directly to an available internet port (modem, router etc).
The company behind the MagicJack products is YMAX Communications Corporation, who provide the transfer of the phone calls made with these products. Many people have heard of MagicJack as it is promoted through commercials on television. It is a very low cost option, with a small annual charge, for making unlimited calls in USA and Canada (note that certain fee type codes and some area codes may require prepaid minutes to be purchased though). A 30-day money back guarantee is offered for those who want to try it out with no risk.
We decided to take the magicJack Plus for a test drive to see how it performs, including ordering, setting up, using it, trying customer support and returning the device.
Ordering the magicJack Plus
Though you can find the magicJack Plus in many consumer electronics stores, we went ahead and purchased the device through the company's website. We selected the expedited shipping option for an additional $8.95 so the device would arrive between 3 to 5 business days. However, the device arrived 9 days (7 business days) after ordering, causing us to deduct a star.
If you are someone who is easily offended by "up selling" tactics, I would avoid ordering the device online. After you register for your free trial, magicJack bombards you with a deluge of add-ons for your order. Some of the offers do make some sense though if you were planning on keeping the service. However, it still feels like a high pressure sales situation so we knocked a star off for these tactics. The below image shows an example of some of the ads.

The cost for the magicJack Plus device is $49.95 and this includes six (6) months of service free (unlimited calling to the USA and Canada). They also promote a 30 day money back guarantee, excluding shipping fees. Like any phone solution, VoIP or landline, additional fees apply to make international calls. Unless you are calling another magicJack subscriber, you are subject to certain fees for numbers outside of the coverage area (including some national area codes). Fortunately, their rates are fairly low (it differs by country.) These fees can only be circumvented if a person you are calling in another country is also using magicJack. If you're really trying to beat the system, you can also assign a local number to a unit and send it to someone over seas.
Here is an image of the package once it arrived.

Installing the magicJack Plus
There are three (3) main ways that the magicJack Plus device and service can be used, as follows. However, option 1 below is required to configure your service before you can make phone calls.

You can connect the device directly to a computer via the USB connector. In this scenario you can use what is known as a "softphone" application, which includes a piece of software that turns your computer into your phone dialer. You will then need a headset, or separate microphone and speaker set to make calls. You can also plug any analog, touchtone phone to the device for a more authentic experience.
The magicJack Plus device can plug directly into your Internet modem or router, which is the easiest way to use the device if you want to use a regular phone. For various set-up options with your home network we recommend reading our set-up article.
There is a free mobile application (App) available on Google Play and Apple App Store which gives users a highly mobile option to use the service as it can function on 3G or higher networks or over Wi-Fi connections. Perfect for modern day smartphones.

No matter how you use it, you have the ability to access voicemail. Fortunately, you don't have to fine tune anything (nor do you have the ability) as you simply plug in the device, provide requested information and you're good to go. Next, lets look at the different ways to use it as introduced above.
1) Using the magicJack Plus with a computer
Installation can be a pain point for some users who are not technology comfortable so we will walk through this. The device utilizes a USB 2.0 connection to interface with a computer. Since Windows commands a majority of operating systems in the market, we installed and tested the device on a computer utilizing the Windows 7 64 bit operating system.
When you plug the magicJack into a USB port on your computer the driver automatically installs. One quick note here is that the device includes two additional USB ports which can be very useful as the device depth means it can cover multiple ports on your computer device. If you have not already registered the device you will need to now. You have to work through a few web forms to setup the device and register a valid phone number. Be prepared: the same offers you encounter when ordering the device come back for a second round of promotional assault. The below image shows the device connected to one of our laptops.

You can request an area code for anywhere in the US or Canada which is a free feature of magicJack Plus. Additionally, it is possible to port an existing number to the service or you can optionally create a vanity number (subject to availability, of course) both for an additional fee of $20 plus $10 a year annually. Note: we typically recommend not porting your existing phone number initially until at least you have used the service and are happy with it. We recommend this for any VoIP service you may be considering. Once you have named your device, selected a valid number and shuffled through all the promo's, you are ready to make calls. The below image shows the phone dialer on the computer screen.

The magicJack application you see above is the softphone you can utilize to initiate phone calls. If you dont have a phone connected to the device then you will need a headset or microphone/speakers combo as mentioned previously. Just like every phone since the rotary phone went to the wayside, you will see a familiar number layout. You use this dialpad to dial the phone number you want to call and click on the "send" button. To end the call you simply click on the "end" button.
You can also connect your existing home phone to the magicJack Plus device in this configuration. Connecting a phone to the device is just as simple as connecting a phone to any other RJ-11 socket in your home or business. If you're using an actual phone, you can also use it's number pad like any other phone, just pick it up and dial the number you want to call. We made a few test calls with this set up and found the sound quality as good as a landline, with no noticeable hum, echo, or static noises in the background.
Depending on how you plan on using the magicJack device, this option works OK but it is somewhat clunky and space consuming, especially when using a laptop. It also requires the computer device to be on and running for the phone service to work. Fortunately, the Plus device includes other ways to use the service as well.
2) Using magicJack Plus with your router
Another way to use the magicJack Plus is by plugging the device directly into an Internet modem or a router Internet port. The device includes an adaptor for the USB connector to plug into a 120V mains socket to power the Plus device (similar to a smartphone power adaptor). Your analog phone will plug into the RJ-11 port just like when using the device with a computer. Then you will use the phone in the same way as if it were a landline. The below images shows the magicJack Plus device connected to a mains outlet and then a cable connected to a router and a cable connected to the phone (3 connections in total).

The device will protrude if connecting directly to a mains outlet, so it is best to avoid plugging it into a socket in a high traffic area. Alternatively, the device does include a USB-power extension cable. This setup is likely the most commonly used. However, when performing an initial setup it is probably simpler to start with the device connected directly to your computer and then move to this setup once complete.
We recommend setting up 911 service as soon as you can, which must be configured through a separate verification process, especially if this will be your main home number.
3) The magicJack smartphone application
This magicJack application is one more way you can utilize this service. For someone with limited minutes on a carrier plan, this is the perfect way to add virtually unlimited minutes to your cell calling plan. It works over both Wi-Fi and 3G or higher mobile data networks. The image below gives you an idea of what the app looks like on a smartphone.

Though the magicJack application is a great a value add-on, we did notice a couple of minor issues we should mention. The first one was that when going to download the app the icon presented is a green square with the words "Talk Free" in white. This App icon looks nothing like the rest of their branding and we almost didn't download the App as we were not sure it was truly for magicJack.
The second issue we encountered with the application has to do with the contact integration. For Android, after selecting a contact in the magicJack application, you are taken to the actual phone's contact database. If you attempt to make a call from here, you will simply utilize your actual phone and not the magicJack application (so using your phone minutes rather than free calling). Many VoIP App's, for example Skype, integrate further into the Android OS such that they appear in a prompt that allows you to select your phone, Skype or another application to call the number you select - magicJack does not.
Though the magicJack app has some flaws, it is a nice add-on feature and does work for making phone calls. The sound quality was no worse than a typical phone call made from your cell phone. The 4G network in the area where we tested the phone App is very good so that would have helped.
Features of the magicJack Plus
As a VoIP product and service, the magicJack Plus is considerably light on features. The included call features are voicemail, caller ID, call forwarding and call waiting. They do also boast free 411 calling. However, these are basic features when compared to many other VoIP services available today (some with 40+ features). As mentioned previously they do allow number porting, but at an additional fee to switch ($20) and then annually to maintain ($10). A fee for porting your existing number is common though (due to "paperwork" involved).
Customer Service
The customer service options are detailed in the tabbed section above titled "Customer Support". This is a very low cost service so it's not surprising that there is NO phone support. They do have a knowledgebase on their website which includes some "how-to" videos and frequently asked questions, as well as a live chat option.
We reached out to magicJack's tech support with a hypothetical issue that we considered uncommon to test out the persons knowledge. Here is the live chat:

This is the meat of the conversation - the rest of the unseen messages primarily consist of profuse appreciative statements from the live chat person. We were also presented with a link to claim a 5 year contract extension for a grand total of about $70. In a nutshell, the live chat person was able to provide an answer even though it was a somewhat obscure request. This is just an example and of course does not cover all scenarios so is not necessarily a true representation of their support as a whole.
Final Thoughts
The only remaining item to test was returning the device. This can be an important step for those who decide it is not for them during the trial period. Returning the product was straight forward and simple we are glad to say. It consisted of entering in a little information, confirming that indeed we wanted to cancel and then getting an RMA authorization to include in the return shipment.
Overall, we had a positive experience with the magicJack Plus device and phone service. The sound quality was acceptable during our testing, although it must be noted we have a high quality Internet connection. The main strength and attraction is quite clearly the low cost. If cost is your only priority then this service is worth considering. The weaknesses include no customer service phone line and the reduced feature set compared with typical VoIP services in the market today. There are also some quirks with the mobile App, although it is a nice feature to have and does work.
Based on it's low cost we would certainly recommend this device to anyone who was looking for a second phone line that was not for critical use. If you are considering this option for your main home phone line then we recommend you consider what is important to you most (cost, customer service, features etc) and to also look through the user submitted reviews before making your decision.



magicJack Overview
From the over 70 user submitted reviews below since 2008 you can see a mixed reaction of experiences. One of the biggest complaints is related to customer service, which is only available through live chat on the website (click on the customer service tab for more information). However, for the very low annual fee its hard to see how CS could be extended without adding more cost to the end user. Overall, the user's average rating is "OK". Please browse through the reviews below or add your own based on your experience.
...Overall, the service is at a good price. Customer service is at the bottom of any telecom service I have used so far...
...Very happy with it for the price, but if you don't have the patience or minimum knowledge to connect it reliably, I would recommend something easier with better customer service....

I have been without a phone for five (5) days,and two days ago I talked to so many people that could not 
fix my telephone under Volume/Headset controls.  I tried to 
explain what was wrong but the individuals I spoke to were unable to understand what I was saying or said 
they couldn't fix it. I am furious at this point. I wrote an email to the manager but have not received a reply.

I love MagicJack!
Pro: It is a great service for a little bit of money!
Con: This is BIG!  For some reason, MagicJack does not support NOMOROBO!  It is a service that works!  MagicJack does nothing to help with scam 
calls!  If they can't block them through their own service, why not allow Nomorobo to do it for them!  Come on, help us to stop these 
annoying phone calls!  Even our cable provider offered assistance!

I have three magic jacks that I located in three separate properties.  The first 
issue I encountered is that each had to have its own email address and had to be 
associated to a separate computer or laptop.  My main device started acting up 
about 3 months ago, I had to pay about $9 each time to replace the adaptor.  Only 
two weeks and bad again.  MJ wants to sell me an upgrade instead of replace or 
allow me to use a device I no longer use, but with my home number.  Too 
inflexible on cleaning any of these issues up.  Want to sell me more when I 
already have plenty - they just wont let me use it!  Each time it acts up, no one 
can call in and it can be days before you know it, goes to VM.  Not recommended 
to do business with this company until they improve support and attitude toward 
their customers.

MagicJack Plus STATIC; Customer Service Useless

I have been using MagicJack then
MagicJack Plus
for around 3 years now. The past
6 months the STATIC
on all calls (in and
out) is horrendous.
You cannot hear almost
anything, except
STATIC. Wasted hours
on-line with
MagicJack's customer
service quite a few
times. A bunch of
idiots! After 1 hour
I'm always told "Let
me get you to a
higher-up tech rep".
So why'd they waste
my time for an hour?
Looking to change
phone provider right
now. MagicJack is
probably the most
inexpensive phone
service but the
aggravation and lost
calls and STATIC makes it
not worth the
savings.

I have had MJ+ for a few years and had no problems. It is plugged into the wall, with a phone by it, and 
an extension phone in another room.  It works as well as the land line and message recorder it replaced. 
At setup, I had to deal with typing and waiting for customer service to answer my questions, but I haven't 
had to deal with that since it was set up, so that doesn't bother me.  I did not have trouble with 
customer service, but without voice service, I can't give them the best rating. If you don't know the 
least thing about computers or electronics, or just don't want to fiddle with it,  you probably need to 
search for a service with a person you can actually talk to. For the rest, you can deal easily enough with 
MJ. I like it because it works well, sounds good and is economical!

I have been using MagicJack for 6 years.  The price of the service is right, really right.  Over the years 
MagicJack service has improved.  In the past there were many rural-area phone systems which did not accept 
MagicJack calls.  Now it appears that I can use MagicJack everywhere.  When I use it with some people 
their voice appears to be a little weak.  With others the volume is fine.  One thing to note, if you have 
decent WIFI service you can call the US from anywhere in the world, free.  I have used my MagicJack from France 
and Central America.  The MagicJack support system is a little spartan, but eventually they have solved my 
problems, and the price is a real bargain.

I had to cancel because Magicjack does not support Nomorobo. If you are plagued by telemarketers, you MUST have 
Nomorobo. It started the day I started Magicjack phone service. I quit, and went to Phone Power and literally the same day the 
calls stopped right after I setup Nomorobo. So, you get what you pay for. Phone power is about $9 month versus $5 for Magicjack.

I would recommend it for low use landline and not very important phone line. They need to work on the 
cellphone application to integrate it to the current smart phones. There is a delay in the connection, 
and if you don't have the app open, you'll probably miss the call. As far as texting, the delay is even 
worse. If someone sends you 2 parts text, the shortest text will arrive first regardless of the order it 
was sent. If someone sends an email address, the second part @xxxx.com never arrives! Only the first 
part before the @ sign. The voice calls are good ONLY if you are in a WiFi area with full reception!

5 year plan expired. Results

My 5 year subscription expired
a few months ago,
03/2016. Up until
that point, my
MagicJack was used
only for making long
distance calls.
Clarity was as good
as calling my next
door neighbor, and
the person on the
other end couldn't
tell the difference
between this service
and my land line.
During my
subscription I had
no need for customer
service, other than
assigning me a
phone
number. Service was
straight forward,
and results were
favorable. 
  
I have been shopping
around for (MJ)
renewal or a different
VoIP provider, as I
can't justify my
current $39
CenturyLink
monthly land line
fee, nor, $75
monthly for a cell
phone, as I don't
use a telephone on a
daily basis. Still
shopping. 

From my experience,
using MagicJack, I
would recommend.
Simple, straight
forward, good
results and cheap.

WhichVoIP Visitor Comments #80 : Posted by Sandra Finlin
I read that Magic Jack does not have to be 
connected to a computer.  Is this true?
-> Response: Yes that is true. The old MagicJack device had to be connected to a PC but the newer ones can be connected to a PC or used standalone.  
#79 : Posted by Gary Hart
Installed magicjack 3 months ago, and have 
sporadic "breaking up" of conversations. Have purchased 
new cordless phone set with all new handsets, and 
upload bandwith is 782 kbps, which is 5 times required. 
All connections are secure and snug fitting, and device is 
hooked directly to wireless modem. Please help.
-> Response: When it breaks up is it both directions or just 1 way e.g. uplink to the other person? Please run our voip test and let us know the results. Also ensure nothing else is running on your Internet at the time, as a test. Limited bandwidth by the sounds of things which may be causing issues if other devices using your Internet at the same time.  
#78 : Posted by Pat
I want to use the
Magic Jack for
incoming Fax. Fax is
currently on a LAN
line. Can I just
plug in the Magic
Jack into the Router
and Fax into the
Magic Jack?
-> Response: You should be able to connect the MJ to your fax machine instead of your analog phone and it will receive your fax. Faxing over the Internet is not as reliable as landlines and MJ does not officially support this but usually it is successful.  
#77 : Posted by Marty
Do I have connect my router and answering machine to 
the Magic Jack?
-> Response: You need to connect the MagicJack to your Internet (could be direct to a modem or through a switch or router). Magic Jack has voicemail and voicemail to email so no need to use your answering machine.  
#76 : Posted by Marty
If I purchase the newest MagicJack, can I use multiple 
phones?
-> Response: Yes you can. The easiest way is to use cordless phones. Alternatively connect to your home internal phone wiring and use phones throughout the house. You just have to be careful with the landline coming into the house in the second case as it is powered by the old landline provider so really should be disconnected at the side of the house.  
#75 : Posted by Renee Sigley
i currently have a MAGIC JACK device and the quality  is 
TERRIBLE!!!! The people on the other end ALWAYS tell me 
there is a beeping sound like I am pressing the buttons. 
Also they tell me the calls fade in and out. So as you can 
see I am VERY leary in purchasing another VOIP service but I can 
not stand to use this MAGIC JACK one more day!!! I am on 
a limited budget and sometimes it will be days before my 
phone rings. I also don't use it much to make outgoing 
calls either nut I still want piece of mind in having a land 
line phone. Please advise me as to what plan would be 
best for me. Also, if it ends up being the quality of the 
MAGIC JACK I now have will I be able to return it if I am 
not satisfied?
-> Response: Try running our VoIP test to see if there is an issue with your Internet connection. This may be the issue rather than MagicJack so worth trying this before looking at any other provider. Many providers offer 30 day cancellation. We normally advise running the VoIP test, then choose a provider that has the option to cancel and when you order, choose a new phone number. Test the service and if happy port any existing numbers over. This tends to ensure a hassle-free approach.  
#74 : Posted by Mike H
Can I get my existing CenturyTel number transferred to Magic 
Jack?
-> Response: You should be able to. There are a few corner cases but it is usually fine to port your number over. A word of warning though, don't cancel CenturyTel until the port has been done as otherwise you could lose the number. Also I would recommend testing the MJ service first to make sure you are happy with it before doing the number transfer.  
#73 : Posted by Dan Nielsen
I recently signed up with MagicJack and am totally 
satisfied with their service and support.  Setup may be 
complicated for some, but their online support will talk 
you through any problems you encounter.  My son, who 
recommended MagicJack to me has been using them for 
3 years with no problems.
 
#72 : Posted by Robert Thomas
I've had both Magic Jack and the Plus 
version. The regular one was not 
dependable but when they came out with MJ Plus I got it 
and can't tell the difference from Verizon. I bought the 5 
year plan after seeing how good it was, feeling like I was 
stealing it, for $99.00. That was about 3 months of phone 
service with Verizon if I didn't make long distance calls. 
When my 5 years are up I'll renew it even though I've got 
Viber on my cell phone & PC and Skype on my PC. 
 
#71 : Posted by George A
I have had magic
Jack for years, And
want to renew my
service for 2015,
however, I have been
having some major
problems with this
service. About 30%
to 40% of the time
when there is an
incoming  phone
call, they can hear
us, but we cannot
hear them.
Please let me know
how this can be
fixed before I sign
up again?
-> Response: George, take a look at our troubleshooting guide for some ideas.
If it wasn't an intermittent issue (i.e. 100% problem) I would suggest your firewall is not letting the right ports through.
Often this kind of issue is with your Internet connection, so it may be worth running our VoIP test.
Have you tried using the MagicJack app on a smartphone? Interested to know if it works in WiFi mode and in cell mode.

VoIP Equipment Guide for 2017

 Articles




VoIP Equipment Guide for 2017

		To take full advantage of all the 
		benefits that VoIP has to offer, it is necessary to evaluate different 
		VoIP equipment options. Some basic items to 
		consider are listed as follows:

How many new IP phones do you need and what will the upfront cost be?
Are Ethernet ports available in every office?
Do you need to upgrade any network switches to support IP phones and VoIP?

The good news is that your service provider will be able to help answer some of these 
		questions with you. The bad news is that you need to research and confirm 
		that the equipment that is being recommended is right for your business, 
		as well as pricing.



Step 1: Decide if You Need New IP Phones
If you are considering changing your 
		phone service provider and your business is already using a hosted VoIP 
		solution or an on-premise VoIP phone system, then there is a good chance 
		that you do not need to purchase new phones. However, it is critical that you 
		confirm phone compatibility with the new service provider that you are 
		considering switching to or it could be a costly mistake.
If your business is switching to 
		hosted VoIP or an on-premise IP enabled phone system, then you will need 
		to either purchase or rent IP phones that support the call control 
		protocols used by the phone service provider you choose. Often, you can purchase equipment directly from the service provider at a good price. Keep an eye out for providers that offer free phones or 2 for the price of 1 deals. This can save you on up front costs and make the switch more viable financially.
Visit our IP Phones section for extensive information on makes and models like Cisco, Polycom and Yealink, plus reviews and more.
Even the most basic IP phones have a 
		good number of features so a business can save a lot of money by 
		selecting the most appropriate phone for its needs. Some popular devices are listed as 
		follows to give you an idea, along with a price guide, number of lines supported and Protocols supported.

* $ = lower cost to $$$$ = Highest cost

Step 2: Identify Other VoIP Equipment Requirements.
Some other items of equipment that 
		you may need to consider purchasing are listed as follows:
Phone Headsets
Average Price Range: < $50
Although IP phones have excellent speakerphones, the majority of employees will likely prefer to use a headset to keep conversations private and respect their work neighbors
Compare popular headsets >>
Power Supplies for IP Phones
Average Price Range: < $50
Required if Power over Ethernet (PoE) is not available in your setup.
Power over Ethernet (PoE) Switches
Average Price Range: Varies
Preferred method of powering IP 
				phones and avoids the extra cost of power supplies. Pricing 
				depends on port count and software features. Quality of service 
				(QoS) feature support should be evaluated to ensure voice 
				packets are properly prioritized over data in the IP packet. QoS 
				helps avoid choppy or dropped calls.
Router Additions/Upgrades
Average Price Range: Varies
New or upgraded routers may be 
				required to ensure redundancy, throughput and packet 
				prioritization.
Analog Telephony Adaptors (ATA)
Average Price Range: $50 to $100
You can continue to use your existing analog phones but they will need an ATA to work. That means you need to purchase an ATA for every 
				existing Analog phone that you want to keep and use. Due to the cost and the productivity benefits of IP phones this may not work out a good choice in the long run.
Compare popular phone adaptors (ATAs) >>
Ethernet Cabling
Average Price Range: Varies
Purchasing and installing CAT5e 
				Ethernet cable can be expensive depending on the size of the 
				installation. Most offices will already have this cabling 
				installed but it is definitely worth checking to avoid a costly 
				surprise.
Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS)
Average Price Range: Varies
Network equipment should already be 
				connected to a UPS to avoid issues during power outages. If no 
				UPS currently exists, then it is recommended that a UPS is 
				installed to ensure that phones (and service) keep 
				working during a power outage.
On-Premise System
If you are seeking an on-premise 
		system, then it is likely that you will need to perform a 
		very thorough evaluation of your existing network. Most service providers can help with this and advise on any recommendations.
Step 3: The Bottom Line
Although additional equipment is 
		often required to be purchased when upgrading to a VoIP solution, the 
		overall benefits typically far outweigh this cost. Businesses should 
		evaluate the annual cost savings that such a solution can offer while 
		considering any up front equipment expenses. In most cases the overall 
		cost savings and productivity increases that VoIP provides will easily 
		justify any potential equipment upgrades.

		businesses that are currently researching to find the best service 
		solution, please take a look at our table of popular providers below:

Millions of phone users are trading in their traditional phone lines for a lower cost super-charged feature set phone service, known as VoIP.

About WhichVoIP
WhichVoIP was founded from a discussion about the future of VoIP as a viable phone service between a group of telecommunication experts back in 2004. With experience in the Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP) field they were convinced that over the coming years both the home and business markets would begin switching to this technology.
There are many VoIP companies offering various plans to consumers and businesses and it is often difficult and time consuming to determine exactly what you are getting from each provider plan, and which is right for you.  It was for this reason that we decided to provide all of this information on our website to help you, our visitors, make an informed decision. Depending on your calling habits, moving to a broadband phone service from a regular phone service can save you up to 80% on your telephone bills.
Over the years we have established partnerships with most of the service providers in the industry allowing us to offer you deals that are often better than those you would get by going direct to the provider's website. Our service comes at absolutely no cost to you.
What started out as helping a few hundred people per year, we now get over 1 million visitors per year and we have helped process over 100,000 free custom price quotes for businesses looking to make the switch.

Hear What Some Happy Visitors Have to Say



			We decided that VOIP made sense for us. We knew we wouldn't have the time to research all the options out there
			on our own, so we decided to use WhichVOIP to find the best solution for us. Within minutes of filling out the 
			submission form I was being contacted by 3 providers. By 24 hours later we were close to choosing a winner. 
			The process was quick and easy and we found a solution that works for our business.

Principal, Strategy & Client Services
at Confluence Digital, LLC








			When our small business decided that we would work with a virtual administrative assistant we want on a search 
			to find out how to do that.  WhichVoIP made this process so easy.  We filled out a very simple form and 
			within a few minutes we received responses from several providers.  We were able to to talk with a representative for 
			each of these providers and get a better idea for what we were looking for and what would be a good fit. 
			I thought this process was going to be very painful, but WhichVoIP made it easy.

This Agreement sets forth the terms of the agreements between you and each of magicJack, LP, YMax and VocalTec as the case may be. Nothing in this Agreement will be deemed to confer any rights upon or benefits to anyone else.

1. Description of how the Services work.
The Devices, the magicApp and Associated Software enable the Services, which include a voice over Internet Protocol service feature and text messaging capability (available with the magicApp Premium Service). To enable your use of the Services you must first purchase a Device and download the Associated Software, and/or download the magicApp. You may download the magicApp from the iTunes App Store and the Google Play store. Some enhanced features also require you to purchase additional services or premium plans. In addition, you may need a computer running Microsoft® Windows (Vista, 7, 8 or 10) or Intel-based Mac® with a high speed Internet connection and, if you purchase a Device, you may need an available USB port and/or a standard telephone to plug into the Device. Bear in mind that your use of the Services may be dependent on these requirements and the failure of one may prevent the Services from working. We cannot guarantee that the Services will always function without disruptions, delay or other imperfections. There may be power outages or internet service disruptions and you may experience other disruptions unrelated to the Services, which will interfere with the quality of your Service. You are responsible for obtaining third party products and services required to use the Services (such as a computer with an appropriate operating system and port, high speed internet access and a standard telephone to plug into the Device) and for paying any fees for such third party products and services.  The Services may not be compatible with certain equipment, including but not limited to, home security systems, medical monitoring equipment, fax machines, satellite television systems, or computer modems.

2. Ownership and Risk of Loss of Device
You will own the Device or Devices you purchase but not the Associated Software used to access Services with the Device or magicApp, which is provided to you by VocalTec for your use under this Agreement for terms ranging from one month to five years depending on the Service term included with your Device purchase and/or the term of your Service renewal upon termination of your initial Service term. You bear all risk of loss of, theft of, casualty to or damage to any Device you purchase from the time of purchase and/or shipment until the time (if any) when it is returned to us in accordance with this Agreement. If, within 30 days after placing your order for the Device directly from the www.magicjack.com website, you are not satisfied with your Device, you may either return it to us for a full refund of the purchase price, minus shipping and handling, or exchange it for a new Device. The full refund or exchange offer is applicable only to the purchase of your first Device. In order to receive a refund or exchange you must request and receive a magicJack RMA number by e-mail and the Device must be returned in its original packaging, be accompanied by proof of purchase and you must pay the expenses of shipping. Request your RMA here http://my.magicJack.com/returns.html. You will receive your refund or your new Device within a reasonable time frame after we receive your package; which is approximately 14 days for an exchange and 45 days for a refund. If you purchased the Device from one of our authorized agents, please contact the distributor or retailer directly to learn about their refund policy.

3. Internet Communications Feature

a) Incoming Calls:
When you first register your Device or download the magicApp Premium, as part of the available features, you may elect to choose a unique phone number.  A monthly or annual fee may apply depending on the Service purchased, the terms of which will be disclosed to you prior to you agreeing to a unique phone number. If you are using the magicApp as a companion to a magicJackGo or magicJackExpress Device, your Device and magicApp will have the same phone number.  YMax is the provider of your phone number and/or inbound calls.  The phone number chosen by you will be allocated to you provided YMax determines that the number is available and legally permissible. If you are eligible for a phone number, it will be allocated to you as soon as reasonably possible after YMax has received your request. Premium numbers are not permanently assigned to your account until after the first 30 days of use.  YMax may use customized ringtones or ring back when completing your calls, including supplying various messages of different lengths. YMax does not guarantee that a requested phone number can be allocated to you or that you can make use of the incoming call feature. The allocation of a phone number to you does not constitute any transfer of title, ownership, license or other rights with regard to the phone number. If you transfer or port out your phone number to another service provider, your Service is terminated and you relinquish all claims for a refund of your initial licensing period as well as any renewal licensing purchased.  YMax may, without any liability, refuse, change or terminate any phone number at any time. If YMax changes the phone number that has been allocated to you, YMax will notify you, stating the effective date of the change and your new phone number. If you do not wish to accept this new phone number, you are entitled to cancel this Agreement; however, you will not be eligible for any refund unless you terminate the Agreement within 30 days after purchase of your Device or download of the magicApp Premium and you qualify for a refund as further described in Section 2 of this Agreement. We will not be liable for any damages resulting from the change of the phone number.

b) Outgoing Calls:
Once you have registered your Device, you may now elect to choose the feature allowing you to make free outgoing calls over the internet. You can make free calls to other Device or magicApp users located anywhere in the world, and to traditional telephone networks or wireless networks in the United States (other than Alaska), Canada (other than Yukon and the Northwest Territories) and calling or conference bridge platforms. International calls and calls to Alaska, and the Yukon and Northwest Territories of Canada to non-Device or magicApp users will require purchase of prepaid international calling service. magicjack, LP allows outbound calling capability which in turn may use YMax as the provider of outbound calling services to subscribers on traditional telephone or wireless networks in the United States and Canada, or for toll free calls, and/or for international calls. We may supply various messages of different lengths before your call is completed. Some restrictions in cost prohibitive areas may apply. You will not have the ability to call any number that would require the addition of any charges to your phone bill, such as 900 or 976 numbers or any other “fee per call” type service. Calls of long duration may be terminated to make sure the integrity of the network is kept intact, which would prevent abandoned calls.

4. What Is Free and What is Not:
A Device or magicApp allows you to receive incoming calls. If you choose outgoing service, the Device or magicApp allows you to make outgoing calls to other Device or magicApp users located anywhere in the world and to traditional telephone networks or cellular networks in the United States (other than Alaska) and Canada (other than the Yukon and Northwest Territories) for no additional charge. Outgoing calls do not include non-8YY accessed calling card, platform, conference or chat lines.  We may require prepaid purchase and/or we may charge you for calls to conference lines, platforms and certain other high cost calls, or any call wherein we incur a cost from another carrier. We may provide for a fee, premium prepaid services, which may be powered by YMax, and may include some inbound, international, conference, platform and outbound calls that receive a recording and certain calls to high cost areas, and the rates for those services will be governed by listed price lists or tariffs. Charges may apply to use the call forwarding feature, if available. VocalTec may make available to you, for an additional fee, enhanced versions of the Associated Software (“Upgraded Software”) that provide new features and functions. “magicApp Basic” is a free download with limited capabilities including free calls to Devices and magicApp users around the world.  “magicApp Premium” is a paid download that provides you with greater calling capabilities including a dedicated U.S. phone number and texting to U.S. mobile numbers with texting capability located in the U.S..  Texting to Canadian numbers is not available.  magicApp Premium is included at no additional cost to Device users for the applicable term of Service for such Device.  For each Device account, you may download magicApp Premium as a companion App to either a single iTunes account or a single Google Play account.

5. Emergency calls:
Please read carefully and understand the difference between the devices and the magicApp.
magicApp does not provide any emergency calling or texting capability.
magicApp - No Emergency Calls or Texts. magicApp does NOT support any emergency calls or texts to 911. magicApp is not a traditional telephone service or a replacement for your primary telephone service. There are important differences between traditional telephone services and the magicApp Associated Software and Service. You need to make additional arrangements in order to call or text 911. It is your responsibility to use the wireless 911 feature of your smart phone or purchase, elsewhere, traditional wireless or fixed line telephone services that offer access to 911. It is Your responsibility to inform all users that may use the magicApp Associated Software that you have downloaded, that it is not possible to support or carry 911 calls or texts using the magicApp Associated Software and products, and that they may access emergency services via the additional arrangements that You have made available.
Device 911 calling Service - The Service is not a traditional telephone service and we are not required to provide you with access to 911, E911, or similar access to emergency services. However, when you register to use a Device, you may enroll in 911 service if you register a United States 911 address for United States telephone numbers or a Canadian 911 address for Canadian telephone numbers. magicJack, LP may take commercially reasonable steps to provide you with emergency service calling only for your registered 911 address.  If you are a new customer and you are using the device in the United States or Canada, you must give us a valid 911 address during the registration process or your Service will not be activated.  If you are an existing customer you must give us a valid 911 address in your my.magicJack account in order for 911 service to be active. You must update this address whenever you change the location from which you place your calls. You agree that each and every time you change the physical location of where you are using a Device, you will update the Emergency Services record at my.magicJack.com and provide the new address where you are using the Device. Your 911 service may take a few days to one week to work after registration but refer to your 911 status at my.magicjack.com for more details.
You understand and agree that access to 911 may be provided to you as a convenience. If you choose to use the same phone number for two or more Devices, you will have 911 emergency dialing on all Devices, but possibly only the first Device registered with the phone number will be associated with the registered 911 address you provide. The Company will not be liable for any damages resulting from any 911 call. You understand that the 911 service will not work in certain circumstances, including, but not limited to: when you relocate your computer or Device to a new physical location without updating your registered location; if you use a non-native telephone number; if you experience broadband connection failure; if you experience loss of electrical power at your location; if delays occur in the system making updates of your registered physical location. You assume the risk that you may not obtain emergency service when you dial 911. You should always have an alternative means of accessing 911 such as a landline or mobile telephone. It is your responsibility to inform others who use your Device to make phone calls that they should be prepared to access 911 through a traditional landline or mobile telephone.
magicJack E911 services will not operate outside of the United States and Canada.
911 Billing – Additional Fees
We have agreed with certain emergency communications districts to bill you via e-mail to collect the charges imposed by them for your ability to dial 911 services.  Such charges are in addition to any fees paid by you for the Device, the magicApp or the Services.  It is important that you pay such charges pursuant to the instructions included in any bills you receive.  If you do not pay this government-imposed charge, the emergency communications district in your jurisdiction may seek to collect any amounts from you directly.  We do not profit at all from your 911 services and the funds we collect are turned over to the appropriate government authority pursuant to their requirements.

6. Proper Use; Suspicion of Fraud:
You agree that you are responsible for your own communications and for any consequences that arise from them. You agree that you will use the Services in compliance with all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules and regulations and you may have to pay certain taxes or fees or surcharges including, without limitation, regulatory fees related to 911 services. Among other things you will not, and will not authorize or encourage any third party to: (a) prevent others from using their Service, (b) use the Service for any fraudulent or inappropriate purpose,  (c) remove any copyright, trademark or other proprietary rights notices contained in or on the Devices and/or magicApp, including those of any of our business associates, from whom we may have licensed certain components used in the Devices and/or magicApp, (d) collect or harvest any personally identifiable information, including phone number, from  the Service, or to use the communication systems provided by the Service for any commercial solicitation or spam purposes and/or (e)  spam, or solicit for commercial purposes, any users of the Service. Violation of any of these obligations may result in immediate termination of this Agreement, and may subject you to state and federal penalties and other legal consequences. The Company reserves the right, but will have no obligation, to investigate your use of the Device, magicApp, or the Associated Software in order (a) to determine whether a violation of the Agreement has occurred or (b) to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request. We may monitor your use of the Service for violations of this Agreement. We may terminate your use of the Device and/or magicApp and/or Associated Software immediately if we suspect a violation of this Agreement, or if we think it necessary in order to protect other customers or our respective, parents, affiliates, directors, officers, agents, and employees from harm. If we become aware of unreasonably excessive use, including but not limited to, a customer whose usage is extraordinarily greater than the average Device or magicApp customer usage, or a customer who calls more than 50 different telephone numbers per day, or a customer who forwards calls from their Device and/or magicApp to a non-Company number for longer than a two week consecutive period, or systematic or intentional misuse, we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to terminate your use of the Device and/or magicApp and/or Associated Software immediately, and you will not be entitled to get a refund of any licensing fee or any other fee you may have paid to us. We reserve the right to reclaim any telephone number that does not make a call for 90 consecutive days. In the event that we reclaim a phone number and your Service under this Agreement is still active, you may choose another phone number.
You also agree not to use or launch any automated system, including without limitation, “robots,” “spiders,” “offline readers,” etc. or “load testers”, including without limitation,  wget, apache bench, mswebstress, httpload, blitz, Xcode Automator, Android Monkey, etc., that accesses the Service in a manner that sends more request messages to the Company’s servers in a given period of time than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using the Service, and you are forbidden from ripping the content unless specifically allowed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company grants the operators of public search engines permission to use spiders to copy materials from the website for the sole purpose of creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials, but not caches or archives of such materials. The Company reserves the right to revoke these exceptions either generally or in specific cases. While we do not disallow the use of sniffers such as Ethereal, tcpdump or HTTPWatch in general, we do not permit any efforts to reverse-engineer our system, our protocols, or explore outside the boundaries of the normal requests made by Company clients. We do not permit the use of request modification tools, including without limitation, fiddler or whisker, or any other such tools activities that are meant to explore or harm, penetrate or test the site. You must secure our permission before you measure, test, health check or otherwise monitor any network equipment, servers or assets hosted on our domain.
We reserve the right to not authorize or settle any transaction you submit which we believe is in violation of this Agreement, any other agreement between you and the Company, or exposes you, other Device or magicApp users’, financial services providers, or the Company to harm or unnecessary risk, including but not limited to fraud and other criminal acts. You grant us authorization to share information with law enforcement about you, your transactions, or your Device or magicApp account if we reasonably suspect that use of your Device or magicApp account has been used for an unauthorized, illegal, or criminal purpose.
We may disclose your personal information to law enforcement, government officials, or other third parties if: (i) we are compelled to do so by subpoena, court order or other legal process; (ii) we must do so to comply with laws, statutes, rules or regulations; (iii) we believe in good faith that the disclosure is necessary to prevent physical harm or financial loss, to report suspected illegal or unauthorized activity, or to investigate violations of this Agreement.

7. No Resale:

The initial term of your subscription for the Services following a Device purchase will be three or more months depending on the Device and Service option purchased.

The magicApp Premium Service will have the Service term communicated to you upon purchase.   If you do not renew your Service subscription, we may immediately revoke the phone number, at our sole discretion, and your Device, magicApp Basic and/or magicApp Premium plan may be deemed obsolete or non-renewable upon the expiration of your subscription. You agree not to modify the Device, magicApp and/or Associated Software in any manner or form, or to use modified versions of the Associated Software, including for the purpose of obtaining unauthorized access to any Device, the magicApp or the Services. We expressly reserve all rights in the Services, the Associated Software, Documentation, and all other materials provided by us hereunder not specifically granted you.

9. Payment:
Use of your Device and/or magicApp and related Services may be free for a period of time. Your purchase of a Device or purchase and download of the magicApp Premium Service and registration of the Device and/or magicApp Premium Service gives you the right to use the Services and the Associated Software for one or more months depending on the Device and plan purchased. To continue using a Device and/or magicApp Premium and Associated Software after the end of the initial Service term, you must renew your Service subscription for additional terms at the then applicable Service subscription renewal fee.

The magicApp Basic Service is a free download and has no term.  magicApp Basic Service may be terminated by us at any time without notice. If your right to use the Services is terminated for breach of this Agreement, you may not be able to use the Device or magicApp features and your right to use any phone number allocated to you will be canceled. Text messages and voicemails stored on the Company’s servers will be deleted as soon as practicable upon expiration or termination of a Device and/or magicApp Premium account.  If you renew after expiration of your most recent Service term, your new Service term will begin on date of registration and you may not have access to any phone number you had previously. For your convenience, we use an auto-renewal program.  To the extent permitted by the laws of your state, the form of payment you have on file may be automatically charged for the prevailing renewal fee. We may receive and/or request automatic updates of your account information from the financial institution that issued your form of payment on file in order to keep your payment information current.  All payments for your Device and Services must be made United States Dollars (USD). If you use a credit card issued by a non-US financial institution to pay for a purchase of a Device or Services, your financial institution may convert the charge and they may impose currency exchange fees.
You can elect to disable this auto renew feature at any time by going to http://my.magicJack.com/autorenew. magicJack, LP offers a thirty-day refund for the Device.

The Services, Device, magicApp and Associated Software are provided “as is”, without any warranties of any kind, whether expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, warranties of quality, performance, non-infringement, merchantability, or fitness for use or a particular purpose.

16. Limitation of Liability:
We can only be held liable for direct damages resulting from failure to perform our respective obligations under this Agreement. In this respect, direct damages means the amount you actually paid for the Device, magicApp and/or Services during the year in which such damages occur. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we will not be liable for any indirect, special, incidental or consequential damages whatsoever including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits or loss or disclosure of confidential or other information, for business interruption, for loss of privacy, or divulgence of sensitive and confidential information or any such damage arising out of or in any way related to the use of or inability to use the Services, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.
Some jurisdictions do not allow some of the exclusions or limitations as established above, so they may not apply to you. In that event, the liability will be limited as far as legally possible under the applicable legislation.

17. Export/Import:
You agree to comply with all export and import laws and restrictions and regulations of the United States and foreign countries, and not to export, re-export or import the Services or Associated Software or any direct product thereof in violation of any such restrictions, laws or regulations, or without all necessary authorizations. Neither the Services or Associated Software, nor their respective underlying information or technology may be downloaded or otherwise exported or re-exported (i) to Cuba, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Sudan, Syria, or any other country subject to U.S. trade sanctions applicable to the Services or Associated Software, to individuals or entities controlled by such countries, or to nationals or residents of such countries other than nationals who are lawfully admitted permanent residents of countries not subject to such sanctions; or (ii) to any named party or individual on the United States Department of Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons, and/or the United States Department of Commerce, Bureau of Export Administration Denied Persons List or Entity List. You acknowledge that the Services and Associated Software contains encryption technology, the export of which is restricted by the United States and certain foreign laws.

18. Automatic Updates:
The Services, Devices or magicApp may communicate with our servers to check for available updates to the Services or Associated Software, including bug fixes, patches, missing plug-ins and new versions (collectively, “Updates”), however we have no obligation to provide you with such Updates and we do so solely at our option. To ensure that you have the most recent updates for the Services and Associated Software you should periodically visit http://www.magicJack.com to check for updates. We will have no liability for your inability to use certain features of the Services or reduced Services performance associated with your failure to install available Updates. We may send and access the Device or cookies on your computer.  A “cookie” is a small file containing information about you that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the website again, the cookie allows that site to recognize such things as your browser, user preferences and other information to optimize the performance of the Services. During the Update process, the Associated Software may send to us or our partners a request for the latest Associated Software version. By installing the Services and/or Associated Software, you hereby agree to allow us the option to automatically provide Updates from our and/or our partners’ servers.

19. Representations and Warranties:

20. Entire Agreement:
This Agreement, as it may be updated or amended from time-to-time as effectuated by posting such updates or amendments in amended versions of this Agreement posted at www.magicjack.com/saps, incorporates by reference all policies and guidelines posted on the www.magicjack.com website and as may be modified thereafter (including the Privacy Policy and any Acceptable Use Policy and/or General Terms and Conditions) and constitutes the entire agreement between you and us regarding the subject matter hereof and supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous representation, understanding, agreement, or communication between you and us, whether written or oral, regarding such subject matter.

21. Assignment:
You agree that you may not assign this Agreement to any third party and that we may assign this Agreement, without your consent, to any person including, without limitation, (i) to any person that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with us, or (ii) pursuant to a transfer of all or substantially all of our business or assets, whether by merger, sale of assets, sale of stock, or otherwise.  Any assignment in violation of this section shall be void.

22. Governing Law:
The Company and you agree that this Agreement has been made in and shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida, without reference to its conflicts of laws principles.

23. Waiver and Severability of Terms:
Even if we do not exercise or enforce any or all of our respective rights or any provision of this Agreement it does not mean that we waive the right or provision, and we may still enforce those rights and provisions later. If any provision of this Agreement is found by any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of this Agreement remain in full force and effect.

24. Statute of Limitations:
You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to your use of the Service or this Agreement must be filed within ninety days after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.

25. Mandatory Binding Arbitration; Forum:
The Company and you agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between us. You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and the Company are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. The arbitration shall be administered in accordance with the then current Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, as modified by this Agreement. Any matter to be settled by arbitration shall be submitted to the American Arbitration Association in Palm Beach, Florida, and you consent to binding arbitration in Palm Beach, Florida.
The arbitrator may award relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. The individual party may recover damages and attorneys’ fees, if authorized by the law governing SUCH PARTY’S claim, to the same extent the individual party would be entitled to recover in court.
YOU AND THE COMPANY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless all parties to the arbitration agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted and shall survive termination of this Agreement.

26. Warranty

Plans to lower pricing and streamline operating efficienciesWill focus on adding customers through digital media and retailExpects to begin selling new low priced proprietary ATA device in Q2 2017 WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. and NETANYA, Israel, Jan.  24, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- magicJack VocalTec Ltd. (Nasdaq:CALL), a leading VoIP cloud-based communications company, today provided an update on its SMB business unit and its plans to leverage the product development investments made in 2016 by focusing on lowered pricing, streamlining its go-to-market strategy, driving sales primarily 
through digital media and retail, and product innovation.
"In 2016 we developed and delivered a terrific SMB product that provides a compelling value proposition to the small office/home office customer," said Gerald Vento, President and CEO of magicJack VocalTec.  "We now see an opportunity to disrupt the SMB market, like we did in the consumer market, with low prices by applying our ultra-low cost DNA. We believe we can achieve an attractive long-term customer lifetime value outcome at favorable customer acquisition costs over time."In addition to lower pricing, magicJack's SMB business will be introducing a new SMB ATA device during Q2 2017.

to extend the useful life of their traditional analog devices via magicJack's low-cost voice over IP telephony network."We are excited by the SMB Business opportunity and believe that the combination of lower pricing, more efficient operating cost structure, low cost customer acquisition strategy and our product innovation provide us with the platform for growth," concluded Mr. Vento.In connection with the new direction and improved operating efficiencies, Keith Reed, SVP and General Manager of SMB, will be departing the company to pursue other opportunities effective February 3, 2017.  magicJack intends to provide a revised 2017 financial forecast for the SMB business unit reflecting its updated strategy on the Q4 2016 earnings call.About magicJack VocalTec Ltd.magicJack VocalTec Ltd.

MagicJack: What The Market Is Missing - magicJack VocalTec Communications Ltd. (NASDAQ:CALL) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»MagicJack: What The Market Is MissingJun.15.17 | About: magicJack VocalTec (CALL) Jim Maguire Value, event-driven, activist investor, GrowthSummaryNew management is incentivized to sell the company.New ventures are finally in the works.The company is operating within an expedited timeframe to unlock shareholder value. Over the past year, few companies have been through as much as MagicJack (NASDAQ:CALL) has. From seemingly endless M&A chatter to multiple proxy wars, the company's share price has gone through unusual turbulence ranging from $6.50 to $8.90 per share on consistently low volume. Fortunately, there is a light at the end of the tunnel. The Business MagicJack's revenue is distributed into three main components:  Core Consumer: This is MagicJack's most profitable division as it accounts for 88% of their revenue during Q1 of 2017. Included in this segment are any sale of MagicJack devices to a wholesaler or directly to consumers, access rights fees, and prepaid minutes. Enterprise: This division represents Broadsmart. Broadsmart specializes in Unified Communication as a Service (UCaaS) and produced 2.7 million in revenue last quarter, or 11% of Q1 revenue. On the past conference call, CEO Don Bell announced that they would be writing off the majority of Broadsmart ($31.5 million of the $40 million acquisition) mainly because one, potentially two, of their customers were not renewing their contracts. In an effort to salvage what's left, management appointed Kerrin Parker to be the CEO of the Broadsmart division, who has hired an entire new sales team to revamp the business as a whole. SMB: The SMB division focuses on the sale of phone services and equipment. It began in March last year, and produces <1% of revenue for each quarter.  Q1 2017 Earnings  Total revenues for the quarter were $23.2 million, with access rights renewals accounting for 58% of total revenues. The sale of MagicJack devices was $2.8 million, Broadsmart contributed $2.7 million, the sale of prepaid minutes accounted for $1.2 million, wholesale charges were 1.1 million, and various smaller sources of revenue accounted for $1.9 million. The company operated at a loss of $34.5 million, mainly because of the Broadsmart write down ($31.5 million) and fees from the proxy fights along with departing senior management compensation ($5.2 million). Churn came in a bit high at 2.5%, compared to last quarter's 2.4%. MagicJack's subscriber base increased by 92,000 to a total of 2.08 million active subscribers. Cash: MagicJack has $48.3 million in cash with no debt. In FY16 the company added $14.7 million in free cash flow and plans on spending 3 to 5 million on incremental investments, specifically within its SMB division.  Overall, this quarter was uniquely difficult for MagicJack because of the writing-off of Broadsmart, proxy fight fees, and exiting management compensation. Broadsmart was an ill-advised venture that never came close to living up to expectations, and is one of the final mistakes from the past management team that Bell was left to fix. None of the other fees noted should be recurring, and with the user subscriber base still growing along with new products in the pipeline, the rest of the year should shape up to be more inline with previous years while this quarter is an outlier. Proxy Wars (NASDAQ:CALL) Over the past 11 months, MagicJack has been working to find a buyer for the company. It began in July 2016, when MagicJack received two "indications of interest" from two separate companies, one known as Carnegie Technologies and the other kept confidential, with the company referring to them as "Bidder A." Bidder A's bid was within the range of $7.50 to $8.00 per share, while Carnegie's bid was within the range of $8.00 to $10.00 per share. MagicJack told both parties that neither offer was good enough, and that they will each have to substantially increase their offer for the company to consider it. Keep in mind, all of this is occurring behind closed doors, and to the common public (and shareholders) all that is seen is the share price down nearly 50% from only eight months prior. Enter David Kanen of Kanen Wealth Management - holder of 5.6% of all outstanding shares - who submits a letter to the Board of Directors essentially demanding they take action to save the crumbling share price. In addition, Kanen nominated its own slate of directors for the upcoming annual meeting. By the time September rolls around, Carnegie and Bidder A have both raised their offers. Bidder A is offering to buy the company for around $9.20 per share, while Carnegie is offering $8.50 per share. After more negotiations between MagicJack and each party, Carnegie wouldn't budge from their original price while Bidder A moved forward in their due diligence. By the end of December, MagicJack reached a settlement with Kanen, although the Board backed out last-minute. The Board made the decision to move forward with the nomination of both Kanen's and their own directors for the upcoming meeting. Along with that, the Board also announced that the then-current CEO Gerald Vento would be stepping down, and that Don Bell III would be taking his place. (An interesting note is Don Bell was a main contributor in the sale of IPC Systems to SilverLake Partners in addition to the sale of NTS Communications to Tower Three Partners, so he has experience in working through buyout processes.) As the new year begins, Carnegie went public with their offer of $8.50 a share and nominated their own slate of directors for the Board. They state they are basically fed up with management, and their lack of an ability to reach a conclusive settlement offer with Kanen reflects their general incompetency. About a week later, a third bidder comes into play (known as "Bidder B") who offers to buy the company at a price apparently greater than what Carnegie is offering. On January 30th, Kanen entered into an official settlement agreement with MagicJack, agreeing to withdraw all of his nominations for the Board of directors. What Kanen got in return, if anything, to my knowledge, is undisclosed. Within one week of the settlement, negotiations with Bidder B progressed to the point where Bidder B signed an NDA and began doing its own due diligence on the company. Over the next two months, Carnegie and MagicJack go back and forth over numerous legality issues until, on March 30th, Carnegie agreed to withdraw their nominations for the Board of Directors. They claimed that they've been happy with the way the new management has run things (under Don Bell III) and sees no need to continue the proxy fight. Since then, there has been no word from Kanen or Carnegie, aside from David Kanen appearing on quarterly conference calls to ask questions. Active Management After the proxy wars ended, management made it a priority to follow their new dual track process: Execution of new business strategy: Management unveiled their new idea, UnJacked, in March. UnJacked is MagicJack's response to the growing trend of SOHO networks within the United States by making their services easier to access through the cloud. Essentially, the idea is that because of their already vertical operations, if they make their services easier to access (cloud-based retrievals are much more handy than having to go through configuration processes) they have the ability to competitively lower their prices while remaining profitable. This is the company moving forward a "mobile-first" initiative and making their services more accessible online. UnJacked will file under the SMB component of revenue. Management plans to send UnJacked to trial in Q3 and release it later this year. Sell the company: The Board put together a special committee consisting of three people (Don Bell, Izhak Gross, and Thomas Fuller) whose main goal is to sell the company. According to the March conference call, they were still in talks with multiple bidders for prices in excess of Carnegie's $8.50 per share. Currently, UnJacked is on track to go to trial as planned, and the process of selling the company under the new management is well underway. On Monday, Axios.com reported that YipTV is willing to buy MagicJack for $9.50 per share. They reportedly have $95 million in committed financing from Goldman Sachs as well as an equity sponsor. Another important piece to the puzzle is an 8k filed by the company on May 10th, which states that if management sells the company within a year's time, Don Bell and Thomas Fuller will roughly make a combined $3.2 million in bonuses ($2.5 million for Bell and $700,000 for Fuller). In addition, Bell and Fuller are both entitled to options that could go through accelerated vesting if they sell the company after a year's time. So essentially, this is what management is looking at: Sell the company within before the one year anniversary of the date of the grant and make $3.2 million. Or... Sell the company after the one year anniversary of the date of the grant and cash in on the options. (In order for the options to me more profitable than the bonuses, management would have to sell the company for around $11 per share.) It's unlikely that MagicJack will sell for as high as $11 per share, so I see management shooting for the former. Needless to say, this provides an enormous incentive for management to deliver and sell the company. Keep in mind, if any bidder (such as YipTV) doesn't want to negotiate with management further for whatever reason, they always have the option of taking their takeover directly to the shareholders to vote. Considering YipTV hasn't made that move, it is likely they are still in the negotiation stages with management. Concerns Even with the likelihood of a buyout here, the rising churn is still somewhat concerning with how management outlined in its annual conference call making it being a priority to retain its subscribers. Along with that, the consistent reliance on the core consumer division (specifically access rights renewals) needs to be successfully diversified. We saw the last management team try to do so and fail with Broadsmart, so it is more relieving that this time around the company isn't trying to force unrealistic synergies between their services and outside companies through acquisitions. With any future revenues from what's left of Broadsmart being largely an unknown, it's important that UnJacked is a success for the SMB unit. Either way, I do not see this being a major factor in the sale of the company - although a new, successful product certainly wouldn't hurt. With $48.3 million in the bank with no debt, the company's financial situation remains in good shape. All of the one-time obligations have been taken care of, and the main subscriber base is still growing. Competition is something to keep in mind because of the company's shift in focus to its SMB unit, with one of their long-time competitors Vonage (NYSE:VG) already having more exposure. Even with that, though, as Don Bell noted in the annual conference call, there are over 26 million SMB units within the United States. If UnJacked lives up to expectations, the company should have no problem breaking into the field. Miscellaneous Some other factors I found worth noting:  The company's new Chairman of the Board, Izhak Gross, is also one of the three people on the special committee to sell the company. Thomas Fuller, also on the committee to sell the company and newly appointed CFO, worked alongside Don Bell during the sale of IPC systems. Michael Tribolet, CEO of YipTV, was once MagicJack's Chief Business Officer.  Conclusion To summarize, the company has been very open about not wanting to accept an offer for $8.50 per share because they had better options on the table, and I think YipTV is just one. Bell mentioned another potential bidder on the annual conference call back in March, so we're unsure if this is the most attractive offer they've received. If management wasn't making any true forward progress on selling the company, I see no reason why Kanen and Carnegie would end the proxy wars within one month of each other. Carnegie was not a majority shareholder and thus I'm unable to tell if they have kept their shares or not, but Kanen Wealth Management has held their shares since their settlement back in February. The driving value in MagicJack is the pending sale of company, and given YipTv's takeover price represents a 26% premium from where the stock traded on June 14th, I see MagicJack as a buy. The current management team (unlike the last one) is incentivized to sell the company, has positive experience selling companies within the sector, and is operating within an expedited timeframe. Given the company has $3.22 per share in cash with roughly $0.92 per share in free cash flow annually with no debt (a decent price floor), a management team active in pursuing a sale of the company, and new, positive ventures on the horizon, MagicJack presents a refreshing opportunity for shareholders.

MagicJack Plus Review by WhichVoIP
This section provides an overall summary of our review of the magicJack Plus phone service. Scroll down to read the complete review, including ordering, installation, using the service and returning.
The Good
The magicJack Plus is very simple to acquire, setup and also has three (3) different ways to utilize the service (computer, home phone, and mobile). The biggest plus is the low cost of service, a fraction of a typical landline cost. This device and service lends itself very well for a cheap second line or for people who are not that reliant on a home phone line (e.g. someone who uses their cell phone for most conversations).
The Bad
There is no customer support to call if you have issues but they do have online chat and a knowledgebase. This would be more of a concern for less tech savvy people who like the comfort of knowing that help is just a phone call away. The feature set is minimal compared with other VoIP services available. There are also a few annoying points with the magicJack mobile application.
The Bottom Line

Cost: $39.95 for the magicJack Plus device which includes 6 months free phone service.
Service Plans: Monthly plan costs $5 per month, 6 
			month plan costs $20 every 6 months, 1 year plan costs $35 
			per year and their 5 year plan costs $120 every 5 years.
Extra fees apply for some features (e.g. porting your number) plus applicable regulatory fees and taxes.
Extra fees apply for certain national area codes plus international calling.
MagicJack Go is now available and comes with 1 year 
			of free service included for an up front cost of $59.95

Overall Thoughts
Overlooking the nuances about the magicJack Plus, it is actually quite a neat product. Setting up the device is a little obnoxious but after you survive the deluge of ads, what lies beneath is an acceptable calling solution. Worth considering if you are comfortable with technology and cost is a major driving factor over anything else.

Introduction
A lot of easy-to-use VoIP calling solutions have made their way to the market. A variety of solutions have surfaced both as an attempt to meet the needs of the everyday consumer as well as enterprises. These simple devices and applications allow people with an Internet connection the ability to make a voice call without an actual landline. One very low cost solution is the magicJack Plus.
MagicJack first hit the market in 2007. The original version was a small USB device that plugged directly into a Personal Computer (PC) and allowed a standard telephone to be plugged into the device. It utilizes Voice over IP (VoIP) technology, allowing users to make internet-based phone calls. MagicJack Plus was introduced in 2011 to remove the requirement of connecting directly to a PC, instead connecting directly to an available internet port (modem, router etc).
The company behind the MagicJack products is YMAX Communications Corporation, who provide the transfer of the phone calls made with these products. Many people have heard of MagicJack as it is promoted through commercials on television. It is a very low cost option, with a small annual charge, for making unlimited calls in USA and Canada (note that certain fee type codes and some area codes may require prepaid minutes to be purchased though). A 30-day money back guarantee is offered for those who want to try it out with no risk.
We decided to take the magicJack Plus for a test drive to see how it performs, including ordering, setting up, using it, trying customer support and returning the device.
Ordering the magicJack Plus
Though you can find the magicJack Plus in many consumer electronics stores, we went ahead and purchased the device through the company's website. We selected the expedited shipping option for an additional $8.95 so the device would arrive between 3 to 5 business days. However, the device arrived 9 days (7 business days) after ordering, causing us to deduct a star.
If you are someone who is easily offended by "up selling" tactics, I would avoid ordering the device online. After you register for your free trial, magicJack bombards you with a deluge of add-ons for your order. Some of the offers do make some sense though if you were planning on keeping the service. However, it still feels like a high pressure sales situation so we knocked a star off for these tactics. The below image shows an example of some of the ads.

The cost for the magicJack Plus device is $49.95 and this includes six (6) months of service free (unlimited calling to the USA and Canada). They also promote a 30 day money back guarantee, excluding shipping fees. Like any phone solution, VoIP or landline, additional fees apply to make international calls. Unless you are calling another magicJack subscriber, you are subject to certain fees for numbers outside of the coverage area (including some national area codes). Fortunately, their rates are fairly low (it differs by country.) These fees can only be circumvented if a person you are calling in another country is also using magicJack. If you're really trying to beat the system, you can also assign a local number to a unit and send it to someone over seas.
Here is an image of the package once it arrived.

Installing the magicJack Plus
There are three (3) main ways that the magicJack Plus device and service can be used, as follows. However, option 1 below is required to configure your service before you can make phone calls.

You can connect the device directly to a computer via the USB connector. In this scenario you can use what is known as a "softphone" application, which includes a piece of software that turns your computer into your phone dialer. You will then need a headset, or separate microphone and speaker set to make calls. You can also plug any analog, touchtone phone to the device for a more authentic experience.
The magicJack Plus device can plug directly into your Internet modem or router, which is the easiest way to use the device if you want to use a regular phone. For various set-up options with your home network we recommend reading our set-up article.
There is a free mobile application (App) available on Google Play and Apple App Store which gives users a highly mobile option to use the service as it can function on 3G or higher networks or over Wi-Fi connections. Perfect for modern day smartphones.

No matter how you use it, you have the ability to access voicemail. Fortunately, you don't have to fine tune anything (nor do you have the ability) as you simply plug in the device, provide requested information and you're good to go. Next, lets look at the different ways to use it as introduced above.
1) Using the magicJack Plus with a computer
Installation can be a pain point for some users who are not technology comfortable so we will walk through this. The device utilizes a USB 2.0 connection to interface with a computer. Since Windows commands a majority of operating systems in the market, we installed and tested the device on a computer utilizing the Windows 7 64 bit operating system.
When you plug the magicJack into a USB port on your computer the driver automatically installs. One quick note here is that the device includes two additional USB ports which can be very useful as the device depth means it can cover multiple ports on your computer device. If you have not already registered the device you will need to now. You have to work through a few web forms to setup the device and register a valid phone number. Be prepared: the same offers you encounter when ordering the device come back for a second round of promotional assault. The below image shows the device connected to one of our laptops.

You can request an area code for anywhere in the US or Canada which is a free feature of magicJack Plus. Additionally, it is possible to port an existing number to the service or you can optionally create a vanity number (subject to availability, of course) both for an additional fee of $20 plus $10 a year annually. Note: we typically recommend not porting your existing phone number initially until at least you have used the service and are happy with it. We recommend this for any VoIP service you may be considering. Once you have named your device, selected a valid number and shuffled through all the promo's, you are ready to make calls. The below image shows the phone dialer on the computer screen.

The magicJack application you see above is the softphone you can utilize to initiate phone calls. If you dont have a phone connected to the device then you will need a headset or microphone/speakers combo as mentioned previously. Just like every phone since the rotary phone went to the wayside, you will see a familiar number layout. You use this dialpad to dial the phone number you want to call and click on the "send" button. To end the call you simply click on the "end" button.
You can also connect your existing home phone to the magicJack Plus device in this configuration. Connecting a phone to the device is just as simple as connecting a phone to any other RJ-11 socket in your home or business. If you're using an actual phone, you can also use it's number pad like any other phone, just pick it up and dial the number you want to call. We made a few test calls with this set up and found the sound quality as good as a landline, with no noticeable hum, echo, or static noises in the background.
Depending on how you plan on using the magicJack device, this option works OK but it is somewhat clunky and space consuming, especially when using a laptop. It also requires the computer device to be on and running for the phone service to work. Fortunately, the Plus device includes other ways to use the service as well.
2) Using magicJack Plus with your router
Another way to use the magicJack Plus is by plugging the device directly into an Internet modem or a router Internet port. The device includes an adaptor for the USB connector to plug into a 120V mains socket to power the Plus device (similar to a smartphone power adaptor). Your analog phone will plug into the RJ-11 port just like when using the device with a computer. Then you will use the phone in the same way as if it were a landline. The below images shows the magicJack Plus device connected to a mains outlet and then a cable connected to a router and a cable connected to the phone (3 connections in total).

The device will protrude if connecting directly to a mains outlet, so it is best to avoid plugging it into a socket in a high traffic area. Alternatively, the device does include a USB-power extension cable. This setup is likely the most commonly used. However, when performing an initial setup it is probably simpler to start with the device connected directly to your computer and then move to this setup once complete.
We recommend setting up 911 service as soon as you can, which must be configured through a separate verification process, especially if this will be your main home number.
3) The magicJack smartphone application
This magicJack application is one more way you can utilize this service. For someone with limited minutes on a carrier plan, this is the perfect way to add virtually unlimited minutes to your cell calling plan. It works over both Wi-Fi and 3G or higher mobile data networks. The image below gives you an idea of what the app looks like on a smartphone.

Though the magicJack application is a great a value add-on, we did notice a couple of minor issues we should mention. The first one was that when going to download the app the icon presented is a green square with the words "Talk Free" in white. This App icon looks nothing like the rest of their branding and we almost didn't download the App as we were not sure it was truly for magicJack.
The second issue we encountered with the application has to do with the contact integration. For Android, after selecting a contact in the magicJack application, you are taken to the actual phone's contact database. If you attempt to make a call from here, you will simply utilize your actual phone and not the magicJack application (so using your phone minutes rather than free calling). Many VoIP App's, for example Skype, integrate further into the Android OS such that they appear in a prompt that allows you to select your phone, Skype or another application to call the number you select - magicJack does not.
Though the magicJack app has some flaws, it is a nice add-on feature and does work for making phone calls. The sound quality was no worse than a typical phone call made from your cell phone. The 4G network in the area where we tested the phone App is very good so that would have helped.
Features of the magicJack Plus
As a VoIP product and service, the magicJack Plus is considerably light on features. The included call features are voicemail, caller ID, call forwarding and call waiting. They do also boast free 411 calling. However, these are basic features when compared to many other VoIP services available today (some with 40+ features). As mentioned previously they do allow number porting, but at an additional fee to switch ($20) and then annually to maintain ($10). A fee for porting your existing number is common though (due to "paperwork" involved).
Customer Service
The customer service options are detailed in the tabbed section above titled "Customer Support". This is a very low cost service so it's not surprising that there is NO phone support. They do have a knowledgebase on their website which includes some "how-to" videos and frequently asked questions, as well as a live chat option.
We reached out to magicJack's tech support with a hypothetical issue that we considered uncommon to test out the persons knowledge. Here is the live chat:

This is the meat of the conversation - the rest of the unseen messages primarily consist of profuse appreciative statements from the live chat person. We were also presented with a link to claim a 5 year contract extension for a grand total of about $70. In a nutshell, the live chat person was able to provide an answer even though it was a somewhat obscure request. This is just an example and of course does not cover all scenarios so is not necessarily a true representation of their support as a whole.
Final Thoughts
The only remaining item to test was returning the device. This can be an important step for those who decide it is not for them during the trial period. Returning the product was straight forward and simple we are glad to say. It consisted of entering in a little information, confirming that indeed we wanted to cancel and then getting an RMA authorization to include in the return shipment.
Overall, we had a positive experience with the magicJack Plus device and phone service. The sound quality was acceptable during our testing, although it must be noted we have a high quality Internet connection. The main strength and attraction is quite clearly the low cost. If cost is your only priority then this service is worth considering. The weaknesses include no customer service phone line and the reduced feature set compared with typical VoIP services in the market today. There are also some quirks with the mobile App, although it is a nice feature to have and does work.
Based on it's low cost we would certainly recommend this device to anyone who was looking for a second phone line that was not for critical use. If you are considering this option for your main home phone line then we recommend you consider what is important to you most (cost, customer service, features etc) and to also look through the user submitted reviews before making your decision.



magicJack Overview
From the over 70 user submitted reviews below since 2008 you can see a mixed reaction of experiences. One of the biggest complaints is related to customer service, which is only available through live chat on the website (click on the customer service tab for more information). However, for the very low annual fee its hard to see how CS could be extended without adding more cost to the end user. Overall, the user's average rating is "OK". Please browse through the reviews below or add your own based on your experience.
...Overall, the service is at a good price. Customer service is at the bottom of any telecom service I have used so far...
...Very happy with it for the price, but if you don't have the patience or minimum knowledge to connect it reliably, I would recommend something easier with better customer service....

I have been without a phone for five (5) days,and two days ago I talked to so many people that could not 
fix my telephone under Volume/Headset controls.  I tried to 
explain what was wrong but the individuals I spoke to were unable to understand what I was saying or said 
they couldn't fix it. I am furious at this point. I wrote an email to the manager but have not received a reply.

I love MagicJack!
Pro: It is a great service for a little bit of money!
Con: This is BIG!  For some reason, MagicJack does not support NOMOROBO!  It is a service that works!  MagicJack does nothing to help with scam 
calls!  If they can't block them through their own service, why not allow Nomorobo to do it for them!  Come on, help us to stop these 
annoying phone calls!  Even our cable provider offered assistance!

I have three magic jacks that I located in three separate properties.  The first 
issue I encountered is that each had to have its own email address and had to be 
associated to a separate computer or laptop.  My main device started acting up 
about 3 months ago, I had to pay about $9 each time to replace the adaptor.  Only 
two weeks and bad again.  MJ wants to sell me an upgrade instead of replace or 
allow me to use a device I no longer use, but with my home number.  Too 
inflexible on cleaning any of these issues up.  Want to sell me more when I 
already have plenty - they just wont let me use it!  Each time it acts up, no one 
can call in and it can be days before you know it, goes to VM.  Not recommended 
to do business with this company until they improve support and attitude toward 
their customers.

I have been using MagicJack then
MagicJack Plus
for around 3 years now. The past
6 months the STATIC
on all calls (in and
out) is horrendous.
You cannot hear almost
anything, except
STATIC. Wasted hours
on-line with
MagicJack's customer
service quite a few
times. A bunch of
idiots! After 1 hour
I'm always told "Let
me get you to a
higher-up tech rep".
So why'd they waste
my time for an hour?
Looking to change
phone provider right
now. MagicJack is
probably the most
inexpensive phone
service but the
aggravation and lost
calls and STATIC makes it
not worth the
savings.

I have had MJ+ for a few years and had no problems. It is plugged into the wall, with a phone by it, and 
an extension phone in another room.  It works as well as the land line and message recorder it replaced. 
At setup, I had to deal with typing and waiting for customer service to answer my questions, but I haven't 
had to deal with that since it was set up, so that doesn't bother me.  I did not have trouble with 
customer service, but without voice service, I can't give them the best rating. If you don't know the 
least thing about computers or electronics, or just don't want to fiddle with it,  you probably need to 
search for a service with a person you can actually talk to. For the rest, you can deal easily enough with 
MJ. I like it because it works well, sounds good and is economical!

I have been using MagicJack for 6 years.  The price of the service is right, really right.  Over the years 
MagicJack service has improved.  In the past there were many rural-area phone systems which did not accept 
MagicJack calls.  Now it appears that I can use MagicJack everywhere.  When I use it with some people 
their voice appears to be a little weak.  With others the volume is fine.  One thing to note, if you have 
decent WIFI service you can call the US from anywhere in the world, free.  I have used my MagicJack from France 
and Central America.  The MagicJack support system is a little spartan, but eventually they have solved my 
problems, and the price is a real bargain.

I had to cancel because Magicjack does not support Nomorobo. If you are plagued by telemarketers, you MUST have 
Nomorobo. It started the day I started Magicjack phone service. I quit, and went to Phone Power and literally the same day the 
calls stopped right after I setup Nomorobo. So, you get what you pay for. Phone power is about $9 month versus $5 for Magicjack.

I would recommend it for low use landline and not very important phone line. They need to work on the 
cellphone application to integrate it to the current smart phones. There is a delay in the connection, 
and if you don't have the app open, you'll probably miss the call. As far as texting, the delay is even 
worse. If someone sends you 2 parts text, the shortest text will arrive first regardless of the order it 
was sent. If someone sends an email address, the second part @xxxx.com never arrives! Only the first 
part before the @ sign. The voice calls are good ONLY if you are in a WiFi area with full reception!

My 5 year subscription expired
a few months ago,
03/2016. Up until
that point, my
MagicJack was used
only for making long
distance calls.
Clarity was as good
as calling my next
door neighbor, and
the person on the
other end couldn't
tell the difference
between this service
and my land line.
During my
subscription I had
no need for customer
service, other than
assigning me a
phone
number. Service was
straight forward,
and results were
favorable. 
  
I have been shopping
around for (MJ)
renewal or a different
VoIP provider, as I
can't justify my
current $39
CenturyLink
monthly land line
fee, nor, $75
monthly for a cell
phone, as I don't
use a telephone on a
daily basis. Still
shopping. 

From my experience,
using MagicJack, I
would recommend.
Simple, straight
forward, good
results and cheap.

WhichVoIP Visitor Comments #80 : Posted by Sandra Finlin
I read that Magic Jack does not have to be 
connected to a computer.  Is this true?
-> Response: Yes that is true. The old MagicJack device had to be connected to a PC but the newer ones can be connected to a PC or used standalone.  
#79 : Posted by Gary Hart
Installed magicjack 3 months ago, and have 
sporadic "breaking up" of conversations. Have purchased 
new cordless phone set with all new handsets, and 
upload bandwith is 782 kbps, which is 5 times required. 
All connections are secure and snug fitting, and device is 
hooked directly to wireless modem. Please help.
-> Response: When it breaks up is it both directions or just 1 way e.g. uplink to the other person? Please run our voip test and let us know the results. Also ensure nothing else is running on your Internet at the time, as a test. Limited bandwidth by the sounds of things which may be causing issues if other devices using your Internet at the same time.

I want to use the
Magic Jack for
incoming Fax. Fax is
currently on a LAN
line. Can I just
plug in the Magic
Jack into the Router
and Fax into the
Magic Jack?
-> Response: You should be able to connect the MJ to your fax machine instead of your analog phone and it will receive your fax. Faxing over the Internet is not as reliable as landlines and MJ does not officially support this but usually it is successful.  
#77 : Posted by Marty
Do I have connect my router and answering machine to 
the Magic Jack?
-> Response: You need to connect the MagicJack to your Internet (could be direct to a modem or through a switch or router). Magic Jack has voicemail and voicemail to email so no need to use your answering machine.  
#76 : Posted by Marty
If I purchase the newest MagicJack, can I use multiple 
phones?
-> Response: Yes you can. The easiest way is to use cordless phones. Alternatively connect to your home internal phone wiring and use phones throughout the house. You just have to be careful with the landline coming into the house in the second case as it is powered by the old landline provider so really should be disconnected at the side of the house.

i currently have a MAGIC JACK device and the quality  is 
TERRIBLE!!!! The people on the other end ALWAYS tell me 
there is a beeping sound like I am pressing the buttons. 
Also they tell me the calls fade in and out. So as you can 
see I am VERY leary in purchasing another VOIP service but I can 
not stand to use this MAGIC JACK one more day!!! I am on 
a limited budget and sometimes it will be days before my 
phone rings. I also don't use it much to make outgoing 
calls either nut I still want piece of mind in having a land 
line phone. Please advise me as to what plan would be 
best for me. Also, if it ends up being the quality of the 
MAGIC JACK I now have will I be able to return it if I am 
not satisfied?
-> Response: Try running our VoIP test to see if there is an issue with your Internet connection. This may be the issue rather than MagicJack so worth trying this before looking at any other provider. Many providers offer 30 day cancellation. We normally advise running the VoIP test, then choose a provider that has the option to cancel and when you order, choose a new phone number. Test the service and if happy port any existing numbers over. This tends to ensure a hassle-free approach.

Can I get my existing CenturyTel number transferred to Magic 
Jack?
-> Response: You should be able to. There are a few corner cases but it is usually fine to port your number over. A word of warning though, don't cancel CenturyTel until the port has been done as otherwise you could lose the number. Also I would recommend testing the MJ service first to make sure you are happy with it before doing the number transfer.  
#73 : Posted by Dan Nielsen
I recently signed up with MagicJack and am totally 
satisfied with their service and support.  Setup may be 
complicated for some, but their online support will talk 
you through any problems you encounter.  My son, who 
recommended MagicJack to me has been using them for 
3 years with no problems.
 
#72 : Posted by Robert Thomas
I've had both Magic Jack and the Plus 
version. The regular one was not 
dependable but when they came out with MJ Plus I got it 
and can't tell the difference from Verizon. I bought the 5 
year plan after seeing how good it was, feeling like I was 
stealing it, for $99.00. That was about 3 months of phone 
service with Verizon if I didn't make long distance calls. 
When my 5 years are up I'll renew it even though I've got 
Viber on my cell phone & PC and Skype on my PC. 
 
#71 : Posted by George A
I have had magic
Jack for years, And
want to renew my
service for 2015,
however, I have been
having some major
problems with this
service. About 30%
to 40% of the time
when there is an
incoming  phone
call, they can hear
us, but we cannot
hear them.
Please let me know
how this can be
fixed before I sign
up again?
-> Response: George, take a look at our troubleshooting guide for some ideas.
If it wasn't an intermittent issue (i.e. 100% problem) I would suggest your firewall is not letting the right ports through.
Often this kind of issue is with your Internet connection, so it may be worth running our VoIP test.
Have you tried using the MagicJack app on a smartphone? Interested to know if it works in WiFi mode and in cell mode.

Voice Over IP based phone 
		solutions have become popular with many companies in recent years. The benefits of this technology include savings of up to 80% on 
		phone bills, feature rich service, ease of implementation, and flexibility.
Business VoIP reviews that have 
		been provided by real 
		users provide a unique insight into various experiences with different services. 
		Like any major decision it is good practice to do your research and 
		compare your options. Reading user reviews should be part of that process, 
		especially with so many solutions on offer in the market today.
Millions of companies have 
		already chosen a VoIP based service as their phone solution, 
		and this wave of adoption is growing larger on a daily basis. Both cost 
		saving and large feature sets are key reasons driving this growth as

		eliminate existing on-premise PBX's.
Each submitted review includes comments

VoIP Equipment Guide for 2017

 Articles




VoIP Equipment Guide for 2017

		To take full advantage of all the 
		benefits that VoIP has to offer, it is necessary to evaluate different 
		VoIP equipment options. Some basic items to 
		consider are listed as follows:

How many new IP phones do you need and what will the upfront cost be?
Are Ethernet ports available in every office?
Do you need to upgrade any network switches to support IP phones and VoIP?

The good news is that your service provider will be able to help answer some of these 
		questions with you. The bad news is that you need to research and confirm 
		that the equipment that is being recommended is right for your business, 
		as well as pricing.



Step 1: Decide if You Need New IP Phones
If you are considering changing your 
		phone service provider and your business is already using a hosted VoIP 
		solution or an on-premise VoIP phone system, then there is a good chance 
		that you do not need to purchase new phones. However, it is critical that you 
		confirm phone compatibility with the new service provider that you are 
		considering switching to or it could be a costly mistake.
If your business is switching to 
		hosted VoIP or an on-premise IP enabled phone system, then you will need 
		to either purchase or rent IP phones that support the call control 
		protocols used by the phone service provider you choose. Often, you can purchase equipment directly from the service provider at a good price. Keep an eye out for providers that offer free phones or 2 for the price of 1 deals. This can save you on up front costs and make the switch more viable financially.
Visit our IP Phones section for extensive information on makes and models like Cisco, Polycom and Yealink, plus reviews and more.
Even the most basic IP phones have a 
		good number of features so a business can save a lot of money by 
		selecting the most appropriate phone for its needs. Some popular devices are listed as 
		follows to give you an idea, along with a price guide, number of lines supported and Protocols supported.

* $ = lower cost to $$$$ = Highest cost

Step 2: Identify Other VoIP Equipment Requirements.
Some other items of equipment that 
		you may need to consider purchasing are listed as follows:
Phone Headsets
Average Price Range: < $50
Although IP phones have excellent speakerphones, the majority of employees will likely prefer to use a headset to keep conversations private and respect their work neighbors
Compare popular headsets >>
Power Supplies for IP Phones
Average Price Range: < $50
Required if Power over Ethernet (PoE) is not available in your setup.
Power over Ethernet (PoE) Switches
Average Price Range: Varies
Preferred method of powering IP 
				phones and avoids the extra cost of power supplies. Pricing 
				depends on port count and software features. Quality of service 
				(QoS) feature support should be evaluated to ensure voice 
				packets are properly prioritized over data in the IP packet. QoS 
				helps avoid choppy or dropped calls.
Router Additions/Upgrades
Average Price Range: Varies
New or upgraded routers may be 
				required to ensure redundancy, throughput and packet 
				prioritization.
Analog Telephony Adaptors (ATA)
Average Price Range: $50 to $100
You can continue to use your existing analog phones but they will need an ATA to work. That means you need to purchase an ATA for every 
				existing Analog phone that you want to keep and use. Due to the cost and the productivity benefits of IP phones this may not work out a good choice in the long run.
Compare popular phone adaptors (ATAs) >>
Ethernet Cabling
Average Price Range: Varies
Purchasing and installing CAT5e 
				Ethernet cable can be expensive depending on the size of the 
				installation. Most offices will already have this cabling 
				installed but it is definitely worth checking to avoid a costly 
				surprise.
Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS)
Average Price Range: Varies
Network equipment should already be 
				connected to a UPS to avoid issues during power outages. If no 
				UPS currently exists, then it is recommended that a UPS is 
				installed to ensure that phones (and service) keep 
				working during a power outage.
On-Premise System
If you are seeking an on-premise 
		system, then it is likely that you will need to perform a 
		very thorough evaluation of your existing network. Most service providers can help with this and advise on any recommendations.
Step 3: The Bottom Line
Although additional equipment is 
		often required to be purchased when upgrading to a VoIP solution, the 
		overall benefits typically far outweigh this cost. Businesses should 
		evaluate the annual cost savings that such a solution can offer while 
		considering any up front equipment expenses. In most cases the overall 
		cost savings and productivity increases that VoIP provides will easily 
		justify any potential equipment upgrades.
For 
		businesses that are currently researching to find the best service 
		solution, please take a look at our table of popular providers below:

About WhichVoIP
WhichVoIP was founded from a discussion about the future of VoIP as a viable phone service between a group of telecommunication experts back in 2004. With experience in the Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP) field they were convinced that over the coming years both the home and business markets would begin switching to this technology.
There are many VoIP companies offering various plans to consumers and businesses and it is often difficult and time consuming to determine exactly what you are getting from each provider plan, and which is right for you.  It was for this reason that we decided to provide all of this information on our website to help you, our visitors, make an informed decision. Depending on your calling habits, moving to a broadband phone service from a regular phone service can save you up to 80% on your telephone bills.
Over the years we have established partnerships with most of the service providers in the industry allowing us to offer you deals that are often better than those you would get by going direct to the provider's website. Our service comes at absolutely no cost to you.
What started out as helping a few hundred people per year, we now get over 1 million visitors per year and we have helped process over 100,000 free custom price quotes for businesses looking to make the switch.

Hear What Some Happy Visitors Have to Say



			We decided that VOIP made sense for us. We knew we wouldn't have the time to research all the options out there
			on our own, so we decided to use WhichVOIP to find the best solution for us. Within minutes of filling out the 
			submission form I was being contacted by 3 providers. By 24 hours later we were close to choosing a winner. 
			The process was quick and easy and we found a solution that works for our business.

			When our small business decided that we would work with a virtual administrative assistant we want on a search 
			to find out how to do that.  WhichVoIP made this process so easy.  We filled out a very simple form and 
			within a few minutes we received responses from several providers.  We were able to to talk with a representative for 
			each of these providers and get a better idea for what we were looking for and what would be a good fit. 
			I thought this process was going to be very painful, but WhichVoIP made it easy.

History[edit]
VocalTec was founded in 1989 by Alon Cohen and Lior Haramaty, its initial operations were devoted to research and commercialization of products which provide audio and voice capabilities for personal computers and over computer networks. Cohen and Haramaty developed and manufactured a PC sound card (SpeechBoard TM) that was sold mainly to the local visually impaired community in Israel with a unique Text to Speech software enabling blind people to use a computer in the Hebrew language.[4] In 1990, technology entrepreneur Elon Ganor joined the company as CEO and Chairman,[5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15]
In 1993, the Company introduced its first commercial product, The CAT, a peripheral device which provides audio capability for personal computers. In 1993 and 1994, the Company introduced additional products, including CATBoard, a full duplex audio card, an internal audio card that provides high level compression. Net sales of these products totaled approximately $0.3 million, $0.4 Million and $0.2 Million in 1993, 1994 and the first nine months of 1995, respectively, and the Company did not expect to recognize significant revenues from sales of these products in the future.[16]
Ganor decided to shift the company's focus to software, and in 1993 VocalChat was born, a software that enabled voice communication from one PC to another on a local and wide area network, and VocalChat LAN/WAN, a hardware and software products that enable real-time voice conversations over local and wide area computer networks.[17] The software was developed by a group of developers including Ofer Kahana (later the founder of Kagoor Networks that was sold to Juniper Networks),[18] Elad Sion (Served in Israel TOP 8200 Intelligence army unit, died young in a car accident), Ofer Shem Tov (A software developer in Israel)[11] and others. The software was presented in Atlanta in May 1993 at the Network InterOp trade show.[11] In 1994 support for Internet Protocol was added and on Friday, February 10, 1995 “Internet Phone“ was launched with a near full page Wall Street Journal article by WSJ Boston Correspondent Bill Bulkeley, “Hello World! Audible chats On the Internet” was the header.[7]
In early 1993 the company partnered with ClassX, a group of innovative teenagers, some were during their army service at renowned Unit 8200. According to Opher Kahane, one of ClassX co-founders, "Few people know that, while VocalTec may have developed voice boards for PCs, it was ClassX that developed the technology that makes VoIP transmission possible."[19] ClassX was acquired by VocalTec in 1993 and its core team developed the first VocalChat product and later on the first Internet Phone, a modified version of VocalChat.
VocalTec Internet Phone[edit]
VocalTec released the first ever Internet VoIP application in February 1995. The product was named Internet Phone but according to Wired magazing many people simply called it iPhone; and was the world's first VoIP based PC to Phone software solution.[2][20]
The software was invented by Alon Cohen and Lior Haramaty, the two co-founders of VocalTec Ltd.[1][21][22] At the base of the Internet Phone residing the invention of Alon Cohen and Lior Haramaty named the "Audio Transceiver", which managed the dynamic jitter buffer that was critical for achieving adaptive lower possible audio latency along with handling packet loss, packet re-ordering, and receiver transmitter sample rate adjustments. The first implementation of the "Audio Transceiver" was carried out by Elad Sion.[3]
Initial Public Offering[edit]
VocalTec had an initial public offering on the NASDAQ on February 6, 1996. The company sold 2,500,000 shares for $19 a share. 1,750,00 shares were sold by the company and 750,000 were sold by selling shareholders including Elon Ganor, VocalTec's CEO and his brother in law, Ami Tal, through their holding of La Cresta International Trading Inc.[23] VocalTec's leadership who managed its successful IPO included:[24] Elon Ganor - Chairman of the board and CEO, Ami Tal - Director and Chief Operating Officer, Alon Cohen - Director and Chief Technology Officer, Lior Haramaty - Director and Vice President Technical Marketing, Yahal Zilka - Chief Financial officer and Secretary, Daniel Nissan - Vice President Marketing, Ohad Finkelstein - Vice President International Sales,
In 1997, Deltathree, an American company engaged in the business of voice over IP telephony services, launched an Internet-based international low cost calling service using VocalTec's VoIP technology, and VocalTec Internet Phone "PC to Phone" solution.[25] The same year, Europe's largest telecommunications company, Deutsche Telekom, bought a 21.1 percent stake in VocalTec for $48.3 million, in addition to purchasing $30 million in telephony products, services, and support over the following two-and-a-half years.[26] During the Dot-com bubble the company’s share peaked at a price of $3,363 per share on March 3, 2000 (split adjusted).[27]
In 2005, completed a business combination with Tdsoft, a provider of VoIP Gateways.[28] and refocused on providing carrier-class multimedia and voice-over-IP solutions for communication service providers. The company's Essentra solution suite, comprised the essential building blocks required to develop a next-generation-network, addressing customers’ specific requirements in trunking, peering and residential/enterprise VoIP application solutions.
Reverse merger with magicJack[edit]
On July 16, 2010, MagicJack took over VocalTec in a reverse takeover.
ITXC[edit]
In 1997, VocalTec founded ITXC Corporation a US-based wholesale provider of Internet-based phone calls. The ITXC voice-over-IP network was powered by the VocalTec technology. The company was founded after Vocaltec's CEO at the time, Elon Ganor met Tom Evslin from AT&T (who led at the time WorldNet AT&T ISP initiative) in a conference, ITXC was founded, with Tom Evslin as its CEO and cofounder.[29] VocalTec invested an initial $500K ITXC Corporation and gave a credit of $1Million in VoIP Gateway equipment in exchange of 19.9% of the company, AT&T followed with an additional investment.[30] ITXC became the world's largest VoIP Carrier reaching a market cap of about $8 Billion as a Nasdaq company in 2000 (prior to the March 2000 Dot com crash).[31]
In 2003 ITXC was acquired by Teleglobe.[32]

History[edit]
VocalTec was founded in 1989 by Alon Cohen and Lior Haramaty, its initial operations were devoted to research and commercialization of products which provide audio and voice capabilities for personal computers and over computer networks. Cohen and Haramaty developed and manufactured a PC sound card (SpeechBoard TM) that was sold mainly to the local visually impaired community in Israel with a unique Text to Speech software enabling blind people to use a computer in the Hebrew language.[4] In 1990, technology entrepreneur Elon Ganor joined the company as CEO and Chairman,[5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15]
In 1993, the Company introduced its first commercial product, The CAT, a peripheral device which provides audio capability for personal computers. In 1993 and 1994, the Company introduced additional products, including CATBoard, a full duplex audio card, an internal audio card that provides high level compression. Net sales of these products totaled approximately $0.3 million, $0.4 Million and $0.2 Million in 1993, 1994 and the first nine months of 1995, respectively, and the Company did not expect to recognize significant revenues from sales of these products in the future.[16]
Ganor decided to shift the company's focus to software, and in 1993 VocalChat was born, a software that enabled voice communication from one PC to another on a local and wide area network, and VocalChat LAN/WAN, a hardware and software products that enable real-time voice conversations over local and wide area computer networks.[17] The software was developed by a group of developers including Ofer Kahana (later the founder of Kagoor Networks that was sold to Juniper Networks),[18] Elad Sion (Served in Israel TOP 8200 Intelligence army unit, died young in a car accident), Ofer Shem Tov (A software developer in Israel)[11] and others. The software was presented in Atlanta in May 1993 at the Network InterOp trade show.[11] In 1994 support for Internet Protocol was added and on Friday, February 10, 1995 “Internet Phone“ was launched with a near full page Wall Street Journal article by WSJ Boston Correspondent Bill Bulkeley, “Hello World! Audible chats On the Internet” was the header.[7]
In early 1993 the company partnered with ClassX, a group of innovative teenagers, some were during their army service at renowned Unit 8200. According to Opher Kahane, one of ClassX co-founders, "Few people know that, while VocalTec may have developed voice boards for PCs, it was ClassX that developed the technology that makes VoIP transmission possible."[19] ClassX was acquired by VocalTec in 1993 and its core team developed the first VocalChat product and later on the first Internet Phone, a modified version of VocalChat.
VocalTec Internet Phone[edit]
VocalTec released the first ever Internet VoIP application in February 1995. The product was named Internet Phone but according to Wired magazing many people simply called it iPhone; and was the world's first VoIP based PC to Phone software solution.[2][20]
The software was invented by Alon Cohen and Lior Haramaty, the two co-founders of VocalTec Ltd.[1][21][22] At the base of the Internet Phone residing the invention of Alon Cohen and Lior Haramaty named the "Audio Transceiver", which managed the dynamic jitter buffer that was critical for achieving adaptive lower possible audio latency along with handling packet loss, packet re-ordering, and receiver transmitter sample rate adjustments. The first implementation of the "Audio Transceiver" was carried out by Elad Sion.[3]
Initial Public Offering[edit]
VocalTec had an initial public offering on the NASDAQ on February 6, 1996. The company sold 2,500,000 shares for $19 a share. 1,750,00 shares were sold by the company and 750,000 were sold by selling shareholders including Elon Ganor, VocalTec's CEO and his brother in law, Ami Tal, through their holding of La Cresta International Trading Inc.[23] VocalTec's leadership who managed its successful IPO included:[24] Elon Ganor - Chairman of the board and CEO, Ami Tal - Director and Chief Operating Officer, Alon Cohen - Director and Chief Technology Officer, Lior Haramaty - Director and Vice President Technical Marketing, Yahal Zilka - Chief Financial officer and Secretary, Daniel Nissan - Vice President Marketing, Ohad Finkelstein - Vice President International Sales,
In 1997, Deltathree, an American company engaged in the business of voice over IP telephony services, launched an Internet-based international low cost calling service using VocalTec's VoIP technology, and VocalTec Internet Phone "PC to Phone" solution.[25] The same year, Europe's largest telecommunications company, Deutsche Telekom, bought a 21.1 percent stake in VocalTec for $48.3 million, in addition to purchasing $30 million in telephony products, services, and support over the following two-and-a-half years.[26] During the Dot-com bubble the company’s share peaked at a price of $3,363 per share on March 3, 2000 (split adjusted).[27]
In 2005, completed a business combination with Tdsoft, a provider of VoIP Gateways.[28] and refocused on providing carrier-class multimedia and voice-over-IP solutions for communication service providers. The company's Essentra solution suite, comprised the essential building blocks required to develop a next-generation-network, addressing customers’ specific requirements in trunking, peering and residential/enterprise VoIP application solutions.
Reverse merger with magicJack[edit]
On July 16, 2010, MagicJack took over VocalTec in a reverse takeover.
ITXC[edit]
In 1997, VocalTec founded ITXC Corporation a US-based wholesale provider of Internet-based phone calls. The ITXC voice-over-IP network was powered by the VocalTec technology. The company was founded after Vocaltec's CEO at the time, Elon Ganor met Tom Evslin from AT&T (who led at the time WorldNet AT&T ISP initiative) in a conference, ITXC was founded, with Tom Evslin as its CEO and cofounder.[29] VocalTec invested an initial $500K ITXC Corporation and gave a credit of $1Million in VoIP Gateway equipment in exchange of 19.9% of the company, AT&T followed with an additional investment.[30] ITXC became the world's largest VoIP Carrier reaching a market cap of about $8 Billion as a Nasdaq company in 2000 (prior to the March 2000 Dot com crash).[31]
In 2003 ITXC was acquired by Teleglobe.[32]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
