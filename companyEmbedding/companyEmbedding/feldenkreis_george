A Cuban Jew Who Sells Products From Japan Succeeds In Miami - tribunedigital-chicagotribune




 



A Cuban Jew Who Sells Products From Japan Succeeds In MiamiAugust 05, 1990|By Derek Reveron, Knight-Ridder Newspapers.MIAMI √¢¬Ä¬î George Feldenkreis arrived in Miami from Havana in 1961 with his pregnant wife, his 1-year-old son, a law degree useless in the United States and $700. He set out to establish an import business. In the process, he tackled a cross-cultural business challenge almost unheard of in those days: He was a Jewish Cuban trying to sell Japanese auto parts to American companies. What`s more, he gambled that an almost non-existent market for Japanese-made auto parts would take off.His long shot paid.Within a year, he founded Carfel, an importer of automobile and motorcycle parts. Next, he founded Supreme International, an importer of guayabera shirts (pleated, embroidered Cuban shirts), now headed by his son, Oscar. Then came Foreign Parts Distributors, followed by Diamond Electronics. Two years ago, Feldenkreis and three business partners started Universal National Bank.Today, Feldenkreis` firms have 250 employees and $50 million in revenue. All the businesses are profitable, he says, and their combined sales are increasing 12 percent a year. His goal is to build a $200 million business.Carfel has provided the financial nourishment for the growth of Feldenkreis` holdings. The company`s success stems from his early cultivation of the Japanese market. Feldenkreis began importing and selling Japanese car parts long before Japanese exports began to dominate the U.S. market. When the export flood began, Carfel was poised for profit.Along with business success has come a rise in social prominence. Feldenkreis has seen to that: ``If you`re working to get better things in life, one of the things you want is recognition from your peers.``He has made the transformation from stranger in a strange land to familiar and influential figure on Miami`s Cuban and Jewish business/social landscapes. He divides his time and money between the two cultures.With a Jewish delegation, he met former President Ronald Reagan in Hollywood, in 1983. With Cuban dignitaries he saw Reagan at the White House in 1985. With Cubans, again, he met the president in Miami in 1986.``He mixes as casually and comfortably as anyone might imagine in both worlds,`` says Lawrence Perl, a business partner in the Universal National Bank venture. ``He has the flavor of his Cuban background, and he is a very proud Jew.``He has built a reputation as a generous contributor to Jewish and Cuban organizations. His wife, Dorita, hosts some of Miami`s grandest and most culturally diverse parties.Friends describe Feldenkreis, 54, as gregarious, smart and methodical.``He takes his time making a decision, but when he makes it, it`s usually the right one,`` says Miami architect Moises Chorowski, who has known Feldenkreis since they both lived in Havana.That`s where Feldenkreis was born. His parents immigrated to Cuba from the Ukraine in 1924. His father was a photographer at Sloppy Joe`s, an internationally popular Havana night spot. He took pictures of celebrities such as Spencer Tracy, Jean Harlow and Mae West.In 1956, while in law school, Feldenkreis suggested that his father strike up a business relationship with Japanese manufacturers. He wasn`t interested. So Feldenkreis and his brother started their own business. They sold products made in Japan such as Formica and auto parts.The business was uprooted after Fidel Castro seized power and Feldenkreis came to Miami.Feldenkreis is rich and charitable. He donates more than 10 percent of his revenue each year to organizations and groups, most of them Jewish or Cuban, he says.Wealthy people who don`t give annoy him.``I have very little respect for them. People who make money and aren`t charitable have a character flaw,`` he said.

Joining us today for this call from Perry Ellis are George Feldenkreis, Executive Chairman of the Company; Oscar Feldenkreis, Chief Executive Officer and President; and David Rattner, Chief Financial Officer.
I would now like to turn the call over to George Feldenkreis.
George Feldenkreis
Good morning. We're glad to report another good quarter for Perry Ellis International. While numerous macroeconomic issues are affecting the apparel industry in the United States and worldwide, we are pleased to report that this was a quarter where we were able to improve analyst estimates and build the guidance for Perry.
We are fully focused on growing our core global brands. Through our excellent inventory management coupled with our strong product performance, we delivered an adjusted gross margin of 37.6%, a full 90 basis point ahead of last year. We will continue focusing on our growth to drive our gross margin to 40% over the next few years.
We managed SG&A very well despite of rising cost and overhead and trends, allowing us to report an adjusted EBITDA margin of 8.2 for the quarter, compared to 6.6 at the end of fiscal year. With this backdrop, we're confident to project an increase in revenues for this year to a range of 870 million to 880 million in revenue. We are confirming our earning guidance for the year in the range of adjusted earnings per share of 2.07 to 2.17. This represents an increase over adjusted EPS last year.
Despite that, consumer behavior is changing so much, so rapidly, which approached great question as to the future of the apparel business. We feel that we have been building the right infrastructure to be successful in this new environment. We're concentrated with a focus approach to various growth global core brand and businesses, which are Perry Ellis, Original Penguin, Golf Lifestyle, Savane, Cubavera on the women brands as well as Farah in Europe.
Oscar will inform you about the performance of each of those brands. We're very proud that through the years we have developed a very-very diversified and balanced customer base that can achieve solid results despite the fact that some of our business partners are experiencing sales decline. We all know that the department store brick-and-mortar business has been heavily impacted by the growth of e-commerce, especially on the women's side by the advent of the vertical European retailers like Zara, H&M, Primark and Japanese Uniqlo.
The department store business represents approximately 29% of our business. We think that retailers have taken the right step to reduce their store base and close underperforming store. As they diminish in size, the lower inventory niche will allow them to increase their cash flow and increase the cash availability, which will help them improve the performance in the years ahead. We're also applauding the changes that retailers are making to receive flows, ensuring that goods are hitting selling floor and customers are shopping thereby driving faster turns or reduced markdowns for them and for us.. This will provide a more level flow for our quarterly reporting as well as on our quarter by quarter basis.

Generally speaking, we believe that the new reduce retail space in America is a very positive development in the long run. It provides retailer with more flexibility to maneuver the tremendous demographic implication of generation D and Y, versus generation X and baby boomers. The generational moves are creating a new paradigm which brands and retailers better learn to navigate, if they want to succeed. From a working capital perspective, we're able to reduce our inventory to 140 million compared to 151 million at the end of last quarter. This is our lowest inventory in many years.
The strategic reduction in inventory allows to drive more profitable top line and allows your company to enter the new fiscal year in a very healthy condition. Needless to say, we're extremely proud of the progress we continue to make towards our near and long-term objectives. On the international side, we continue to be very bullish in the United Kingdom and Europe as well as Mexico and Canada. Business in the UK is already improving considerably while at the same time we continue to increase our business in the continent.
The first quarter was a good indication that our business is strengthening in the continent and the UK. The consumer will always expect in the higher prices consequence of the evaluation of the costs. We've seen that by the second half of the year, our foreign exchange losses which have reduced our earnings for the last eight quarters will improve considerably. As a matter fact, we're reviewing the possibilities of establishing on operation in the Netherland to be able to better serve the continental cost.
We continue to execute against our strategic initiative to grow our international business. In the first quarter, international revenues grew 4.7% and accounted for 11.1% of total revenue up from last year 9.8%. For the full-year, we expect international growth would to grow nearly to $80 million, 20% of our year-over-year to generate 13% of our revenue up from last year 11%. We remain quite bullish about our business in Europe. Our launch of Nike Swim across Europe is exceeding expectations.
Our latest Farah Brand continues its strong growth 20% year-over-year and is expanding to non-UK business into European market behind Urban Outfitter ASOS, Zalando and specialty accounts are opted due to business in the continent grew over 40% this year as we expand this reduction in Germany and open new markets such as Greece, Israel and soon South Africa. And Callaway, which is today the best and most popular golf line in the world is increasing its footprint and penetration in profitable big box or in goods and golf specialty retailer to compliment our core green grass and independent accounts.
We are managing now six brands in Europe, Original Penguin, Farah Vintage, Farah Classic, Callaway, Ben Hogan and most recently Nike Swim. This gives us a lot of leverage to open totally different channel of this reduction which are critical for the future of our growth, ideas and projections for Europe. We expect that our business in Canada will grow over 20% year-over-year led by strong Perry Ellis performance [indiscernible] accounts in Canada, then Europe and Mexico, we benefit from our diverse portfolio brands excluding Nike and other fashion in Swim brand and golf led by Callaway and PGA Tour.
Finally, Mexico despite currently another challenge we continue to record double digit growth as we optimize our direct Nike Swim and others swim business with Marty, Liverpool and other important accounts. For the quarter, international grew by 14% versus last year. On the retail and direct-to-consumer front, we experienced sales decline more notably in our full price stores and shoe outlets. Launching 10 stores for last year cost us $4.7 million in revenues and this quarter costs us above another $1.5 million. However, our retail sales were much more profitable this quarter than we have had in the number of years. The store that we were depriving this year will reduce sales by about 1.6 million, but again we will have improved our revenues per share.

By the end of the year, we project to have 59 stores in the United States. We will continue opening store book with a more selective approach and in areas where rental in line with the potential revenue that these stores could generate in such sense. On the licensing front, during this quarter we terminated the relationship with the major licensee and gave that product license to our current licensee that will now have better opportunities to self product that relate with other was a onetime hit. As we called out in November, quarter-over-quarter comparisons are distorted by some extraordinary transition in any one year.
And while our licensing partners are not immune from retail another challenge, we continue to see organic growth which complements our expansion in new categories and market. We have been especially encouraged by growth in Perry Ellis luggage and footwear with revenue increasing 52% over prior year, our successful launch of our Original Penguin Home Fashion with few partners such as Deluxe and Bed Bath and Beyond by our triple digit success and leverage in the brand equity and momentum of Farah in Europe.
As well as our traction, we got another brands in your portfolio to ultimately generate meaningful licensee income. We expect four no agreements in this quarter, three of which are in international market and we have a robust pipeline of new licensees, we expect to conclude over the next several quarter. We remain on track to achieve our targets of 20% to 25% no agreement to 20% to 25% no agreement across our portfolio brands. We're projecting approximately 180 licenses by year end. We continue to focus shopper in the digital world.
We have always been forward thinking on technology and we've seen throughout the years, how different disruptions have influenced to date market in the United State. The original disruptors were really the off-price challenge plus and lower price share. This brought commoditization of product that helps their growth as prices kept declining. Our department stores unfortunately did not see that coming. Furthermore, vertical foreign companies with superior speed to market innovation and fast delivery like Zara, H&M, Primark and Uniqlo strong affected the women's side of the business again striking many brick-and-mortar retails very hard.
E-commerce was a major disruptor. Everybody knew that e-commerce was going to grow, but some retailers did not see that way and came in with very late. Amazon successfully operated a non-profitable organization which allowed to build an amazing tech company and now it controlled 43% of searches and keep growing worldwide. The next disruptor in the years ahead and a very well be artificial intelligence, AI, which will continue to disrupt the all retail models. And on top of all that the increase in real estate values brought super high rents which many retailers could not effort to pay.
All of the above five have contributed to the presence state of the first in the retail business, so the question is what are we going to do? At Perry Ellis, we indentified many of these trends early and because of this we have been able to transition our company to our successful model for the present and for the future. We're always concerned of our long-term profitability even if it has shortened profit. We see the changes in demographic increase in sales via smartphone apps, making it easier and easier to shop on your phone. This will continue to have a big influence in sales and apparel and almost every other category.
We have adopted and implemented several digital initiatives using new state-of-the-art software in order to lower our cost of design and production. We're working to reduce our distribution cost by the end of the year. We have also acquired data mining software and joined our software partners to help us grow substantially our onsite sales as well as our retail customer digital sales. Fit to market is an extremely important initiative it's obvious in the fact that Adidas has through their ability to replenish sold their products in just 45 days. Nike has also announced that they plan to double their supply and change speed.

The investment in the last two years in new plants and equipment in Asia to be able to make apparel better, faster and cheaper are really mindboggling. You have to go to Asia and visit some of these super modern factories to realize how much money has been invested in the future. Our strategy has worked very well and it has allowed us to establish a strong foothold in different channels, in different geographies and in different areas Perry Ellis and product lines.
We're very proud that our financial condition is the strongest in 20 years. For this quarter, the Company performance and working capital discipline has resulted in a lower net debt to capitalization of 24.3%. We have a very strong balance sheet ready for growth in both the United States as well as international. Your company is in great shape.
Thank you. I will now turn over the call to Oscar.
Oscar Feldenkreis
Thank you, George, and good morning everyone. I'm pleased to be speaking to you today on our first quarter call. The quarter marked a solid start to the year as we delivered sales and earnings above our guidance. As expected, sales rose in our core global brand with earlier shipments of spring merchandize driving the outperformance versus guidance. In total, revenues declined as a planned versus the prior year as we remain laser focused on positioning our brands and the higher productive doors while reducing inventory to improve churns and margins.
Importantly, the execution of this strategy is elevating our powerful core brand with consumers through the continuous introduction of innovative fabrics and our trend apparel and accessories, through the expansions of our marketing to intensify our digital reach and through our actions to make it even easier to shop our brands whenever and wherever consumers choose shop on mobile, online and in store.
During the quarter, we also continued to make progress on our speed to market initiative, which are expected to reduce lead times so that we bring product to stores faster and meet the demands of the retailers today, which are as you know are looking for product closer to the needs of selling. And we maintained our relentless discipline on expenses and inventory management, all of this served us well and positions our company to achieve our core sales and growth for the year across our divisions Golf, Nike, Rafealla contributed to our better than expected sales and earnings performance.
As expected, laundry sales declined as we work on the re-launch of the brand. As we mentioned during our third quarter call last year, we welcome back Veronica Davis to laundry. Veronica led the laundry teams since we acquired it in 2009 and was instrumental in driving the brands growth which more than doubled under our leadership. We have no doubt that she will be equally successful and will ensure that the D&A of the brand matches its customers profile with product execution and marketing.
Turning to reviewing our business beginning with Golf, we are very pleased about our positive performance in golf, which demonstrated our continuous dominance in the Golf apparel business. During the quarter, we saw strength in bottoms as we introduce new pants and shorts with a comfort waistband which have exceeded sales expectations. We also add new fabrics with new motion technology in the manufacturing of the garments. This has lead to a fantastic beginning of the golf seasons for us across all distribution channel and brands in the United States, Canada and Europe.
As we move into the most important quarters for golf, we are very optimistic that these new products will continue to outperform. The importance of stretch is gaining momentum across retailers. We are pleased to be one of the early movers in offering stretch product and expect to capitalize on our proven expertise in this area. The retailers seek us out for. With all these new products in our golf brands which incorporated performance fabrics and stretch offerings, we are ahead of the competition.

Looking ahead, we are very excited about our new fabrics that we will be introducing as well as our pipeline of new initiatives in golf that will continue to drive our performance. We are also very excited about the Jack Nicklaus launch into a large mass retailer with an introduction to 1,650 doors. We are very excited about the new opportunities with this relationship, as it sets the stage for a multitier brand approach. Our golf, Callaway golf business also had a strong quarter with a notable strength in the UK, which I saw as 30% increase in sales.
We're looking to capitalize on the continued success of Callaway's brand performance as recently announced on the earnings call. We renewed our Callaway license agreement through 2022, which has opened the doors for us to pursue new opportunities for growth across the authentic green grass channel, our off-course specialty and better department store channels. We introduced map pricing in Callaway, which has resulted in a positive response from the authentic channel.
During the quarter, we expand the Callaway into Golf Galaxy, PGA Tour Superstore, Academy and Golfhound in Canada just to name a few. We continue to expect golf to continue to grow in high single-digits this year. The first quarter is a largest shipping quarter for the year for Nike Swim and we are pleased with its performance of retail across men's and women's and young athletes and swim gear. Our Nike business continues to perform extremely well in the U.S. and we've seen significant opportunities ahead to expand international.
In fact, we expect to be shipping product into about 30 countries by year end, giving our expanded relationships. As it relates to the product, the expansion of Hydroguard UV protection swim tops continues to perform well, and we expect to build upon the positive momentum with the upcoming deliveries. The introduction of extended sizes in men and women's also has been a success across retail, which is leading to additional growth as additional retailers add this category going forward.
Entering to Q2, we believe that we are well prepared to meet the needs of our customers as well as our e-commerce accounts which are benefitting from a year around demand online. Receptive to the new 2018 Nike spring season product, the preview has been very strong and we're very excited about the introduction into new geography. Overall, we expect to maintain our dominance in the swim market where we're taking share domestically with the expectations of transferring this success on a global scale.
Perry Ellis continues to perform well while the quarter started slow as noted across retail generally, early spring product sold well with particularly strength in linen sportswear. We're very excited about the continuing expansions of Perry Ellis 360 at leisure functional sportswear product. We plan to expand the 360 collection further within the specialty accounts in the second half of the year. Pants under Perry Ellis portfolio performed extremely strong with positive sell through rates across all customers driven by the introduction of the performance, fabrics and new models.
On the e-com side, e-commerce continues to do well both internally and third-party. We're focused on ensuring the experience with the consumer with product in store to online as the same and we will continue investing on ensuring that we‚Äôre positioned for strong growth in e-commerce digital going forward. We will continue to manage inventories very tightly to maintain a strong sell-through and fast return. We feel good about the Perry Ellis prospects Q2, given strong early reads on the newness we delivered ahead of Father's Day.
We're also excited to announce that we have retained a new PR, an ad agency that will help us get our messaging across to the end consumer with an increased emphasis on digital, and we're also looking forward to the August launch of our new Perry Ellis fragrance. As we mentioned in our Q4 call, we named the new President for the Original Penguin brands and are pleased with the early results.

While we saw a fine revenue reduction in Original Penguin as we took a concentrated effort to reduce unproductive retail stores and channels and reduce use, this effort enable us to drive quality sales of full price selling and expand our penetration in productive stores. As a result, we experienced higher internal margins and increase products sell-through at higher AURs across most of our classification with less promotional activities. Early spring leads on swim and tees have been the strong product performance categories.
We will continue to apply this strategy while driving top line growth as well as Original Penguin as a full collection in tops and bottoms there by guarding our penetration and adding higher productive stores. At the same time, we're focusing our marketing on digital and feel that this effort will enable us to align with the Original Penguin consumer that spends an increasing amount of time connected to this end.
Turning to the women's and beginning with laundry. During the quarter, we consciously lowered our in-store inventory to give us a fast return this along with our customer focus on fashion newness versus price and a shift to online assisted us to improve margins. We just completed our fall 17 market and we're very excited about the plans we've received from our core retail partners and have a confidence that the new managements we have in laundry is on track for growth in the second half of the year. 
Rafaella performed above our expectation mainly driven by the early timing of shipments reflecting retailer supporting the new product initiatives. At retail, we saw a sales trend in the April driven by our new initiatives including the introduction of weekend getaway collection products, a traditional company product for Rafaella consumer. In fact all of Rafaella department stores supported this initiative with the weekend getaway launch into 200 stores at Belk, Bon-Ton Dillard's, Boscov and Lord & Taylor.
We will begin delivering monthly capitals of the weekend getaway going forward giving customers something new to browse and buy each time SheShops. Overall, we expect the retail environment to remain challenging with the possibility of additional store closures and retail bankruptcies expected in the USA. Even with this backdrop, we remain confident in our ability to deliver core sales growth as we have aligned our brand and our businesses with higher productive door and the expansion internationally and t direct to consumer.
It is also important to note that we have a diversified brand portfolio, diversified channel and we offer niche lifestyle to service the mass change, stores, department stores and special markets as a company we are very disciplined and focused on managing inventory tightly and delivering product closer to the time of the need while providing a continuous flow of new innovative products to market to deliver our growth and profitability goals.
With that, I would now like to turn the call over to David to review our financial guidance.
David Rattner
Good morning, everyone. In the first quarter as we noted in our press release, we recorded revenues and earnings per share that exceeded our guidance. Consolidated revenues for the quarter totaled 242 million, which was ahead of our guidance, reflecting strength in our core businesses with the earlier shipment of spring merchandize Oscar just spoke about. As compared to the prior year, revenues declined driven by retailers' preference to receive products closer to need to increase their churn which we spoke about on our Q4 call in March, as well as negative foreign exchange and the reduction in owned stores which benefited profitability.
By segment, revenue in our men's sportswear and swim segment totaled 186 million as compared to 198 million in prior year. Increases were noted in our core Golf apparel, Nike Swim and other brands. Revenue in our women's sportswear segment totaled 30 million as compared to 32 million in the year ago period. Increases in our Rafaella business were offset by planned reductions in laundry as discussed by Oscar. Direct-to-consumer revenue totaled 18.2 million as compared to 20.5 million in the prior year mostly due to the closing of 10 stores last year that resulted in a much more profitable store base. Store comp was down 2% in the quarter but comp traffic was down 9% for the quarter as we focused on the customer experience by door.

Also our store comp margins were up nearly 3% for the quarter reflecting the strong consumer response to our product assortment. Total DTC comp sales were down 4% yet comp margin dollars were flat reflecting higher AUR based on a twofold approach. One, being internal pricing strategy, and two, moving away from highly promotional events, overall we were very pleased with our performance in a tough environment. Licensing revenues totaled 8.3 million as compared to 10.4 million in the prior year. As discussed last year we transitioned from two of our license partners, one brought in-house and one a new partnership. As George has commented, this was part of our strategy to elevate our brands globally. As we expected this transition reduce revenues in this segment of our business versus last year. 
Moving on to total company results beginning with gross margin. We continue to be very pleased with our gross margin expansion as margins expanded by 90 basis points versus prior year's adjusted basis. Continued solid performance in our men's collection Golf apparel and Nike Swim businesses were additionally assisted by improved margins in our direct-to-consumer business. We also continue to benefit from efficiencies in our supply-chain infrastructure. 
SG&A totaled $71 million for the quarter as compared to an adjusted amount of approximately $70 million in the prior year. SG&A in our current fiscal quarter included $1 million of anticipated cost that are not expected to continue. Excluding this SG&A was in line with prior year, we are pleased with our cost discipline to effectively manage increases in wages and other inflationary cost that are closer to 3% to 4% per year. 
Turning to the balance sheet, inventories continue to be managed extremely tight and believe our in great shape to support our forward sales forecast. Our inventory discipline enabled us to pose a net debt to total capitalization of 24.3% as compared to 30.5% in the year-ago period. This places us in a very comfortable position to support the expansion of our businesses. Looking to quarter two, we expect revenues in the range of 202 million to 205 million compared to 202 million in the year-ago period. We expect revenue growth in our men's collection and Golf apparel businesses and also expect to benefit from the continued roll out of Nike Swim in Europe and Latin America and further expansion in global golf brands.
We see gross margin approximately 36.4% for the quarter, which reflects higher margin shipments in Q1 due to customer risk. SG&A is expected to be relatively consistent with adjusted prior year levels reflecting our ability to offset inflationary cost pressures. Due to the plans shift, our pretax earnings are tax rate is expected to be higher in Q2 versus last year which is expected to negatively impact the quarter by $0.06 to $0.07 per share compared to prior year. For the above reasons, we expect earnings per share to be approximately $0.07 to $0.10 for the second quarter as compared to an adjusted $0.15 in the prior year. 
As we look at the remainder of the year, we see continued headwinds from lack of consumer traffic and macroeconomic issues. We feel that we are positioned well in terms of our product focus and our execution and performance. Accordingly, we are maintaining are guidance for revenues of $870 million to $880 million and adjusted earnings per share for the year of $2.07 to $2.17. This continues to reflect the gross margin rate between 37.3% to 37.5%. Despite the challenges in the global market, we continue to focus on controlling those items within our control, elevating our brand and improving our profitability. 
With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.
Question-and-Answer Session

Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Ronald Bookbinder with Coker & Palmer.
Ronald Bookbinder
Looking now at the environment, you talked a lot about the shift to e-com, but is that really picking up all the merchandize or do you think industry-wide there is just too much product out there also, not just too many stores, but just too much product?
Oscar Feldenkreis
I think it‚Äôs a blend of both. I think that definitely e-commerce is growing. I think the challenge that we‚Äôre seeing and the improvement that we're seeing as we experience with some other channels and distributions that we're actually seeing a shift of one the product is actually being delivered which in retailers are starting to operate on less inventory in the store and focusing more on the turn and delivering product quicker, which is similar to what some of the vertical retailers have been successful doing, offering more deliveries more frequently. 
Ronald Bookbinder
And you guys talked a lot about Europe and your focus on building up the infrastructure there. But do you think the channel shift that we‚Äôre seeing in U.S. to e-commerce? Do you see the hitting Europe sometime in the next year or two?
George Feldenkreis
Thank you, Ron, for your comments. We don‚Äôt see that happening that quickly. Number one, there are really no major department store Europe outside of [indiscernible] Spain and I'm taking about continental Europe. In the UK, of course, there are large department stores on which very similar business with the U.S. or in Europe it's only Spain and to some degree Germany not as important as in United States, so it's harder to substitute the small time [indiscernible] prevalent in all of Europe when it comes to Amazon et cetera, et cetera.
So, we don‚Äôt -- we see the same -- there is no question that the European e-commerce as a matter of fact in many cases and some countries has a higher percentage of the market than in the United States. But it‚Äôs a different situation, brands are still more important in Europe than in the United States, although other total they represented total smaller percent of the total market.
And there is no question that we have some brands that have a lot of appeal to the Europeans like Callaway, Nike and even Penguin and Perry is a good brand there from before. So, we see Europe as a very fertile market for us to grow. And when I mean Europe, I mean all the countries in Europe including the Middle East et cetera, et cetera.
Ronald Bookbinder
And on the Jack Nicklaus to that mass merchant, how much of a revenue benefit do you think that will be for Q2, opening up over 1600 stores?
Oscar Feldenkreis
Well, it's already included in our numbers, revenue numbers for this year and we hope that that will perform well. Early performance has been very strong and hopefully that will continue. That momentum will continue and hopefully for next year and possibly Q4 as we start again the spring season we'll be able to gain further market share. So, we're very excited with the Jack Nicklaus launch and we'll have more updates in Q2 in terms of what other additional opportunities that we see with the golf segment.
Ronald Bookbinder
Okay, and lastly, I think you had some notes that recallable in April. How are you guys looking at that given how strong your balance sheet is with cash being generated?
George Feldenkreis
We're not -- at this moment, we don't have plans to call it. Frankly, we are waiting for -- hopefully, one day we'll have a change in the tax situation and we have funds in Europe that through our European corporation that there we can use for growth in Europe. So, depending on how we see our -- the needs of our growth in Europe initiatives, we can bring in enough money to pay down the debt. So, that is -- that is really what we're waiting for. We're waiting for a few months.

This stage of the market, we feel it's more prudent to be on a very strong cash position for anything that might happen for good or bad. There are going to be big opportunities on M&A I feel because many of the players, we talk about the smaller wholesale business general, we're talking about the number of companies that are not going to make it, they're going to be looking to be acquired. So, there should be some up on that at prices that we have not seen in years.
Operator
And we'll go next to Eric Beder with Wunderlich.
Eric Beder
You guys have done a great job of being very innovative with the product. When you look out, how do you keep that competitive edge in having just being like kind of the leader with these active brands and some of these brands here in terms of product offerings?
Oscar Feldenkreis
Well, Eric, that's a very good question. We have a strong organization overseas, we have a strong merchandizing team and we also have a development team in Asia that is very focused on helping us create innovative product, and we constantly-- our merchandizing team, oversea, is constantly reviewing what all new possibilities are out there to incorporate within our sportswear brands and our where best selling product today, as I've mentioned in just alone in golf and some of the introduction in performance fabrics into even Perry Ellis, which we just introduced a four-way stretch pant under Perry Ellis' performing extremely well. And that for us has, you know I've always believed product is king. You have product, consumers will buy regardless.
Eric Beder
Great. And when you look at Amazon and your own online e-commerce, how is that going and where do you think it should go over going longer-term?
George Feldenkreis
Well, e-commerce of us has been very strong. E-commerce even if you look at just this first quarter alone third-party e-commerce was up plus 10% and just alone in golf alone e-commerce was plus 15% this quarter. So, we're very excited with the opportunities as you know we mentioned last year that we invested heavily into photography studio in-house as well as now we are going to be adding videography, which will allows us to create more videos for our third-party and as well as our online e-commerce sites, which will allow us to have more -- the consumers have more knowledge about the product and as well as well as we are upping our game when it comes to social marketing and market digital marketing as well.
But we feel that there still a lot of run room for us to begin to open up additional e-commerce sites of our own within our portfolio of brands. We are planning on launching a laundry e-commerce side in the second half of the year, which we are very excited as you know was a dress market today, almost 50% of the dress market is done online. And we feel that this could be a great opportunity for us, and we are in the process now of looking at other golf brands that we launch online as well. We feel that DTC online definitely has a potential to be a $100 million business for us over the next three to five years.
Eric Beder
Question for David. In terms of inventories, you've done an outstanding job, in terms of reducing inventories around. How much more can you go?
David Rattner
Well, as George mentioned, our inventories are in excellent shape right now. We ended at a 140 million for the current quarter compared to running 150 million prior quarter. We our turns -- our approaching are right at four times at this point, and given where we are at we're comfortable with our inventory levels throughout the remainder of the year and we see inventories ending flat year-over-year from $150 million to $160 million.
Eric Beder
Okay. And different kind of question, you talked about -- we obviously know there's a lot of disruption right now in the retail environment. How aggressively and what are you guys doing to make sure that you are paid and that you have a deal with some of this retail bankruptcies or these companies loosing financial ability to pay debt?

David Rattner
We on the accounting -- on the AR side, we whatever -- I would say, we're pretty well funded with either a factoring or an insurance or we're carrying our own paper. But I would feel that our account receivables outstanding are in a pretty good shape.
Oscar Feldenkreis
Our receivables are -- we're very current, right now. We are in really excellent state with our receivables and we do monitor some of the riskier accounts very closely, making sure that we are not over extending ourselves from a credit perspective. So, we have a very diligent eye on receivables and certain customers.
Operator
We will go next to Greg Pendy with Sidoti.
Greg Pendy
My question I guess as you guys were early to see the downturn in the store base and took the pain awhile ago, but now on the call you mentioned the possibility of opening of new stores where they make economic sense. Can you just give us a sense of how you see in this environment? What is economic sense in the new store opening? Do you look on cash on cash returns? Or how are you viewing a potential new store? And what are the hurdles you're thinking about?
Oscar Feldenkreis
We're opening up more -- we're looking at doors very, very cautiously based upon the analysis that we're doing. They have to profitable I would within the first year. We're looking pop ups versus signing long-term leases. There is more pop opportunities. We just opened up a pop up in Aspen, Colorado, which we're very excited. It's about a six month opportunity and if we're successful, we will stay in that location, it's small, it's a 900 square foot store, so it's substantially smaller than the 800 or 2000 square feet that we've had before.
So, we're looking up pop ups, we're making sure that we're in the right location as we know in real estate location, location is very important and that‚Äôs the approach we're taking. We‚Äôre not going to be crazy opening up stores. We've opened up some new stores in the airport here in Miami, with Original Penguin and it's been extremely successful, generating over a $1000 a square foot. And we see that airport stores as a great opportunity as you know more there is more and more travelers today than ever before and we feel that could be a good opportunity for us in the long run.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We will go next to Ed Yruma with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Unidentified Analyst
This is Mac on Ed. Obviously, department stores have been challenged, we're wondering how you're feeling about orders moving forward. Specifically, are you seeing your partners become even more conservative or is it more so just status quo? And similarly for sporting goods, lot of consolidation and disruption in this channel, how do you feel about your product there, what‚Äôs working and what's not? And finally, can you give us an update on your swim business in the channel? Thank you.
Oscar Feldenkreis
Okay, we will take question number one, regarding department stores. Department stores have been planned flat. They started -- we plan the business since last year, almost six to seven months in advance, and we're planning our business with them in certain categories flat in other areas up. But of course that goes by geography, we've seen sales in the south east, south west let say United States continuing to do well, so that‚Äôs where the emphasis is going versus the mid tier of the -- the mid zone of the states geographically have been probably most challenged by because of weather et cetera that many have reported.
But we‚Äôre planning our business flat to a slight increase, but it's all depends on the brand and the actual retailer. When it comes to the sporting goods channel, golf is growing as I mentioned and we continue to see opportunities in the sporting good side. The retailers that have exited or gone out of business in the sporting good side, we were never selling them much except Sports Authority and Nike Swimwear where a lot of that market share has been picked up by the other retailers that are strong out there today either via e-commerce or via brick and mortar so we feel positive about the consolidation and less stores.

Nike is an extreme, is very extreme powerful brand and I would say that we are the leader when it comes to swimwear for all genders within the sporting goods channel and our business is up and we're trending up, we're having a great season. We've introduced a lot of innovative products like stretch and swimwear which has been brand new and that‚Äôs been very disruptive from the non-stretch product that has been out there and we're seeing basically it's all about innovation and servicing the customer both from a mobile digital perspective to brick-and-mortar.
Our swim business has been excellent as I mentioned first quarter was very strong, we delivered a lot more swimwear in Q4 and Q1 this year and last year, which has, we're fueling the sales of our growth both from sporting goods to the traditional department stores to chain stores to e-commerce sites. Our swim business continues to be extremely strong and very dominant and the same applies to our international business, our partners like with ASOS and in Mexico, Canada our business with Nike swimwear has been very-very strong.
Unidentified Analyst
Thank you, and so for the men's business, are you seeing any new trends, I know you said linen was strong, but I believe that was also the case last year? Is there anything new you're seeing this year fashion wise?
Oscar Feldenkreis
Well, I think the disruption this year in the newness and men's wear has really been print, both the knits and wovens as well as stretch and bottoms has caused the consumer to go out there and replenish their bottoms wardrobe once they try a pair of stretch comfortable pant, maybe a pant or a short, that's what creating the replenishment needs for a consumer to go out there and buy something that they don't have in their wardrobe today. So, our bottoms business as I mentioned both in Golf and Perry Ellis are extremely strong, and we see that momentum very positive going forward, and we're applying the same technology by the way to our women's Rafaella bottoms business which has been very strong because we adapted some of the technology in our men's side to our Rafaella bottoms side.
Operator
And with no further questions in the queue, I'd like to turn the conference back over to George Feldenkreis for any additional or closing remarks.
George Feldenkreis
Thank you, I would like to thank all of our stockholder for your support and also to all our analysts who are in support of our efforts. We look forward to updating you on our start to fiscal 2018 after the first quarter. Have a great day. Thank you.

George Feldenkreis ‚Äî a Cuban refugee who got his start as a small importer of guayaberas in 1967 before taking over New York fashion house Perry Ellis International 32 years later ‚Äî announced Wednesday that he will step down as the company‚Äôs chief executive officer in January 2016. His son, Oscar, will take over day-to-day operations.
Feldenkreis, 79, will continue in his role as chairman of the global retailer, although his title will become executive chairman. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a goodbye,‚Äù Feldenkreis said in a telephone interview. ‚ÄúI will still be very involved with strategic decisions. But I‚Äôm getting to a situation in life where I want to be able to spend some times helping the charities I‚Äôm involved in.‚Äù
Feldenkreis is a trustee of the University of Miami and sits on the board of directors at the Greater Miami Jewish Federation, the Simon Wiesenthal Center and the American Friends of Rambam Medical Center.


The company best known for its colorful, casual men‚Äô clothing has struggled to break a profit in recent years as some of its smaller brands failed to grow. The company‚Äôs best known fashion lines include Perry Ellis (its premier brand), Original Penguin, Jantzen, Savane, Cubavera and Rafaella.




Perry Ellis missed revenue targets at the end of last year as its supply chain broke down during a slowdown at West Coast ports, and faces a proxy fight from an activist investor based in California. The publicly traded company is a major employer in Florida with more than 1,000 employees.
Results improved in the first quarter of 2015 as the company beat analyst expectations, reporting $266 million in revenue for the quarter, up 3.5 percent. The company‚Äôs stock is up 10 percent since the announcement.
Feldenkreis came to Miami in 1961, seeking a visa for his son Oscar. Then came the Bay of Pigs incident. There was no going back.
‚ÄúFor a Cuban refugee that came here with $700, it‚Äôs a great American story as far as I‚Äôm concerned,‚Äù Feldenkreis said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so proud to be in America. This could only happen in America. Whatever I have achieved, I owe it to this country.‚Äù
The financier Carl Icahn, a friend of Feldenkreis for many years, called his accomplishments ‚Äúincredibly impressive.‚Äù



‚ÄúAlthough I don‚Äôt own Perry Ellis, anyone that bought the stock over the last few years must be extremely pleased with the profit on their investment,‚Äù Icahn said in a telephone interview from his office in New York.
Perry Ellis‚Äô stock tumbled to $3.60 per share during the heart of the financial crisis. It now stands at $26.50.
The younger Feldenkreis, who will take over as CEO, has worked at the Doral-based retailer since 1980, becoming president and chief operating officer in 1993.
The retailer also faces a proxy fight from an activist investor, Legion Partners, which plans to run candidates for three open board seats at the next shareholders‚Äô meeting in July. The California-based investment firm has criticized the company‚Äôs performance and said that its governance structure does not allow adequate, independent oversight.
Together with the California State Teachers‚Äô Retirement System pension fund, Legion owns 6.3 percent of Perry Ellis stock.



Although Legion has called for the separation of the chairman and CEO role in the past, the firm‚Äôs managing partner Chris Kiper said Wednesday that Feldenkreis stepping down as CEO did not go far enough.
‚ÄúMore change at Perry Ellis is required due to the domination of the Feldenkreis family,‚Äù Kiper said.
Oscar Feldenkreis countered that the company has made progress by shedding unprofitable brands, opening up its own retail stores, and focusing on sales in Latin America and Europe, as well as e-commerce. 
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre a much, much more focused company today,‚Äù Feldenkreis said. ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôve made a lot of headway and changes over the last two years.‚Äù
Feldenkreis has also been nominated for a seat on the company‚Äôs board of directors, along with Bruce Klatsky, former chairman and CEO of the Phillips-Van Heusen Corporation, an apparel company, and Michael Rayden, former president and CEO of Tween Brands.

                    October 23, 2016 7:00 PM
                



The enthusiasm is electric inside the new Miami Fashion Institute at Miami Dade College‚Äôs downtown Wolfson Campus. In between classes, students are gathered in the airy, open foyer of the building‚Äôs sixth floor with rows of sewing machines behind them and clusters of mannequins draped in bright fabric. 
The light pours in from big picture windows and there‚Äôs talk of dream jobs: interning at Vogue, visual styling at Bergdorf Goodman, becoming a buyer at Saks. Students swap stories about designers who inspire them: Jeremy Scott, Marc Jacobs, Stella Jean, Zuhair Murad, Olivier Rousteing of Balmain.
‚ÄúThe environment when you walk in, it‚Äôs just like, you want to be here,‚Äù says Kiana Dur‚Äôant, 20, from Kendall. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an eye-opener. I‚Äôm doing stuff that I never even dreamed about doing.‚Äù
‚ÄúI saw a poster [at the Kendall campus] that said fashion design and merchandising and my heart literally just went, ‚ÄòOh my God!‚Äô And I was like, I need to sign up for this right now,‚Äù says Estefania Delgado, 19, also from Kendall. ‚ÄúThis has been the greatest move I‚Äôve ever done in my whole entire life.‚Äù


The young women have become fast friends over their love of fashion, each dressed in boxy, distressed dark denim jackets. ‚ÄúBoth of us want to move to New York and go to FIT,‚Äù Delgado says, referring to the Fashion Institute of Technology, part of New York‚Äôs state university system. 




They‚Äôre members of the inaugural class of 100 students at MFI, a two-year associate degree program with tracks in fashion design and merchandising. The program was created as a direct response to the needs of Miami‚Äôs local fashion industry by consulting with designers, retailers, factory managers and fashion schools to develop the curriculum. The program‚Äôs board of advisers consists of 15 industry heavyweights chaired by Naeem Khan, who is moving his eponymous fashion line from New York to a facility on the Miami River by late 2018.
‚ÄúOne of the things that‚Äôs missing in Miami is the ecosystem, the educational infrastructure that will strengthen and develop a skilled workforce that the industry needs,‚Äù says Marimar Molinary, director of academic program development at MDC. Some of these basic skills include construction, pattern making and sewing.
According to Molinary, MFI is the only public higher education institution in Florida offering a program of its kind, creating an unprecedented affordable option for students with a price tag of about $8,000 total for two years.
In Miami, MFI joins the private International University of Art & Design, whose fashion program is helmed by 40-year industry veteran Charlene Parsons. Founded in 1955,  it was originally called the International Fine Arts College and started with a small program in fashion merchandising. It eventually added interior design and fashion design to its programming, and in 2001 it was sold to the Art Institute. Parsons has been with the college through the changes, and today the school offers bachelor‚Äôs degrees in fashion design and fashion merchandising, as well as an associate degree in accessories design with a student body of 650.

Miami‚Äôs rich history in fashion and apparel started in the 1950s and ‚Äô60s when Wynwood, Hialeah and Allapattah were filled with manufacturing warehouses. Major department stores like Burdines, Jordan Marsh, Jefferson Ward, Jackson Byrons (which eventually became J. Byrons) and Richards dotted downtown. National retailers like Sears and JCPenney had offices here, providing local apparel lines manufactured in Miami access to wide distribution. Some of the major brands included Suave Shoes, D‚ÄôAccord, Twins Swim, Cover Girl and Tail.
Much of Miami‚Äôs fashion golden era can be attributed to the influx of Cuban refugees in Miami. ‚ÄúTens of thousands of Cuban women came to Miami with experience in apparel. They were pattern makers and sewers,‚Äù says George Feldenkreis, founder and executive chairman of Perry Ellis International, who came to Miami from Cuba in 1961. ‚ÄúLatins propelled the boom in Miami‚Äôs garment industry in Wynwood and Hialeah because the labor force from Americans was not there.‚Äù
The industry fell into sharp decline in the mid-1990s in large part due to globalization and new technology with cheaper labor available offshore and open trade agreements. ‚ÄúThe economy changed,‚Äù Parsons says. ‚ÄúThe Omni Mall, which was very high end, closed. Other retailers closed. People were leaving. The designers left and manufacturing stopped.‚Äù
The U.S. textile and apparel workforce was hit hard, dropping from 2.4 million workers in 1973 to 1.5 million in 1996, a decline of 39 percent, according to the Department of Labor.
In Miami, this left a challenging landscape for new designers, especially with the labor intensive and essential skill of sewing in short supply. ‚ÄúA lot of the skills needed to make garments have disappeared,‚Äù Feldenkreis says. ‚ÄúThere are very few people that know how to make apparel. It‚Äôs an art. Those people have disappeared.‚Äù 



Despite these challenges, successful, enduring Miami designers have emerged, including Rene Ruiz, Silvia Tcherassi, Mayda Cisneros and Julian Chang, all of whom serve on MFI‚Äôs advisory board. Still, more young designers are breaking into the industry every day and thriving. These include companies like Eberjey, Alexis, Del Toro, Miansai, Style Mafia and Bammies.
Today, Miami‚Äôs fashion industry is buoyed by events like Fashion Week Swim and Funkshion Fashion Week, as well as a salient swim, bridal and accessories industry. It‚Äôs one of the few metropolitan areas where retail is growing, thanks to developments like the Design District and Brickell City Centre. There are also law firms like Foley & Lardner LLP dedicated to the fashion industry and professional networking organizations like Fashion Group International.
According to the Beacon Council, the creative design industry in Miami, of which fashion is a niche sector, employs 24,075 people at 3,512 companies with an economic impact of $1.1 billion.
In recent years, the local industry has seen a pivot away from overseas manufacturing with a desire for ‚ÄúMade in Miami‚Äù products, evidenced by an uptick of brands headquartered in Miami with both retail storefronts and manufacturing facilities ‚Äî and these businesses want to grow.
‚ÄúIt represents a true industry cluster,‚Äù says Pamela Fuertes-Berti, vice president of international economic development programs at The Beacon Council. ‚ÄúWe have everything here: manufacturing, sourcing, distribution, warehouse, styling, development. It‚Äôs not just one aspect. Brands want to have their whole team close by, so everything is interconnected.‚Äù 
‚ÄúThe industry is poised to flourish,‚Äù Molinary says. ‚ÄúYou have the world looking at Miami. It‚Äôs young, vibrant, creative, cosmopolitan and international. With all of this energy happening at this time, what we‚Äôve heard from the industry is that in order for it to grow, we need an educational infrastructure or it won‚Äôt be able to reach its full potential.‚Äù 
And to understand its potential, it‚Äôs wise to examine its history. Here‚Äôs a look at some of the pioneers of Miami‚Äôs fashion and apparel industry. For decades they‚Äôve endured a fluctuating economy and the industry‚Äôs shifting landscape by seizing opportunities, diversifying products, recalibrating strategies, carving out a niche and reinventing themselves. Their leaders have demonstrated a sharp understanding of the industry with an eye towards future trends and have made vital adjustments along the way allowing them to endure and thrive. 
A mother-daughter story 
The story of Miami‚Äôs fashion and apparel industry is, much like the city itself, a story of human migration and family. Maria ‚ÄúMarita‚Äù Srebnick‚Äôs parents arrived in Cuba in 1923, Jews fleeing Eastern Europe‚Äôs pogroms, her father from Poland and her mother from the Ukraine. 
‚ÄúHow did they end up in Cuba? You had to have money to go to Mexico and more money to go to the U.S. If you had no money, you were left in Havana,‚Äù says Srebnick, 76.
Her mother, Sofia, built a warehouse and factory in Havana making zippers, manufacturing machines and dying undergarments that she exported to South America. It was March 1960 when the government put a Soviet flag on top of her building. ‚ÄúShe went up with a pair of scissors and cut it down,‚Äù Srebnick recalls. ‚ÄúMy father could smell communism coming.‚Äù Soon after, Cuba‚Äôs new regime froze every account and confiscated the business.
The family eventually reunited in New York City in 1962 where Sofia went to work as a floor lady at a zipper factory and Srebnick‚Äôs father, Jaime, worked in a warehouse. 
In 1966, with $6,000 saved between the two of them, Marita and Sofia moved to Miami and opened Scott Notions. Specializing in zipper assembly and distribution, their first customer was  Sportailor, a Cuban-owned Miami apparel company still in business today, with a purchase order for $72 in zippers. 
¬†Marita Srebnick, owner of Scott Notions, checks on some zippers just out of the product line. This is a 50 year old family business founded by her Mother after leaving Cuba and returning from New York in the seventieth in Wynwood on Tuesday October 18, 2016.PEDRO PORTAL / pportal@miamiherald.com
In 1976, The YKK Group, a Japanese company with U.S. headquarters in Macon, Georgia, group of manufacturing companies that is the world‚Äôs largest zipper manufacturer,  approached their operation and Scott Notions became the company‚Äôs first assembler. That‚Äôs when Srebnick‚Äôs cousin Ben Horenstein joined the business handling sales. 
When Scott Notions started out, there were five competitors in Miami making zippers. Srebnick‚Äôs partnership with YKK, whose zippers went on to monopolize the industry, played a vital role in pushing Scott Notions to the top. In the 1980s, their competitors began going out of business.
Levi‚Äôs came calling in 1986 and Srebnick answered by flying to their headquarters in San Francisco the next morning. ‚ÄúI tell my children that when I went to Levi‚Äôs Plaza, there‚Äôs a beautiful restaurant called Il Fornaio for breakfast. I sat there and looked at the Levi‚Äôs building and started to cry. I said how did I come to be here? A Cuban refugee with no money and I‚Äôm going to be a supplier to Levi‚Äôs?‚Äù With a wry, matter-of-fact smile, she adds, ‚ÄúAnd we were.‚Äù
Scott Notions supplied Levi‚Äôs with YKK zippers for a decade, making $10 million annually in sales at its height. In 1996, the industry took a sharp downturn as manufacturing and production migrated overseas and companies like Levi‚Äôs followed.
To stay afloat, Srebnick diversified, becoming a one-stop shop for all products catering to the apparel industry. As companies went out of business, she took on their products. She now supplies everything from elastic, thread, buttons, poly bags and hangers in addition to zippers to about 200 clients.
‚ÄúDo we sell a lot? No. But we survive,‚Äù Srebnick says. 
They‚Äôve maintained a competitive edge by being one of the only operations to assemble jacket zippers with a machine that Sofia bought in 1978, and to this day, jacket zippers comprise 80 percent of their zipper orders. They‚Äôve also stayed nimble by developing a program to supply home sewing and arts and crafts operations in the Caribbean with smaller quantities of thread and elastic. 
So what keeps Srebnick‚Äôs passion for the business alive as Scott Notions celebrates its 50th anniversary this month? She says, ‚ÄúI love coming here everyday because my mom started it.‚Äù
Carving a niche 
Originally from Cuba, Richard Behar‚Äôs father, Simon, moved to New York in the 1950s, where he spent 20 years as an executive at a fabric company. He moved to Miami in 1972 to launch Colorama Fashions, specializing in women‚Äôs wear. 
In 1988, Richard founded Capitol Clothing Corporation with the help of his father. Initially, his brand Little Baron produced fashionable coordinated sets for boys, which was a void in the children‚Äôs wear market. They also had a secondary line of novelty uniforms in a variety of themes, including park ranger, police officer, firefighter, boat captain, safari and military outfits, but this was a smaller segment of the company.
Their first break came a year into business when a buyer for the Army/Airforce Exchange placed a large order, distributing their clothing line to military bases in the U.S. and abroad. 
In 1991, Behar met a buyer from the San Diego Zoo at a trade show in Las Vegas who requested he create a junior zookeeper uniform. ‚ÄúSince then, they‚Äôve been one of our best accounts,‚Äù he says.
Starting in 2000, Behar noticed that many ‚Äúmom and pop‚Äù children‚Äôs retail stores were going out of business and the showrooms catering to the industry were disappearing. ‚ÄúIt was time to refocus the direction of the company for continued growth,‚Äù he says. That‚Äôs when their novelty uniforms became a profitable niche.
Today, they‚Äôre distributed to 300 retailers, including the Grand Canyon and Everglades National Park in large part through Eastern National, a concessionaire company with more than 100 gift shops at National Parks and museums. Their products are also distributed to Law Enforcement Uniform and Army Navy stores. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a segment that‚Äôs really grown for us,‚Äù Behar says. ‚ÄúBecause each style has its own unique theme, each has its own market.‚Äù

They also have celebrity fans with the children of the late Michael Jackson, John Travolta and David and Victoria Beckham sporting Little Baron uniforms.
Through a shifting economy where many of his competitors went out of business due to manufacturing moving overseas, Behar has managed to use American-made fabric and keep the company‚Äôs manufacturing local. Their apparel is cut on-site in  their Allapattah warehouse and sent out to sewing shops in Hialeah. ‚ÄúOur customers love the idea that our products are ‚ÄòMade in USA.‚Äô It adds perceived value for the consumer,‚Äù Behar says. ‚ÄúWe have very strict quality control with all the sewing shops that work for us. The garments are then sent back to our location to be coordinated as sets and shipped out.‚Äù
In the end, children‚Äôs fashion has kept Behar young at heart. ‚ÄúI love the business. It‚Äôs like my hobby,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fun making children‚Äôs wear.‚Äù
A fashion family incubates new talent 
If necessity is the mother of invention, then reinvention is the key to longevity in Miami‚Äôs fashion and apparel business. No one understands this better than Andy Varat, whose family has been in the industry for four generations. With his family‚Äôs origins in Russia, his father, Morton, moved from New York to Miami in 1950 to found Cover Girl, a successful, publicly held women‚Äôs wear brand that he ran until 1972 when he retired the line. 
In 1968, during Cover Girl‚Äôs tenure, Morton built a 36,000-square-foot facility with warehouse and office space at 3300 NW 41st Street that would also become the headquarters of Tail, founded by Andy and his sister Cheryl Singer in 1974. The fashionable women‚Äôs active-wear line grew to become the leading brand in golf and tennis with $26 million in sales at its peak. Varat and Singer sold Tail in 2008 and kept the facilities.
Today, the building is something of a fashion incubator, home to eight independent businesses including a cutting service and sewing house run by Tony Fernandez and Florence Kemper, respectively, who have worked with the Varats since the early days. Many of the apparel businesses, A‚ÄôNue Ligne, Top Secret Society, Lucky in Love and Louis at Home, are helmed by members of the Varat family. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a wonderful family business,‚Äù says Lois Varat, Andy‚Äôs sister, who founded A‚ÄôNue Ligne, an elevated women‚Äôs basics line, with her daughter Jodi Bondy in 1991. ‚ÄúIt works well. We‚Äôre independent, but we‚Äôre there for each other.‚Äù
The building‚Äôs most high-profile tenant is lingerie and loungewear line Eberjey, whose operations occupy about three-quarters of the space. Founded by Mariela Rovito and Ali Mejia in 1996, the brand has developed a cult following and is found in 1,400 specialty stores worldwide, 25 top tier department stores and at three flagship boutiques between Miami and Newport Beach, California, with a fourth opening in December in New York City. 
‚ÄúThe building was set up for this kind of business already, so it made a lot of sense for us,‚Äù says Rovito of moving Eberjey‚Äôs headquarters to the 3300 Building in 2009 when their need for space tripled. ‚ÄúIt has sufficient office space in the front with warehouse space in the back, which is actually really hard to find.‚Äù
While Varat no longer operates a fashion line himself, he‚Äôs become a generous consultant and underwriter of emerging designers and businesses, most recently hosting German designer Jens Werner, who collaborated with Shake-A-Leg to create avant-garde designs out of old ship sails to raise money for the nonprofit dedicated to teaching the disabled and underserved communities how to sail. (Werner‚Äôs line will debut at Shake-A-Leg‚Äôs 25th Anniversary Art of Sail event on Saturday at 7 p.m. at the Historic Coast Guard Hangar  in Coconut Grove with tickets available for $300.)
‚ÄúPersonally, I‚Äôm smart,‚Äù quips Varat. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm out of the business. I just help people try to become successful.‚Äù
The brand blockbuster 
Before Perry Ellis International became a $900 million global fashion titan, it started with a penniless Cuban refugee who came to Miami in 1961 at age 26 with nothing. ‚ÄúI originally sold window glass to cruise boats,‚Äù says George Feldenkreis, founder and executive chairman of PEI, of his first job in Miami.
It was 1967 when he and his brother Herman founded Supreme International, an apparel line of school uniforms and guayabera shirts sold at Sears, JCPenney and Burdines. 
Even as Miami‚Äôs manufacturing and retail industry boomed in the 1970s, Feldenkreis‚Äô approach was global, importing goods from Japan at competitive prices. ‚ÄúThe local industry here was based upon a specialty store mentality, very small,‚Äù says Oscar Feldenkreis, George‚Äôs son who joined the business in 1980 and now serves as CEO and president of PEI. ‚ÄúMost people that had factories worried more about factories and production than going overseas and trying to produce the same product at cheaper price points. It was challenging in those days if you didn‚Äôt have a niche or a brand or an opportunity to go into a customer. The challenge was [other companies] were not able to evolve.‚Äù
In 1980, Supreme International introduced Feldini, a fashion-forward men‚Äôs wear brand, to the market. A year later, the company reached $5 million in annual revenues and in 1993 it went public on the NASDAQ stock exchange.
This marked a period of aggressive acquisition and licensing of brands, which would separate their company from the pack not only locally, but worldwide. ‚ÄúI was very fixed in getting brands because I felt that was the only way we‚Äôd be able to sell big quantities,‚Äù George Feldenkreis says. ‚ÄúYou needed brands: a product that the consumer knows is fashionable, but every time you buy it there is continuity in the fit and the quality. That‚Äôs what allowed us to get into department stores.‚Äù 
In 1999, Supreme International acquired men‚Äôs wear brand Perry Ellis and changed its name to Perry Ellis International. Today, PEI is composed of 16 brands, including Original Penguin, Cubavera, Nike Swim, Callaway Golf and Laundry by Shelli Segal.
It was George‚Äôs acuity in forecasting the industry‚Äôs evolution that led to the company‚Äôs overwhelming growth, while competitors stayed small and eventually went out of business. 
Today, PEI continues to look to the future of consumer buying habits and the disruptive nature of the internet, social media and new technology. To that end, they‚Äôve invested in their e-commerce talent and built an in-house, dual bay photography studio at their headquarters in Doral, which allows them to instantaneously push product online to their websites and Amazon.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not only about the capacity to make garments anymore,‚Äù George says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs also about the capacity to create fashion and sales on a direct basis to the consumer. That‚Äôs going to be critical to the future. You need the capabilities in computers and new sciences to be able to reach those consumers in the United States and all over the world.‚Äù Oscar adds, ‚ÄúMobility is the future of the industry and it‚Äôs growing faster and faster.‚Äù

Giving Back: A Family Tradition

Oscar Feldenkreis, president and chief operating officer of Perry Ellis International, is on a mission that extends far beyond continuing to increase company profits. That is almost a fait accompli for this talented entrepreneur with a strong vision, a creative edge and a passion for his work. Since joining his father, George Feldenkreis, founder of this leading company in men‚Äôs apparel, Oscar has taken the company to new heights, expanding product categories, acquiring trademarks, growing the customer base and, in 1993, taking the company public, soaring profits to an unprecedented level.







HERITAGE: Oscar Feldenkreis, CEO of Perry Ellis International, contributes to a number of Jewish causes.Share


For your average Joe, that would be quite a feat. But Feldenkreis is not average by any means, nor is he one to rest on his laurels. Instead, he works tirelessly to give back to the Jewish community, the State of Israel and various medical institutions committed to research.
After all, that is his family‚Äôs heritage. Fleeing communist Cuba when the young Oscar was only 1 year old, his parents found refuge, and later fortune, on the shores of Miami Beach, Fla. His father became very active in the Latin division of the area‚Äôs Jewish federation and soon became its president, holding meetings at the family home. Today, the younger Feldenkreis, sitting in his house overlooking Biscayne Bay in Miami, recounts listening to his father at the meetings and participating in the federation dinners as a young boy. He now holds a Cabinet position at the Greater Miami Jewish Federation. And each year he tries to donate more money than the year before.

‚ÄúBeing successful, you have to be able to share, and our family is very big on that ‚Äî on being able to give back as much as possible,‚Äù Feldenkreis said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre very much involved in Jewish causes, where I would say we give a big percentage of our donations.‚Äù
Each year, Feldenkreis donates tens of thousands of dollars to Miami‚Äôs Jewish federation. He also purchases vast amounts of Israel bonds to help bolster Israel‚Äôs economy, and he is contributing to the funding of the expansion of Temple Menorah in Miami Beach. His non-Jewish philanthropic efforts include donations to the University of Miami/Jackson Memorial Hospital.

Feldenkreis contributes to these organizations as a private individual and not on behalf of Perry Ellis, though he is driven to expand the business not so much for his own personal benefit but rather to increase his ability to give. With his philanthropic goals in mind, failure has never been an option for Feldenkreis. In fact, it‚Äôs failure that he fears. ‚ÄúI think that businessmen that have that type of fear will always be successful, because they are going to try as hard as possible to make sure that they do not fail,‚Äù Feldenkreis said.
Perry Ellis International achieved a great measure of success and expansion under his leadership. When Feldenkreis joined his father‚Äôs apparel business in 1979, he started a pants line that he called Feldini, an Italian spin-off of his last name, and he started developing what he calls ‚Äúthe bottom business.‚Äù With the same levelheaded practicality that he exuded during our interview, Feldenkreis recognized that the average American consumer did not want to pay $90 to $125 for pants made in Italy. He then realized that there was an opportunity to develop pants manufactured in Korea that made of 100% wool or woolen blends, would sell for only $50 to $70. It was this move that put the company in a relationship with Federated Department Stores, which in its day comprised the large department stores that dominated the apparel industry.
The momentum grew from there. Feldenkreis was responsible for the company‚Äôs tremendous growth spurt during the 1990s, with profits rising to $33 million in 1993 from $18 million only a year earlier. He and his father decided to take the company public on the Nasdaq exchange, turning the company‚Äôs fortunes, then $33 million, to an astonishing $54 million in one year‚Äôs time.
‚ÄúWe started to grow almost 100% every single year,‚Äù Feldenkreis said.
In 1996, the company acquired its first true brands, and today it boasts a composite of such familiar labels as Perry Ellis, Manhattan, John Henry, Mundo del Marco, Axis and Treaco St. Rafael, to name a few. Perry Ellis International is also the licensee for PGA Tour Golf and holds the license for all categories of Nike swimwear.
Feldenkreis is always on the move, seeking out new opportunities for his Miami-headquartered company with multiple offices in Asia and on both American coasts. ‚ÄúOur culture is very entrepreneurial. We‚Äôre about growth,‚Äù he said.
No one can say that Feldenkreis is all work and no play. To the contrary, he can be spotted each Hanukkah in Aspen, Colo., with his wife of 25 years and their three daughters, ranging in age from 19 to 24. ‚ÄúWe light Hanukkah candles in Aspen,‚Äù he said. The five family members also enjoy boating, and they travel to Europe together during the summers. When at home, they enjoy traditional Sabbath dinners and keep kosher, Feldenkreis said with pride. Having attended Hebrew Academy of Miami Beach, Feldenkreis is a strong believer in passing down Jewish values to his children, who attended Jewish day schools. In fact, he begins each day by donning tefillin.
Feldenkreis is very active at Temple Menorah, a large, well-established Conservative synagogue in Miami Beach. As a board member, he serves on a committee charged with building an updated synagogue and a new social hall. ‚ÄúFor the last 20 years, I have been doing the Israel Bonds campaign drive at Temple Menorah,‚Äù he said.
Feldenkreis recently ascended the podium as the honored guest of the 2007 Israel Bonds dinner, where he spoke about the complex issues facing Israel today and in the future. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a very troublesome situation,‚Äù Feldenkreis said, describing the challenges that Israel faces and the breadth of Israel‚Äôs enemies, which, he said, reach far beyond the Palestinians.
His commitment to Israel is well evidenced. From 1989 through 1991, Feldenkreis served as chairman of Miami‚Äôs Israel-America Chamber of Commerce, helping businesspeople look for opportunities to import and export products between the United States and Israel.
‚ÄúI think the biggest issue we have within the Israel-America Chamber of Commerce is that we need more people involved,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe local Israelis that have been very successful here should be much more involved.‚Äù
One of his personal goals is to take a more active role in federation activities.
‚ÄúI believe as an American Jew that I have to give a big percentage of our commitments to the Jewish federation and support for the State of Israel,‚Äù Feldenkreis explained. He urges others to do the same. ‚ÄúThe U.S. will continue to support the State of Israel‚Ä¶ as long as [it sees] a strong Zionist-American movement for the support of Israel on a philanthropic basis. I think that there is a lot of need for American Jews that are not involved and have the power and the wherewithal to be able to give back to the State of Israel,‚Äù he asserted. ‚ÄúI believe that that‚Äôs something that we need to work on.‚Äù
