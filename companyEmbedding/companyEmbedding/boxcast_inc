                        "As soon as I started, it became clear that BoxCast’s customer support is what makes them truly stand out. They’re entirely available - not just M-F 8-5, either. They’ve even worked with me on Sunday mornings! Everyone’s been so friendly and helpful that even if the product were subpar (which it’s not), I would have waited around for it to improve. Luckily, the quality of the stream and the archiving is fantastic! I couldn't be happier."

BoxCast Video Streaming for Associations











































Improve How You Reach and Involve Members
Ready to stream?

Live Video Streaming for Associations



Engage members, attract prospective applicants, and earn revenue with BoxCast’s live video streaming platform. Professional member associations host amazing activities all year long. Events like annual conferences, monthly educational workshops, regional speaker panels, and board meetings provide an incredible amount of value.
Unfortunately, distance and cost prevent many people from participating in these events. Live streaming addresses this problem head-on, allowing organizations to better promote their events and serve their members.







With BoxCast's live video streaming platform, associations can:



Engage anyone, anywhere
Many people are unable to travel long distances to attend an event, no matter how much they’d like to. Live streaming your event gives those who can’t be there in person with the opportunity to participate from afar. 


Earn additional revenue
Many associations depend on the income their events provide. That’s why BoxCast’s built-in ticketing feature makes it easy to charge viewers on a pay-per-view basis. You can still generate revenue, even if participants can’t be there in person.




Innovate and adapt
Innovation doesn’t have to be expensive. BoxCast’s solution is not only affordable, but it’s a great way to set yourself apart. Members young and old will appreciate the flexibility live streaming provides them, and you won’t have to break your budget.


Create engaging content
Once your live stream is over, BoxCast will automatically provide you with the recorded video file. You can easily use this archived footage to create educational materials, on-demand offerings, and other content for resale, promotional marketing, or internal use.




 


Streaming Has Never Been So Easy






1
CAPTURE
BoxCast can acquire video from numerous sources including cameras, switchers and iOS devices.



2
DELIVER
BoxCast sends video to the cloud and optimizes it so that viewers anywhere can watch the stream live.



3
WATCH

Key Features



Simple
BoxCast’s platform makes it easy to stream. Stream from any video camera with our plug-and-play setup, or from any iOS device. No tech team? No problem.


Reliable
When it comes to planning events, there are a lot of things to worry about. Your live stream shouldn’t be one of them. Our amazing customer support team is on call when you need them. We even proactively monitor broadcasts.


Affordable
BoxCast was founded on the belief that live streaming should be a possibility for anyone. Your organization is no exception. With BoxCast’s ticketing feature, streaming could even become a new revenue source.

BoxCast hopes to become the kind of company of which movies are made



BoxCast-2.JPG
        
            The BoxCast device, about the size of a hefty smartphone, is a specialized computer that simplifies video streaming so that virtually anyone can broadcast their event online.

The need for a simple way to share video was maybe best described by a funeral home director who wanted to broadcast a chapel service to people who could not be there.
	He explained to Gordon Daily and his colleagues that he had to focus on grieving family members, not cameras and computers: "Can you just make something that works automatically?" 
	Daily believes they did. 
Local startupsEmbrace Pet Insurance finds success keeping tails waggingBoxCast hopes to become the kind of company of which movies are made 
	Jumpstart Inc. just announced a $250,000 commitment to BoxCast, a Cleveland startup with a device that simplifies video streaming for the masses. It's the largest investment to date in BoxCast, a young company that some think is poised to soar. 
	Lee Poseidon, a former tech executive who advises entrepreneurs for JumpStart, calls BoxCast's video broadcast system "a potential game changer" for the new options it offers anyone with an audience to reach. 
	Online video streaming has been around for years. But it's complex and expensive enough, Daily argues, that most people don't attempt it. And so sermons go unheard, high school football games go unwatched, and countless meaningful events are missed by people who would dearly like to see them. 
 Gordon DailyCassie Tabora/The Plain Dealer The solution began brewing in 2008, when Daily and some former Case Western Reserve University classmates designed a website for Jenkins Funeral Chapel in Westlake. 
	The director asked if there was a way for family members to watch a service through the website. Team members arranged an online broadcast but they also saw larger potential. 
	"What if we could make it so simple anyone could do it?" Daily recalls thinking. "We knew this was a killer idea." 
	Fortunately, he had the skill to match his passion. Before co-founding BoxCast, the 34-year-old engineer worked as product manager and software developer at Rockwell Automation. 
 Rockwell's influences are apparent in the BoxCast device. It's a sturdy, uncomplicated black box the size of a chubby smartphone. There's no dials or buttons to confuse, only connection points for the video camera and the Internet. 
	Packed with customized microchips, the Mentor-made device is a specialized computer that captures video from a camera and sends it to the cloud, where the video is formatted by BoxCast for broadcast to online devices. 
	The technological breakthrough, Daily says, is BoxCast's ability to stream high-definition video to practically any smartphone, laptop or tablet computer. That required years of effort and lots of help. 
	A $60,000 product improvement grant from MAGNET allowed the company to design a better, cheaper, $300 version of its original model. Daily said he also benefited mightily from technical support and business guidance from Rockwell and from local entrepreneurship support groups like TECHudson and JumpStart. 
	With JumpStart's investment, the company can now focus on expanding its base of about 100 customers -- mostly church pastors and school athletic directors whose subscriptions allow them to sell or share their video as they see fit. 
	"Anybody would want to see their kid play," Daily said. "We just need to get the word out that this is possible." 
	Earlier this month, the company moved into bright, spacious offices on the second floor of the Burke Lakefront Airport Terminal. The staff recently grew from four to an even dozen, and more hires are expected. 
	As he watches planes taking off outside his office windows, Daily aims a video camera -- one equipped for streaming -- and envisions the world doing the same.
