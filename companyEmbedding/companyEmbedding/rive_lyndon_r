    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Greetings, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the SolarCity Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Aaron Chew. Thank you, sir. You may begin.
Aaron N. Chew - VP-Investor Relations
Thank you and good afternoon to all those joining us today for SolarCity's second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Leading the discussion today will be our Chief Executive Officer, Lyndon Rive; and, also available to answer questions are our Chief Financial Officer, Tanguy Serra; our Chief Technology Officer, Peter Rive; and our Chairman, Elon Musk.
As a reminder, today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements that involve our views as of today based on information currently available to us. Forward-looking statements should not be considered a guarantee of future performance or results and reflect information that may change over time.
Please refer to SolarCity's quarterly Shareholder Letter issued today and the slides accompanying this presentation, as well as our periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a discussion of our forward-looking statements and the factors and risks that could cause our actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements. We do not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement.
In addition, during the course of this call, we'll use a number of specially defined terms relating to our business metrics and financial results, including non-GAAP financial metrics. We refer to definitions of these terms and required reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial metrics included in the Shareholder Letter issued today and the slides accompanying this presentation, which are available on our Investor Relations website at investors.solarcity.com.
With that finally behind us, I would like to introduce SolarCity's CEO, Mr. Lyndon Rive.
Lyndon R. Rive - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks, Aaron. Today, we're not going to go through the presentation. I'd rather spend time answering questions. Before getting to the questions, let me just provide you with a quick summary.
For the quarter guidance, we came in nicely above our guidance. We installed 201 megawatts. Our bookings increased 40% over last quarter. You will see a large increase in cash and loans. We now are roughly 20% of our bookings is cash and loans. We're expecting that to increase significantly in Q4. Cash and loans actually improve the cash generation of the business dramatically.
Our customer acquisition costs came down 27%. We expect the customer acquisition costs to reduce further in Q3. We're also seeing an increase in the value of our solar systems that we are installing. As you may recall, in January we increased pricing. We're starting to see the effect of that pricing increase and our system value has increased $0.16 per watt. On a gigawatt, that would be equivalent to $160 million increase in net present value.

Looking at our customer billings, that'd be leases and power purchase agreements, we're now almost at $100 million per quarter. And once we pay back tax equity, debt, and maintenance for the solar systems, SolarCity is generating $34 million of recurring cash flows.
Next point I'd like to address is our cash outlook. For the quarter, we consumed $216 million. A big cause of this was the Tesla announcement. The Tesla announcement delayed our tax equity funds and just – the tax equity fund had to go back to credit committee to get approval. Those have all now been approved and have been funded, but this caused a delay in Q2.
I just want to spend a few minutes describing the two primary sources of our financing. We have tax equity, and then we have debt. Tax equity is roughly two-thirds of the cash needed to finance the systems and debt is roughly one-third. Once we closed the tax equity fund, we needed to get it approved by debt provider, which is the aggregation facility. We have one large aggregation facility that approves all our tax equity funds and that takes roughly 45 days to approve. They are now approving them in Q3 and we expect that cash balance for Q3 to increase over our cash balance in Q2. For Q4, we expect our cash balance to increase over Q3.
One final point I want to make before getting into questions, and this one I'm really very excited about, is in Q1 we announced our new grid services offering. As a reminder, the grid services offering is services that we provide to the utility; so, the utility is our customer. When providing grid services to the utility, we leverage our existing infrastructure and we provide things like demand load shifting, voltage control or reactive power. Just within the first few months, we've established partnerships with PG&E, Southern California Edison, and the Energy Commission of California. We have a strong pipeline of over $100 million in prospective opportunities.
When it comes to grid services, we're really unique. We have the software and we also have the deployment infrastructure. Nobody else has this capability. So we're excited to help utilities manage the grid a lot better as you see large solar and storage being deployed.
For 2016, and actually 2015, we've invested a lot into products. We believe that, in order to differentiate ourselves in the future, we're going to have to have significant product differentiation. And to maintain our leadership and actually expand our leadership, we need to invest into products. We're going to be launching two new products at the end of this year, which we expect will meaningfully increase our sales in 2017.
With that said, I want to open it up to questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Philip Shen with ROTH Capital. Please proceed with your question.
Philip Lee-Wei Shen - ROTH Capital Partners LLC
Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one is on the Tesla deal and acquisition offer. The final deal and offer price was actually lower than the original price. Can you comment on – and it might be hard for you to do this, but the rationale for taking the lower offer and how that came about? Thanks.
Elon Reeve Musk - Chairman
Sure. I can comment. It's Elon here. And, yeah, (6:44) now joins us and this call the first time is – that we can answer questions like this. This was a negotiation of the independent board members. I actually wasn't part of – any part of it. It was simply what they came up with after, I think, a quite exhaustive discussion that lasted a week or two. So I've not inquired about the details and I'm not privy to the details, but it was ultimately what they concluded was fair between the independent board members of SolarCity and the board members of Tesla. Obviously, this is now up to the shareholder votes – independent shareholder votes where, obviously, I'm recusing myself. I'm not legally obligated to recuse myself; I'm just doing so because I think it's morally the right thing to do, and so is Lyndon and Pete and JB Straubel.

Philip Lee-Wei Shen - ROTH Capital Partners LLC
Okay. Thanks, Elon. In terms of the Silevo manufacturing facility, can you give us an update on what the latest – what's going on now? Are we – are you guys on track to hitting your targets of 1 gigawatt by year end 2017, I believe? And if not, perhaps how much might be in place by the end of the year, what the cost structures might be and so forth? Thanks.
Peter Rive - Co-Founder & Chief Technology Officer
Sure. This is Peter. So we're actually going to be able to start making modules out of Buffalo faster than we had anticipated. Right now, we're actually expecting to ramp the module lines by Q2 of 2017. So – and we're going to be making a pretty interesting product, and I'm excited to kind of reveal it to you all at some point, but it is not just your typical module. It is both very efficient and it looks really, really good.
Elon Reeve Musk - Chairman
It's a solar roof as opposed to a module on a roof.
Peter Rive - Co-Founder & Chief Technology Officer
Yeah. So, I mean, I think that in – a couple of weeks ago, we talked about us wanting to start actually having a roofing integrated product, and a large part of that module manufacturing being there is going to be for that.
Elon Reeve Musk - Chairman
Yeah. And I'd just like to emphasize, I think, this is really a fundamental part of achieving differentiated product strategy where you have a – it's not even a beautiful roof; that it is a solar roof. It's not a thing on a roof, it is the roof. That's – which is quite a difficult engineering challenge, and not something that is available really anywhere else that is at all good. I think this will be something that's quite a standout and (9:37). So this is one of the things I'm really very excited about the future. So...
Lyndon R. Rive - Chief Executive Officer & Director
And it's just addressing a really big market segment. So just in the U.S., there's 5 million new roofs installed every year. And this is a product we'll focus on the – primarily focus on the new roof market.
Elon Reeve Musk - Chairman
Yeah. I mean, I think the interesting thing about this is that it actually doesn't cannibalize the existing product of putting solar on roof, because essentially if you've got – if your roof is nearing end-of-life, you definitely don't want to put solar panels on it because you're going to have to replace the roof. So, there's a huge market segment that is currently inaccessible to SolarCity because people know they're going to have to replace their roofs. You don't want to put solar panels on top of a roof you're going to replace.
However, if you are close – if your roof is nearing end-of-life, well, you've got to get a new roof anyway. As Lyndon was saying, there's 5 million new roofs a year just in the U.S. And so, why not have a solar roof that's better in many others ways as well. We don't want to show all of our cards right now, but I think people are going to be really excited about what they see. And like I said, the cool thing is that it doesn't cannibalize the existing business because you got two classes of customer – like, customers that – where the roof's nearing end-of-life and customers where they've just put in a new roof. And so, you actually get – this is a great situation where you get to introduce new product without cannibalizing the existing product.
Peter Rive - Co-Founder & Chief Technology Officer
And this is a product that we're going to be kind of expediting module manufacturing for, out of Buffalo.
Elon Reeve Musk - Chairman
Right. And this is – exactly – and this is why it's really important to do the manufacturing in-house because you're – it (11:29) control of the aesthetics and ideally really design – it's kind of like making a custom car. Like when somebody orders a car from Tesla, they'll pick a wide array of options. That car will be custom made to their preferences; and you really want the roof custom-made to the individual customer as a kit and then sent to – that would be the delivery team to get installed.

Peter Rive - Co-Founder & Chief Technology Officer
I'd just want to note that the majority of the capital expenses in order for us to get going on module manufacturing have essentially being incurred. So as exciting as a product as this is, the majority of the manufacturing expenses just for the module line here are essentially incurred. And then, we also have been looking at ways to significantly improve the capacity of the manufacturing facility in Buffalo. And we have both process equipment improvements as well as layout improvements that, I think, gives us the ability to meaningfully increase it above a gigawatt a year. And what's really important for us in the factory is that it's competitive for years to come. So we're going to take the time to make equipment modifications as you get the layouts exactly right. We don't want to rush to actually initiate some of the equipment installation for the cell line and then have that be a regretful layout only months later.
So – but from a high level, I'm pretty excited about what we're doing at Buffalo. We're going to have module manufacturing ahead of schedule and we have designs that will give us the ability to increase the capacity beyond a gigawatt.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Hey, guys thanks for taking the questions; maybe just start off with a high level one. As you see some of the business mix evolving here, what do you think the appropriate growth rate is as you transition to more of a loan system sale driven strategy versus – or product mix versus the PP and lease model before, given the different financing mechanisms behind the two types of products. And then, how quickly – I know you said, Lyndon, it's up to 20% of bookings, but how quickly do you think that goes to 50%-50% for you guys?
Lyndon R. Rive - Chief Executive Officer & Director
So, let me answer the second part. So, we're pushing quite a bit on the cash and loan. We like cash and loan. It actually – from a cash generation, for the business, it improves it dramatically. It's also a lot easier to raise loan financing. There's only, I'll call it, a dozen or so tax equity providers, but there are many providers that like high quality cash growth. Cash equity is a unique financing source as we're financing straightforward solar systems is a lot easier. It'd be hard for me to give you exact forecast; I mean, I think it'd be 50%-50%. I'm expecting to increase dramatically in Q4. It'd just be a little hard for me to give you an exact forecast of how much more, but it'll be a big focus for us in Q4. Frankly, it's a big focus for us right now, but the effect of it will happen in Q4.
Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Okay.
Elon Reeve Musk - Chairman
Yeah, and – pardon me for tagging on. I talk too much, but I think the – I think what we'll – if you look a little bit beyond that, it is going to be a lot more towards cash and loan. It's actually economically more efficient for the end customer to do that. So, if the end customer has a good cost of capital or bad cost of capital, which they usually do, then SolarCity – it's fundamentally not (15:27) going to be more efficient for them to take the debt on themselves; and then, has the benefit of, from a SolarCity standpoint, of decreasing dependence on the tax equity and securitization market.
Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. Maybe related to that, if we look at the competitive dynamics and market share over the course of several years, there was clearly a big consolidation happening across the space as you and some of your peers were gaining a lot of share and just in recent quarters that seems to – the momentum there has reversed a bit. As you see loans and cash system sales and those financing mechanisms coming into play, does that reverse that momentum, again, where you start to see broader consolidation in the residential vertical? And then, I think one of the shifts we've also seen in the marketplace is some of these online kind of marketplace platforms starting to gain some traction. Is that something you have any initiatives around or you would even look to doing a partnership around to gain access to that channel?

Lyndon R. Rive - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yes. So I think part of our – if you look at our customer acquisition costs in Q1, we just had tremendous sales inefficiency. So, we made changes there; sales efficiency has improved a lot. And so, with the sales efficiency improvement, we now have seen bookings increase. So we feel good about that.
In terms of the lease versus loans, I don't think that's going to be the big differentiator. Financing has never really been a big differentiator; everybody has always had financing. Initially, what our biggest differentiator has been is that we're vertically integrated. We provided better services to our customers than any of our other competitors. Over time, our competitors have vertically integrated their services as well. Now our focus is on products and we are releasing products that our competitors will not have, and that will be the biggest driver to differentiating and growth.
Elon Reeve Musk - Chairman
Yeah, absolutely.
Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Okay.
Tanguy Vincent Serra - President, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer
To answer your last question, we're also focused, obviously, on developing an online channel and the ability for customers to purchase a solar roof or solar system through the Internet.
Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Okay. Great. Thank you. Maybe if I could just squeeze one housekeeping one in for you, Tanguy, on the P&L, the pre-production expense went from being in COGs last quarter to it's now listed in OpEx. Just can you walk us what drives the delta from quarter-to-quarter in the accounting and how that's going to be treated in Q3 and Q4? Thank you, guys.
Tanguy Vincent Serra - President, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer
Sure, absolutely, Brian. So this is a consequence of what Pete just discussed, which is some of the cells that we're manufacturing. Given the focus on the module line in Buffalo and then the solar roof, some of this other manufacturing in Q3, Q4 are now becoming R&D. And so – sorry, in Q1, Q2, are now becoming R&D, as we're classifying that spend as R&D, which is below cost. So, it's just a matter of a decision to be made and the consequence of that from an accounting perspective.
Brian Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Thanks, guys.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Jobin with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
Unknown Speaker
Hi, everyone. It's Andrew (18:48) on for Patrick. A couple questions; one on 2016 guidance, and specifically volume expectations for the fourth quarter with that big ramp and it being C&I focused; there has been some delays in the C&I business for you guys in the past. Just curious your level of confidence in being able to deliver those megawatts with, it looks like, the majority being in the commercial segment.
Tanguy Vincent Serra - President, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer
Yeah. So, I think that's a fair comment. So, things – we've got the significant portion of those megawatts that we're booking, they're already significantly underway. So they are either actually under construction or through the permit and interconnection process. And so, we've got line-of-sight on the vast majority of those megawatts. The other comment I'd make is that includes some megawatts in Mexico, for the first time sort of real megawatts volume in Mexico, where – those that are cash sales and where the permitting structure is a little bit different and easier (19:50) and so – and there's no weather issues, so we feel good about those megawatts.
Unknown Speaker
Great. That's helpful. And then, in terms of just selling into California right now with NEM 2.0 underway in certain utility territories, how that is going? And then, how you guys anticipate even beyond that the sales process evolving from your perspective as, you know, we come into the time-of-use rate net metering program in California beyond that?

Lyndon R. Rive - Chief Executive Officer & Director
So we've actually moved our sales team over to selling net metering 2.0 already. So remember the – we have to set the expectation with the customer of when the system is interconnected. And it's hard to forecast exactly when net metering 2.1 occurs – sorry, 1.0 occurs versus 2.0. And so, in our proposals we actually give expectation to our customers of what net metering 2.0 look like. And so, it's already incorporated in our sales channel in PG&E. At Southern California Edison, we have a longer lead-time. And the effective sales, actually the sales efficiency has improved in July, so I don't think it's going to have that much of an effect. In fact, it hasn't had much.
Peter Rive - Co-Founder & Chief Technology Officer
I mean, in the long-term, we've been investing a lot in being able to integrate knowledge of the customers' usage patterns with our rate structure databases with things like storage control, smart thermostat control, in order to be able to adjust when the customers' energy is actually going to be used. So I think you'd maybe have like this short-term anomaly which isn't having that much of an impact on us, but in the long run I think it's going to be a further point of differentiation for us.
Unknown Speaker
That makes sense. And just one more, if I may, and kind of segueing off that, can you discuss at all your current attachment rate of storage today in the U.S., and then what your expectations are on a forward basis, particularly as you get into 2017 and NEM 2.0, and then even further on into time-of-use? I'd be really curious, sort of 2019, what you expect storage attachment rates to be with new systems. And I'll hop back in the queue. Thanks.
Peter Rive - Co-Founder & Chief Technology Officer
Sure. So the majority of the storage bookings and deployments that we've had to-date has been in commercial as well as utility scale. Last earnings call I was talking to you about having a backlog of over 100 megawatt hours in those market segments. And so, that's where the majority of the traction has been. I think that when we think about the business in the long run, if I look into the -maybe like 2020 and beyond, I see us having 100% attach rate.
I think that the next kind of phase of solar adoption is going to be one that is almost always coupled with storage. And so, I would just say that, I guess it's kind of like a linear attachment rate between where we are right now, which is single-digit percentages, all the way to 100% as we enter the next decade.
Tanguy Vincent Serra - President, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer
And in some instances you'd actually go back and either retrofitting the utility scale or wind farm...
Peter Rive - Co-Founder & Chief Technology Officer
Yeah.
Tanguy Vincent Serra - President, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer
...or a residential or commercial with the (23:07) benefit from the economics at the time.
Peter Rive - Co-Founder & Chief Technology Officer
Yeah, absolutely. It's one of the questions that we always get from our hundreds of thousands of customers, like, hey, when are you going to be able to retrofit my system and storage? That will be a massive up-sell opportunity with all the systems that we already have deployed as well (23:23).
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Kallo with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.
Benjamin Joseph Kallo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Hey, thanks. On those lines, how much utility sales do we think you'll have, call it, in two years versus your traditional business?
Lyndon R. Rive - Chief Executive Officer & Director
So, we have a small team focused on that right now. If you – total utility volume, that's essentially customers that we've sold where the end buyer is the actual utility, in the company's history is around 60 megawatts or so. I do see that growing, but it'd be hard to give you an exact forecast of whether it'd be in two years' time. There's long lead-time on that. Our primary focus today is on residential and commercial customers, but that will become a bigger market of ours in the later years.

Peter Rive - Co-Founder & Chief Technology Officer
And as you remember that, like, when people say utility – like, we structured our products and services that we have something to offer in generation as well as distribution and transmission. And if you go to our website, you'll see the way that we're explaining the services. But on generation, I see us being able to be a massive participant in the next phase of utility-scale solar generation, which is to provide solar power through all of the peak hours. I think that you can look at many utility-scale generation markets and see that they're almost at the point of saturation for typical solar. So what we're positioning ourselves for is this next wave. And this is going to be kind of planet-wide; it's not just going to be a U.S. thing. And then, also, making sure that, through distributed generation, we can also offer products and services that are alternatives to traditional distribution and transmission-related expense. So...
Benjamin Joseph Kallo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Elon (25:36).
Peter Rive - Co-Founder & Chief Technology Officer
I'm sorry?
Benjamin Joseph Kallo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
I had two questions for Elon real quick.
Peter Rive - Co-Founder & Chief Technology Officer
(25:51) I think I'm just going to say that, yeah, so we offer products and services, also, for distribution and transmission; but, I'm sorry, go ahead.
Benjamin Joseph Kallo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
So, Elon, you've seen a lot of money invested, I'm sure, in the Valley into next-generation solar; a lot of money lost. Can you help us with the manufacturing side with Silevo, number one? And number two, how do we think about leadership going forward? You have lots of competent people at SolarCity, but how do we think about who actually does day-to-day management if Tesla does get to buy SolarCity? Thank you.
Elon Reeve Musk - Chairman
Well, I think the – one thing on the solar side is to – on the panel and module side and cell side is to create a high level of product differentiation, in particular with respect to aesthetics. Most people care a great deal about that. I mean, technically, you could live in a house without drywall and just have all the insulation and wiring just hanging there, but people care about drywall. People care about remodeling their kitchen. People care about their yard. They care about making sure that their primary asset, typically being their house, is something that they – that it looks good and that they're proud to show off. And that's one of the primary – that's like the most important element of product differentiation here.
And then, there is also, of course, the efficiency of the panel. Are you able to get a very high efficiency, but still at a low cost? And Silevo has, I think, some important elements of that. And I think we'll probably – we won't be talking about Silevo as a name, really, because we'll be adding a lot of – assuming it's going to be – the merger is approved by shareholders, we'll be adding considerably to the technical team there. It will become something far more than the original Silevo.
We're also entertaining some discussions with strategic partners on the solar cell manufacturing, and some of those could head in an interesting direction. Our default path is still to continue the – assuming – again, assuming we come together as a company to – the default path is still to continue with the cell engineering internally and bolster that team with – by recruiting world-class engineers, but we may conceivably on the solar cell side – I want to distinguish that from the module and from the overall roof system – there may be some merit to bringing in a strategic partner as Tesla has with the battery cell manufacturing.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Colin Rusch with OppCo (29:11). Please proceed with your question.
Colin Rusch - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Hi. Thanks so much. Can you talk a little bit – or give us a sense of the percentage of potential customers that have said no to buying a solar system historically because of the age of their roof or issues that might lead to replacement of the roof?
Lyndon R. Rive - Chief Executive Officer & Director
It's hard to give you a rough estimate of how many systems actually get disqualified because of the age of the roof.
Elon Reeve Musk - Chairman
Disqualified from a SolarCity standpoint.
Lyndon R. Rive - Chief Executive Officer & Director
From SolarCity's standpoint; but it's hard to know – if you have an old roof, you're probably not looking to get solar. So that customer probably didn't even come to SolarCity in the first place. If we look at our current roofs that don't qualify, Tanguy, it's around 8%, 10%?
Tanguy Vincent Serra - President, Chief Financial & Accounting Officer
It's 10%, correct.
Lyndon R. Rive - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah.
Peter Rive - Co-Founder & Chief Technology Officer
That's not the relevant number. I mean, the issue is right now (30:05) from the top of the funnel.
Lyndon R. Rive - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. That's the biggest issue, hands down.
Elon Reeve Musk - Chairman
But what we do know is they're not even considered.
Lyndon R. Rive - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yes.
Peter Rive - Co-Founder & Chief Technology Officer
Exactly.
Elon Reeve Musk - Chairman
I mean, the number is probably close to 20% to 30% or more. I mean, figure – like essentially, the basic math is like, let's say, you've got a 20-year roof, right? And how far are you into the life of that roof? If you are, let's say, more than 10 years or 12 years into the life of your roof and you've got, say, eight years left, you're probably not going to want to put solar on your roof, right, because you know you're going to want to replace it. So that's sort of where it transitions. Certainly, if you've got like four years or five years left on a 20-year roof, you're definitely not going to get solar. So that suggests pretty obvious top-level analysis of something on the order of 30%, but conceivably as high as 40%.
Lyndon R. Rive - Chief Executive Officer & Director
The answer to – once you've announced this product, you – when a customer needs to upgrade his roof, it's something that bugs him for a long time. They've got to do it; they've got to do it; oh, they've got to do it. And so, there is another buying motivation beyond just saving money off your electricity or using clean energy. And so, I should (31:27) think that will increase the sales demand more than just what we're experiencing today and starting a savings proposition.
Elon Reeve Musk - Chairman
Yeah, it's like what if we can offer you a roof that looks way better than a normal roof? What if we could offer you a roof that lasts far longer than a normal roof? Like now, it's a different ballgame.
Lyndon R. Rive - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah.
Colin Rusch - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Okay.
Lyndon R. Rive - Chief Executive Officer & Director
(31:53) getting a new roof...
Colin Rusch - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
That's super helpful, guys. Thanks a lot. All right, so with Tesla's mission to really transform the energy economy, I trust you guys are far down the road at looking at energy efficiency, seeing as that's the most efficient, most cost effective energy source. How long is it going to be before the combined entity introduces a home energy management system or some sort of robust energy efficiency offering?
Peter Rive - Co-Founder & Chief Technology Officer

I'll just say that, it would also be a great feature in our roof, if it were also energy efficient. And then, I think that in terms of home energy management systems, SolarCity's Gateway has, for many years, been kind of a brain in the customers' household that has a handle on how much energy they're using as well as how solar's being produced. We have integrations with smart thermostats.
So I think that that's kind of already in place to some degree through the SolarCity App. You can log on. You can see, in general, where your energy is going. You can get real-time reading on how much energy you're consuming. So a lot of that stuff is kind of already in place, but it's something that we're going to be elaborating on in the coming years for sure.
Elon Reeve Musk - Chairman
And certainly, integrating that with the stationary battery pack so there's not a duplication of systems, which would otherwise be the case. (33:25) on the Tesla call – I mean, really like solar and battery go together like peanut butter and jelly. It's like a – you obviously need the battery, particularly as you get to scale and you want to have solar be a bigger and bigger percentage of the grid. If you don't have the batteries there to balance the grid and buffer the power, you really can't go beyond a certain percentage of solar in a particular neighborhood. You can – maybe you can go up to about 20% solar, but more than that, it starts to unbalance the grid and you need to buffer it, because the – I mean, obviously the energy generation is low at dawn and dusk. It's high in middle of the day, and it's zero at night. So you got to smooth that out.
And so, in order to – if you like sort of fast forward to where do we want the world eventually to be is we want the world to have both sustainable energy generation and sustainable energy consumption. So that really requires three – the three critical ingredients for that is the solar panels, the stationary batteries, and electric vehicles.
So – and like I said, you just – you can't get beyond a certain scale with solar unless you have the batteries to go with it to buffer the power. And then, you got to manage all of that because you'll have millions of these batteries. You've got to manage that, integrate it with the utility.
I do want to emphasize there's still a very important role for utilities here, because sometimes people think that this is an either/or thing; it's like either rooftops are going to win or centralized generation is going to win, and actually both are going to win because the electricity usage is going to increase dramatically as we transition away from burning old dinosaurs to electric cars, and then to electric transport. We'd see roughly a doubling of electricity consumption as all transport moves to electric. And then, there is a tripling of electricity usage if you take all heating and make that electric as well, because, obviously, most heating is from oil and natural gas, particularly. So...
Colin Rusch - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Okay. That's super helpful. And – the heating timeframe, low-single-digits right now, and timeframe on the cars. I think we can take some of that offline, but I think my question is really about timeline for energy efficiency offering; and it sounds like it's in the works. So I can take the rest of it offline. Thanks a lot guys.
Elon Reeve Musk - Chairman
Yeah. It's a high priority and we think it's important.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Morosi with Avondale Partners. Please proceed with your question.
Michael Morosi - Avondale Partners LLC
Hi. Thanks for taking the question. You called out Mexico as factoring heavily into 4Q shipments. Just looking at Tesla and the fact that over 50% of sales in 2015 came from international markets, how could international sales and international storage play a factor in the combined company?

Lyndon R. Rive - Chief Executive Officer & Director
So, once again, assuming once the transaction is approved by the shareholders, I mean, Tesla's footprint internationally is super valuable. We'll definitely look at that. We'll analyze what's the cost of energy in all the different countries. That's the number one ingredient. And then, when you combine solar combined with storage, you're not tied to policy. So you don't need net metering internationally. You don't need a feeding tariff. You don't need different programs. You can just be competitive to the current cost of energy. And so, we'll look at those markets to see where the two combined can be very competitive and we will absolutely expand to (37:46).
Elon Reeve Musk - Chairman
Yeah. And I think there's also a lot of opportunity at the utility scale, providing integrated solar battery system to utilities so that they can provide sustainable energy that's load-leveled and buffered to their customers. And we've got a huge project in Hawaii that's happening right now. I think it's the biggest in the U.S. or...
Peter Rive - Co-Founder & Chief Technology Officer
I don't know of any of other firm (38:16) solar system that is bigger when you combine the demand with (38:18).
Elon Reeve Musk - Chairman
Yeah. We think it's the biggest solar battery utility-scale installation in the United States, maybe the world. So, I think there's going to be actually a lot of business with utilities, as we provide them with an option to have sustainable, centralized power generation. That's what I want – I really want to emphasize, like, our goal is to work with utilities and to collectively to solve the future energy electricity demands of the world, as the electricity demand rises tremendously due to electrification sustainability. I mean, I don't think anybody wants to have huge new power lines pulled through their neighborhoods and vast expansion of substations and all the things that would be necessary to fully electrify transport and heating. It's a huge headache to do that. It's not something that, I think, any consumer wants and it's not a headache that utilities want to have to go through. But if you don't have localized generation combined with central, that's what's going to have to happen and that would suck. So it's just sort of terrible in every way. So this is something that's a cooperative solution for the future.
Lyndon R. Rive - Chief Executive Officer & Director
We're really seeing an uptick in that. The utilities want to look at solutions, how you manage large-scale deployment of solar and storage. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we have three products really going with utilities. Utilities wanted – we're starting to see a movement of utilities wanting to collaborate and we have entire focus there. I highly recommend you go to our website and look at all the utility services that we provide. It's a big focus for the company.
Elon Reeve Musk - Chairman
Yeah, I think it also – I mean, it helps to use that as an example of one of the reasons to combine Tesla and SolarCity is that in order to do this big wide utility solar battery project, it had to go through the independent committees of both boards. There had to be discussions back and forth. It took a few months to get that all worked out.
And as we do many more of those deals, if we go to dozens of those deals, hundreds, potentially thousands in the future, this is completely unworkable. I mean, there's just no way we could get all of that through independent board committees. It's completely unworkable. So the irony, which I mentioned before, is that this combination is about getting rid of the conflicts of interest so we can work together effectively to provide solutions to consumers and to utilities and large commercial customers.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.
Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hi. Thanks for taking the question, guys. Can I just ask about the geographic footprint? How many states are you currently in? Are you looking to exit any of your existing states? And then, conversely, are you looking to enter any new ones in the foreseeable future? That's my only question Thanks.
Lyndon R. Rive - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. We're in kind of roughly 19 states, and probably open up one or two more states before the end of the year.
Elon Reeve Musk - Chairman
And if I may add, also, just because I – particularly, I want to add things that I think are beneficial with combination of the companies, is that Tesla is currently operating in over 40 countries and, thus, we have a presence around the world. And we'd love to bring solar solutions to all of those countries – our solar battery solutions. And I think this is particularly powerful in places like Germany and Australia and in many other parts of the world. So, I think there's a lot of potential to amplify the expansion of sustainable energy generation.
Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. Just quickly following up, you've entered a number of states just in the last six months. And I guess what I'm curious is, is your mix changing as you're entering these new states or are you still very heavily tied to kind of the legacy California, New York, Arizona that you've historically been in for a longer period of time?
Lyndon R. Rive - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yes. The way I'd view state expansion is any new state that we're expanding in next year, the effect of that new state is going to be very small. The following year, however, that new state will have a larger effect and then the mix will start changing. It just takes time to build out the infrastructure, get the installations going; and then, of course, the year after that, those states will continue to grow. So most of the volume that we'll get in any specific year will be because of states that we expanded to the year before. So the states that we're expanding into this year, most of that volume and the impact you'll see in 2017.
Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
Vishal B. Shah - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to understand the customer behavior ahead of some of the Silevo manufacturing ramp. Are you seeing a pause in customer demand or are your customers still asking you to sort of place – giving you orders for that – for the new equipment that they'll be installing at some point next year or are you seeing no change at all?
Lyndon R. Rive - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yes. Just in terms of the efficiency, the biggest benefit is to us in operations. So for our customers, the difference to them would be two different panels. So, we're not seeing a delay in our current option for customers for the modules that we have today. So, no, we're not seeing it. As far as the solar modules (45:01) and be focused on a different market segment, primarily, and is going to be focused on the new roofing market. So, it's addressing a market that we don't address today.
Vishal B. Shah - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. And also, it sounds like there is great availability. I mean, there's no constraint in terms of loan availability. Are you thinking about – or is it possible to actually take the loan offering to the existing installed base of lease customers and convert some of those lease customers into loan customers?

Lyndon R. Rive - Chief Executive Officer & Director
No, that's something we won't be able to do. The way it's structured, the tax equity investors owns the equipment. That equipment will be on the roof for 20 years. The – all the focus would be on new customers.
Vishal B. Shah - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
I appreciate it. Thank you. And then, one last question just on the mix, earlier question. What percentage of your mix – as some of these new states become important, what percentage of mix will from California in 2017?

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Osborne with Cowen & Co. Please proceed with your question.
Jeffrey Osborne - Cowen & Co. LLC
Hey, good afternoon, guys. I had just a couple more questions on Silevo, if you don't mind. I think in the past you had talked about certain level of capacity achieving kind of a low to mid-$0.50s cost per watt, just given what's going on in the broader module market. I was wondering if you could just confirm what capacity levels you're building for the Silevo silicon-based product in Buffalo? And then, also update us if there's been any technology advancements that perhaps would lower that cost per watt number?
Lyndon R. Rive - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yes. So like I was saying before, we actually think we will be expanding the capacity. At this point, I don't want to get specific and say what we think that we'll be expanding it by just yet, but I think that we'll be expanding it beyond a gigawatt.
And I think that the cost potential over time is definitely in the $0.40 to $0.50 a watt range, but I also – what I found in many discussions is people draw this comparison between essentially high efficiency modules, and then the cost of standard efficiency modules. And the benefits of high efficiency, economically, are, first, that you typically win more deals in front of the customers. The customers prefer to have standard efficiency. You also get more revenue per customer, and your balance and system costs are lower. So, I don't think that it's a fair comparison to compare the cost structure that we believe that we will have to the cost structure of our standard efficiency modules.
Jeffrey Osborne - Cowen & Co. LLC
Perfect. And the follow-up I had was just on (48:15).
Elon Reeve Musk - Chairman
I think it's worth adding like, at Tesla, we're achieving the lowest cost per kilowatt hour for battery packs, at the cell level and at the pack level, in the world, despite having the highest energy density. So we have the best cell at the lowest – best cell and pack at the lowest price – lowest cost. I'm confident we can achieve that at SolarCity as well.
Jeffrey Osborne - Cowen & Co. LLC
Got it. And then just, I wanted to see if Elon or someone else on the floor there could elaborate on the $150 million in synergies. It just seemed like the press and other analysts had some skepticism of that. I don't cover Tesla, as you know, but is there any further discussion or elaboration that you could offer would be helpful?
Elon Reeve Musk - Chairman
I think this is – I mean, obviously, when you combine two companies, there is some level of overlap. And then, at the product level there is some level of overlap with the solar battery solution. If you have two separate companies, you have to have two separate computers, operating systems. You've got to have separate communication systems interfacing with two separate server networks. You are developing two separate phone apps for the consumer to monitor their system. You've got to do two installation businesses instead of one. So, I would say that $150 million is a very conservative number.

Lyndon R. Rive - Chief Executive Officer & Director
And then, if just look at the sales synergy, if we just reduce $0.10 a watt in our acquisition cost, that alone would be $100 million at a gigawatt run rate. And that we may get just by virtue of having some real estate or access to (50:11).
Peter Rive - Co-Founder & Chief Technology Officer
Right.
Jeffrey Osborne - Cowen & Co. LLC
Got it. Yeah. Just real quickly as a follow-up, is the intent for SolarCity in the future as its roofing product comes along to either partner with local roofing in solar or do you actually have – intend to have your green bands (50:25) be both roofing companies as well as an electrician?

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gordon Johnson with Axiom Capital. Please proceed with your question.
Gordon Johnson - Axiom Capital Management, Inc.
Hey, thanks for taking my questions, guys. So for Q2, when looking at installations and bookings, can you let us know what percent of those installations and bookings were sales from SolarCity to Tesla versus sales to rooftops? And then, I have a follow-up.
Lyndon R. Rive - Chief Executive Officer & Director
I don't understand that question.
Gordon Johnson - Axiom Capital Management, Inc.
Okay. Sure. Tesla has a Gigafactory. There were some solar systems installed on the rooftops of the Gigafactory. So I'm trying to figure out if there was a large order in Q2 that helped installations and, additionally, potentially bookings associated with sales of systems from SolarCity to Tesla. And if so, what percent of installations and bookings were those sales?

Zero, we've not actually ordered any. We will, but we haven't, yet.
Gordon Johnson - Axiom Capital Management, Inc.
Okay. So, there were no sales. Okay, I got it. And then, just with respect to the acquisition, one question I had is it seems like there were comments out of Tesla as recently as November of 2015 that combining a battery and a rooftop solar company didn't make a ton of sense because, effectively, when you have a rooftop solar company with net metering, the grid acts as, effectively, a battery, ruling out the need for a battery technology. So can you help us understand those comments that were made in 2015 and now, fast forwarding to today, the rationale behind the acquisition?
Lyndon R. Rive - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. Let me just talk about net metering, where we see net metering evolving over the next few years, because I think this is a really important part of how storage is a combination with the solar. The case that I'd like everybody to review is what just recently happened in New York. This is a collaboration of the local utilities and the solar industry. And the collaboration is net metering for the next three years, and then a phasing to more of a grid services model where you combine solar, storage, smart inverters and provide all these additional grid services, and you phase that in; and then, essentially, you phase-out net metering into that grid services model.

And so, we see that probably happening as a standard policy and we're going to promote that across all the different states. But you – we have to get to a point where it is grid services, so that utilities recognize the value that solar and storage can provide to the grid.
Elon Reeve Musk - Chairman
It's also just a relative scale thing. Up through the 20% power level produced by solar, you don't need – you know, there's some value to a battery, but there's – it's not totally necessary. And, in fact, actually, up through a certain – I mean, at least through the 10% level all the way up to the 20% level, solar actually helps the grid because it generates energy when people use it most. Like, the electricity demand peaks during the day because that's when the air conditioning is running at maximum power. That's when companies who are operating machinery is operating. So, solar actually helps utilities – like rooftop solar, localized rooftop solar actually helps utilities up to a certain percentage. And that's – you can sort of debate that percentage, but it's somewhere between like 10% – minimum 10%, but all the way up to 20%.
But then, beyond that point the – it gets very difficult to balance the power distribution in the grid, and then you really have to have the batteries to scale, ultimately, to 100%. Long-term, it's tautological we have to have sustainable energy across the board or, by definition, it would be unsustainable. So just looking at it from a macro standpoint, you have to have a large number of batteries combined with a lot of solar. Wind will play a significant, but smaller role. Hydro will play, also, a small role. Nuclear will play a small role. Geothermal will play a small role, but the really heavy lifting is going to be solar. And, particularly for solar, and even more so for wind, being able to buffer the power is fundamental to the solution.
Gordon Johnson - Axiom Capital Management, Inc.
Okay. So I just want to make sure I understood the answers correctly. What you guys are saying is you're going to phase out net metering and shift to a different strategy, and you're also saying that power peaks at, I guess, in the middle of the day at 12 o' clock?
Lyndon R. Rive - Chief Executive Officer & Director
No, I wouldn't – I mean, that's to say a little hard statement. We're saying that over time as large volume gets deployed, you're going to phase out of net metering, and then provide grid services as you phase it out. The key point is as large volume gets deployed.
Elon Reeve Musk - Chairman
Yeah. And so – yeah, exactly. To reiterate, in the beginning, rooftop solar helps utilities. But as it becomes a bigger percentage of the grid power, you really need batteries to smooth out that power. And, yeah, it's really, I mean, just common sense. I mean, when is the sun the brightest? Yeah, like middle of the day; and it's weaker at dusk and dawn, and it's off at night. So, clearly, you need to buffer the power.
Lyndon R. Rive - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. I mean, I just want to repeat the statement: it's based on large volume. And to make the statement that we think net metering should end is just a mis-quote and an incorrect representation.
Gordon Johnson - Axiom Capital Management, Inc.
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time there are no further questions. I would to like turn the floor back to management for closing comments.
Lyndon R. Rive - Chief Executive Officer & Director
We don't have any closing comments. Thank you so much for everybody's time (57:52).
Elon Reeve Musk - Chairman
Yeah, let me just like – one little thing, which is like, I mean, there is a lot of focus on this month or that month or this quarter or that quarter, but I think it's worth raising – lifting our gaze a little bit to think longer-term to a year, or two years or several years out and, ultimately, to where do we – what do we want the world to look like and are we going there as fast as possible? I think, really, any rational person who believes in science thinks that it's important for the world to transition to sustainable energy generation and consumption sooner rather than later.

In fact, even if you just assign a probability instead of saying it's black and white, what is your probability that going to sustainable energy – non-CO2 generating energy is good versus bad? Even if you think it's like – if you take the devil's advocate position and say, well, we think it's 1% likely that – hypothetically, that massively increasing the CO2 in the oceans and atmosphere is bad. Well, okay, we're 1%, but you only have one planet. So even if you think it's highly unlikely that global warming is real and that there's only a small chance that it's bad, we should still accelerate the advent of sustainable energy. And anyone who thinks that – is 100% certain that global warming is fake and that massively changing the chemical composition of the oceans and atmosphere is fine, is a bloody fool, obviously.
So that's what this is all about. This is about trying to accelerate to where we know we need to get to anyway. And not unlike small potatoes, put some pieces away, but in a very big macro scale way.
Lyndon R. Rive - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thank you, everybody. Have a good day.

SolarCity’s Lyndon Rive: On Biz Model, Growth & Domination
Apr 16, 2012 | China - what we can learn, Clean Tech, Entrepreneurship & Innovation, Featured, Green jobs, Solar Energy

By Alison van Diggelen, host of Fresh Dialogues
SolarCity’s CEO Lyndon Rive sat down with Fresh Dialogues last week to share details of the solar company’s business model, rapid growth, and ultimate goal of being the world’s largest energy provider. Yes indeed: this 35 year-old entrepreneur from South Africa anticipates no less than world domination.
Although Rive was tight lipped about the impending IPO expected in Q3 this year, he referred to the $280M investment from Google last year and said, “Our expectation is that companies like Google and other Fortune companies start making similar investments.”
“In order to monetize the full benefits of the solar system you need a large tax paying company. .. might as well use that tax bill to motivate the growth of the renewable industry…” he added. “We are approaching hundreds of Fortune 100 and 1000 companies…and will continually be raising funds, potentially in perpetuity.”
SolarCity is targeting companies that can benefit handsomely from the 30% Federal Business Tax Credit for solar investments. Although Rive wouldn’t name names, Apple Inc. springs to mind immediately. Record profits and enormous tax base? Check. Recently inclined to alternative energy investments? Check. In case you missed it, Apple recently invested in a massive 4.8 megawatt fuel cell development using Bloom Energy technology. Watch this space. We’ll keep you updated.
.

.
Business Model
SolarCity’s innovative model offers a range of solar options. Customers can buy systems outright or pay zero down and lease or purchase the power the system produces. Large investments from partners like Google allow the company to make solar affordable and continue growing rapidly. Rive described the company’s business model thus: “(We) install solar systems for free, so we need capital to pay for that, and take a long term revenue stream on the electricity that we sell. So, as fast as we grow, that’s the business model that we’re in.”
Chinese Solar Panels and Tariffs
The Obama administration recently imposed tariffs on solar panels manufactured in China. Rive confirmed that about 50% of the panels SolarCity installs are made in China (the remainder come from Japan, Korea and the US). Is he not concerned that the era of “cheap” Chinese panels is over and that will impact the company’s bottom line?
“It’s more of an annoyance than a concern,” Rive said. “It’s a worldwide market…if China’s costs go up, we’ll just buy from somebody else.”
He added that economies of scale is the largest factor driving cost curves down and that in California, despite incentives being reduced from $2.70/watt just five years ago to 25c/ watt today, adoption has never been higher.
Job Growth
The company, founded by Lyndon Rive and his brother Peter on Independence Day, 2006 now employs 1700 employees in twelve states and D.C. The company is hiring about four new employees a day, Rive confirmed. With this rapid expansion, and a market share which grew from 6% in 2010 to 14% in 2011, I asked the young CEO if the company was over extended?
“We have a four month waiting list….four months is totally acceptable. Our customers totally understand it,” said Rive. “Could we grow even faster?  Yes. But then the wheels may start getting shaky. So we are growing at a healthy rate to ensure quality, safety and also customer satisfaction.”
Check back soon for:
Elon Musk’s contribution to SolarCity – he’s Lyndon Rive’s first cousin and SolarCity chairman, but what else has he contributed to the company?

Please stand by. Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the SolarCity First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Aaron Chew, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Aaron N. Chew - VP-Investor Relations
Thank you and good afternoon to all those joining us today for SolarCity's first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Leading the presentation today will be a discussion from our Chief Executive Officer, Lyndon Rive; our President and Chief Financial Officer, Tanguy Serra; and our Chief Technology Officer, Peter Rive, after which point in time we will open up the call to questions.
As a reminder, today's discussion will contain forward-looking statements that involve our views as of today based on information currently available to us. Forward-looking statements should not be considered a guarantee of future performance or results and reflect information that may change over time.
Please refer to SolarCity's quarterly shareholder letter issued today and the slides accompanying this presentation as well as our periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a discussion of forward-looking statements and the factors and risks that could cause our actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements. We do not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.
In addition, during the course of this call, we'll use a number of specially defined terms relating to our business metrics and financial results, including non-GAAP financial metrics. We refer to definitions of these terms and required reconciliation between all GAAP and non-GAAP financial metrics included in the Shareholder Letter issued today and the slides accompanying this presentation, which are available on our Investor Relations website at investors.solarcity.com.
With that finally behind us, I would like to introduce SolarCity's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Lyndon Rive.
Lyndon R. Rive - Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Aaron. So for the quarter, we installed 214 megawatts, that's dramatically above our forecast of 180 megawatts, which was what we forecasted during the last earning call. Tanguy will give an update on the big improvement there. Let me jump into Q1 bookings.
So Q1 bookings came in a lot lower than expected. We had a bunch of headwinds that hit us all at the same time and I'd like to walk them through. So for Nevada, we were expecting the grandfathering would be approved at the beginning of February. And at the time, everybody was in favor of grandfathering, the Governor's office was in favor of it, the solar industry, the legislators, consumers, as well as the utilities were in favor of grandfathering.
Now that did not happen and that actually had a spillover effect into other states. Customers were concerned about, if they go solar, would they get grandfathering. Now, this has actually been addressed. A lot of states have made it clear that there's 20-year grandfathering, and in Q2, we're not seeing this concern much at all.

We also had a bunch of pending regulatory outcomes in California, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire. These are all open items in Q1 that now have been resolved and actually look really good for the solar industry. We now have long-term visibility in those states and in fact, we've never had this type of long-term clarity for some time. So though it was rocky in Q1, we now have that clarity.
We also increased pricing in January and with the increase in pricing, it's pulled in our sales cycle. So typically we have about a 15 day to 20 day sales cycle for residential. And with our customers knowing that we're going to increase pricing in January, they came in and made the decision earlier. What that – what happened to us then is that, starting the year, we essentially flushed our pipeline and now we have to build a new pipeline.
We're also halfway through the quarter, ended our MyPower product. We now redesigned it, it's a lot better and a lot more simple product for a customer to understand, previously it was kind of a hybrid between a power purchase agreement and a loan, now it's a fixed monthly payment. Customers like it a lot more. We just launched it, we launched it last week, and we're expecting to see big demand for that. And we also have different financing terms, previously it was only 30-year financing; now we have 20-year and 10-year financing.
And we're also seeing a big increase in demand for ownership and we want to make sure we address that market, so we're quite optimistic about our loan product that we just launched. And then this 30% tax credit, that got extended for five years, which is a great win for the industry, but the effect of that is commercial customers who were under time pressure to make the decision in order to get the systems installed in 2016, they now have more time to make the decision and just going through the standard procurement process. So we've seen the bookings increase again in Q2, but we had a low in Q1.
Because of all these headwinds and the volume was low that increased our customer acquisition costs. These have all been addressed, so these all temporarily affected us and we're starting to see our customer acquisition costs come down quite dramatically in Q2. But it will take us about two quarters to get back to normalized customer acquisition levels.
So because of the effect of Q1 bookings, we actually now need to re-guide on the year-end guidance. So the previous guidance was 1,250 megawatts, the new guidance is going to be 1,000 megawatts to 1,100 megawatts. This is because of Q1 bookings and then as well as we are timing our commercial installations closer to interconnections from the utility. We've seen now that often we install systems and the interconnection time lag may be three months to six months afterwards, so we're actually timing it to match the interconnection timeframe. For the quarter, for 2Q, we're forecasting 185 megawatts installed.
But as mentioned, these headwinds, as I discussed, that hit us in Q1, they are past now and we're looking forward to seeing the effect of our consumer loan product. This will also allow us to expand into new states. There are some states that do not allow us to offer a lease or PPA. And with this new consumer loan product, we'll be able to offer a lease and PPA in these states. And then in terms of regulation or policy, we now have better clarity than we've had for a very long time.
I'm going to hand you now over to Tanguy, our CFO.
Tanguy Vincent Serra - President and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Lyndon. We installed 214 megawatts in Q1. In the 214 megawatts, there's a 14 megawatt utility-scale project that came in the last few days of the quarter, which we were really expecting to come in the first few days of April. Crews outperformed and the weather cooperated. But nevertheless, we came in nicely above our conservative projections on our residential installations, commercial came in where we expected.

The megawatts we deployed in Q1 had a value of $3.46 per watt, down slightly from our prior quarters on the back of lower SREC pricing and increase in the mix of commercial deployment. The piece I'm the most excited about for this quarter is how much we monetized, $728 million of financing coming in, in Q1. This is a massive accomplishment by our capital markets team, led by Rad Small.
At $3.12 per watt deployed in asset financing, it's a little bit above where we expect to be on a run rate basis, given we took our assets with no back leverage down to 76 megawatts from 257 megawatts in Q4. Financing for us really is like working capital and the 76 megawatts represents about a month of assets that are in the to-be-financed bucket. Furthermore, above and beyond the absolute dollar amount, I like where we are strategically on financing. We've monetized every piece of the value of a watt with tax equity, residential and commercial asset debt as well as SREC financing. We tapped the bank market and the securitization market. We also did a cash equity transaction at the beginning of Q2 and I'll talk more about that later.
But to summarize, we monetized $3.12 per watt deployed or $728 million. And as per usual, there's a memo that's attached, our audited financial statement, explaining this number in detailed methodology. Our build costs continue to be best-in-class, under $2 a watt. The team lead by Eric Wittenberg has done a phenomenal job. Both our residential and commercial build costs were flat in Q1, in spite of lower volume, which implies our variable costs continue to come down and we are on track with our long-term install goals.
Lyndon talked a little bit about our results in Q1 and part of the fixed costs were booked through yielding a higher than we would like customer acquisition cost of $0.97 per watt. Overhead is marginally up on absolute dollar basis with some investments in policy and legal, but we feel good about where we're heading there.
Lastly, quick housekeeping note, we tweaked the methodology for calculating unit costs. We added in the cancel costs as per the industry standard, but we took out the cost associated with managing the portfolio, which we're now reporting separately. And there's a full cost memo explaining the details as per usual on our website. So as I mentioned we're doing a lot of work on our financial reporting and providing clarity on our business.
We probably show recurring cash flows from the generation of our portfolio. We generated $67 million of billings, paid for $14 million of maintenance costs, and as I mentioned, those costs were previously the unit costs – unit build costs, we've taken them out and we're putting them here now and we paid $21 million of tax equity distributions, about 30% of billings and we paid $14 million of interest on the asset financing, which leaves in Q1 $18 million of recurring cash flow to SolarCity. Note that in Q1 that the cash flow from the portfolio was $27 million that included a one-off $10 million payment from MyPower customers paying down principal after their tax credit. We've gone back and calculated this historically and providing a memo on the website tying back to our financials.
When you put it all together, with the $768 million of cash we received from financing, the $780 million we spent to build the assets, pay for the overhead and the working capital, our development company is roughly breakeven. But when you add in the $28 million of cash received from the portfolio, our solar business, our solar development business generated $10 million of cash in Q1, even after paying for all the R&D [and debt] in our investment in grid software that we have at SolarCity. So, cash flow positive for the solar business – for the core solar business.

Furthermore, we invested $42 million in our cell and module business, which is continued success and Peter will talk more about that. But overall, I'm happy to have proven that our solar residential and commercial business can be cash flow positive and generate value contracted in minimum cash flows above and beyond the cash.
As you might have seen, we executed a cash equity trade over some of our assets. It's a great trade. We had a super high quality institutional investor diligence our assets and our processes and we did a first-of-its-kind trade for $227 million. There's a large class of investors that are looking for unlevered yield and the securitized price has no reference to LIBOR and is non-recourse SOC. If it's a clear floor on the value of our residential assets, at least $3.25 per watt of cash up front and we still own some residual and we own the 20-year to 30-year residual customer relationship. I'm happy to have proven up this alternative source of funding. The thing that matters to us is keeping the customer relationship and you offer grid services from those assets. But we like the idea of leveraging in our recurring cash flows and redeploying the capital to DevCo to continue lowering that costs and growing.
This quarter, we're also disclosing our SREC book. This is cash flow from our assets on top of the recurring cash flow retained value. We generate roughly 282,000 SRECs in East Coast states, which we can monetize and assuming on average $100 per megawatt hour, we generate another $30 million per year of cash and the number is growing as we continue deploying assets.
The chart in the earnings deck provides explicitly contrasts the SREC with investment-grade up-takers that we have and the implied cash flows from those contracts. We're seeing value continues to grow on an unlevered basis and given the finance of the assets and reducing the megawatts unfinanced as discussed at the beginning, in net, we can value-increase from $1.963 billion to $1.994 billion.
Our balance sheet continues to be upbeat and we are continuously moving assets from the – in development from our revolver into our aggregation facilities and then to our long-term options, be it securitizations, bank debt or cash equity. Opening new financing sources of takeout was an important strategic step for us. It's important to understand that all of our debt pieces have specific assets yielding either recurring cash flows for what is a clear financing takeout or vehicles that are tied to them, and there are engines that can deploy hundreds of megawatts at limited debt.
With that, let me pass over to Pete to talk a little bit more about the new products.
Peter Rive - Co-Founder & Chief Technology Officer
Hi, everybody. Peter Rive, Chief Technology Officer. So, the past couple of months, some great progress has been made towards a future vision for how rooftop solar can be compensated and integrated into utility operations. Specifically a group of utilities and solar companies jointly proposed a long-term solution that supports net metering being in place until 2020, it removes uncertainty for customers on grandfathering and recognizes the value that solar provides to the distribution system.
The post-2020 framework is basically to value the exported energy at the energy price plus the value to the distribution system plus the environmental benefits. This approach should work for us and is in line with our goal to include storage with most of our solar systems around that timeframe. Additionally a big part of the discussions we're having with regulators and utilities surround additional business model opportunities created by customer-sited energy resources. And to that end, we're excited about some product releases that address utility infrastructure needs which is more than a $50 billion a year market.

We now provide products and services for firm generation as well as the transmission and distribution system and are seeing a 3X growth rate in this area. We have over 100 megawatt hours of storage under contract and plan to complete one of the planet's largest firm and dispatchable solar systems in Hawaii this year. We're also engaged in several pilots with some of the largest investor-owned utilities to prove the benefits of our control systems within the distribution system, grid functions that have traditionally been performed through equipment like transformers and capacitor banks can now be performed by solar inverters, providing us with opportunities to extend our income streams beyond the sale of energy.
And with that update, I think that we're moving to questions and answers, I believe.
Aaron N. Chew - VP-Investor Relations
Operator, we'll open it up to Q&A, please.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. And we'll go first to Patrick Jobin with Credit Suisse.
Patrick S. Jobin - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. First question, just about the cash equity financing. What's your outlook for that market or source of capital for remainder of the year? And then, thanks for this disclosure, we're kind of backing into just over an 8% unlevered IRR, is that about right? And then, I have a few follow-ups. Thanks.
Tanguy Vincent Serra - President and Chief Financial Officer
Hi, Patrick. Thank, this is Tanguy. So, look, what we – the thing that's clear to us having done the work here is that this market is real, exists and there's market participants that are very, very active in it. They typically not had exposure to the residential solar assets, but invested in a number of different infrastructure classes. So I think this market as I discussed is reasonably big. Since we announced this, we've had a number of inbounds. But at this stage, we're not willing to make any commitments for the rest of the year, but it's clearly an asset class that had interest from some of the largest most sophisticated institutional investors on the planet.
And then the – the specific terms of this specific agreement don't allow us to disclose the discount rate, but we've disclosed, I believe enough information for you to do your work and it's – your number is probably right.
Patrick S. Jobin - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Okay. And then, my second question I guess it's a two-part question, relates to the cost structure. Just when we think about putting fewer volumes through the system here in 2016 given the bookings challenges in Q1, how should we think about cadence of total cost structure through the end of the year, where do you think you can end the year? And then the related question, I guess relates to mix, how sizable would the C&I mix be in the volume guidance now? And what, if any, volumes are you including with the utility-scale solar and storage? Thanks.
Tanguy Vincent Serra - President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. So the – Pete mentioned there's project in Kaua'i that is utility-scale that we'll be building out, that one is clearly in the guidance. The rest of the mix is roughly the same mix as historically, call it 80/20 residential/commercial, we can do that on mix. Does that make sense, answer your question?
Patrick S. Jobin - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
And then the first question and – I mean, the equipment cost. You have cleared...
Tanguy Vincent Serra - President and Chief Financial Officer
But – we variablized significantly the installed cost structure. So that number is going to continue to come down on a like-for-like basis. So residential assets are going to continue to be built for less. There's some procurement benefits that will ripple through, cost of panels are continuing to decline as well as cost of inverters. So those numbers are going to be coming down and then Lyndon has some comments around the cost of acquisition.

Lyndon R. Rive - Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. So this cost of acquisition will come down quite dramatically in Q2, but it'll probably take about two quarters or so before we get to normalized acquisition levels that we've seen in the past.
Peter Rive - Co-Founder & Chief Technology Officer
And also, I think they were – on the utility question like we're carving out a pretty special niche here in a differentiated type of generator, when you combine solar and battery. So it's not like a typical utility-scale solar economics, with Kaua'i as an example, it's about $0.14 a kilowatt hour PPA and it's a very different type of PPA in that it's combined with the battery and the energy is available at night. The same is also true with the project that we are finishing installing right now in Connecticut. It's this combination of the power purchase agreement with the capacity agreement. So the majority of the utility-scale business that we're pursuing is this kind of hybrid, between solar economics and battery economics, but it's not like we're signing up $0.03, $0.04 a kilowatt hour utility-scale projects or anything like that.
Patrick S. Jobin - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. We'll now go to Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have a few of them, first one, Lyndon, a high-level question, if I look at it over the last couple of years, there's been a lot of moving parts, you guys want to retain assets, now the focus is shifting a little bit, you are willing to sell, maybe price discounting, whatever it is, so you changed focus from growth to cost reduction. So my big picture first question is what exactly is the business model of SolarCity? Then I have a couple of follow-ups.
Lyndon R. Rive - Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer
So the business model of SolarCity is to provide energy at a lower cost than you can get it today from fossil fuel and then, long-term our goal is to transform our energy infrastructure to a renewable infrastructure. In doing this, there are many different products that customers want, some customers prefer a power purchase agreement, some customers prefer leases, and we're seeing a growing demand for customers wanting to own new equipment and that's where we have solar loans. But to answer your question – so, I think there was another question on volume and cost optimization, yes, we have reduced volume and we are focusing on cost optimization for this year.
Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
All right. Did you guys quantify what exactly would be the cost exiting calendar 2016?
Lyndon R. Rive - Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer
No. We haven't given a forecast for 2016; we have given a forecast for the end of 2017 of $225 million.
Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
So that is still on target?
Lyndon R. Rive - Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. We still feel good about that.
Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
All right. And just another follow-up is, it looks like, you need 60% of your installed regions the second half of the year to meet at least 1 gigawatt target. So I'm kind of curious what gives you the confidence you can hit that trend? What are the key factors of state that would be the key drivers to – for you to hit at least 1 gigawatt this year?
Lyndon R. Rive - Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. So we feel very confident about our gigawatt. Now, the key thing there is based on all the state policies that we see right now is, we don't – we actually have tremendous clarity in all our primary states. So unless something happens too in the primary states, feel good about the gigawatt. Getting to 1.1 gigawatt that was then we need to see an improvement of conversion rate from the loan product and I'm optimistic about the loan product. I feel very confident about the 1 gigawatt and depending on how the loan product goes, it will get us potentially to 1.1 gigawatt or over.

Krish Sankar - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Got it. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. We'll take our next question comes from Philip Shen with ROTH Capital Partners.
Philip Lee-Wei Shen - ROTH Capital Partners LLC
Hey, everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. Just as a quick follow-up on MyPower. Can you talk about – can you just give us a bigger overview of the product, specifically do you have a partner on the solar loan product or do you have a source of capital that you've already designated and identified for that product specifically and then getting back to mix, can you help us understand of the annual guidance, how much might be MyPower?
Lyndon R. Rive - Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer
Shen, so in terms of the partner for essentially a relaunch of MyPower, we're actually not going to be calling it MyPower, it's just a little confusing in, the name, it's going to be solar loan, so it's a little more straightforward. But essentially it's MyPower 2.0. And the product is a fixed monthly payment to the customer. Out of the gates we're going to be partnering with multiple financial partners to provide it – to be viewed as a cash sale, and we'll be selling it and then somebody else will be financing it. So that's the current plan for the loan product. In terms of mix, it's hard to forecast how, historically out of the gates MyPower was around 20% range and then it started winding down to around 12%, 15% depending on the state, but I'm optimistic about it. We've seen a trend towards consumers wanting to own it and if you can provide financing cost that makes it very affordable. We think the ownership model will take some share of our business.
Philip Lee-Wei Shen - ROTH Capital Partners LLC
Lyndon, can you share any of the names of the financial partners by chance?
Lyndon R. Rive - Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer
Not at this stage.
Philip Lee-Wei Shen - ROTH Capital Partners LLC
Okay. One more if I may and I'll jump back in the queue. With the cash equity deal in place, can you talk to us about, how you view ABS versus cash equity, how you might toggle between the two, what might we see next, should we expect to see a cash equity deal next or an ABS ahead of that since the debt markets are incrementally improving since earlier this year.
And then, additionally can you talk us through the potentially the eventual tax implications of the cash equity deal. So given the fact that much of the depreciation has passed on to tax equity investors, what are the potential tax implications from the cash equity financing? Thanks.
Tanguy Vincent Serra - President and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks a lot. Tanguy. So first question on securitization versus cash equity, well, the way our business works is, is we develop assets and the pipeline is financed by the revolver. We then take it out with the tax equity and the aggregation facility. And then, we bought time and what we really want to do is optimize around that. So there's a number of markets that I can take out and put a permanent cap on these assets, so the securitization market I've always liked, we clear north of $3 a watt in the securitization context and on a significant portion of the back end. So we like that market a lot. Again, the key here is clearing our costs. Once we clear our costs then it's a liquidity decision as opposed to a [P&L] decision.
The cash equity market as we believe we price at best-in-class – first-of-its-class kind of security. That's a market that's going to be continuously available. More players are entering this particular market and over time, we think the cost of that could continue to be coming down. And then there's the bank debt market, I don't think you should discount the bank debt market. Bank debt market is attractive and there's a number of banks that are looking for really elongated paper with super high quality assets in U.S. dollars.

And then I'd say above and beyond anything else is that, the quality of our reporting, the quality of our data, the quality of our process, the auditability of everything from our people in China that are looking at our suppliers' factories down to our O&M business and the way we accept assets or fleet is truly phenomenal. And so we're able to access all the capital that other players may not be. So I feel good about all those different sectors. I don't want to predict what we're going to do next. I think the beauty of having a number of choices is that we're not overly relying on a given market and I think that's really important as we think about the outlook right here.
So on the tax – does that make sense, Phil? Do you need anything, any other clarification there?
Philip Lee-Wei Shen - ROTH Capital Partners LLC
Okay. No, that makes sense. And if you can talk about the tax impact especially on the pre-tax NPV that would be fantastic. Thanks.
Tanguy Vincent Serra - President and Chief Financial Officer
Sure. So, I don't want to sound too technical here, but the investment is structured as a combination of debt and a piece of deferred. And so, as a consequence, it's financing and we – there is no tax implications for us upfront.
Philip Lee-Wei Shen - ROTH Capital Partners LLC
Okay. Thanks again talking and Lyndon, I'll jump back in the queue.
Tanguy Vincent Serra - President and Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Phil.
Operator
Thank you. And we'll continue on to Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs.
Brian K. Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. I have two of them. Maybe the easy one to start off. I think in the recent past, you guys have talked about, I think about $2.8 billion to $3 billion of capital in total, needing to hit the operational plans for 2015. Now with the new target in place can you update us as to what that number would be? And then, as a follow-up to that, how much you've already secured maybe a quick rundown on tax equity to-date, debt, and then maybe any other forms of capital, you would count towards that new 2016 funding target. And then, I have a second question.
Tanguy Vincent Serra - President and Chief Financial Officer
Sure. Hey Brian, this is Tanguy. So the – round numbers right, about 1 gigawatt of volume and roughly on average $2.7 billion, $2.8 billion on the cost structure, nearly about $2.8 billion total. So, that's the rough breakdown of the assets of the capital that we need for financing purposes. Over the last four months, we've raised $1.1 billion, so we're well on track to be able to raise that capital. The one thing about the cash equity I think is interesting to know is that as a consequence of the cash equity, we actually paid down some of our aggregation facilities, freeing up more capacity from there. So, that's the beauty of being a model where you're recycling capital which is you're able to use capital more than once. So, with that, right now, we've got $714 million of available pocket financing capacity, which includes just under $500 million of tax equity on – as you can see on page nine.
Brian K. Lee - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. Second question was just around the – I guess maybe that philosophy around growth here, this is the third year in a row you grow with the volume targets. I don't think there's been once where there was a financing issue at play at least for your guys' commentary as to what might have driven the need to adjust volume targets over the past couple of years. So given how important that part of the equation is for you guys funding the business. Just wondering I guess at a high level, what the thought process is around, maybe completely throwing down customer ads to the point where maybe the cumulative cash from the installed base starts to offset some of the growth OpEx and you can self-fund to some degree and so basically targeting absolute volumes not to grow each year, which doesn't trend very well right now it appears based on the market's reaction, but just maybe focusing on net customer ads, even if lower each year to target a better cash flow and profitability growth also, just be curious to hear your thoughts on transition to do something like that?

Lyndon R. Rive - Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer
Just let me, just address the reforecast for this year. And so, the original plan was 1,250 megawatts. The adjustment for that is nothing at all to do with anything relating to financing. It's purely just because of the multiple headwinds that hit us in Q1. And if it wasn't for that, we'd probably – the guidance would stay as is or pretty close to as is right now. Everything just happening all in one quarter was just too much to recover from and still keep on track for the rest of the year. And we're really seeing big improvements in Q2 and it's to get everything back to normalized levels again in Q3.
And in terms of growth, we are very excited about a lot of the innovation that we're doing here and although we are seeing about 20% growth this year, I don't want to forecast for 2017, but once the business starts generating cash, the goal will be to go back into growth mode again.
Operator
And we'll continue on to Colin Rusch with Oppenheimer.
Colin Rusch - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Thanks, guys. Can you talk a little bit about the comp trajectory to date, just in terms of your construction costs, obviously not coming down, quite as much as we would have expected, can you talk a little bit about what's going on internally with that and how we should see that move forward and maybe talk about it a little bit, but just specifically what areas you're going to get the cost out of?
Tanguy Vincent Serra - President and Chief Financial Officer
That's going fine, absolutely. So, just to be clear, the Q1 costs on the installed side are a...
Colin Rusch - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Yeah, yeah. I'm just talking about the construction cost. I'm fully aware of the amortization over the number of megawatts.
Tanguy Vincent Serra - President and Chief Financial Officer
Agree. So, the Q1 costs is $1.98 in Q1, $1.92 in 4Q. So, to make sure we're clear on with that, this is a blend of residential costs and commercial costs. Our residential costs are lower than our commercial build costs. And both residential and commercial were flat to down on a like-for-like basis, between 4Q and 1Q, but the mix effect of deployed assets in 1Q skewed up the cost per watt of residential – of the blend, sorry, but the thing to know is that both residential and commercial are separately on a downward trajectory, so that nothing's changed there, that's been true as long as I've been here, I think it's going to be forever.
Peter Rive - Co-Founder & Chief Technology Officer
Yeah, and then a couple of things on what we're seeing, how to reduce costs because today we're seeing the ASPs of module prices decline, we're seeing the same happening with inverters and then there's a couple of pretty big breakthroughs in the mounting hardware on the residential side as well as on the commercial side that will further drive down costs and give us a lot of confidence for our long-term cost targets.
Colin Rusch - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Okay, great. And then as you look at the variety of the ways that you can monetize these assets, how much lead time do you need for decision-making purposes from looking at what's going on in the market to decide which route you're going to go and to the point that you monetize and actually price these things? And how much flexibility do you have in terms of switching from one strategy to another with the given portfolio?
Tanguy Vincent Serra - President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. So the key here is having tax equity funds that are fully deployed with all the assets billing. Once you've got a – that creates a very, very neat series of assets, receipt of cash flows that are very discrete and easily financeable. So just for sake of argument typically you would raise a tax equity in the given quarter, deploy it, and install it in the next and then have everybody – all the customers and the underlying assets reach permission to operate, it's being able to be billing in the fourth quarter.

So that's the timeline. So the assets go from the revolver and then ultimately to the aggregation facility and then at that point executing whether it's on a bank debt transaction, a securitization or cash equity trade is weeks – not, sort of, call it 2 months, 60 days, 90 days, to get to trade down along those lines. Depending on market conditions, securitization might go faster. This cash equity trade we did, we did in that sort of timeframe and this was a market that did not exist where we had to write the docs from scratch. That gives you a sense of the speed at which we can execute here.
Colin Rusch - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Okay, great. I'll take the rest of it offline. Thanks a lot guys.

Thank you. And our next question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC
Hey, good afternoon, guys.
Tanguy Vincent Serra - President and Chief Financial Officer
Hey, Julien, how are you?
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC
Good. Thank you. So, just following up a little bit on that cash flow breakeven commentary and bringing the business back in line there? When do you think you'll get there such that you begin focusing on growth again, I just want to kind of reframe the story. And then secondly, you talked about normalizing your cost structure, I'd just be curious, you are indeed reiterating your cost targets for 2017, correct? I just want to make sure I have this correct that you'll get to that level at that point in time?
Unknown Speaker
So, this is . So, we won't get to 2017 cost dollars in the next two quarters. So that's not the outcomes, the...
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC
Right. But you're on target for 2017 – in 2017?
Unknown Speaker
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, we still feel very, very good about our own target for $225 million at the end of 2017. So, we still feel good about that goal, and so – but in terms of your growth question, we're working hard towards being net cash flow positive in Q4, and at that point in time, we're going to be looking at the market conditions, the cash generation of the business and then decide if we want to go back into growth mode, and...
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC
And could you define the cash flow target a little bit more, just what that means?

Cash coming in the business is more than the cash going out of the business.
Tanguy Vincent Serra - President and Chief Financial Officer
Difference in cash position between two periods being higher.
Unknown Speaker
Good. And not counting any dilutive equity raise.
Tanguy Vincent Serra - President and Chief Financial Officer
Julien, one comment just to be clear, in Q1, so, we actually achieved that target on just the solar business, we actually cleared $10 million and some retained value. On a cash basis, we cleared $10 million. And we then invested $42 million into our cell and module business for building a best-in-class asset, but that feels pretty good.
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC
Got it. So just to be clear though by hitting the DevCo cash, you hit it for this quarter outside of the – obviously, the cell module?
Tanguy Vincent Serra - President and Chief Financial Officer
That's right. And so the goal here is that to Lyndon's point, to make the cell and module bar on slide 12, go to the other side of the chart, so it's unequivocal that we are generating cash, even after having paid for the .
Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC
Okay. Fair enough, guys. Thank you.

Thank you. We will now hear from Ben Kallo with Baird.
Benjamin J. Kallo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Hey, Lyndon, Peter, Aaron and Tanguy, thank you for taking my question. Krish's, at Mother Merrill, I think his question was very good, what is SolarCity, if we take a step back, and I think the market thinks that the residential business in the US is not a good business and so could you just explain why it's a good return on invested capital right now, for you guys, and there's a lot of math being done around some of the asset sales, and people worried about capital, just talk us through what you're thinking what the business looks like in five years and if the return on invested capital is different, then the market's thinking that you're losing money on these deals with cash equity. Thank you, that's it.

Tanguy Vincent Serra - President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, let me just address that head on because I think this is one I really don't agree with, so let us just take a step back, so here are the economics, right. On a – and we've been extremely transparent on where all the numbers come from, they all tie to our GAAP financials, they're all on the financials, so there's no debate about these numbers.
So we can build these assets. In June, 2015 – we built these assets for about $2.70 per watt, it's about $1.90 of construction costs, some COA and then some overhead. We're building them for $2.7 a watt, as Lyndon said, in Q1 our sales are going to be higher than expected, but overall, we're building this for $2.7 a watt.
Now, in that $2.7 a watt, as Pete said, the cost of panels, the cost of inverters is clearly going to continue coming down. So it's a cost per watt that is declining. There's clearly three years of regulatory runway here, as established – as Lyndon talked about, so what that gives us is that the top-line economics aren't going to change too much over the next three years. When you combine all that with an explicit cash trade, with a leading investor, we're clearing at least $3.25 a watt for a portfolio that is somewhat reasonably representative, but arguably with a little bit of a less California in our current mix, we're clearing at least $3.25. So the worst case scenario, we're clearing $3.25 less $2.70 and you're clearing $0.50 a watt on the resi asset. Now that's a margin concept.
The return on capital concept is, what does it take to grow, and this is the key point, which is when we grow, we add warehouses, we add trucks, we add qualified installers. But there is no capital cost associated with growing that, and as you see we disclosed our specific CapEx for our solar business – our solar development business which is in the single-digit million dollars a quarter.
So the idea that the residential business does not clear super attractive return on capital is just wrong and I'm happy to spend more time on that.
Benjamin J. Kallo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Are you taking share?
Tanguy Vincent Serra - President and Chief Financial Officer
I'm sorry?
Benjamin J. Kallo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Are you taking share?
Lyndon R. Rive - Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer
Share, like could you tell us what do you mean?
Tanguy Vincent Serra - President and Chief Financial Officer
The...
Benjamin J. Kallo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Your market share, how is that changing, and why?
Tanguy Vincent Serra - President and Chief Financial Officer
So as a percentage of installs, the Q1 numbers aren't out yet to the best of my knowledge. I saw Vivint came out to provide this call, I haven't got time to go through the numbers, but it feels like we're doing pretty well in the market, yes.
Peter Rive - Co-Founder & Chief Technology Officer
Yeah. And I think that like in Q4 it went up from Q3. I haven't seen the Q1 numbers yet, but it's probably going to be like in the kind of mid-30%s I would guess, somewhere in there. I don't think that there's a big reduction in our share of installations or anything.
Lyndon R. Rive - Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, with the new loan product, I think it should – it should accelerate.
Tanguy Vincent Serra - President and Chief Financial Officer
Does that answer your question? It is really important to me, we all agree that the – this return on capital concept is measuring the difference in margin over the EBITDA grow. On that basis, we're absolutely a great business.
Benjamin J. Kallo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
And so what – so what's the difference between you and number two, three, and actually number ten and how has the market changed with size and scale? Because if you guys – if capital is a constraint then doesn't everyone else has that issue and you should be able to take share, or am I wrong?

Lyndon R. Rive - Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer
So capital is not a constraint, so we don't really address that. It hasn't been a constraint, it's not our constraint, and it's not capital. This is a high-quality asset and people want to finance this asset.
Tanguy Vincent Serra - President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. But I've got massive respect for all our competitors. The one thing I would say is that our key clear differentiators are cost structure, our cost structure is just better than everybody else's, and we're optimally selling is the commodity electron. So we're clearly in a better place there. The other big differentiator I think is all the investments that we're making under Pete's leadership on the grid services, the agreement that was – come up between us and some of our peers in one of the Eastern states, the State of New York, I think it's a blueprint for how the industry is going to go from forward. So we've got clear technological leadership, we own our mounting hardware and destiny around that, we have clear EBITDA to capital and we're ultimately building what is our best-in-class power plants for the lowest cost, that feels like pretty strong differentiators.
Lyndon R. Rive - Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. And you – yeah, Tanguy kind of mentioned this, but our Zep product itself, a mounting hardware, it allows us to go fast so there's less disruption for the customer, but at the same time it just looks better than any other installed system out there. And so aesthetically it's just a better-looking system than any of our competitors.
Benjamin J. Kallo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)
That's what – Lyndon, I think we should focus on that more going forward than tax equity flips and depreciation, accelerated depreciation over five years, I'm not telling you how to run your business but Wall Street thinks this is way too complicated, and we need to get back to brass tacks of what you guys do, and that's just my two cents here.
Lyndon R. Rive - Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer
And that's great feedback, I think we'll maybe have a little more in-depth product review the next time. I think that's great, great to hear that – we're investing a lot and we have massive differentiation.
Benjamin J. Kallo - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)

Thank you. Our next question comes from Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank.
Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank
Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. You mentioned your custom acquisition costs will come back in the next two quarters, where do you think costs will lead in Q3, Q4 timeframe? And then is this second half mix going to be more skewed towards commercial given that you're sort of pushing some of the installations to – closer to interconnection timeframes and does that impact your project value or economics in the second half?
Lyndon R. Rive - Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer
So, in terms of custom acquisition costs, I expected to come roughly 20%-ish down this next quarter and then the following quarter back to normalized acquisition levels. In terms of commercial mix, roughly it's going to be about 20%. So, I don't expect too much change in the total value of megawatts deployed.
Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank
Okay. Great. And then, can you just talk about whether you are raising PPA rates in other markets outside of California and how that is impacting, just the customer behavior, it looks like the world financing environment, while it's good, it's slightly in terms of cost, it's worse than what you were previously expecting. So, does that translate into higher rates in the industry overall?
Lyndon R. Rive - Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer

Yeah. I think the biggest impact in our pricing increase was the flushing of the pipeline and accelerating customers from January to December, and so starting the year with essentially no pipeline was the biggest impact, in terms of the pricing increase. We increased slightly, it's just about a $0.005 to $0.01 per kilowatt hour depending on the market, and this is a small increase, but that does make a difference on a dollars per watt basis.
We don't see this as a reason for losing business, at least we don't see it yet, and we actually see a lot of our competitors actually needing to increase their pricing too. In fact, we've also started to increase our commercial pricing as well.
Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank
Okay. Great. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Gordon Johnson with Axiom Capital Management.
Gordon Johnson - Axiom Capital Management, Inc.
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question.
Tanguy Vincent Serra - President and Chief Financial Officer
Hey, Gordon.
Gordon Johnson - Axiom Capital Management, Inc.
Hey. So, I guess, first with respect to the cash equity deal, I guess, with respect to the cash equity portion the $345 million, is that cash that's available to invest immediately in growth and debt repayment? And then, in addition, with respect to that deal, will you guys continue to recognize revenue and other financials on the projects or the project cash flows that were sold to John Hancock? I have a follow-up.
Tanguy Vincent Serra - President and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks for that. I'm not quite sure of all the numbers, so the cash equity trade that we announced was $227 million of cash in, with that we repaid in part the aggregation facilities and so – of $151 million and the rest was cash that we cleared for the company. And so that is cash sitting on our balance sheet right now.
Gordon Johnson - Axiom Capital Management, Inc.
Right. But is that cash – I'm sorry, is that cash associated with the tax equity, is that cash that you have available in your coffers to immediately extend to apply the growth and debt repayment, or is that cash already accounted for, is a proportion of that cash already accounted for?
Tanguy Vincent Serra - President and Chief Financial Officer
Well, the cash is fungible. So when we execute the trade, cash came in. We repaid a part of $151 million of aggregation facilities and the rest was cash that was absolutely available on our cash balance – on a daily cash balance, yes.
Gordon Johnson - Axiom Capital Management, Inc.
Okay. And then, are you guys going to recognize the revenues and other financials associated with the projects, the project cash flows you saw, will you still recognize those revenues in your income statement, even though the cash associated with those revenues is being paid to John Hancock?
Tanguy Vincent Serra - President and Chief Financial Officer
So, just to be clear, so the trade is that, there's – John Hancock takes about 95% of the cash flows, but we retain a portion of them and so yes, absolutely we will continue recurring that that way.
Gordon Johnson - Axiom Capital Management, Inc.
Okay. So you'll recognize 100% of revenues. And then with respect to your guidance to be cash flow positive this year, I just want to be clear here. So you're saying you're going to be cash flow positive including financing the debt raises and potential equity raises as well as module manufacturing investments. So you're not saying you're going to be cash flow positive from an operating cash flow perspective or free cash flow perspective. You're saying, you're going to cash flow positive from the perspective of including financing because you may do as well as excluding any module manufacturing investment, is it – am I thinking about that correctly?

Tanguy Vincent Serra - President and Chief Financial Officer
It will be cash flow positive, but that includes the financing for the assets...
Gordon Johnson - Axiom Capital Management, Inc.
So we're not.... So, okay, sorry.
Tanguy Vincent Serra - President and Chief Financial Officer
It includes the – for the quarter, for the cost of the manufacturing, but if there was a diluted round, it would not include any of that. So it's only focused on all cash generated from financing the assets.
Gordon Johnson - Axiom Capital Management, Inc.
Okay, okay. And then lastly, I noticed last quarter or not last quarter, but the quarter before you guided your Q4 calls to $245 million to $260 million, they actually came in at $227 million, the GAAP OpEx. So is the higher cost this quarter a potential spillover from delayed cost recognition in Q4 and how should we think about that transitioning through I guess the rest of the year? Thanks for the questions guys.
Tanguy Vincent Serra - President and Chief Financial Officer
I didn't follow that last question. $240 million, what was the question?
Gordon Johnson - Axiom Capital Management, Inc.
Yeah, so the GAAP OpEx guidance for Q4, operating expense guidance was $245 million to $260 million, the number actually came in at $227 million. So we thought that your cost could be slightly higher this year, as there was some delayed cost recognition from Q4 to Q1, not this year, I'm sorry, this Q1, the first quarter of 2016, it looks like your cost was higher. I wanted to know if the cost is going to remain at that level or we should see some work down on that going forward?
Tanguy Vincent Serra - President and Chief Financial Officer
So the – in Q4 as we talked about last time around we're reducing the marketing spend in Q4, and so as a consequence those costs came down a little bit, on a cash OpEx basis, for those costs not linked to Q1. So – in Q1, the run rate we're at right now is going to stay roughly where it is with increased volume as Lyndon mentioned. So, our unit costs will come down.
Gordon Johnson - Axiom Capital Management, Inc.
Okay. Thanks again, guys.
Tanguy Vincent Serra - President and Chief Financial Officer

Our next question comes from Michael Morosi with Avondale Partners.
Michael Morosi - Avondale Partners LLC
Hi guys. First half on the utility services segment, longer-term, how much of a factor do you think this could play in the overall business in terms of leveraging cost over a larger installed base. And also, yeah, from a more strategic standpoint, as the business becomes more ownership-agnostic, whether it's loan products, yeah, presumably that means that the business is increasingly agnostic with respect to, whether utility is ultimately on these assets as well? So, how does this segment kind of position SolarCity for those longer-term market developments?
Lyndon R. Rive - Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. So – and I think that if I look at the next decade, I'd be surprised if we weren't driving, call it 50% to 30% of our revenues from utilities. I think that you end up in a situation where you have an energy contract with the customer, and you know how that asset's financing may change and it seems to get a lot of airplay but like that, the payments to us come in part from utility and in part from the customer but the value proposition to the customer is still cheaper, cleaner, and probably more reliable energy.
So yeah, I just see that in the long run, say 2020 and beyond the way that the grid is basically designed and maintained is fundamentally different and utilities don't necessarily have to look only to capital expenses in order to be able to meet the grid needs but kind of look to these customer side of resources for a lot of these benefits.

Peter Rive - Co-Founder & Chief Technology Officer
Yeah, I mean, looking at that timeframe, to me there's no doubt that all systems that we will be deploying at that time will have storage combined with smart inverters. And when you have that, you can provide all the grid services you need to the utility. The idea that we'll be investing into big power plants at that time, I highly doubt it, and we have an asset that can generate energy at a pace that's needed and you'll be able to store it and you'll be able to provide services to the grid. That's a far better way of building out the grid and leveraging existing equipment that we'll be deploying anyway. So, this is just over and above the equipment of – the services over and above the equipment we're deploying anyway.
And in terms of the utility, ownership of behind the newer generation, I just think that it's and I think this is shared with economists and many regulators that extending the utility's monopoly position should be avoided as much as it can be. I think that people are more looking towards ways to kind of innovate within the utility sector. And so a couple of interesting ideas of being advanced in terms of being able to give the utilities the ability to earn income over services they can procure from companies like SolarCity, rather than necessarily only owning earning income, also capital expenses or all equipment that they own.
Lyndon R. Rive - Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. It's actually once against this business, I actually I'm very encouraged by that, I want utilities to get into this business, and if they want to get directly into the same business they should, just not under their regulated division as Pete mentioned, it should be under a different part of the company, which doesn't have the protection of all the rate payers, they can go through the same process, make the same investment decisions that we have to make. But I think in the long run, it'll just be more simplistic to partner in that area.
Michael Morosi - Avondale Partners LLC
That's great. And then, with respect to the asset monetizations, one of the bigger question marks around the company and the value that the company creates is, is how to value the renewal period. Public equity investors have apparently always very heavily discounted it or at least in recent quarters they have. The ABS market does not attribute much value to it, or any value, yeah, the cash equity deal with Hancock didn't – yeah, was a 20-year term. So what can you do to prove out that renewal value or to maybe even change, innovate around contract structures that may be even extended contract terms, as there's more of a track record with the technology in the field, and people get more comfortable around the longer-term production profiles, is there any opportunity to kind of partially prove out that renewal period by actually making it not a renewal period, and instead making it a longer contracted period.
Peter Rive - Co-Founder & Chief Technology Officer
Well, I mean, I think that like a longer contracting period for the customer wouldn't necessarily be good to us, I don't that think we necessarily want to try to increase the contract term. And I don't – I can't immediately think of some way to prove out exactly what will happen 20 years from now. But I think that I can just extrapolate as to what the value of energy will be. And then also just think about, what additional technologies can be deployed alongside that that will be particularly appealing to the customer. So, being able to 20 years from now, retrofit the system with the technology that can allow them to participate in this going to kind of grid services of the economy or being able to add a battery to add additional reliability, as well as additional income streams. I think that what gives me great confidence in renewal is the ability to supplement the products they have with something that will be even more appealing at that point, combined with the fact that fundamentally the value of the energy is expected to be quite a bit lower than what they're paying the utility.

Lyndon R. Rive - Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. And the asset life of this is 35 years, 40 years, the direct warranty is 25 years. So, this tremendous value plus the renewal period.
Tanguy Vincent Serra - President and Chief Financial Officer
Also, just the value of the relationship with the customer I think, is a little less kind of tangible, but it's present – and not just the customer but the relationship that we have with them. I'm seeing that the customer may sell their home – will likely sell their home in that period. So, and that's not as tangible, but I think in my opinion anyway it's incredibly valuable.
Michael Morosi - Avondale Partners LLC
All right. Thanks a lot guys.
Operator
I will go to Sven Eenmaa, with Stifel.
Sven Eenmaa - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Yes. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I wanted to ask in terms of the Hancock-type of asset monetization transactions, if you think of these megawatts deploying in the years, in – during a year, like how big part of the mix you would expect to finance through such type of transactions going forward?
Lyndon R. Rive - Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I appreciate the question, thanks. So I think it really would depend on where the financing markets are. So, if you have a vibrant securitization market, we might want to do more in the securitization markets, but this creates another significant opportunity. It also depends on – this is a way to clear more liquidity upfront than we would on a securitization. So it also depends on specific liquidity requirements of the business at that moment in time.
So, I don't want to give a mixed forecast basis, I would expect we would do all of our assets over time go either into bank debt, securitization or cash equity and a nice healthy mix of all three over the cycle, but any given period, I don't know.
Sven Eenmaa - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Got it. Second question I wanted to ask, in terms of you mentioned the combination of the cost structure on the utility projects you're doing, consisting of a traditional utility-scale plus storage. How should we think that impacting your kind of cost curve here, as we go through the rest of the year? I mean, your high dollar 90s in the current quarter as the mix increases, what's the implications here?
Lyndon R. Rive - Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, I think in subsequent quarters, we'll be providing you a better framework to understand the cost and the profit associated with solar-plus battery systems. So it's unfortunate at this point in time, but I don't think that we can kind of break it out or give you a good indication. But I think that generally speaking, we're going to be able to give you a good framework to understand what the solar costs are and then separately, what the cost of storage is.
Sven Eenmaa - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
As a last question, I want to ask, in terms of – and I apologize if you mentioned it already, but if I look at your first quarter bookings and sequential kind of 25% growth commentary here, what will be the catalysts here on bookings front to drive you guys into that 1 gigawatt level for that or 1.1 gigawatt level for the year to be able to meet that target?
Lyndon R. Rive - Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer
Sorry, I didn't understand the question, you're saying, what causes to...
Tanguy Vincent Serra - President and Chief Financial Officer
What will the catalysts to increase booking and going forward?
Peter Rive - Co-Founder & Chief Technology Officer
I mean, solar alone will be a good example of it.
Lyndon R. Rive - Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer
So, the regulatory issues have – are being resolved, at least most of them have. So that's a big item. Q1 had many decisions that had to be made, California made its decisions, Massachusetts made its decision, New Hampshire made its decision. So, that's all now being addressed. The solar loan product, there is a growing demand for customers who want to own the equipment, so we think that will have an impact, seasonality kicks in, so now we're entering into the summer and then we're also going to be expanding into new states, and so those are the other areas that will help us with the additional bookings.

Sven Eenmaa - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.

Thank you. We'll now go to Sophie Karp with Guggenheim.
Sophie Karp - Guggenheim Securities LLC
Hello. Thank you for taking my question guys. I just wanted to get your perspective on, how much leverage do you think is appropriate for these assets? And your funding mix has moved quite a bit, it is more debt-financed this quarter, or less tax equity. So what do you kind of see as a normalized level in terms of what are the metric you want to choose debt to cash flow or debt-to-EBITDA for these assets within the PowerCo? Thank you.
Tanguy Vincent Serra - President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. I think in terms of more of percentage of PD6, they could have the securitization markets look at it. So you look at, most tax equity cash flows, you discount that back at 6%, that gives you a dollar number, and then the securitization market, we'll say it's anywhere between 70% and 80% of that number would be available for securitization principal. Then, there is some DSCR ratios around that. But, that's kind of the metric to look at.
Sophie Karp - Guggenheim Securities LLC
Thank you. And then, just as a follow-up on the mix, I guess, I just want to make sure I understood you correctly. I think you said that going forward, you expect to have 80% residential, 20% C&I, but this quarter in particular, we saw a higher percentage of the C&I, is that right?
Tanguy Vincent Serra - President and Chief Financial Officer
That's right, yes.
Sophie Karp - Guggenheim Securities LLC

Thank you. And we'll now go to Edwin Mok with Needham & Company.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC
Hi, thanks for taking my questions. So, just want to quickly revisit kind of your OpEx or your cash OpEx I think this quarter, you said because of the low booking more on – your OpEx went up a lot and you expect to come back in the second quarter as you're booking accelerated, right. So, just how do you kind of think about your overall OpEx for the company? I think previously, you guys talked about that number likely to continue grow on a sequential and year-over-year basis. Just want to kind of get a sense where do you think OpEx or cash OpEX would be for the company, let's say, by towards the second half of the year end, and or we are kind of at the level that you think you're good enough to ramp up your booking level, and therefore, you can keep it at this level? Any kind of guidance on that?
Tanguy Vincent Serra - President and Chief Financial Officer
So we really think about the cost on a unit basis and so that's why we've disclosed the cost memo, which really ties all of our OpEx numbers to a per unit basis, so the parts of the OpEx are included in overhead and the cost of sales. We expect the overhead piece on an absolute dollar basis to be roughly flat and we expect the sales and marketing piece to reflect as when Lyndon said, a decline on a per unit basis in Q2 and Q3.
Edwin Mok - Needham & Co. LLC
I see. And beyond this year, right, as you look longer-term, do you think, let's say you continue to grow and increase your size – your installation per year, do you see a need to continue to grow that or I would have think that as you build out certain regions you can kind of, basically kind of stop in those regions and still kind of get more leverage out of your sales team. Do you not see that or can you give us some color on that?
Lyndon R. Rive - Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer
Yes. So, you definitely need to continue investing into sales and marketing. We saw that, when we slowed down our performance marketing, so all the advertising in November, December, it generates less leads, so you do need to continue to invest into sales and marketing. We are looking at different sales channels to continue reducing our acquisition costs. When we look at different acquisition costs, some of the sales channels is actually quite low. And so, we'll be scaling those more aggressively. So, but we will still continue investment in sales and marketing, I don't see that changing. And even in states like California, we still only have, call it 3%, 4% penetration. So, we need to continue to advertise.

Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.
Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Yeah. Hey, guys. You mentioned at the beginning that the regulatory climate is the best in years, as you put it in a really long time. What are the remaining question marks in at the state level that you have yet to get clarity on and that you expect to be resolved by the end of the year?
Lyndon R. Rive - Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer
So the – I'd say, the biggest open item right now is Arizona. And I don't expect that we get clarity at the end of the year, probably clarity Q1, next year – maybe a little later than Q1 next year. But Arizona today is the biggest unanswered state, but the for rest of the States, clarity looks really good.
Peter Rive - Co-Founder & Chief Technology Officer
I mean, I think that like traditionally, when people talk about clarity and the way we've talked about it, it's been a strong focus on net metering. But there is a lot of distributed resource plan that are currently being evaluated in California and New York and other places, where like the utility business model and the way that utilities can be compensated is changing. So there is a lot of interesting stuff happening in New York and California this year that we're watching very closely. In California, we have good net metering run rate, there is a lot of stuff going on as to how utilities in California can include the benefits of these customer-sited resources, and the distribution systems. So there's a lot of stuff happening there that hopefully will create the environment for us to be able to see greater incomes from our solar systems.
Lyndon R. Rive - Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, and I actually expect to get clarity for Nevada in the February-ish legislation. The legislators definitely want to do the right thing, 17,000 people are treated really unfairly. And so now the legislators want to look at addressing that. And I know that the state wants to see solar come back, the community definitely wants us to come back. So that's another area that I think we'll see more clarity around the February, March timeframe.
Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
And then just a small kind of a technical question. You introduced a new line item on the revenue statement operating lease prepayments and upfront incentives. What is that going to correlate with? In other words, is that tied to your cash sales or the megawatts installed, what's the connection there?
Tanguy Vincent Serra - President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. Thanks. So what we try to do is really break out in the financials, there's total revenue from periodic billing. So that ties to the amount of megawatts that we have under management, and the irradiance, and the dollars coming in associated with those PPAs, leases and long-term contracts. We then have revenue from offering these prepayments and upfront incentives. So those would be correlated to the one-off dollars coming in from specific one-off programs. And so that would correlate to megawatts installed or deployed, deployed would be probably a better metric.
Pavel S. Molchanov - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. Appreciate it.
