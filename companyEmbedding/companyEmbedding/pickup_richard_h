      Epicor’s Board and management team, I am pleased to welcome Richard and 
      John to Epicor’s Board. These appointments increase stockholder 
      representation on the Board and are a testament to our commitment to 
      drive value for all stockholders. Together, Richard and John bring years 
      of expertise in their respective fields to our Board and are an 
      excellent complement to the existing strengths of our Board. We welcome 
      the new perspectives and insights they will provide. We believe the 
      agreement we have reached with Elliott Associates is in the best 
      interest of the Company and its stockholders and we look forward to 
      executing on our strategic plan, which we believe will drive stockholder 
      value.”
    

      “As a major shareholder interested in Epicor's long-term value, Elliott 
      is pleased to have worked with the Company to reach this agreement,” 
      said Jesse A. Cohn, Portfolio Manager at Elliott Associates. “With two 
      shareholder-appointed representatives on its Board and a constructive 
      dialogue in place between Epicor and its shareholders, we believe the 
      focus is firmly on maximizing shareholder value.”

The Crowd: New owners welcomed in at Balboa Bay Club - tribunedigital-dailypilot

YOU ARE HERE: Daily Pilot Home→Collections→Newport BeachThe Crowd: New owners welcomed in at Balboa Bay ClubJuly 11, 2012|By B.W. CookIN CHARGE: Richard and Donna Pickup welcome 700 guests… (Daily Pilot )The changing of the guard at The Balboa Bay Club and Resort officially took place last week. The new owners of the legendary coastal hotel and club introduced themselves to the community, welcoming some 700 guests to a cocktail reception in the Grand Ballroom.Producers of the event set up a raised stage and seated the executive team, led by the controlling interest of Richard H. Pickup joined by son Todd Pickup, son-in-law Kevin Martin, business partner Tim Busch and hotel executive Steve Arnold. Following a brief introduction by John Wortmann, chairman of the club's board of governors, the gentlemen fielded questions taken from the audience in advance concerning the future of the institution that will celebrate its 65th anniversary in 2013 as Newport Beach's "Host of the Coast."The overflow crowd came together much like an enormous family, many of whom represent multiple generations of Newport Beach residents associated with the history of the property. Because the BBC has for decades been the setting of social, charitable, family and civic events, the changing of the guard from the previous 41-year ownership under the leadership of the Ray family to the Pickup family and partners is a serious issue to locals.AdvertisementIrene and Dr. Bill Mathews, prominent local Newport Beach citizens, said, "The BBC is a part of the fabric of this community and we look forward to a new and exciting era on the coast."The gentlemen on the dais responded to questions concerning the future of the property, stressing their intent to preserve its grand history, while making improvements and adapting to a changing 21st century model.Carrie Young of Dover Shores, wife of Rob Young and mother of two twin daughters who recently graduated from Newport Harbor High School, shared, "I have been a member of The BBC my entire life and it was an incredible place for me to grow up, and now is a wonderful place for my children Robin and Christina and my younger son Ryan to enjoy family activities on the bay."Following the question and answer period, the crowd was treated to a cocktail and wine reception with white glove service, tray-passed hors d' oeuvres and sushi bar. Executive Tim Busch, whose family also owns a California winery, Trinitas, generously gifted the entire gathering with a selection of his estate bottled wines.*Across town at Big Canyon Country Club in Newport Beach, some 100 guests came together for the first Wine and Dine benefit for Laura's House.
