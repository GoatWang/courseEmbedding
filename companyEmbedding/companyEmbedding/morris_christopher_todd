  Sprinkler System Benefits






        Sprinkler System Benefits


   
| PROTECT YOUR HOME OR BUSINESS IN MARIN COUNTY, CA Fires can happen at any time, anywhere, and they always come without warning. It’s almost impossible to detect a fire in its beginning stages without an advanced fire protection system like our sprinklers. Our sprinkler systems can detect the fire’s heat, activate individually where needed, and respond immediately to eliminate any further damage. While smoke detectors simply warn you of the dangers of smoke, our automated sprinkler systems are proactive in putting out the fire and smoke.
 




   




   
 
| FIRE SPRINKLER SYSTEM BENEFITS


Sense of SecurityIf a fire is under control, there is less need for firefighters and other emergency responders to have to enter your home, meaning less intrusion and increased safety for all involved. Immediate AlertYour automatic sprinkler systems will alert occupants and emergency response personnel of the developing fire. Used in combination with a smoke detector alarm, everyone will be warned of the situation at hand and will be able to respond accordingly.Enhanced Life SafetyYour family or the personnel and tenants in your building won’t be at a high-risk if a fire breaks out.


   




   
 
| CALL TODAY FOR AN EVALUATION OF YOUR SYSTEM


Reduced Heat and Smoke DamageWhen the fire is quelled at an earlier stage, there will be much less smoke and fire damage to your property.Decreased Insurance ExpensesIf your insurance company is aware of your system, they will usually offer a generous discount, which can save you a good amount of money each year.Immediate Identification and ControlSprinkler systems are ready 24/7 to respond at any time, whether or not someone is home, so that your property is safe even while you’re away.

BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
                    





Mail Returned









                        BBB reports when mail sent to the business was returned by the Postal Service.

BBB Rating System Overview














Customer Review Rating:









                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        Christopher Todd Morrison, PC has received 5 out of 5 stars based on 1 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

| PROTECT YOUR HOME OR BUSINESS IN MARIN COUNTY, CA Fires can happen at any time, anywhere, and they always come without warning. It’s almost impossible to detect a fire in its beginning stages without an advanced fire protection system like our sprinklers. Our sprinkler systems can detect the fire’s heat, activate individually where needed, and respond immediately to eliminate any further damage. While smoke detectors simply warn you of the dangers of smoke, our automated sprinkler systems are proactive in putting out the fire and smoke.
