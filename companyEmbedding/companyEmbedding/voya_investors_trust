Overview+



What is an annuity? 
An annuity is an insurance product that pays you periodic income payments in exchange for your premium payment. It can be used as part of your overall retirement strategy. Depending on the type of annuity, it may help you grow your retirement savings, protect your savings from loss, and offer death benefits to protect your beneficiaries. 




How to choose an annuity
Make your choice based on how your needs match up to the features of the annuity. Do you need to grow your retirement savings or are you concerned with losing principal? Or both? Do you need income that starts now or in the future? Do you want to leave a legacy to your heirs? These are some of the questions to ask yourself to determine which annuity might work for you. 




Why Voya?
Voya Financial is ready to help Americans build a secure financial future—one person, one family, one institution at a time. We are ready to make a difference—to deliver financial solutions to help all Americans become retirement ready.

2 As of 06/30/16, Voya IM assets of $218 billion include proprietary insurance general account assets of $93 billion calculated on a market value basis. Voya IM assets as reported in Voya Financial, Inc. SEC filings, include general account assets valued on a statutory book value basis and total approximately $204 billion.

4 Metrics presented use pre-determined criteria to measure each individual investment product based on its ability to either A) rank above the median of its peer category; or B) outperform its benchmark index on a gross-of-fees basis. Generally speaking, the results for unconstrained, fully-active investment products were based on relevant peer category rankings while those of "enhanced index", rules-based, risk-constrained, or client-specific investment products were based on benchmark-relative performance. Metrics are calculated on an annualized basis and includes mutual funds as well as pooled and separately-managed institutional portfolios that fall within our traditional (long-only) commercial book of business that remain open as of 6/30/16. If terminated and other accounts had been included, results may have differed from that shown. Source of performance returns and peer medians is Voya Investment Management but is based in part on data from Morningstar (mutual funds) and eVestment (institutional composites). Further detailed information regarding these calculations is available upon request.
5 Metrics are based on observations of rolling 3-year annualized returns over the last 30 months, calculated on an annualized, gross-of-fees basis, and includes mutual funds as well as pooled and separately-managed institutional portfolios that fall within our traditional (long-only commercial book of business that remain open as of 06/30/2016. If terminated and other accounts had been included, results may have differed from that shown. Source of performance returns is Voya Investment Management, and further detailed information regarding these calculations is available upon request.
Past performance is not indicative of future results.

View Detailed Performance






The performance quoted represents past performance and does not guarantee future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance information shown. The investment return and principal value of an investment in the Portfolio will fluctuate, so that your shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. See above “Average Annual Total Returns %” for performance information current to the most recent month-end. Returns for the other share classes will vary due to different charges and expenses. Performance assumes reinvestment of distributions and does not account for taxes.Total investment return at net asset value has been calculated assuming a purchase at net asset value at the beginning of the period and a sale at net asset value at the end of the period; and assumes reinvestment of dividends, capital gain distributions and return of capital distributions/allocations, if any, in accordance with the provisions of the dividend reinvestment plan. Net asset value equals total Fund assets net of Fund expenses such as operating costs and management fees. Total investment return at net asset value is not annualized for periods less than one year.



Benchmark Disclosures

S&P 500 Index
The Standard and Poor's 500 Index is an unmanaged capitalization-weighted index of 500 stocks designed to measure performance of the broad domestic economy through changes in the aggregate market value of 500 stocks representing all major industries. The index does not reflect fees, brokerage commissions, taxes or other expenses of investing. Investors cannot invest directly in an index.




Principal Risks
All investing involves risks of fluctuating prices and the uncertainties of rates of return and yield inherent in investing. Investing in funds that are concentrated in a smaller number of holdings poses greater risk than funds with a larger number of holdings because each investment has a greater effect on the Fund's performance. The value of a participation fluctuates with the market value of the underlying portfolio securities of the Trust. The dividend income, if any, from the portfolio securities is subject to fluctuation which in turn will affect the amounts of distributions made to participants. An investor in the Trust has no assurance against loss in a declining market, and redemption at a time when the market value of the participations is less than their cost will result in a loss to the investor.Taxation: For Federal income tax purposes, (1) the Trust will be treated as a fixed investment trust and will not be subject to Federal income tax, (2) each participant will be treated as the owner of his pro rata portion of the common stock of the corporations held by the Trust, (3) each participant will be required to include in his gross income his pro rata portion of the dividends and interest received by the Trust (including the amounts of such dividends and interest that are not distributed to participants but are used to pay the fees and expenses of the Trust), at the time such dividends and interest are received by the Trust, not at the later time such dividends and interests are distributed to participants or reinvested in additional participations, and (4) each individual participant who itemizes deductions may deduct his pro rata portion of the fees and expenses of the Trust only to the extent such amount, together with his other miscellaneous itemized deductions, exceeds 2% of his adjusted gross income. Please see the prospectus for further information.
