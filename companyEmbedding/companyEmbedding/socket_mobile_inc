Socket Mobile Family of Products
Socket Mobile barcode scanners connect over Bluetooth in two form factors: handheld and attachable.  The stand-alone handheld models come in standard (colorful Series 7) and durable (DuraScan IP54 dust and water rated) with three types of scanning engines: linear imager (7Ci or D700), laser (7Mi or D730) and 2D (7Qi or D750). The attachable models (S800 linear imager and S850 2D) attach to a smartphone or tablet for scanning convenience.  Attachment options include a Socket provided Klip for easy removal or with our optional DuraCase sleeve for enhanced single-handed scanning and charging with smartphones.  The attachables can also be used as a handheld. The Company is also developing a handheld contactless reader/writer for data capture using Near Field Communications (NFC) for availability later in 2017.







Developer Program –     Socket Mobile’s SDK enables Apple, Android and Windows application developers to create custom or commercial mobile data collection solutions.  A single installation of the Socket SDK provides universal support for Socket Mobile data capture products, giving customers the opportunity to select the data capture products that work best for them and retaining the ability to upgrade at any time.  Socket supports a compelling portfolio of enterprise solutions, with hundreds of business applications published in the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store and many proprietary applications distributed to enterprise end users.
