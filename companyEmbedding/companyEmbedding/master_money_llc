SAVE MONEY WITH OFFSHORE ASIAN TOOLING
Master Molded Products, LLC. can now build your molds at our partner tool shops in Asia! MMP tooling and project engineers at our facility in Elgin Illinois, with our on site project managers in Shanghai China ,will guide your Asian tooling project with the same technical precision and dedication as if it were being built domestically.
MMP now also has tooling partners in JAPAN.
MMP employs the same proven mold design and project management techniques for our Asian molds as we do for domestically built  North American molds.
MMP Asian molds are designed and built in China to the same exacting specifications for production in our molding facility in Elgin, Illinois. This is accomplished by doing the following:

Complete mold design review and approval prior to mold construction by MMP tooling engineers.
Specification of European or Japanese tool steels to ensure long life and durability.
Use of standard, readily available mold components.
On Site project management and a minimum 24 hour run off prior to tool shipment and approval.








Master Molded Products, LLC. will guarantee your mold, depending on part complexity and cavitation, for 1 to 3 million shots and that if your tool is sourced over seas through us, it will run and function for years, as if it were built originally in North America.
Remember …..Chinese molds built in China for production of parts in China ARE NOT THE SAME as the Asian molds MMP builds for production in the U.S.A.
LET US DEMONSTRATE HOW OUR ASIAN-CHINESE TOOLING PARTNERS CAN SAVE YOU MONEY WITH A QUALITY MOLD AND ENSURE YOUR PRODUCTS SUCCESS!!! 
Contact us at 847-695-9700 or sales@mastermolded.com to have us quote this option for your next custom molding project!
