Laboratory WeighingBalances and Scales for the LaboratoryHow can we assist you?►Expertise Library ►Product Finder ►Service Finder  Laboratory Weighing – Laboratory Balances and ScalesWhat is the difference between mass and weight?The words ‘mass’ and ‘weight’ are frequently used interchangeably, and both are determined by weighing, however, in terms of laboratory balances and scales, the difference between the two is key. Mass measures the amount of material in any given item, is independent of location, and remains the same, no matter their environment. Mass is measured via comparison using a balance. The kilogram is the SI unit of mass; it is equal to the ‘International Prototype Kilogram’ (IPK), the original object from which the measurement derived. An object’s weight is how hard gravity is pulling on the mass, as a force. The SI unit for weight is the Newton (= 1 kg x m/s2). An object with a mass of 1.0 kg weighs approximately 9.81 Newtons on the surface of the earth (mass multiplied by earth’s gravity). The weight of an object on a mountain will be less than at sea level, due to gravitational variations - a high accuracy balance will detect such differences. The redefinition of the kilogram is scheduled for 2018. Supporting Redefinition of the Kilogram offers further reading about the change. Although mass and weight are different entities, the process of determining both weight and mass is called weighing. How do electronic balances work? What is the electromagnetic force compensation principle?With mechanical balances, a sample is placed on one end of the beam, reference weights on the other, until it is perfectly balanced, the sum value of the weights representing the mass of the sample. Electronic precision balances, analytical balances, and microbalances in high accuracy classes work with a sensor based on electromagnetic force compensation. A coil on a free movable beam is inserted in a permanent magnetic field. An optical electronic sensor current maintains its position, controlled to an accuracy greater than one thousandth of a millimetre. The sensor records vertical position changes when the pan is loaded which is used to change the current in the coil to return to its initial position. The more weight is added to the pan, the more current is needed to compensate it, this is digitized on the display. Laboratory balances and readabilitiesCommon laboratory balances and scales types are ultra-micro, micro, semi-micro, analytical, and precision balances. The readability of a balance is the smallest difference between two measured values that can be read on the display. With a digital display this is the smallest numerical increment, also called the scale interval. The readability of a balance is not equivalent to its weighing accuracy. Several properties may limit performance. The most important are repeatability (RP), eccentricity (EC), nonlinearity (NL) and sensitivity (SE).Our Laboratory Balances and Scales video course Basics and Weighing Influences explains basic concepts of good weighing practice. How to select the right laboratory balance or scale?For accurate measuring, consider:Required weighing accuracy -> sets the upper limit to the allowable measurement uncertainty of the balance to ensure process tolerances e.g. 1%Safety Factor -> ensures that even with changes over time, the required weighing accuracy is still keptRequired smallest net weight to be weighed -> specifies the minimum weight the balance must achieve (according to measurement uncertainty and/or customer process tolerances)Largest weight to be weighed (including tare) -> specifies the capacity of the balanceEnvironmental conditions and weighing application -> specifies further properties of the laboratory balances and scalesMake sure that you select a lab balance or scale that meets YOUR process requirements and respective tolerances. Good Weighing Practice™ (GWP®) is a universal approach to selecting and testing weighing instruments. A global standard, it can be used in any industrial and working area for new or existing weighing systems. GWP® provides documented evidence for reproducible weighing results in accordance with all current quality standards. Offering reliable product quality and regulatory compliance, GWP® is a benchmark for laboratory balances and scales, and uses two key issues to determine quality:The weighing capacity must be larger than the largest gross load expected to be weighed by the userThe minimum weight of the weighing instrument for the accuracy required - including the safety factor - must be smaller than the smallest sample expected to be weighed by the user. What is the resolution of a laboratory weighing instrument?The resolution is the degree to which change can be detected, usually expressed as a number of points. It is the capacity (in g) divided by the readability (in g). An analytical balance or scale with a capacity of 200 g and a readability of 0.00001 g has a resolution of 20 million points. METTLER TOLEDO’s highest resolution comparator is the M1 mass comparator, with 1 billion points. Which tolerances are applicable in weighing processes?Tolerances determine whether a lab balance or scale behaves "well enough" to meet process requirements and how much deviation is permittable. Tolerances set the criteria to issue a Pass/Fail statement. Tolerances come from a variety of sources, including legal agencies, manufacturing industries, and the process itself.Legal tolerances:Legal tolerances stipulated by OIML R76 or NIST Handbook 44 (US only) assess legal for trade requirements. These tolerances are quite large and easily met with laboratory balances, or when weighing at the lower end of the measurement range.Manufacturer tolerances:Manufacturer tolerances ensure that equipment meets manufacturer specifications. Manufacturer tolerances do not consider user specific process requirements, and are unsuitable for improving the weighing process.Process tolerances: Specific process tolerances defined by the user, support process improvements and savings on material, waste and rework. For scales in a legal for trade application, process tolerances should be applied in addition to legal tolerances. For more details on METTLER TOLEDO's GWP Verification® visit: Good Weighing Practice. Legal tolerances protect consumers but do not consider specific producer requirements. Optimising process tolerances can have a large impact on process profitability. ProductsApplicationsPublicationsServicesSoftware & AccessoriesProductsApplicationsPublicationsServicesSoftware & Accessories

Truck Scales / Weighbridges and DimensioningDimensioning, Weighing and Identification / Truck Scales and WeighbridgesHow can we assist you?►Expertise Library ►Product Finder ►Service Finder  We are the Leading Supplier for Transportation and Logistics Solutions WorldwideRugged and reliable truck scales are critical for weighing bulk goods bought or sold by the truckload. Truck scales are industrial scales that are capable of weighing trucks of all sizes. Often, they are used to monitor intake and output volumes at facilities, such as solid waste processing and recycling centers, construction sites and more. The truck scale consists of the foundation, which may be a permanent installation made from concrete; a truck scale or scale deck; the load cells, which are the sensors that measure the weighing on the scale; the terminal or indicator, which displays the weight value; and cables, which connect the load cells to the terminals. Legal-for-trade applications require scale calibration at certain intervals, which are determined by local weights and measures authorities. Truck scales can lose their accuracy over time, which is why regular calibration service is critical.

Formation and history[edit]
Toledo Scale Company[edit]




Toledo counter-top fan scale






Toledo dial scale






A Toledo scale used in a hospital cafeteria


Allen DeVilbiss, Jr. (1873-1911) was an inventor who lived in Toledo, Ohio, USA. He became interested in the concept of weighing machines and conceived the idea of an automatic computing pendulum scale. He was able to prove his concept with a local butcher, who realized that customers appreciated the automatic computation which eliminated the risk of overcharging. While his invention gained in popularity, DeVilbiss was not interested in making it a viable business.[2]
In 1900, Henry Theobald (1868-1924) was fired from his job at the National Cash Register Company. He decided to start his own business, and was convinced that selling the automatic computing scales could be a good business. He solicited additional financial investors and purchased the company from DeVilbiss. On July 10, 1901, the Toledo Computing Scale and Cash Register Company was incorporated.[2]
By May 1902, Theobald's company was selling more than 100 cash registers with scales per month. By that time, John H. Patterson, Theobald's boss from NCR, threatened to sue the new company for patent infringements. As an alternative, Patterson offered to purchase all cash register patents and property, along with the stipulation that Theobald would no longer engage in the cash register business. The investors, who worried about the costs of patent infringement litigation, agreed to the sale in June 1902. Since cash registers were no longer part of Theobald's business, he changed the name to Toledo Computing Scale Company. Theobald later coined the phrase "No Springs, Honest Weight" as a slogan for the new company.[2][2]
In the years that followed, Theobald realized that the weighing scale was the most important part of the retail transaction between the merchant and the customer. He felt that many of his competitors who used spring scale technology, especially Dayton Scale Company, were allowing merchants to cheat their customers by incorrectly calculating the total price of a measured good. He campaigned for more government regulation of weights and measures to eliminate dishonest weighing systems. On October 1, 1907, Massachusetts adopted the first weights and measures laws in the United States.[3]
In 1912, the company name changed once again, to Toledo Scale Company.[4] Additionally, a new scale line featuring a double pedulum mechanism and a dial face was introduced and was most suited for industrial applications.[5]
Mettler Instruments AG[edit]
In 1945, Dr. Erhard Mettler, a Swiss engineer, started a precision mechanics company in Küsnacht, Switzerland. He invented the substitution principle with a single-pan balance, capable of being produced in series. Analytical balances with a single weighing pan gradually replaced conventional two-pan balances in the laboratory.
Mettler diversified its product line in 1970 with the introduction of its automated titration systems, and the acquisition of balance manufacturer Microwa AG. Mettler acquired its 500-employee competitor August Sauter KG, of Albstadt-Ebingen, Germany, in 1971, for its specialized industrial and retail scales.[6]
In 1980, Dr. Mettler sold his business to Ciba-Geigy AG. A third pillar - after laboratory and industrial - was created: the retail business. Technological progress had made it possible to advance retail scales to instruments for the management of perishable goods.
Mettler Toledo[edit]
In 1989, Reliance Electric sold the Toledo Scale division to Ciba-Geigy AG. The division was then merged with Mettler Instruments. The merger vastly increased the global scope of the company, which, as a result, operated in 18 countries. Mettler acquired another competitor, Ohaus Corp., in 1990.[6] In 1992, the company was incorporated as Mettler Toledo, Inc.[5]
In 1996/97, Mettler Toledo, Inc. was sold by Ciba-Geigy AG to the New York-based AEA Investors Inc., in preparation for a subsequent initial public offering. The initial public offering was completed and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange, under the ticker symbol NYSE: MTD.
The resultant company is currently headquartered in Greifensee, Switzerland, with offices for its many brands based around the world.
Operational structure[edit]
Mettler-Toledo is a global manufacturer and marketer of precision instruments for use in laboratory, industrial and food retailing applications. They are geographically diversified with sales in 2012 derived 34% from Europe, 34% from the Americas, and 32% from Asia and other countries. The Company has an extensive global sales and service organization with approximately 6,000, or approximately one-half, of the employees providing sales and service in 36 countries. The Company has a manufacturing presence in Europe, the United States and China.[1]
Laboratory Instruments[edit]
1952, the measurement of up to one ten-millionth of a gram became possible with the laboratory balance products. "The Mettler Balance" proved to be a catchphrase in the laboratory.[citation needed] Consequently, with the advancement of microprocessor technology over the years, a wide range of products for the laboratory were invented, like automated titrators and thermal analyzers. Mettler-Toledo laboratory products and technology were able to improve processes in research and development, drug discovery and quality control. Application-specific software for balances provides data analysis opportunities to enhance accuracy, productivity and compliance.
RAININ Instrument[edit]
In 2001, Mettler-Toledo purchased Rainin Instrument, LLC, which is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Mettler-Toledo.[7] Rainin supplies precision instruments and services worldwide. Rainin pipettes provides automated chemistry systems used in drug and chemical compound discovery and development. The company also manufacturers and markets metal detection and other end-of-line inspection systems used in production and packaging.
AutoChem[edit]
The Mettler-Toledo AutoChem Inc. develops process analytical technology (PAT), automated reactors, and in situ sampling for use in the chemical, pharmaceutical, and academia industries. Specifically, in situ spectroscopy and automated sampling provides continuous analysis of chemical reactions; inline particle size analysis enables crystallization, suspension, and emulsion development with real-time particle size and shape measurements; and automated reactors and reaction calorimetry provides process knowledge to eliminate scale-up and safety incidents. As METTLER TOLEDO built the franchise from a startup operation in the early 1990s, several companies were acquired. These acquisitions included ASI Applied System Inc., Lasentec®, and the Virtual Lab software business from Avantium to assemble the technology platforms required to develop and maintain its market leading position.
THORNTON[edit]
Thornton, Inc. Process Analytics Division [8] founded in 1964 develops, manufactures, markets, and supplies instrumentation and sensors used for liquid process measurement and control applications.The instrumentation provides pure water treatment measurement & control for the pharmaceutical industry; and parameters of conductivity/resistivity, TOC, pH, DO, dissolved ozone and flow for the semiconductor and power industries.
INGOLD[edit]
Founded in 1948,[9] INGOLD specializes in solutions for pH, DO, conductivity, turbidity and CO2 for process analytics applications in chemical, pharmaceutical and food & beverage industries.
Industrial Instruments[edit]
The Company manufactures numerous industrial weighing instruments and related terminals and offer software for the pharmaceutical, chemical, food and other industries. In addition, it manufactures metal detection and other end-of-line product inspection systems used in production and packaging. The Company supplies automatic identification and data capture solutions, which integrate in-motion weighing, dimensioning and identification technologies for transport, shipping and logistics customers. The Company also offers heavy industrial scales and related software.
Cargoscan[edit]
Mettler-Toledo Cargoscan Dimensioning solutions are used by international transport companies, small carriers, warehouses and distribution centres around the world. Systems are all approved according to international weights and measures standards, ensuring high instrument performance. It has been shown that laser range finder technology provides high accuracy in the industry making an impact on a production's revenue.[citation needed]
Hi-Speed[edit]
Hi-Speed division joined Mettler-Toledo in 1981 to provide weighing solutions for laboratory, industrial, and food retailing applications. The Product Inspection Team provides the checkweighers, metal detection devices, and other end-of-line inspection systems for local and multinational companies worldwide
Safeline[edit]
Safeline was developed in 1989 at METTLER TOLEDO. The Safeline product was an advanced metal detector the used digital technology for increased sensitivity and accuracy.
To expand the detection solutions, METTLER TOLEDO acquired AVS Raytech and AVS Metrology in 2000. AVS Raytech manufactured x-ray inspection equipment. The x-ray inspection equipment combined with the detection products allowed companies to identify multiple contaminants as well as verifying product integrity and portion control.
CI-VISION[edit]
Mettler-Toledo CI-Vision is a wholly owned subsidiary of Mettler-Toledo Inc. The Mettler-Toledo Product Inspection Group, consisting of CI-Vision, Hi-Speed and Safeline, is a superior supplier of in-line checkweighers, metal detectors, machine vision systems and x-ray inspection systems.

Formation and history[edit]
Toledo Scale Company[edit]




Toledo counter-top fan scale






Toledo dial scale






A Toledo scale used in a hospital cafeteria


Allen DeVilbiss, Jr. (1873-1911) was an inventor who lived in Toledo, Ohio, USA. He became interested in the concept of weighing machines and conceived the idea of an automatic computing pendulum scale. He was able to prove his concept with a local butcher, who realized that customers appreciated the automatic computation which eliminated the risk of overcharging. While his invention gained in popularity, DeVilbiss was not interested in making it a viable business.[2]
In 1900, Henry Theobald (1868-1924) was fired from his job at the National Cash Register Company. He decided to start his own business, and was convinced that selling the automatic computing scales could be a good business. He solicited additional financial investors and purchased the company from DeVilbiss. On July 10, 1901, the Toledo Computing Scale and Cash Register Company was incorporated.[2]
By May 1902, Theobald's company was selling more than 100 cash registers with scales per month. By that time, John H. Patterson, Theobald's boss from NCR, threatened to sue the new company for patent infringements. As an alternative, Patterson offered to purchase all cash register patents and property, along with the stipulation that Theobald would no longer engage in the cash register business. The investors, who worried about the costs of patent infringement litigation, agreed to the sale in June 1902. Since cash registers were no longer part of Theobald's business, he changed the name to Toledo Computing Scale Company. Theobald later coined the phrase "No Springs, Honest Weight" as a slogan for the new company.[2][2]
In the years that followed, Theobald realized that the weighing scale was the most important part of the retail transaction between the merchant and the customer. He felt that many of his competitors who used spring scale technology, especially Dayton Scale Company, were allowing merchants to cheat their customers by incorrectly calculating the total price of a measured good. He campaigned for more government regulation of weights and measures to eliminate dishonest weighing systems. On October 1, 1907, Massachusetts adopted the first weights and measures laws in the United States.[3]
In 1912, the company name changed once again, to Toledo Scale Company.[4] Additionally, a new scale line featuring a double pedulum mechanism and a dial face was introduced and was most suited for industrial applications.[5]
Mettler Instruments AG[edit]
In 1945, Dr. Erhard Mettler, a Swiss engineer, started a precision mechanics company in Küsnacht, Switzerland. He invented the substitution principle with a single-pan balance, capable of being produced in series. Analytical balances with a single weighing pan gradually replaced conventional two-pan balances in the laboratory.
Mettler diversified its product line in 1970 with the introduction of its automated titration systems, and the acquisition of balance manufacturer Microwa AG. Mettler acquired its 500-employee competitor August Sauter KG, of Albstadt-Ebingen, Germany, in 1971, for its specialized industrial and retail scales.[6]
In 1980, Dr. Mettler sold his business to Ciba-Geigy AG. A third pillar - after laboratory and industrial - was created: the retail business. Technological progress had made it possible to advance retail scales to instruments for the management of perishable goods.
Mettler Toledo[edit]
In 1989, Reliance Electric sold the Toledo Scale division to Ciba-Geigy AG. The division was then merged with Mettler Instruments. The merger vastly increased the global scope of the company, which, as a result, operated in 18 countries. Mettler acquired another competitor, Ohaus Corp., in 1990.[6] In 1992, the company was incorporated as Mettler Toledo, Inc.[5]
In 1996/97, Mettler Toledo, Inc. was sold by Ciba-Geigy AG to the New York-based AEA Investors Inc., in preparation for a subsequent initial public offering. The initial public offering was completed and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange, under the ticker symbol NYSE: MTD.
The resultant company is currently headquartered in Greifensee, Switzerland, with offices for its many brands based around the world.
Operational structure[edit]
Mettler-Toledo is a global manufacturer and marketer of precision instruments for use in laboratory, industrial and food retailing applications. They are geographically diversified with sales in 2012 derived 34% from Europe, 34% from the Americas, and 32% from Asia and other countries. The Company has an extensive global sales and service organization with approximately 6,000, or approximately one-half, of the employees providing sales and service in 36 countries. The Company has a manufacturing presence in Europe, the United States and China.[1]
Laboratory Instruments[edit]
1952, the measurement of up to one ten-millionth of a gram became possible with the laboratory balance products. "The Mettler Balance" proved to be a catchphrase in the laboratory.[citation needed] Consequently, with the advancement of microprocessor technology over the years, a wide range of products for the laboratory were invented, like automated titrators and thermal analyzers. Mettler-Toledo laboratory products and technology were able to improve processes in research and development, drug discovery and quality control. Application-specific software for balances provides data analysis opportunities to enhance accuracy, productivity and compliance.
RAININ Instrument[edit]
In 2001, Mettler-Toledo purchased Rainin Instrument, LLC, which is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Mettler-Toledo.[7] Rainin supplies precision instruments and services worldwide. Rainin pipettes provides automated chemistry systems used in drug and chemical compound discovery and development. The company also manufacturers and markets metal detection and other end-of-line inspection systems used in production and packaging.
AutoChem[edit]
The Mettler-Toledo AutoChem Inc. develops process analytical technology (PAT), automated reactors, and in situ sampling for use in the chemical, pharmaceutical, and academia industries. Specifically, in situ spectroscopy and automated sampling provides continuous analysis of chemical reactions; inline particle size analysis enables crystallization, suspension, and emulsion development with real-time particle size and shape measurements; and automated reactors and reaction calorimetry provides process knowledge to eliminate scale-up and safety incidents. As METTLER TOLEDO built the franchise from a startup operation in the early 1990s, several companies were acquired. These acquisitions included ASI Applied System Inc., Lasentec®, and the Virtual Lab software business from Avantium to assemble the technology platforms required to develop and maintain its market leading position.
THORNTON[edit]
Thornton, Inc. Process Analytics Division [8] founded in 1964 develops, manufactures, markets, and supplies instrumentation and sensors used for liquid process measurement and control applications.The instrumentation provides pure water treatment measurement & control for the pharmaceutical industry; and parameters of conductivity/resistivity, TOC, pH, DO, dissolved ozone and flow for the semiconductor and power industries.
INGOLD[edit]
Founded in 1948,[9] INGOLD specializes in solutions for pH, DO, conductivity, turbidity and CO2 for process analytics applications in chemical, pharmaceutical and food & beverage industries.
Industrial Instruments[edit]
The Company manufactures numerous industrial weighing instruments and related terminals and offer software for the pharmaceutical, chemical, food and other industries. In addition, it manufactures metal detection and other end-of-line product inspection systems used in production and packaging. The Company supplies automatic identification and data capture solutions, which integrate in-motion weighing, dimensioning and identification technologies for transport, shipping and logistics customers. The Company also offers heavy industrial scales and related software.
Cargoscan[edit]
Mettler-Toledo Cargoscan Dimensioning solutions are used by international transport companies, small carriers, warehouses and distribution centres around the world. Systems are all approved according to international weights and measures standards, ensuring high instrument performance. It has been shown that laser range finder technology provides high accuracy in the industry making an impact on a production's revenue.[citation needed]
Hi-Speed[edit]
Hi-Speed division joined Mettler-Toledo in 1981 to provide weighing solutions for laboratory, industrial, and food retailing applications. The Product Inspection Team provides the checkweighers, metal detection devices, and other end-of-line inspection systems for local and multinational companies worldwide
Safeline[edit]
Safeline was developed in 1989 at METTLER TOLEDO. The Safeline product was an advanced metal detector the used digital technology for increased sensitivity and accuracy.
To expand the detection solutions, METTLER TOLEDO acquired AVS Raytech and AVS Metrology in 2000. AVS Raytech manufactured x-ray inspection equipment. The x-ray inspection equipment combined with the detection products allowed companies to identify multiple contaminants as well as verifying product integrity and portion control.
CI-VISION[edit]
Mettler-Toledo CI-Vision is a wholly owned subsidiary of Mettler-Toledo Inc. The Mettler-Toledo Product Inspection Group, consisting of CI-Vision, Hi-Speed and Safeline, is a superior supplier of in-line checkweighers, metal detectors, machine vision systems and x-ray inspection systems.

Formation and history[edit]
Toledo Scale Company[edit]

A Toledo scale used in a hospital cafeteria


Allen DeVilbiss, Jr. (1873-1911) was an inventor who lived in Toledo, Ohio, USA. He became interested in the concept of weighing machines and conceived the idea of an automatic computing pendulum scale. He was able to prove his concept with a local butcher, who realized that customers appreciated the automatic computation which eliminated the risk of overcharging. While his invention gained in popularity, DeVilbiss was not interested in making it a viable business.[2]
In 1900, Henry Theobald (1868-1924) was fired from his job at the National Cash Register Company. He decided to start his own business, and was convinced that selling the automatic computing scales could be a good business. He solicited additional financial investors and purchased the company from DeVilbiss. On July 10, 1901, the Toledo Computing Scale and Cash Register Company was incorporated.[2]
By May 1902, Theobald's company was selling more than 100 cash registers with scales per month. By that time, John H. Patterson, Theobald's boss from NCR, threatened to sue the new company for patent infringements. As an alternative, Patterson offered to purchase all cash register patents and property, along with the stipulation that Theobald would no longer engage in the cash register business. The investors, who worried about the costs of patent infringement litigation, agreed to the sale in June 1902. Since cash registers were no longer part of Theobald's business, he changed the name to Toledo Computing Scale Company. Theobald later coined the phrase "No Springs, Honest Weight" as a slogan for the new company.[2][2]
In the years that followed, Theobald realized that the weighing scale was the most important part of the retail transaction between the merchant and the customer. He felt that many of his competitors who used spring scale technology, especially Dayton Scale Company, were allowing merchants to cheat their customers by incorrectly calculating the total price of a measured good. He campaigned for more government regulation of weights and measures to eliminate dishonest weighing systems. On October 1, 1907, Massachusetts adopted the first weights and measures laws in the United States.[3]
In 1912, the company name changed once again, to Toledo Scale Company.[4] Additionally, a new scale line featuring a double pedulum mechanism and a dial face was introduced and was most suited for industrial applications.[5]
Mettler Instruments AG[edit]
In 1945, Dr. Erhard Mettler, a Swiss engineer, started a precision mechanics company in Küsnacht, Switzerland. He invented the substitution principle with a single-pan balance, capable of being produced in series. Analytical balances with a single weighing pan gradually replaced conventional two-pan balances in the laboratory.
Mettler diversified its product line in 1970 with the introduction of its automated titration systems, and the acquisition of balance manufacturer Microwa AG. Mettler acquired its 500-employee competitor August Sauter KG, of Albstadt-Ebingen, Germany, in 1971, for its specialized industrial and retail scales.[6]
In 1980, Dr. Mettler sold his business to Ciba-Geigy AG. A third pillar - after laboratory and industrial - was created: the retail business. Technological progress had made it possible to advance retail scales to instruments for the management of perishable goods.
Mettler Toledo[edit]
In 1989, Reliance Electric sold the Toledo Scale division to Ciba-Geigy AG. The division was then merged with Mettler Instruments. The merger vastly increased the global scope of the company, which, as a result, operated in 18 countries. Mettler acquired another competitor, Ohaus Corp., in 1990.[6] In 1992, the company was incorporated as Mettler Toledo, Inc.[5]
In 1996/97, Mettler Toledo, Inc. was sold by Ciba-Geigy AG to the New York-based AEA Investors Inc., in preparation for a subsequent initial public offering. The initial public offering was completed and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange, under the ticker symbol NYSE: MTD.
The resultant company is currently headquartered in Greifensee, Switzerland, with offices for its many brands based around the world.
Operational structure[edit]
Mettler-Toledo is a global manufacturer and marketer of precision instruments for use in laboratory, industrial and food retailing applications. They are geographically diversified with sales in 2012 derived 34% from Europe, 34% from the Americas, and 32% from Asia and other countries. The Company has an extensive global sales and service organization with approximately 6,000, or approximately one-half, of the employees providing sales and service in 36 countries. The Company has a manufacturing presence in Europe, the United States and China.[1]
Laboratory Instruments[edit]
1952, the measurement of up to one ten-millionth of a gram became possible with the laboratory balance products. "The Mettler Balance" proved to be a catchphrase in the laboratory.[citation needed] Consequently, with the advancement of microprocessor technology over the years, a wide range of products for the laboratory were invented, like automated titrators and thermal analyzers. Mettler-Toledo laboratory products and technology were able to improve processes in research and development, drug discovery and quality control. Application-specific software for balances provides data analysis opportunities to enhance accuracy, productivity and compliance.
RAININ Instrument[edit]
In 2001, Mettler-Toledo purchased Rainin Instrument, LLC, which is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Mettler-Toledo.[7] Rainin supplies precision instruments and services worldwide. Rainin pipettes provides automated chemistry systems used in drug and chemical compound discovery and development. The company also manufacturers and markets metal detection and other end-of-line inspection systems used in production and packaging.
AutoChem[edit]
The Mettler-Toledo AutoChem Inc. develops process analytical technology (PAT), automated reactors, and in situ sampling for use in the chemical, pharmaceutical, and academia industries. Specifically, in situ spectroscopy and automated sampling provides continuous analysis of chemical reactions; inline particle size analysis enables crystallization, suspension, and emulsion development with real-time particle size and shape measurements; and automated reactors and reaction calorimetry provides process knowledge to eliminate scale-up and safety incidents. As METTLER TOLEDO built the franchise from a startup operation in the early 1990s, several companies were acquired. These acquisitions included ASI Applied System Inc., Lasentec®, and the Virtual Lab software business from Avantium to assemble the technology platforms required to develop and maintain its market leading position.
THORNTON[edit]
Thornton, Inc. Process Analytics Division [8] founded in 1964 develops, manufactures, markets, and supplies instrumentation and sensors used for liquid process measurement and control applications.The instrumentation provides pure water treatment measurement & control for the pharmaceutical industry; and parameters of conductivity/resistivity, TOC, pH, DO, dissolved ozone and flow for the semiconductor and power industries.
INGOLD[edit]
Founded in 1948,[9] INGOLD specializes in solutions for pH, DO, conductivity, turbidity and CO2 for process analytics applications in chemical, pharmaceutical and food & beverage industries.
Industrial Instruments[edit]
The Company manufactures numerous industrial weighing instruments and related terminals and offer software for the pharmaceutical, chemical, food and other industries. In addition, it manufactures metal detection and other end-of-line product inspection systems used in production and packaging. The Company supplies automatic identification and data capture solutions, which integrate in-motion weighing, dimensioning and identification technologies for transport, shipping and logistics customers. The Company also offers heavy industrial scales and related software.
Cargoscan[edit]
Mettler-Toledo Cargoscan Dimensioning solutions are used by international transport companies, small carriers, warehouses and distribution centres around the world. Systems are all approved according to international weights and measures standards, ensuring high instrument performance. It has been shown that laser range finder technology provides high accuracy in the industry making an impact on a production's revenue.[citation needed]
Hi-Speed[edit]
Hi-Speed division joined Mettler-Toledo in 1981 to provide weighing solutions for laboratory, industrial, and food retailing applications. The Product Inspection Team provides the checkweighers, metal detection devices, and other end-of-line inspection systems for local and multinational companies worldwide
Safeline[edit]
Safeline was developed in 1989 at METTLER TOLEDO. The Safeline product was an advanced metal detector the used digital technology for increased sensitivity and accuracy.
To expand the detection solutions, METTLER TOLEDO acquired AVS Raytech and AVS Metrology in 2000. AVS Raytech manufactured x-ray inspection equipment. The x-ray inspection equipment combined with the detection products allowed companies to identify multiple contaminants as well as verifying product integrity and portion control.
CI-VISION[edit]
Mettler-Toledo CI-Vision is a wholly owned subsidiary of Mettler-Toledo Inc. The Mettler-Toledo Product Inspection Group, consisting of CI-Vision, Hi-Speed and Safeline, is a superior supplier of in-line checkweighers, metal detectors, machine vision systems and x-ray inspection systems.

Formation and history[edit]
Toledo Scale Company[edit]




Toledo counter-top fan scale






Toledo dial scale






A Toledo scale used in a hospital cafeteria


Allen DeVilbiss, Jr. (1873-1911) was an inventor who lived in Toledo, Ohio, USA. He became interested in the concept of weighing machines and conceived the idea of an automatic computing pendulum scale. He was able to prove his concept with a local butcher, who realized that customers appreciated the automatic computation which eliminated the risk of overcharging. While his invention gained in popularity, DeVilbiss was not interested in making it a viable business.[2]
In 1900, Henry Theobald (1868-1924) was fired from his job at the National Cash Register Company. He decided to start his own business, and was convinced that selling the automatic computing scales could be a good business. He solicited additional financial investors and purchased the company from DeVilbiss. On July 10, 1901, the Toledo Computing Scale and Cash Register Company was incorporated.[2]
By May 1902, Theobald's company was selling more than 100 cash registers with scales per month. By that time, John H. Patterson, Theobald's boss from NCR, threatened to sue the new company for patent infringements. As an alternative, Patterson offered to purchase all cash register patents and property, along with the stipulation that Theobald would no longer engage in the cash register business. The investors, who worried about the costs of patent infringement litigation, agreed to the sale in June 1902. Since cash registers were no longer part of Theobald's business, he changed the name to Toledo Computing Scale Company. Theobald later coined the phrase "No Springs, Honest Weight" as a slogan for the new company.[2][2]
In the years that followed, Theobald realized that the weighing scale was the most important part of the retail transaction between the merchant and the customer. He felt that many of his competitors who used spring scale technology, especially Dayton Scale Company, were allowing merchants to cheat their customers by incorrectly calculating the total price of a measured good. He campaigned for more government regulation of weights and measures to eliminate dishonest weighing systems. On October 1, 1907, Massachusetts adopted the first weights and measures laws in the United States.[3]
In 1912, the company name changed once again, to Toledo Scale Company.[4] Additionally, a new scale line featuring a double pedulum mechanism and a dial face was introduced and was most suited for industrial applications.[5]
Mettler Instruments AG[edit]
In 1945, Dr. Erhard Mettler, a Swiss engineer, started a precision mechanics company in Küsnacht, Switzerland. He invented the substitution principle with a single-pan balance, capable of being produced in series. Analytical balances with a single weighing pan gradually replaced conventional two-pan balances in the laboratory.
Mettler diversified its product line in 1970 with the introduction of its automated titration systems, and the acquisition of balance manufacturer Microwa AG. Mettler acquired its 500-employee competitor August Sauter KG, of Albstadt-Ebingen, Germany, in 1971, for its specialized industrial and retail scales.[6]
In 1980, Dr. Mettler sold his business to Ciba-Geigy AG. A third pillar - after laboratory and industrial - was created: the retail business. Technological progress had made it possible to advance retail scales to instruments for the management of perishable goods.
Mettler Toledo[edit]
In 1989, Reliance Electric sold the Toledo Scale division to Ciba-Geigy AG. The division was then merged with Mettler Instruments. The merger vastly increased the global scope of the company, which, as a result, operated in 18 countries. Mettler acquired another competitor, Ohaus Corp., in 1990.[6] In 1992, the company was incorporated as Mettler Toledo, Inc.[5]
In 1996/97, Mettler Toledo, Inc. was sold by Ciba-Geigy AG to the New York-based AEA Investors Inc., in preparation for a subsequent initial public offering. The initial public offering was completed and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange, under the ticker symbol NYSE: MTD.
The resultant company is currently headquartered in Greifensee, Switzerland, with offices for its many brands based around the world.
Operational structure[edit]
Mettler-Toledo is a global manufacturer and marketer of precision instruments for use in laboratory, industrial and food retailing applications. They are geographically diversified with sales in 2012 derived 34% from Europe, 34% from the Americas, and 32% from Asia and other countries. The Company has an extensive global sales and service organization with approximately 6,000, or approximately one-half, of the employees providing sales and service in 36 countries. The Company has a manufacturing presence in Europe, the United States and China.[1]
Laboratory Instruments[edit]
1952, the measurement of up to one ten-millionth of a gram became possible with the laboratory balance products. "The Mettler Balance" proved to be a catchphrase in the laboratory.[citation needed] Consequently, with the advancement of microprocessor technology over the years, a wide range of products for the laboratory were invented, like automated titrators and thermal analyzers. Mettler-Toledo laboratory products and technology were able to improve processes in research and development, drug discovery and quality control. Application-specific software for balances provides data analysis opportunities to enhance accuracy, productivity and compliance.
RAININ Instrument[edit]
In 2001, Mettler-Toledo purchased Rainin Instrument, LLC, which is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Mettler-Toledo.[7] Rainin supplies precision instruments and services worldwide. Rainin pipettes provides automated chemistry systems used in drug and chemical compound discovery and development. The company also manufacturers and markets metal detection and other end-of-line inspection systems used in production and packaging.
AutoChem[edit]
The Mettler-Toledo AutoChem Inc. develops process analytical technology (PAT), automated reactors, and in situ sampling for use in the chemical, pharmaceutical, and academia industries. Specifically, in situ spectroscopy and automated sampling provides continuous analysis of chemical reactions; inline particle size analysis enables crystallization, suspension, and emulsion development with real-time particle size and shape measurements; and automated reactors and reaction calorimetry provides process knowledge to eliminate scale-up and safety incidents. As METTLER TOLEDO built the franchise from a startup operation in the early 1990s, several companies were acquired. These acquisitions included ASI Applied System Inc., Lasentec®, and the Virtual Lab software business from Avantium to assemble the technology platforms required to develop and maintain its market leading position.
THORNTON[edit]
Thornton, Inc. Process Analytics Division [8] founded in 1964 develops, manufactures, markets, and supplies instrumentation and sensors used for liquid process measurement and control applications.The instrumentation provides pure water treatment measurement & control for the pharmaceutical industry; and parameters of conductivity/resistivity, TOC, pH, DO, dissolved ozone and flow for the semiconductor and power industries.
INGOLD[edit]
Founded in 1948,[9] INGOLD specializes in solutions for pH, DO, conductivity, turbidity and CO2 for process analytics applications in chemical, pharmaceutical and food & beverage industries.
Industrial Instruments[edit]
The Company manufactures numerous industrial weighing instruments and related terminals and offer software for the pharmaceutical, chemical, food and other industries. In addition, it manufactures metal detection and other end-of-line product inspection systems used in production and packaging. The Company supplies automatic identification and data capture solutions, which integrate in-motion weighing, dimensioning and identification technologies for transport, shipping and logistics customers. The Company also offers heavy industrial scales and related software.
Cargoscan[edit]
Mettler-Toledo Cargoscan Dimensioning solutions are used by international transport companies, small carriers, warehouses and distribution centres around the world. Systems are all approved according to international weights and measures standards, ensuring high instrument performance. It has been shown that laser range finder technology provides high accuracy in the industry making an impact on a production's revenue.[citation needed]
Hi-Speed[edit]
Hi-Speed division joined Mettler-Toledo in 1981 to provide weighing solutions for laboratory, industrial, and food retailing applications. The Product Inspection Team provides the checkweighers, metal detection devices, and other end-of-line inspection systems for local and multinational companies worldwide
Safeline[edit]
Safeline was developed in 1989 at METTLER TOLEDO. The Safeline product was an advanced metal detector the used digital technology for increased sensitivity and accuracy.
To expand the detection solutions, METTLER TOLEDO acquired AVS Raytech and AVS Metrology in 2000. AVS Raytech manufactured x-ray inspection equipment. The x-ray inspection equipment combined with the detection products allowed companies to identify multiple contaminants as well as verifying product integrity and portion control.
CI-VISION[edit]
Mettler-Toledo CI-Vision is a wholly owned subsidiary of Mettler-Toledo Inc. The Mettler-Toledo Product Inspection Group, consisting of CI-Vision, Hi-Speed and Safeline, is a superior supplier of in-line checkweighers, metal detectors, machine vision systems and x-ray inspection systems.

Formation and history[edit]
Toledo Scale Company[edit]




Toledo counter-top fan scale






Toledo dial scale






A Toledo scale used in a hospital cafeteria


Allen DeVilbiss, Jr. (1873-1911) was an inventor who lived in Toledo, Ohio, USA. He became interested in the concept of weighing machines and conceived the idea of an automatic computing pendulum scale. He was able to prove his concept with a local butcher, who realized that customers appreciated the automatic computation which eliminated the risk of overcharging. While his invention gained in popularity, DeVilbiss was not interested in making it a viable business.[2]
In 1900, Henry Theobald (1868-1924) was fired from his job at the National Cash Register Company. He decided to start his own business, and was convinced that selling the automatic computing scales could be a good business. He solicited additional financial investors and purchased the company from DeVilbiss. On July 10, 1901, the Toledo Computing Scale and Cash Register Company was incorporated.[2]
By May 1902, Theobald's company was selling more than 100 cash registers with scales per month. By that time, John H. Patterson, Theobald's boss from NCR, threatened to sue the new company for patent infringements. As an alternative, Patterson offered to purchase all cash register patents and property, along with the stipulation that Theobald would no longer engage in the cash register business. The investors, who worried about the costs of patent infringement litigation, agreed to the sale in June 1902. Since cash registers were no longer part of Theobald's business, he changed the name to Toledo Computing Scale Company. Theobald later coined the phrase "No Springs, Honest Weight" as a slogan for the new company.[2][2]
In the years that followed, Theobald realized that the weighing scale was the most important part of the retail transaction between the merchant and the customer. He felt that many of his competitors who used spring scale technology, especially Dayton Scale Company, were allowing merchants to cheat their customers by incorrectly calculating the total price of a measured good. He campaigned for more government regulation of weights and measures to eliminate dishonest weighing systems. On October 1, 1907, Massachusetts adopted the first weights and measures laws in the United States.[3]
In 1912, the company name changed once again, to Toledo Scale Company.[4] Additionally, a new scale line featuring a double pedulum mechanism and a dial face was introduced and was most suited for industrial applications.[5]
Mettler Instruments AG[edit]
In 1945, Dr. Erhard Mettler, a Swiss engineer, started a precision mechanics company in Küsnacht, Switzerland. He invented the substitution principle with a single-pan balance, capable of being produced in series. Analytical balances with a single weighing pan gradually replaced conventional two-pan balances in the laboratory.
Mettler diversified its product line in 1970 with the introduction of its automated titration systems, and the acquisition of balance manufacturer Microwa AG. Mettler acquired its 500-employee competitor August Sauter KG, of Albstadt-Ebingen, Germany, in 1971, for its specialized industrial and retail scales.[6]
In 1980, Dr. Mettler sold his business to Ciba-Geigy AG. A third pillar - after laboratory and industrial - was created: the retail business. Technological progress had made it possible to advance retail scales to instruments for the management of perishable goods.
Mettler Toledo[edit]
In 1989, Reliance Electric sold the Toledo Scale division to Ciba-Geigy AG. The division was then merged with Mettler Instruments. The merger vastly increased the global scope of the company, which, as a result, operated in 18 countries. Mettler acquired another competitor, Ohaus Corp., in 1990.[6] In 1992, the company was incorporated as Mettler Toledo, Inc.[5]
In 1996/97, Mettler Toledo, Inc. was sold by Ciba-Geigy AG to the New York-based AEA Investors Inc., in preparation for a subsequent initial public offering. The initial public offering was completed and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange, under the ticker symbol NYSE: MTD.
The resultant company is currently headquartered in Greifensee, Switzerland, with offices for its many brands based around the world.
Operational structure[edit]
Mettler-Toledo is a global manufacturer and marketer of precision instruments for use in laboratory, industrial and food retailing applications. They are geographically diversified with sales in 2012 derived 34% from Europe, 34% from the Americas, and 32% from Asia and other countries. The Company has an extensive global sales and service organization with approximately 6,000, or approximately one-half, of the employees providing sales and service in 36 countries. The Company has a manufacturing presence in Europe, the United States and China.[1]
Laboratory Instruments[edit]
1952, the measurement of up to one ten-millionth of a gram became possible with the laboratory balance products. "The Mettler Balance" proved to be a catchphrase in the laboratory.[citation needed] Consequently, with the advancement of microprocessor technology over the years, a wide range of products for the laboratory were invented, like automated titrators and thermal analyzers. Mettler-Toledo laboratory products and technology were able to improve processes in research and development, drug discovery and quality control. Application-specific software for balances provides data analysis opportunities to enhance accuracy, productivity and compliance.
RAININ Instrument[edit]
In 2001, Mettler-Toledo purchased Rainin Instrument, LLC, which is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Mettler-Toledo.[7] Rainin supplies precision instruments and services worldwide. Rainin pipettes provides automated chemistry systems used in drug and chemical compound discovery and development. The company also manufacturers and markets metal detection and other end-of-line inspection systems used in production and packaging.
AutoChem[edit]
The Mettler-Toledo AutoChem Inc. develops process analytical technology (PAT), automated reactors, and in situ sampling for use in the chemical, pharmaceutical, and academia industries. Specifically, in situ spectroscopy and automated sampling provides continuous analysis of chemical reactions; inline particle size analysis enables crystallization, suspension, and emulsion development with real-time particle size and shape measurements; and automated reactors and reaction calorimetry provides process knowledge to eliminate scale-up and safety incidents. As METTLER TOLEDO built the franchise from a startup operation in the early 1990s, several companies were acquired. These acquisitions included ASI Applied System Inc., Lasentec®, and the Virtual Lab software business from Avantium to assemble the technology platforms required to develop and maintain its market leading position.
THORNTON[edit]
Thornton, Inc. Process Analytics Division [8] founded in 1964 develops, manufactures, markets, and supplies instrumentation and sensors used for liquid process measurement and control applications.The instrumentation provides pure water treatment measurement & control for the pharmaceutical industry; and parameters of conductivity/resistivity, TOC, pH, DO, dissolved ozone and flow for the semiconductor and power industries.
INGOLD[edit]
Founded in 1948,[9] INGOLD specializes in solutions for pH, DO, conductivity, turbidity and CO2 for process analytics applications in chemical, pharmaceutical and food & beverage industries.
Industrial Instruments[edit]
The Company manufactures numerous industrial weighing instruments and related terminals and offer software for the pharmaceutical, chemical, food and other industries. In addition, it manufactures metal detection and other end-of-line product inspection systems used in production and packaging. The Company supplies automatic identification and data capture solutions, which integrate in-motion weighing, dimensioning and identification technologies for transport, shipping and logistics customers. The Company also offers heavy industrial scales and related software.
Cargoscan[edit]
Mettler-Toledo Cargoscan Dimensioning solutions are used by international transport companies, small carriers, warehouses and distribution centres around the world. Systems are all approved according to international weights and measures standards, ensuring high instrument performance. It has been shown that laser range finder technology provides high accuracy in the industry making an impact on a production's revenue.[citation needed]
Hi-Speed[edit]
Hi-Speed division joined Mettler-Toledo in 1981 to provide weighing solutions for laboratory, industrial, and food retailing applications. The Product Inspection Team provides the checkweighers, metal detection devices, and other end-of-line inspection systems for local and multinational companies worldwide
Safeline[edit]
Safeline was developed in 1989 at METTLER TOLEDO. The Safeline product was an advanced metal detector the used digital technology for increased sensitivity and accuracy.
To expand the detection solutions, METTLER TOLEDO acquired AVS Raytech and AVS Metrology in 2000. AVS Raytech manufactured x-ray inspection equipment. The x-ray inspection equipment combined with the detection products allowed companies to identify multiple contaminants as well as verifying product integrity and portion control.
CI-VISION[edit]
Mettler-Toledo CI-Vision is a wholly owned subsidiary of Mettler-Toledo Inc. The Mettler-Toledo Product Inspection Group, consisting of CI-Vision, Hi-Speed and Safeline, is a superior supplier of in-line checkweighers, metal detectors, machine vision systems and x-ray inspection systems.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
