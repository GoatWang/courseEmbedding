	Re:


	Transocean Partners LLC Registration Statement on Form S-1




	Ladies and Gentlemen:


	We have acted as U.S. counsel for Transocean Partners LLC (the Company), a Marshall Islands limited liability company, with respect
	to certain legal matters in connection with the offer and sale by Transocean Partners Holdings Limited of common units representing limited liability company interests in the Company. We have also participated in the preparation of a Prospectus (the
	Prospectus) forming part of the Registration Statement on Form S-1, No. 333-196958 (the Registration Statement).


	This opinion is based on various facts and assumptions, and is conditioned upon certain representations made by the Company as to factual
	matters through a certificate of an officer of the Company (the Officers Certificate). In addition, this opinion is based upon the factual representations of the Company concerning its business, properties, and governing documents
	as set forth in the Registration Statement.


	In our capacity as counsel to the Company, we have made such legal and factual examinations
	and inquiries, including an examination of originals or copies certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction of such documents, corporate records, and other instruments, as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for purposes of this
	opinion. In our examination, we have assumed the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals, the genuineness of all signatures thereon, the legal capacity of natural persons executing such documents, and the conformity to authentic
	original documents of all documents submitted to us as copies. For the purpose of our opinion, we have not made an independent investigation or audit of the facts set forth in the above-referenced documents or in the Officers Certificate. In
	addition, in rendering this opinion we have assumed the truth and accuracy of all representations and statements made to us which are qualified as to knowledge or belief, without regard to such qualification.


	We are opining herein as to the effect on the subject transaction only of the federal income tax laws of the United States, and we express no
	opinion with respect to the applicability thereto, or the effect thereon, of other federal laws, foreign laws, the laws of any state or any other jurisdiction or as to any matters of municipal law or the laws of any other local agencies within any
	state. We hereby confirm that all statements of legal conclusions contained in the discussion in the Prospectus under the caption Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations constitute the opinion of Baker Botts L.L.P. with respect
	to the matters set forth therein as of the effective date of the Registration Statement, subject to the assumptions, qualifications, and limitations set forth therein. No opinion is expressed as to any matter not discussed therein.


	This opinion is rendered to you as of the effective date of the Registration Statement, and we undertake no obligation to update this opinion
	subsequent to the date hereof. This opinion is based on various statutory provisions, regulations promulgated thereunder, and interpretations thereof by the Internal Revenue Service and the courts having jurisdiction over such matters, all of which
	are subject to change either prospectively or retroactively. Also, any variation or difference in the facts from those set forth in the representations described above, including in the Registration Statement and the Officers Certificate, may
	affect the conclusions stated herein.

	We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Prospectus and to the use of our name under the captions Material

	treated as an adjustment to the Asset Purchase Price.
