Inside Instagram’s reinvention
How Kevin Systrom got over minimalism and snapped into building mode.

Toward the tail end of 2015, Kevin Systrom, the CEO of Instagram, came to a realization: The photo-sharing app he had founded five years earlier was straying too far from its roots. 
Instagram was growing, yes, and finally generating some serious ad dollars — which Facebook had been waiting for since it bought the company for $1 billion back in 2012. 
But its user base was also growing, and it wasn’t all good growth: Instagram feeds that were once dominated by photos from friends and family members were becoming more impersonal. 
Brands, celebrities and publishers had arrived en masse, and with them the pressure to capture and share that perfect photo — the one that made you and your weekend hiking adventure look as cool as humanly possible — had escalated. User feeds were riddled with what some saw as over-produced or inauthentic depictions of people’s lives. The feed was becoming a digital game of keeping up with the Joneses. 
“It became a place where people kept raising the bar on themselves in terms of the quality of what they had to achieve to post,” explained Kevin Weil, Instagram’s head of product, who has been working to fix this problem since joining Instagram from Twitter in early 2016. “We didn’t want that.”
That pressure on users led to pressure internally at Instagram. Users started sharing less frequently, according to a June 2016 report from The Information. And Snapchat, the hot messaging app from LA that Facebook tried to buy but couldn’t, was offering young people the kind of experience that Instagram was not: A low-pressure way to share photos and videos that don’t stick around online.  
In April of last year, a study from investment bank Piper Jaffray found that Snapchat had surpassed Instagram as the “most important” social network for teenagers, a title Instagram had held the previous two years. Another study by RBC found the same, that teens would choose Snapchat over Instagram as the one social network they’d choose if they were trapped on a desert island. 
Instagram needed to evolve. Systrom did that by looking backward: He refocused the company around priorities he says Instagram held in its early days.
“Your connections with your friends and your family are the thing that make Instagram work,” Systrom, 33, explained from Facebook’s Menlo Park, Calif., headquarters late last month. “All the data supports that if you follow more friends and engage with your friends, your activity goes through the roof. If you just follow more celebrity content or more interest-based content, that doesn’t move the needle at all.”
“Your connections with your friends and your family are the thing that make Instagram work.”
That realization led to a massive product push in 2016 designed to make Instagram more authentic, encouraging users to share with friends in places outside of the traditional feed.
The list of major updates since May include:


Instagram Stories — Montages of photos and short videos that users can share with their followers. Stories expire after 24 hours. 

A feed ranking algorithm — A computer model that surfaces the posts Instagram thinks you’ll like, not just the most recently published content.  

Live video broadcasting — The ability to stream live video directly to your followers, who in turn can send you messages while they watch. The video feeds disappear after they’ve ended. 

Ephemeral messages — A new messaging feature that erases the photos or videos you send friends after they’ve been opened. 

Ask Systrom for the “aha” moment that prompted such a rampant product revival and he won’t be able to name one. He won’t comment on Instagram’s sharing decline (though he doesn’t deny it either), and says Snapchat “motivate[s] us in the sense that I think that they’re really innovative.”
Not exactly a rallying cry.
Instead, Systrom chalks up Instagram’s busy year to a combination of changes, both structural and philosophical.
For starters, Instagram got much bigger.* The company’s engineering team, which had long been run by co-founder Mike Krieger, hired a new leader in fall of 2015: Jim Everingham, a former Yahoo VP who oversaw engineering for Yahoo’s homepage. Then Everingham went on a hiring spree, doubling his team’s size last year to more than 200 people. (Krieger is still at Instagram as CTO, but focused more on big picture issues.)
The product organization grew, too. The key hire was Weil, the former product boss and longtime exec at Twitter who oversaw the company’s ad products through the IPO. Weil was known inside Twitter as a good operator; he left the company in early 2016 after a year and a half as Twitter’s highest-ranking product executive. 
Weil now has the same role at Instagram, where he’s tasked with turning Systrom’s visions into reality. The duo have known each other for a decade — Weil’s wife Elizabeth went to Stanford with Systrom — and Weil says getting the chance to work with Systrom at Instagram was a huge draw. 
“[Systrom is] absolutely one of the best product thinkers I’ve ever met,” Weil said in December from the company’s new office, a three-story complex a short bike ride from Facebook’s main headquarters. “Probably the best I’ve ever worked with.” 
Even with that growth, Instagram is still small compared to its peers. It has just north of 450 employees despite a product with 600 million monthly users and 300 million daily users. Twitter, for comparison, has more than 3,500 employees for 317 million monthly users, and Snapchat has more than 1,500 employees for a daily user base half the size of Instagram’s.
That’s not a completely fair comparison: Instagram has the luxury of tapping into Facebook resources like data centers, content moderation teams and advertising technology — things that its competitors have to build and support on their own.
But Instagram is still taking advantage of its nimble staff.
“You can turn the ship much more quickly with smaller teams,” Weil explained. “When we decide to do something, the time difference between us making the decision and doing it is very small. And that’s different if you have a multi-thousand person organization.”
Weil says that Instagram Stories, the company’s most significant product launch of the year and a direct copy of a Snapchat feature with the same name, was the first big product he worked on after joining Systrom at Instagram. Concept to launch took just four months. (Of course, it’s also faster to launch a product that’s nearly identical to one already on the market.)

Stories lets users share with their friends a montage of photos and videos that expire after 24 hours. The feature has been a hit with Instagram’s users: 150 million people use Stories every day. That’s as many people as Snapchat’s entire user base. 
One reason people likely use Stories is that you can’t really miss them. Instagram added the new feature at the very top of the home screen, so it’s the first thing you see whenever you open the app. (In Snapchat, the app opens directly to the camera, prompting you to share something, but not necessarily something to Stories.)
“There’s no more bold move you could have made,” Weil said about the new product’s location. “And [it happened] without the kind of existential debate, because the founder and the CEO says this is the problem we need to solve.” 
Stories, for example, was never tested outside of Facebook’s walls. In other words, it was a feature Instagram’s top brass wanted, regardless of whether or not its user base was on board. 
Systrom cites Stories, Instagram’s ranked feed and even its decision to abandon square-only photos back in August 2015 as examples of “false constraints” that were holding Instagram back.
“[There was] a change in philosophy internally of not being too precious about what got us here,” Systrom explained. “I learned a lesson from watching other companies who held onto things too long. If you look at the history of companies that have succeeded and the ones that have failed, there’s a pretty clear pattern that the ones that have succeeded typically morph every couple of years into something new. And that change is fairly uncomfortable.”
“[There was] a change in philosophy internally of not being too precious about what got us here.”
Stories, in particular, was a change targeting the pressure around sharing that Instagram executives had noticed in late 2015. Stories disappear after 24 hours, meaning the bar for what qualifies as “post-worthy” is usually much lower on Stories than what you’ll find in your feed. It’s a lot of the same stuff — food shots, sunsets, selfies — just less manicured. 
Instagram doesn’t deny that it borrowed the idea for Stories. Weil says the feature was “built on a format that Snapchat invented. It’s because they were solving the same problem. It’s a format, [and] we believe that format will be universal.” 
Admitting to borrowing an idea is one thing, but neither Weil nor Systrom will admit that Snapchat’s rise in popularity is pushing Instagram to move faster. (Multiple former Facebook employees say that Snapchat is indeed a driving force — and Instagram’s spate of very similar product launches seems to confirm the same.) 
“They motivate us in the sense that I think that they’re really innovative. I think that they execute really well,” Systrom said. “I think we run different companies and I think we have different goals in mind, but we share a lot of the same aspirations.”
Casual sharing is certainly one of those aspirations. Instagram also launched disappearing private messages, another Snapchat innovation. And when you create a live video broadcast on Instagram, the video disappears as soon as the broadcast ends. It doesn’t stick around as part of your profile. 
These kinds of changes seem to be working for Instagram. The company added its last 100 million users in just six months, the fastest growth rate in company history. The sharing problem from 2015 seems to be fixed, too. 
“In the last couple months, with ranked feed and Stories, people are sharing more now than ever on a per-person basis, and more people are sharing [in] total,” Systrom said, without providing actual numbers. “We have more people sharing every single day than ever before.” 

  
That’s good news for Facebook, which seems to be betting on Instagram to not only fend off Snapchat but boost Facebook’s sales.
Instagram’s ad revenue has become more crucial to Facebook, which is starting to run out of places in its News Feed to put advertisements. Instagram, though, is still just ramping up a business that analysts think could be huge. 
Research firm eMarketer estimates that nearly three quarters of U.S. companies over 100 employees will use Instagram for marketing in 2017, more than the number that will do the same on Twitter. Credit Suisse, meanwhile, estimated back in April that Instagram would bring in more than $3 billion in revenue in 2016, though other analyst firms offered more conservative estimates. (Facebook doesn’t yet break out Instagram’s financials.) 
That growth will no doubt be challenged by Snapchat parent company, Snap, which is gearing up for an IPO this year. Snapchat had the original Stories product and has emerged as Instagram’s largest (and really only) major threat.
Instagram just recently started selling the same type of full screen, vertical video ads that Snapchat has popularized, and the two apps will be fighting to win marketer budgets. 
And, of course, fighting for your selfies and messages, too. 
“Our mission is to strengthen relationships through shared experiences,” Systrom said. “And we’re going to be best at that in the world.”

Early life and Education[edit]
Systrom was born in 1983 in Holliston, Massachusetts. He is the son of Diane (Pels), a marketing executive at Zipcar, who also worked at Monster and Swapit during the first dotcom bubble,[4] and Douglas Systrom, Vice President in Human Resources at TJX Companies.[3][5][6] His maternal grandparents were members of The First Congregational Church of Hancock.[7][8]
Systrom attended Middlesex School in Concord, Massachusetts, where he was introduced to computer programming. His interest grew from playing Doom 2 and creating his own levels as a child. He also once created programs that would prank his friends by appearing to hack their AOL Instant Messenger accounts.[9]
He worked at a vinyl-record store in Boston while he was in high school.[10]
Systrom attended Stanford University and graduated in 2006 with a bachelor's degree in management science and engineering.[11][4] At Stanford, he was a member of the Sigma Nu fraternity. He spent the winter term of his third year in Florence, where he studied photography.[12]
He got his first taste of the startup world when he was chosen as one of twelve students to participate in the Mayfield Fellows Program at Stanford University.[13] The fellowship led to his internship at Odeo, the company that eventually gave rise to Twitter.
Career[edit]
Google[edit]
After graduating Stanford, he joined Google as an associate product marketing manager, working on Gmail, Google Calendar, Docs, Spreadsheets and other products.[10] He spent two years at Google; during the first, he worked on Gmail, Google Reader, and other products, and during the second he worked on the Corporate Development team.[10]
Burbn[edit]
After leaving Google to join Nextstop, a location recommendation startup founded by ex-Googlers that was acquired by Facebook in 2010, Systrom thought of combining location check-ins and popular social games.[14] He made the prototype of what later became Burbn and pitched it to Baseline Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz at a party. He came up with the idea while on a vacation in Mexico when his girlfriend was unwilling to post her photos because they did not look good enough when taken by the iPhone 4 camera.[4][15] The solution to the problem was to use filters, effectively hiding the qualitative inferiority of the photographs.[16] Subsequently, Systrom developed the X-Pro II filter that is still in use on Instagram today.[15]
After the first meeting, he decided to quit his job in order to explore whether or not Burbn could become a company. Within 2 weeks of quitting his job, he received $500,000 seed funding round from both Baseline Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz. While in San Francisco, Systrom and Mike Krieger built Burbn, a HTML 5 check-in service, into a product that allowed users to do many things: check into locations, make plans (future check-ins), earn points for hanging out with friends, post pictures, and much more. However, recalling their studies in Mayfield Fellows Program, Krieger and Systrom identified that Burbn contained too many features and the users did not want a complicated product. They decided to focus on one specific feature, photo-sharing. The development of Burbn led to creation of Instagram. A month after launching, Instagram had grown to 1 million users. A year later, Instagram hit more than 10 million users.[17]
Instagram[edit]
In 2010, Systrom co‑founded the photo-sharing and, then later, video-sharing social networking service Instagram with Mike Krieger in San Francisco, California.[18] The name "Instagram" comes from the words "instant" and "telegram".
In April 2012, Instagram was sold to Facebook for $1 billion in cash and stock, along with 13 employees.[19] According to multiple reports, the deal netted Systrom $400 million based on his ownership stake in the business.[20] One of the key contributions to the acquisition is that Mark Zuckerberg stated Facebook is "committed to building and growing Instagram independently," allowing Systrom to continue to lead Instagram.[21] Systrom stated in an interview with Bloomberg that the pros of becoming a part of Facebook were that “we got to pair up with a juggernaut of a company that understands how to grow, understands how to build a business, has one of the best, if not the best, management team in tech and we got to use them as our resource.”[22]
In an interview with Forbes, he stated that "Instagram is a new form of communication that’s an ideal fit with the always-with-you iPhone in today’s social media world. Instagram’s a social network built around photos, where people can quickly comment on or ‘like’ photos and share them on Twitter or Facebook." [23] Systrom identifies Instagram as a media company, which explains the roll-out of video advertisement by big companies such as Disney, Activision, Lancome, Banana Republic and CW in late 2014.[24]
Under Systrom's leadership, Instagram developed key features like the Explore tab, filters, and video. Over time, Instagram has rolled out features allowing users to upload and filter photographs and short videos, follow other users' feeds, geotag images, name location, and comment on other users' photographs and short videos. Instagram allowed the development of web profiles in 2012, connecting accounts to Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, and Flickr in 2013, an Explore tab in mid-2012, and Video in June 2013.[25] Instagram offers 19 photographic filters; Normal, 1977, Amaro, Branna, Earlybird, Hefe, Hudson, Inkwell, Kelvin, Lo-fi, Mayfair, Nashville, Rise, Sierra, Sutro, Toaster, Valencia, Willow, X-Pro II.
Systrom hired former Yahoo Vice-President James Everingham, as well as Kevin Weil, who formerly headed product development at Twitter, as high-ranking executives at Instagram.[26]
As of October 2015, 40 billion pictures had been shared on Instagram.[4]
As of June 2016, Instagram has over 500 million active users.[27]
Also in 2016, CNN quoted a study according to which Snapchat was regarded as the most important social network among teenagers aged 14 to 19, the first time in two years that Instagram did not feature at the top.[28]
Instagram currently employs around 450 people.[26] The app is used by 600 million people per month and 300 million per day.[26] Its competitors Snapchat and Twitter employ more people for a smaller user base, with Twitter having 3,500 employees for 317 million monthly users, and Snapchat employing 1,500 people for half of Instagram’s daily user base.[26]
In the future, Systrom seeks to develop Instagram further to better integrate the use of videos into the app.[29] He also stated that in a few years, the company might be getting involved in Virtual Reality products.[29]
According to Quartz and the New York Times, Systrom and Krieger implemented a system to overcome bottlenecks and slow decision-making in the company by scheduling meetings in which only decisions are taken.[30][31] This approach was informed by Systrom's interest in academic business theories, in particular Clayton M. Christensen's concept of the “The Innovator’s Dilemma”.[31]
Views on copying ideas in the industry[edit]
Instagram has been called out in multiple occasions for copying various new functions from its closest competitor Snapchat.[32] Regarding the issue, Systrom argued that all new services launched by tech companies nowadays are "remixes" of existing products, and that "all of these ideas are original when you remix them and bring your own flavour".[33]
Forbes list[edit]
In 2013, Systrom was listed in the Forbes 30 under 30 list under the Social/Mobile category.[34]
In 2016, the magazine ranked Systrom as a billionaire with an estimated net worth of $1.1 billion.[35] The fortune came about as a result of Facebook stocks rising more than 500%.[35]
Personal life[edit]
According to The Guardian, Systrom enjoys "fine food, golf, skiing and holidays at California’s Lake Tahoe." 
In February 2016, Systrom met with Pope Francis at the Vatican, where they discussed the power of images in uniting people "across borders, cultures and generations."[36]

Early life and Education[edit]
Systrom was born in 1983 in Holliston, Massachusetts. He is the son of Diane (Pels), a marketing executive at Zipcar, who also worked at Monster and Swapit during the first dotcom bubble,[4] and Douglas Systrom, Vice President in Human Resources at TJX Companies.[3][5][6] His maternal grandparents were members of The First Congregational Church of Hancock.[7][8]
Systrom attended Middlesex School in Concord, Massachusetts, where he was introduced to computer programming. His interest grew from playing Doom 2 and creating his own levels as a child. He also once created programs that would prank his friends by appearing to hack their AOL Instant Messenger accounts.[9]
He worked at a vinyl-record store in Boston while he was in high school.[10]
Systrom attended Stanford University and graduated in 2006 with a bachelor's degree in management science and engineering.[11][4] At Stanford, he was a member of the Sigma Nu fraternity. He spent the winter term of his third year in Florence, where he studied photography.[12]
He got his first taste of the startup world when he was chosen as one of twelve students to participate in the Mayfield Fellows Program at Stanford University.[13] The fellowship led to his internship at Odeo, the company that eventually gave rise to Twitter.
Career[edit]
Google[edit]
After graduating Stanford, he joined Google as an associate product marketing manager, working on Gmail, Google Calendar, Docs, Spreadsheets and other products.[10] He spent two years at Google; during the first, he worked on Gmail, Google Reader, and other products, and during the second he worked on the Corporate Development team.[10]
Burbn[edit]
After leaving Google to join Nextstop, a location recommendation startup founded by ex-Googlers that was acquired by Facebook in 2010, Systrom thought of combining location check-ins and popular social games.[14] He made the prototype of what later became Burbn and pitched it to Baseline Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz at a party. He came up with the idea while on a vacation in Mexico when his girlfriend was unwilling to post her photos because they did not look good enough when taken by the iPhone 4 camera.[4][15] The solution to the problem was to use filters, effectively hiding the qualitative inferiority of the photographs.[16] Subsequently, Systrom developed the X-Pro II filter that is still in use on Instagram today.[15]
After the first meeting, he decided to quit his job in order to explore whether or not Burbn could become a company. Within 2 weeks of quitting his job, he received $500,000 seed funding round from both Baseline Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz. While in San Francisco, Systrom and Mike Krieger built Burbn, a HTML 5 check-in service, into a product that allowed users to do many things: check into locations, make plans (future check-ins), earn points for hanging out with friends, post pictures, and much more. However, recalling their studies in Mayfield Fellows Program, Krieger and Systrom identified that Burbn contained too many features and the users did not want a complicated product. They decided to focus on one specific feature, photo-sharing. The development of Burbn led to creation of Instagram. A month after launching, Instagram had grown to 1 million users. A year later, Instagram hit more than 10 million users.[17]
Instagram[edit]
In 2010, Systrom co‑founded the photo-sharing and, then later, video-sharing social networking service Instagram with Mike Krieger in San Francisco, California.[18] The name "Instagram" comes from the words "instant" and "telegram".
In April 2012, Instagram was sold to Facebook for $1 billion in cash and stock, along with 13 employees.[19] According to multiple reports, the deal netted Systrom $400 million based on his ownership stake in the business.[20] One of the key contributions to the acquisition is that Mark Zuckerberg stated Facebook is "committed to building and growing Instagram independently," allowing Systrom to continue to lead Instagram.[21] Systrom stated in an interview with Bloomberg that the pros of becoming a part of Facebook were that “we got to pair up with a juggernaut of a company that understands how to grow, understands how to build a business, has one of the best, if not the best, management team in tech and we got to use them as our resource.”[22]
In an interview with Forbes, he stated that "Instagram is a new form of communication that’s an ideal fit with the always-with-you iPhone in today’s social media world. Instagram’s a social network built around photos, where people can quickly comment on or ‘like’ photos and share them on Twitter or Facebook." [23] Systrom identifies Instagram as a media company, which explains the roll-out of video advertisement by big companies such as Disney, Activision, Lancome, Banana Republic and CW in late 2014.[24]
Under Systrom's leadership, Instagram developed key features like the Explore tab, filters, and video. Over time, Instagram has rolled out features allowing users to upload and filter photographs and short videos, follow other users' feeds, geotag images, name location, and comment on other users' photographs and short videos. Instagram allowed the development of web profiles in 2012, connecting accounts to Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, and Flickr in 2013, an Explore tab in mid-2012, and Video in June 2013.[25] Instagram offers 19 photographic filters; Normal, 1977, Amaro, Branna, Earlybird, Hefe, Hudson, Inkwell, Kelvin, Lo-fi, Mayfair, Nashville, Rise, Sierra, Sutro, Toaster, Valencia, Willow, X-Pro II.
Systrom hired former Yahoo Vice-President James Everingham, as well as Kevin Weil, who formerly headed product development at Twitter, as high-ranking executives at Instagram.[26]
As of October 2015, 40 billion pictures had been shared on Instagram.[4]

Instagram allowed the development of web profiles in 2012, connecting accounts to Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, and Flickr in 2013, an Explore tab in mid-2012, and Video in June 2013.[25] Instagram offers 19 photographic filters; Normal, 1977, Amaro, Branna, Earlybird, Hefe, Hudson, Inkwell, Kelvin, Lo-fi, Mayfair, Nashville, Rise, Sierra, Sutro, Toaster, Valencia, Willow, X-Pro II.
Systrom hired former Yahoo Vice-President James Everingham, as well as Kevin Weil, who formerly headed product development at Twitter, as high-ranking executives at Instagram.[26]
As of October 2015, 40 billion pictures had been shared on Instagram.[4]
As of June 2016, Instagram has over 500 million active users.[27]
Also in 2016, CNN quoted a study according to which Snapchat was regarded as the most important social network among teenagers aged 14 to 19, the first time in two years that Instagram did not feature at the top.[28]
Instagram currently employs around 450 people.[26] The app is used by 600 million people per month and 300 million per day.[26] Its competitors Snapchat and Twitter employ more people for a smaller user base, with Twitter having 3,500 employees for 317 million monthly users, and Snapchat employing 1,500 people for half of Instagram’s daily user base.[26]
In the future, Systrom seeks to develop Instagram further to better integrate the use of videos into the app.[29] He also stated that in a few years, the company might be getting involved in Virtual Reality products.[29]
According to Quartz and the New York Times, Systrom and Krieger implemented a system to overcome bottlenecks and slow decision-making in the company by scheduling meetings in which only decisions are taken.[30][31] This approach was informed by Systrom's interest in academic business theories, in particular Clayton M. Christensen's concept of the “The Innovator’s Dilemma”.[31]
Views on copying ideas in the industry[edit]
Instagram has been called out in multiple occasions for copying various new functions from its closest competitor Snapchat.[32] Regarding the issue, Systrom argued that all new services launched by tech companies nowadays are "remixes" of existing products, and that "all of these ideas are original when you remix them and bring your own flavour".[33]
Forbes list[edit]
In 2013, Systrom was listed in the Forbes 30 under 30 list under the Social/Mobile category.[34]
In 2016, the magazine ranked Systrom as a billionaire with an estimated net worth of $1.1 billion.[35] The fortune came about as a result of Facebook stocks rising more than 500%.[35]
Personal life[edit]
According to The Guardian, Systrom enjoys "fine food, golf, skiing and holidays at California’s Lake Tahoe." 
In February 2016, Systrom met with Pope Francis at the Vatican, where they discussed the power of images in uniting people "across borders, cultures and generations."[36]

Early life and Education[edit]
Systrom was born in 1983 in Holliston, Massachusetts. He is the son of Diane (Pels), a marketing executive at Zipcar, who also worked at Monster and Swapit during the first dotcom bubble,[4] and Douglas Systrom, Vice President in Human Resources at TJX Companies.[3][5][6] His maternal grandparents were members of The First Congregational Church of Hancock.[7][8]
Systrom attended Middlesex School in Concord, Massachusetts, where he was introduced to computer programming. His interest grew from playing Doom 2 and creating his own levels as a child. He also once created programs that would prank his friends by appearing to hack their AOL Instant Messenger accounts.[9]
He worked at a vinyl-record store in Boston while he was in high school.[10]
Systrom attended Stanford University and graduated in 2006 with a bachelor's degree in management science and engineering.[11][4] At Stanford, he was a member of the Sigma Nu fraternity. He spent the winter term of his third year in Florence, where he studied photography.[12]
He got his first taste of the startup world when he was chosen as one of twelve students to participate in the Mayfield Fellows Program at Stanford University.[13] The fellowship led to his internship at Odeo, the company that eventually gave rise to Twitter.
Career[edit]
Google[edit]
After graduating Stanford, he joined Google as an associate product marketing manager, working on Gmail, Google Calendar, Docs, Spreadsheets and other products.[10] He spent two years at Google; during the first, he worked on Gmail, Google Reader, and other products, and during the second he worked on the Corporate Development team.[10]
Burbn[edit]
After leaving Google to join Nextstop, a location recommendation startup founded by ex-Googlers that was acquired by Facebook in 2010, Systrom thought of combining location check-ins and popular social games.[14] He made the prototype of what later became Burbn and pitched it to Baseline Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz at a party. He came up with the idea while on a vacation in Mexico when his girlfriend was unwilling to post her photos because they did not look good enough when taken by the iPhone 4 camera.[4][15] The solution to the problem was to use filters, effectively hiding the qualitative inferiority of the photographs.[16] Subsequently, Systrom developed the X-Pro II filter that is still in use on Instagram today.[15]
After the first meeting, he decided to quit his job in order to explore whether or not Burbn could become a company. Within 2 weeks of quitting his job, he received $500,000 seed funding round from both Baseline Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz. While in San Francisco, Systrom and Mike Krieger built Burbn, a HTML 5 check-in service, into a product that allowed users to do many things: check into locations, make plans (future check-ins), earn points for hanging out with friends, post pictures, and much more. However, recalling their studies in Mayfield Fellows Program, Krieger and Systrom identified that Burbn contained too many features and the users did not want a complicated product. They decided to focus on one specific feature, photo-sharing. The development of Burbn led to creation of Instagram. A month after launching, Instagram had grown to 1 million users. A year later, Instagram hit more than 10 million users.[17]
Instagram[edit]
In 2010, Systrom co‑founded the photo-sharing and, then later, video-sharing social networking service Instagram with Mike Krieger in San Francisco, California.[18] The name "Instagram" comes from the words "instant" and "telegram".
In April 2012, Instagram was sold to Facebook for $1 billion in cash and stock, along with 13 employees.[19] According to multiple reports, the deal netted Systrom $400 million based on his ownership stake in the business.[20] One of the key contributions to the acquisition is that Mark Zuckerberg stated Facebook is "committed to building and growing Instagram independently," allowing Systrom to continue to lead Instagram.[21] Systrom stated in an interview with Bloomberg that the pros of becoming a part of Facebook were that “we got to pair up with a juggernaut of a company that understands how to grow, understands how to build a business, has one of the best, if not the best, management team in tech and we got to use them as our resource.”[22]
In an interview with Forbes, he stated that "Instagram is a new form of communication that’s an ideal fit with the always-with-you iPhone in today’s social media world. Instagram’s a social network built around photos, where people can quickly comment on or ‘like’ photos and share them on Twitter or Facebook." [23] Systrom identifies Instagram as a media company, which explains the roll-out of video advertisement by big companies such as Disney, Activision, Lancome, Banana Republic and CW in late 2014.[24]
Under Systrom's leadership, Instagram developed key features like the Explore tab, filters, and video. Over time, Instagram has rolled out features allowing users to upload and filter photographs and short videos, follow other users' feeds, geotag images, name location, and comment on other users' photographs and short videos. Instagram allowed the development of web profiles in 2012, connecting accounts to Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, and Flickr in 2013, an Explore tab in mid-2012, and Video in June 2013.[25] Instagram offers 19 photographic filters; Normal, 1977, Amaro, Branna, Earlybird, Hefe, Hudson, Inkwell, Kelvin, Lo-fi, Mayfair, Nashville, Rise, Sierra, Sutro, Toaster, Valencia, Willow, X-Pro II.
Systrom hired former Yahoo Vice-President James Everingham, as well as Kevin Weil, who formerly headed product development at Twitter, as high-ranking executives at Instagram.[26]
As of October 2015, 40 billion pictures had been shared on Instagram.[4]

Instagram allowed the development of web profiles in 2012, connecting accounts to Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, and Flickr in 2013, an Explore tab in mid-2012, and Video in June 2013.[25] Instagram offers 19 photographic filters; Normal, 1977, Amaro, Branna, Earlybird, Hefe, Hudson, Inkwell, Kelvin, Lo-fi, Mayfair, Nashville, Rise, Sierra, Sutro, Toaster, Valencia, Willow, X-Pro II.
Systrom hired former Yahoo Vice-President James Everingham, as well as Kevin Weil, who formerly headed product development at Twitter, as high-ranking executives at Instagram.[26]
As of October 2015, 40 billion pictures had been shared on Instagram.[4]
As of June 2016, Instagram has over 500 million active users.[27]
Also in 2016, CNN quoted a study according to which Snapchat was regarded as the most important social network among teenagers aged 14 to 19, the first time in two years that Instagram did not feature at the top.[28]
Instagram currently employs around 450 people.[26] The app is used by 600 million people per month and 300 million per day.[26] Its competitors Snapchat and Twitter employ more people for a smaller user base, with Twitter having 3,500 employees for 317 million monthly users, and Snapchat employing 1,500 people for half of Instagram’s daily user base.[26]
In the future, Systrom seeks to develop Instagram further to better integrate the use of videos into the app.[29] He also stated that in a few years, the company might be getting involved in Virtual Reality products.[29]
According to Quartz and the New York Times, Systrom and Krieger implemented a system to overcome bottlenecks and slow decision-making in the company by scheduling meetings in which only decisions are taken.[30][31] This approach was informed by Systrom's interest in academic business theories, in particular Clayton M. Christensen's concept of the “The Innovator’s Dilemma”.[31]
Views on copying ideas in the industry[edit]
Instagram has been called out in multiple occasions for copying various new functions from its closest competitor Snapchat.[32] Regarding the issue, Systrom argued that all new services launched by tech companies nowadays are "remixes" of existing products, and that "all of these ideas are original when you remix them and bring your own flavour".[33]
Forbes list[edit]
In 2013, Systrom was listed in the Forbes 30 under 30 list under the Social/Mobile category.[34]
In 2016, the magazine ranked Systrom as a billionaire with an estimated net worth of $1.1 billion.[35] The fortune came about as a result of Facebook stocks rising more than 500%.[35]
Personal life[edit]
According to The Guardian, Systrom enjoys "fine food, golf, skiing and holidays at California’s Lake Tahoe." 
In February 2016, Systrom met with Pope Francis at the Vatican, where they discussed the power of images in uniting people "across borders, cultures and generations."[36]

Kevin Systrom is posing for a photograph when we meet at Instagram HQ, arms splayed across the back of a sleek black sofa, with a knowing grin. “More photos!” he sighs, as he is moved to another spot in the room, with all the unconvincing exasperation of someone who quite likes having his picture taken. And so he should, because as the co-founder of Instagram, he gets asked a lot.
Systrom is a rangy 6ft 5in and prides himself on dressing smartly, by Silicon Valley standards; today he wears a light grey jacket over his T-shirt, and dark trousers. He seems older than his 31 years and has a certain swagger, exuding the self-assurance that comes with having built a $35bn technology company and a personal fortune of around $400m.
In a former life, this meeting room was bland and corporate – white plastic table, grey carpet, black mesh chairs – but a visit from Al Gore in May last year changed all that, Systrom says. “This,” he says, channelling the former vice-president’s scorn, “is an Instagram meeting room?” He called a designer friend from San Francisco, who sourced green 1970s chairs and a huge white marble table, customised wallpaper based on staff fingerprints, and prints of favourite pictures taken by the Instagram team.
On the other side of the freeway sits Facebook’s newest, Frank Gehry-designed office, housing 2,800 in one giant room. Given Instagram’s strong sense of aesthetic, you’d think they’d mind not having space inside their mothership, but Systrom insists they operate as a separate company; they are tucked away instead on Facebook’s Menlo Park campus. It’s a sprawling, pristine, plain set of buildings from the outside, the former home of Sun Microsystems, wedged between the freeway and the swampy southern edges of San Francisco Bay. The receptionist is baffled that I have arrived by public transport; Facebook and Instagram staff either drive or are shuttled the 38 miles from San Francisco in luxury coaches with Wi-Fi and air conditioning, presumably so they can keep working until the last possible moment. Inside, the floor is stripped back to the concrete and the walls are decorated with motivational posters: “Kick the shit out of Plan B”; “Leadership is best measured by what people do when you’re not around”; “Looking for love in the great forest of like.” Inside a central courtyard there is an ice-cream parlour, brightly coloured food stalls, wooden benches and energetic young people looking as if they are busy changing the world.

Founded five years ago, Instagram was born during a summer holiday in Mexico’s boho beach town of Todos Santos. Then 26, Systrom was sketching out new app ideas for the aspiring location service Burbn he was building (users could check in at various locations, and report back on their meet-ups), having already secured a $250,000 investment. Talking through an idea to introduce photographs to Burbn, Systrom’s girlfriend, Nicole Schuetz, said she wouldn’t want to post hers, because they wouldn’t look good enough; her iPhone 4 didn’t have a great camera. The answer, they concluded, was to add filters. By the end of the day, Systrom had created the X-Pro II filter and posted an image of a dog and Schuetz’s foot on an early version of Instagram (codenamed Codename).
“That first picture became everything and more than we wanted it to be,” he says, pointing out that the office coffee table is built around a giant print of that first photograph. “Back then, there was no way of showing what was going on in your life, as it happened. Facebook was still primarily desktop, Flickr was about uploading from your SLR camera, and Twitter barely had any photo support. That left this opportunity wide open to share what was happening in your life visually.” Instagram was born just a few months after the iPhone 4, a way of disguising its low-quality pictures. Since then, Systrom explains, filter usage has declined as mobile picture quality has improved. Instagram itself, however, has done anything but decline, with an unfathomable 40bn photos shared to date.

Did he foresee the size to which the site would grow? “Obviously, we couldn’t have predicted the scale, but it makes sense. Our brains are primarily visual. Letterform was just a hack, until people worked out how to communicate more perceptually.” Comparisons with Guttenberg’s 15th-century printing press and its revolutionary effect are popular with heads of technology firms who clearly hope to have as big an impact. And it is possible that some of today’s biggest tech firms may initiate a new age of enlightenment; it is equally likely they will implode after a few years and be replaced by the next cool thing. This is Systrom’s challenge, to stay on the right side of that equation.
***
The rapid growth of Instagram and its popularity with everyone from designers to photojournalists and politicians is one of Silicon Valley’s favourite fables. Its followers include President Obama (advocating Obamacare), David Beckham (berating the Daily Mail for criticising his parenting skills) and Kim Kardashian (trying to break the internet). It makes room for the mundane: plumbers sharing their latest jobs, teachers sharing the delight and horror of the classroom. It features bad taxidermy and horrific autopsy shots. It hosts millions of us, snapping our holidays, our children, our shopping and a disproportionate number of sunsets.
Only 18 months after founding the company, with just 13 employees serving 30 million users, Systrom and co-founder Mike Krieger found themselves caught in a bidding war between Twitter and Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg’s persistence and deep pockets won out, with a deal eventually worth (after a dip in Facebook’s share price) $736.5m.




 

It’s very hard to succeed without giving your entire life to this thing




 

“It was a lot of luck, a lot of opportunity and a lot of hard work,” Systrom says now of the deal and the months that led up to it. “Weekends didn’t exist. Mike and I set up an alarm on our phones if the servers were overloaded and went down, and that went off every four or five hours. Then as we grew, it went off every hour, or every 15 minutes. To this day, I have a Pavlovian response to that alarm: simultaneous nausea and anxiety. But it was also a sign of growth, which is a great problem to have. Now it’s different problems: what do we work on, what’s our strategy, how do we fend off competitors?”
Why does he think this punishing work culture appeals to so many? “When you’re small, it’s very hard to succeed without giving your entire life to this thing. The technology moves so fast and the context – your competition – changes so quickly that the one advantage you have as a small company is speed. You can pack three to four working days into one day and gain an advantage.”
Silicon Valley is known for being pressurised, highly competitive and stuffed with ambitious people who push themselves – and sometimes fail to admit they are struggling to cope. Research published in April, by Dr Michael Freeman at the University of California in San Francisco, found 49% of the entrepreneurs he surveyed reported a mental health condition; 30% felt depressed (the US average is 8%) and 27% had anxiety concerns. Suicides of company founders have cast a shadow over the industry, including 22-year-old Ilya Zhitomirskiy of Diaspora, 47-year-old Ecomom co-founder Jody Sherman and, in May this year, 31-year-old Austen Heinz of Cambrian Genomics.

But overwork seems a world away from Instagram, whose staff seem content in their secure and rapidly growing company. I am taken on a tour by the publicist, admittedly, but their delight appears genuine (“It’s my dream job!”). Does Systrom feel a duty of care towards his (often very young) team? “People don’t work in a dotcom because they have to,” he says. “There are many professions that don’t require that sort of time. But people sign up because they want to make world-changing differences, to build something that affects millions of people. These are the companies that in just a couple of years can change entire industries.” Systrom says Instagram conducts anonymous surveys to check the health of its staff, and is respectful of weekends and families. “You don’t win a marathon by sprinting all day,” he says, not sounding as heartfelt as when talking about his ambition to change the world.

Later, I talk to Ashley Yuki, a product manager who oversaw the recent introduction of portrait and landscape formats to the service. (Instagram’s square format photos are a legacy of Systrom using a Holga camera while studying photography in Florence, Italy, for one term of his Stanford degree; the switch was big news in Instagram world.) Yuki coordinates designers, engineers, marketing and every other team to get new features out on time. Does she feel Silicon Valley has a long-hours problem? “We are measured on the impact of our work – the number of people who use it, the feedback from users, the results of what we did – not how many hours we’ve worked. That lends itself to a more meritocratic culture. My schedule is flexible and I have lots of control. We work hard and I like that, so it’s a burden and a joy to be the person who can fit all those pieces together.”

Kevin Systrom was born in the wealthy Massachusetts suburb of Holliston, to a human resources executive father and a marketing executive mother, who worked at Monster and Swapit during the first dotcom boom. At Middlesex boarding school in Concord, he started to learn programming. Later, at Stanford, studying management science and engineering, he interned at Odeo, the company that went on to found Twitter. Systrom sat next to Jack Dorsey, but that didn’t help Dorsey during negotiations to buy Instagram, which Systrom and Krieger sold to Facebook for nearly twice Twitter’s offer. Dorsey hasn’t posted to Instagram since.
Systrom’s life outside work is as carefully curated as his Instagram feed: he’s into fine food, golf, skiing and holidays at California’s Lake Tahoe. His favourite Instagrammers are @symmetrybreakfast (exactly that), @everydayafrica, a group of photographers publishing shots from across the continent, and @petesouza, the White House’s official photographer. (He insists he’s been to few fashion shows, despite being photographed on the front row with Alexa Chung, and at awards ceremonies with Diane von Furstenberg and Kim Kardashian.) He is adept at redirecting unwelcome questions: when I ask if he has any political allegiances, and joke that he might have an opinion on Donald Trump, a strategic user of Instagram, he simply says he’s not political. No, he hasn’t met Trump; the other presidential candidates campaign just as effectively through his service, too.

Instagram’s new “search and explore” feature, rolled out in June for American users only, now highlights collections of Instagram accounts – extreme sports, for example, travel or fashion. It is designed to surface more diverse content, and show what’s trending now. Is this editorialising? Systrom resists the word, while claiming Instagram has rivalled his experience of television news, most powerfully when users posted hundreds of pictures of the devastation wrought by Hurricane Sandy, in near real time, in October 2012.
Instagram began with 25,000 users, on its first day; now, thanks in part to the Facebook deal, it has 400 million people using the site every month, with 80 million photos shared every day. Systrom says this growth is largely down to Facebook’s considerable resources when it comes to sales advertising, their targeting and relevance algorithms, which he claims are helping Instagram mature more quickly than its rivals. (Research company eMarketer suggests Instagram will reach $600m in ad revenue this year, but that this will grow to $2.81bn in 2017; remarkably, Instagram is also predicted to have bigger net mobile display ad revenues than Twitter and Google by then, having introduced more innovative formats.)
While it’s hard to see how Systrom could have turned down Facebook – an offer so big, it astonished many in the tech industry at the time – what would have become of Instagram if it hadn’t signed up? “A lot of great things have happened,” Systrom says. “There are fun parts of running a startup and not-so-fun parts, and Facebook handles the not-so-fun parts, like infrastructure, spam, sales. The real questions are, how big can Instagram get? Is it 400 million, or bigger? Can it be a viable business if it is that big? These are at the top of the list for everyone in Silicon Valley.”




 

How big can Instagram get? Is it 400 million, or bigger?




 

These are no doubt the kind of questions he puts to Zuckerberg when they meet on campus. The Facebook founder pursued him aggressively in 2012, then, after making the offer, retired to watch Game Of Thrones while Systrom made frantic calls to lawyers and investors. The pair meet weekly, inside and outside of work, and by all accounts have much in common, with Zuckerberg savvy enough to give Systrom the space he needs.
Being under the care of Facebook is a constant reminder of how much bigger Instagram could be. “At Facebook [which has 1.5 billion users every month], we’re the little kid on the block. If you ask someone on the street in India if they use Instagram, they will say no – so that’s an opportunity for us.” This is what Silicon Valley’s investors love to hear: unapologetic ambitions for global growth, no holds barred.
It’s not just Systrom who is making money from the site. Many Instagrammers claim to be earning a significant income, including Sharmadean Reid of @wahnails, Dutch fishmonger Bart van Olphen, who has used its 15-second videos to build his cookery brand, and New Yorker Liz Eswein, @NewYorkCity, who has 1.2 million followers and claims to charge advertisers $1 for every “like” on a sponsored photo. The money starts coming in when you have more than 100,000 followers, which can be worth upwards of £3,000 a month, according to professional Instagrammer Brian DiFeo, who founded an agency advising others on how to exploit the service.
Seventy-five per cent of users are outside the US, 14 million of them in the UK. I suggest to Systrom that this is photo sharing on a massive scale; he disagrees. “Calling Instagram a photo-sharing app is like calling a newspaper a letter-sharing book, or a Mozart grand era symphony a series of notes. Instagram is less about the medium and more about the network. If you’re a business, we have a product so you can buy ads. If you’re a consumer and want to entertain, you can record a 15-second looping video. If you’re an artist and want to do a piece of conceptual art, there’s a place for you, too. ‘Photo sharing’ misses the nuance.”
***
What makes one picture better than the other? An understanding of light is what separates a great photographer from a mediocre one, says Richard Koci Hernandez, assistant professor of new media at UC Berkeley’s journalism school in San Francisco. “Humans are conditioned to see strong shapes and patterns, and it’s light, combined with capturing that human moment, that can stop people in their tracks .” Hernandez was one of the first news photographers to document Silicon Valley’s smartphone era and has been using Instagram since it launched. Yet late last year he deleted more than 1,100 photos from his Instagram account because they were making him feel trapped, he says. A year on, he wants to do the same thing again with the 70 images he has published since – monochrome lone figures, an atmospheric city, snatched moments of real life.

“My images are a reflection of me as a photographer, so is that me? We are all influenced by likes and comments in a social space, and I have thousands of images and tons of followers.” And he does: 235,000 of them. “That was influencing who I was, and I was thinking too much about what I was posting. We are all trying to find our voice and find what is authentic, but the comments push you in a certain direction that is less objective.” Hernandez says he would like his images to live momentarily, which is exactly the appeal of Instagram’s biggest rival, Snapchat, estimated to have 200 million users, many of them younger than Instagram’s. “That backlog starts to define you,” Hernandez says, “but I think we’re always different and evolving. I’d like my images to live a couple of days and then die, so I don’t have to remember or be tied.”
Hernandez is sanguine about the popularity of selfies and pictures of latte foam; he sees Instagram as a collective experiment in visual communication. “That’s what humanity does when we get together – we want everyone to look at us. It’s the game we’re all playing. Expecting anything more from a medium in its infancy is too much to ask. I believe in the power of latte foam. Communication has to be homogenous at the start; after that, the creativity and nuance creeps in, and artists move the medium to the edges.” Maybe so, but even Ai Weiwei uses Instagram for selfies.
Systrom gives short shrift to the suggestion that his service has been overrun by hipsters and narcissists uploading pictures of their coffee. “With so many people, it’s hard to have uniformity or predictability. There are performance artists, sports stars, celebrities, people singing and doing Dubsmashes and, yes, hipsters use Instagram. But last year we had activist Katie Meyler documenting ebola on the ground, raising awareness of the epidemic in a way no one else could. We had stunning photos of the Baltimore riots, the winter storm Juno, that made the cover of the New York Times. These are not hipster shots of lattes.”
Why did Instagram succeed where other, similar services failed? There was a swath of photo-filter apps available in 2010 and most fell by the wayside. Systrom puts a large part of his success down to luck; I’d also put it down to a combination of simple design, improved smartphone cameras and an appetite for a broader network based on visual images. The service has grown thoughtfully, even cautiously, so that it remains accessible. But it will need to work hard to compete against the excitement and spontaneity of Snapchat, the speed and simplicity of text messaging, and photography fatigue (the more pictures we take, the less we seem to value them). Other challenges lie beyond the horizon, where the biggest threat might now be no more than a sketch in someone’s notebook.
So where does Instagram go from here? I ask Systrom to imagine the most fantastical feature he could add. “Imagine a world where virtual reality exists and is ubiquitous, and we have whatever device we need to experience it. How cool would it be if you were at a concert in the countryside and I could be there with you – hearing, smelling, seeing it, too? Or the presidential inauguration – that would be amazing. That’s what Instagram is now, in a very low-fidelity way. I like to say we’re working on time travel, but the difference is we’re not sending you there – it’s coming to you.”

Top of Systrom’s priorities right now is his wedding to college sweetheart Schuetz next summer. It will be a local affair, and combine good food and wine. He has read somewhere that English weddings are traditionally in the morning so he wants to do that (in California, this counts as eccentric). I tell him it means everyone just gets more drunk in the afternoon, because there’s nothing else to do before the party, and an eyebrow crumples; he is trying to work out if this is good or bad. More importantly, will the wedding be on Instagram? “I don’t think we could get away with not putting it on Instagram,” he concedes. “But I don’t think it will trend.”
Whatever comes next, Systrom is made for life. He is a model of what success currently looks like in Silicon Valley – young, white and male, with all the confidence, opportunity and connections that an expensive education can provide. Five years in and Instagram has joined the elite group of technology firms now shaping our world, albeit from a very particular perspective. I’m struck by the disparity between Instagram, the cool, sleek world it inhabits on and offline, and the real world outside. We see, we share, but what then?
It is hometime at Facebook as I leave the building and a fleet of pristine luxury buses arrives to ferry everyone back to San Francisco. I cross the nine lanes of freeway again and pay my $2.10 to catch the bus back over the Bay. It is a beautiful, hazy evening and for a second I think I might Instagram it. But I put my phone back in my bag, rest my head on the window and my eyes catch sight of a seal bobbing up from the water instead.

Meet the man who helped Facebook bring Snapchat to its knees


 Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom needed someone to implement his plan to overhaul the service. At a dinner, he asked Kevin Weil, who had gone to Harvard with Mark Zuckerberg and worked at Twitter as a top exec, to take the job. Soon after Weil joined, Instagram user and advertiser growth took off.

Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom had a key role to fill in early 2016. He was seeking to revamp the photo-sharing service he'd co-founded with Mike Krieger six years earlier, and which Facebook had bought in 2012.
After keeping Instagram's executive ranks intentionally small, Systrom was putting together a team to help him overhaul the site.
The objective was to get users—especially younger ones—to post more content on Instagram.

At the time, Snapchat was growing fast among youthful social media users, thanks to fun features like funny photo filters and disappearing videos.
Systrom had already poached some big names from Silicon Valley rivals, getting Ian Spalter from YouTube as head of design in early 2015 and hiring Yahoo's James Everingham as head of engineering six months later.
Now he needed someone to get the features and tools being designed and built onto the site and into the hands of Instagram users.
As he searched for someone to help him implement his product roadmap, Systrom asked a friend, venture capitalist Elizabeth Weil, to arrange a dinner.
Weil, who'd spent four years as a partner at the marquee investment firm Andreessen Horowitz before becoming managing partner of a new firm, 137 Ventures, is married to Kevin Weil, whom she'd met when they were both students at Stanford University.
Kevin Weil had quit the university's Ph.D. program in theoretical physics to start working at Twitter in 2009, when the social media service had just 40 employees.
After seven years at Twitter, he had worked his way up to executive vice president overseeing all of the company's products, including its consumer-facing site, advertising products and the Vine and Periscope video tools.
Elizabeth Weil arranged the dinner.
During it, Systrom offered Kevin Weil a job running product for Instagram, according to an on-stage interview Weil gave in May to Stanford professor Tina Seelig, as part of the university's discussion program for prospective entrepreneurs.
Weil says he turned Systrom down. He'd already resigned from Twitter, where user growth had begun to wane, and planned to take six months off to train for a 50-mile foot race that traveled the course of the American River in California's Central Valley. What's more, he and his wife had started a family.
Weil, who is 34, was enjoying time off and had just attended the Super Bowl, which was held that year in Santa Clara, California, according to his Twitter feed.



'I like running long races'

But then he reconsidered.
"I said 'no,' then said to myself: Why should I turn this down?" Weil said in the video.
Weil, a whiz at math and later at physics, grew up in Redmond, Washington, home of Microsoft, where his dad had worked for two decades. After his own long stint with one company, Weil told Seelig, "I wanted to see how other companies did things."
Weil took the job in March 2016—and then finished the American River 50 in April, where he placed fifth.
"I like running long races," Weil stated, a comment that should put fear into the hearts of Snap investors. "There's not a lot of tricks to running a 50-mile race, you just start running and keep going. People underestimate the value of fighting through it," he said.
Equally as impressive is what Weil, and the rest of the team Systrom put together, have managed to pull off in the last year and a half.
"He was a great hire...a key player," said Krishna Subramanian, CEO of Captiv8, a startup that provides analytics to social media sites and their users who create popular content.
"He's been a critical part of their success," said Subramanian, who's sold several companies he's co-founded previously, including Mobclix and BlueLithium.
Within months of Weil's arrival, the site began to roll out a raft of new tools and features to match what Snapchat was doing. The key was Instagram Stories, a feature that let users share photos and videos for up to 24 hours before they disappeared, mimicking the similar Snapchat Stories feature. 
In November, it began letting users post images and videos that disappeared right away—the feature that originally made Snapchat famous—and in May 2017 it added face filters, one of Snapchat's most popular features.

Soon Instagram's growth in both users and ads began to surge.
It was aided not only by the tools Weil and others helped get out the door but also by a savvy digital marketing plan: Facebook sent repeated notifications to its own users telling them which of their online friends were already on Instagram.
The plan worked.
In June 2016, Instagram had 500 million monthly users. By April 2017, it had grown 40 percent to 700 million.
More users brought more online marketers. In late March, Instagram hit 1 million advertisers, double the 500,000 it had last September.
As its growth accelerated, Snapchat's began to flatten out.
In the first quarter, Snapchats number of daily users grew only 36 percent from the previous year, to 166 million. Instagram Stories, meanwhile, has grown to 250 million daily users in less than a year on the market.
"It's the fastest-growing product I've ever seen," Weil stated in the video.
Instagram, which Zuckerberg bought for $1 billion five years ago, is expected to post sales of $3.6 billion in 2017, according to the market research firm eMarketer.



How Instagram did it

When Weil joined in spring 2016, he said in the  the Instagram brass had come to a conclusion.
"A year ago, Instagram was a product for your highlights," rather than a place where users posted content about more routine events in their lives, Weil said in the video.
In other words, it had not changed much since Systrom had started it as a sort of daily photo diary back in 2010.




"If you start simple, systems will get more complex (eventually)...If you start complex, you're in trouble."
-Kevin Weil, Head of Product, Instagram


"If people are going to post multiple times throughout the day, the product needs to be more 'person-oriented' than 'feed-oriented," Weil explained.
That meant allowing users to post not only square photos but videos of varying shapes, sizes and lengths.
Instagram also has a culture designed for doing "the simple things first."
In the video, he says, "If you start simple, systems will get more complex (eventually)...If you start complex, you're in trouble."
Also, while big product launches are important, "what people miss are the little changes...Facebook and Instagram are better at that than anyone," he says.
Weil, whose 30-person team (as of May) work "all in the same room," also credits Systrom and Zuckerberg for maintaining Instagram's independence.
"I give a lot of credit to the two founders..We're a tiny company that gets to be a superpower because we're part of Facebook," according to Weil.
As for Snapchat, Weil gives it its due— up to a point.
"Snapchat was the first to create the format...more power to them, they did a fantastic job," he said. 



An 'insane' personal life

In the 15 months since Weil joined Instagram, something else has grown:
His wife had twins and now the couple have three very young children, according to his Twitter feed and the video. 
When Seelig asked whether his life has "balance," Weil chuckled and described his home life as "insanity...life is insane between six and nine (p.m.)"
Asked whether he sleeps, Weil answered "not much, that's mostly what we sacrifice."
In spite of all that, this past spring he ran the American River 50 again and did slightly better, finishing fourth.
In a fitting bit of irony, Weil also attended Harvard at the same time as Mark Zuckerberg, who never finished his Harvard degree. (Zuckerberg received an honorary degree last month, when he delivered the university's commencement speech.)
After Zuckerberg left for California and never came back, Weil, who as a junior was one year ahead of Zuckerberg, described his reaction.
"I'm sitting there going, 'He's giving up a Harvard degree to go work on some company? What an idiot!'...Now 12 years later I'm working for him."

Early life and Education[edit]
Systrom was born in 1983 in Holliston, Massachusetts. He is the son of Diane (Pels), a marketing executive at Zipcar, who also worked at Monster and Swapit during the first dotcom bubble,[4] and Douglas Systrom, Vice President in Human Resources at TJX Companies.[3][5][6] His maternal grandparents were members of The First Congregational Church of Hancock.[7][8]
Systrom attended Middlesex School in Concord, Massachusetts, where he was introduced to computer programming. His interest grew from playing Doom 2 and creating his own levels as a child. He also once created programs that would prank his friends by appearing to hack their AOL Instant Messenger accounts.[9]
He worked at a vinyl-record store in Boston while he was in high school.[10]
Systrom attended Stanford University and graduated in 2006 with a bachelor's degree in management science and engineering.[11][4] At Stanford, he was a member of the Sigma Nu fraternity. He spent the winter term of his third year in Florence, where he studied photography.[12]
He got his first taste of the startup world when he was chosen as one of twelve students to participate in the Mayfield Fellows Program at Stanford University.[13] The fellowship led to his internship at Odeo, the company that eventually gave rise to Twitter.
Career[edit]
Google[edit]
After graduating Stanford, he joined Google as an associate product marketing manager, working on Gmail, Google Calendar, Docs, Spreadsheets and other products.[10] He spent two years at Google; during the first, he worked on Gmail, Google Reader, and other products, and during the second he worked on the Corporate Development team.[10]
Burbn[edit]
After leaving Google to join Nextstop, a location recommendation startup founded by ex-Googlers that was acquired by Facebook in 2010, Systrom thought of combining location check-ins and popular social games.[14] He made the prototype of what later became Burbn and pitched it to Baseline Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz at a party. He came up with the idea while on a vacation in Mexico when his girlfriend was unwilling to post her photos because they did not look good enough when taken by the iPhone 4 camera.[4][15] The solution to the problem was to use filters, effectively hiding the qualitative inferiority of the photographs.[16] Subsequently, Systrom developed the X-Pro II filter that is still in use on Instagram today.[15]
After the first meeting, he decided to quit his job in order to explore whether or not Burbn could become a company. Within 2 weeks of quitting his job, he received $500,000 seed funding round from both Baseline Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz. While in San Francisco, Systrom and Mike Krieger built Burbn, a HTML 5 check-in service, into a product that allowed users to do many things: check into locations, make plans (future check-ins), earn points for hanging out with friends, post pictures, and much more. However, recalling their studies in Mayfield Fellows Program, Krieger and Systrom identified that Burbn contained too many features and the users did not want a complicated product. They decided to focus on one specific feature, photo-sharing. The development of Burbn led to creation of Instagram. A month after launching, Instagram had grown to 1 million users. A year later, Instagram hit more than 10 million users.[17]
Instagram[edit]
In 2010, Systrom co‑founded the photo-sharing and, then later, video-sharing social networking service Instagram with Mike Krieger in San Francisco, California.[18] The name "Instagram" comes from the words "instant" and "telegram".
In April 2012, Instagram was sold to Facebook for $1 billion in cash and stock, along with 13 employees.[19] According to multiple reports, the deal netted Systrom $400 million based on his ownership stake in the business.[20] One of the key contributions to the acquisition is that Mark Zuckerberg stated Facebook is "committed to building and growing Instagram independently," allowing Systrom to continue to lead Instagram.[21] Systrom stated in an interview with Bloomberg that the pros of becoming a part of Facebook were that “we got to pair up with a juggernaut of a company that understands how to grow, understands how to build a business, has one of the best, if not the best, management team in tech and we got to use them as our resource.”[22]
In an interview with Forbes, he stated that "Instagram is a new form of communication that’s an ideal fit with the always-with-you iPhone in today’s social media world. Instagram’s a social network built around photos, where people can quickly comment on or ‘like’ photos and share them on Twitter or Facebook." [23] Systrom identifies Instagram as a media company, which explains the roll-out of video advertisement by big companies such as Disney, Activision, Lancome, Banana Republic and CW in late 2014.[24]
Under Systrom's leadership, Instagram developed key features like the Explore tab, filters, and video. Over time, Instagram has rolled out features allowing users to upload and filter photographs and short videos, follow other users' feeds, geotag images, name location, and comment on other users' photographs and short videos. Instagram allowed the development of web profiles in 2012, connecting accounts to Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, and Flickr in 2013, an Explore tab in mid-2012, and Video in June 2013.[25] Instagram offers 19 photographic filters; Normal, 1977, Amaro, Branna, Earlybird, Hefe, Hudson, Inkwell, Kelvin, Lo-fi, Mayfair, Nashville, Rise, Sierra, Sutro, Toaster, Valencia, Willow, X-Pro II.
Systrom hired former Yahoo Vice-President James Everingham, as well as Kevin Weil, who formerly headed product development at Twitter, as high-ranking executives at Instagram.[26]
As of October 2015, 40 billion pictures had been shared on Instagram.[4]
As of June 2016, Instagram has over 500 million active users.[27]
Also in 2016, CNN quoted a study according to which Snapchat was regarded as the most important social network among teenagers aged 14 to 19, the first time in two years that Instagram did not feature at the top.[28]
Instagram currently employs around 450 people.[26] The app is used by 600 million people per month and 300 million per day.[26] Its competitors Snapchat and Twitter employ more people for a smaller user base, with Twitter having 3,500 employees for 317 million monthly users, and Snapchat employing 1,500 people for half of Instagram’s daily user base.[26]
In the future, Systrom seeks to develop Instagram further to better integrate the use of videos into the app.[29] He also stated that in a few years, the company might be getting involved in Virtual Reality products.[29]
According to Quartz and the New York Times, Systrom and Krieger implemented a system to overcome bottlenecks and slow decision-making in the company by scheduling meetings in which only decisions are taken.[30][31] This approach was informed by Systrom's interest in academic business theories, in particular Clayton M. Christensen's concept of the “The Innovator’s Dilemma”.[31]
Views on copying ideas in the industry[edit]
Instagram has been called out in multiple occasions for copying various new functions from its closest competitor Snapchat.[32] Regarding the issue, Systrom argued that all new services launched by tech companies nowadays are "remixes" of existing products, and that "all of these ideas are original when you remix them and bring your own flavour".[33]
Forbes list[edit]
In 2013, Systrom was listed in the Forbes 30 under 30 list under the Social/Mobile category.[34]
In 2016, the magazine ranked Systrom as a billionaire with an estimated net worth of $1.1 billion.[35] The fortune came about as a result of Facebook stocks rising more than 500%.[35]
Personal life[edit]
According to The Guardian, Systrom enjoys "fine food, golf, skiing and holidays at California’s Lake Tahoe." 
In February 2016, Systrom met with Pope Francis at the Vatican, where they discussed the power of images in uniting people "across borders, cultures and generations."[36]

Early life and Education[edit]
Systrom was born in 1983 in Holliston, Massachusetts. He is the son of Diane (Pels), a marketing executive at Zipcar, who also worked at Monster and Swapit during the first dotcom bubble,[4] and Douglas Systrom, Vice President in Human Resources at TJX Companies.[3][5][6] His maternal grandparents were members of The First Congregational Church of Hancock.[7][8]
Systrom attended Middlesex School in Concord, Massachusetts, where he was introduced to computer programming. His interest grew from playing Doom 2 and creating his own levels as a child. He also once created programs that would prank his friends by appearing to hack their AOL Instant Messenger accounts.[9]
He worked at a vinyl-record store in Boston while he was in high school.[10]
Systrom attended Stanford University and graduated in 2006 with a bachelor's degree in management science and engineering.[11][4] At Stanford, he was a member of the Sigma Nu fraternity. He spent the winter term of his third year in Florence, where he studied photography.[12]
He got his first taste of the startup world when he was chosen as one of twelve students to participate in the Mayfield Fellows Program at Stanford University.[13] The fellowship led to his internship at Odeo, the company that eventually gave rise to Twitter.
Career[edit]
Google[edit]
After graduating Stanford, he joined Google as an associate product marketing manager, working on Gmail, Google Calendar, Docs, Spreadsheets and other products.[10] He spent two years at Google; during the first, he worked on Gmail, Google Reader, and other products, and during the second he worked on the Corporate Development team.[10]
Burbn[edit]
After leaving Google to join Nextstop, a location recommendation startup founded by ex-Googlers that was acquired by Facebook in 2010, Systrom thought of combining location check-ins and popular social games.[14] He made the prototype of what later became Burbn and pitched it to Baseline Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz at a party. He came up with the idea while on a vacation in Mexico when his girlfriend was unwilling to post her photos because they did not look good enough when taken by the iPhone 4 camera.[4][15] The solution to the problem was to use filters, effectively hiding the qualitative inferiority of the photographs.[16] Subsequently, Systrom developed the X-Pro II filter that is still in use on Instagram today.[15]
After the first meeting, he decided to quit his job in order to explore whether or not Burbn could become a company. Within 2 weeks of quitting his job, he received $500,000 seed funding round from both Baseline Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz. While in San Francisco, Systrom and Mike Krieger built Burbn, a HTML 5 check-in service, into a product that allowed users to do many things: check into locations, make plans (future check-ins), earn points for hanging out with friends, post pictures, and much more. However, recalling their studies in Mayfield Fellows Program, Krieger and Systrom identified that Burbn contained too many features and the users did not want a complicated product. They decided to focus on one specific feature, photo-sharing. The development of Burbn led to creation of Instagram. A month after launching, Instagram had grown to 1 million users. A year later, Instagram hit more than 10 million users.[17]
Instagram[edit]
In 2010, Systrom co‑founded the photo-sharing and, then later, video-sharing social networking service Instagram with Mike Krieger in San Francisco, California.[18] The name "Instagram" comes from the words "instant" and "telegram".
In April 2012, Instagram was sold to Facebook for $1 billion in cash and stock, along with 13 employees.[19] According to multiple reports, the deal netted Systrom $400 million based on his ownership stake in the business.[20] One of the key contributions to the acquisition is that Mark Zuckerberg stated Facebook is "committed to building and growing Instagram independently," allowing Systrom to continue to lead Instagram.[21] Systrom stated in an interview with Bloomberg that the pros of becoming a part of Facebook were that “we got to pair up with a juggernaut of a company that understands how to grow, understands how to build a business, has one of the best, if not the best, management team in tech and we got to use them as our resource.”[22]
In an interview with Forbes, he stated that "Instagram is a new form of communication that’s an ideal fit with the always-with-you iPhone in today’s social media world. Instagram’s a social network built around photos, where people can quickly comment on or ‘like’ photos and share them on Twitter or Facebook." [23] Systrom identifies Instagram as a media company, which explains the roll-out of video advertisement by big companies such as Disney, Activision, Lancome, Banana Republic and CW in late 2014.[24]
Under Systrom's leadership, Instagram developed key features like the Explore tab, filters, and video. Over time, Instagram has rolled out features allowing users to upload and filter photographs and short videos, follow other users' feeds, geotag images, name location, and comment on other users' photographs and short videos. Instagram allowed the development of web profiles in 2012, connecting accounts to Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, and Flickr in 2013, an Explore tab in mid-2012, and Video in June 2013.[25] Instagram offers 19 photographic filters; Normal, 1977, Amaro, Branna, Earlybird, Hefe, Hudson, Inkwell, Kelvin, Lo-fi, Mayfair, Nashville, Rise, Sierra, Sutro, Toaster, Valencia, Willow, X-Pro II.
Systrom hired former Yahoo Vice-President James Everingham, as well as Kevin Weil, who formerly headed product development at Twitter, as high-ranking executives at Instagram.[26]
As of October 2015, 40 billion pictures had been shared on Instagram.[4]

Instagram allowed the development of web profiles in 2012, connecting accounts to Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, and Flickr in 2013, an Explore tab in mid-2012, and Video in June 2013.[25] Instagram offers 19 photographic filters; Normal, 1977, Amaro, Branna, Earlybird, Hefe, Hudson, Inkwell, Kelvin, Lo-fi, Mayfair, Nashville, Rise, Sierra, Sutro, Toaster, Valencia, Willow, X-Pro II.
Systrom hired former Yahoo Vice-President James Everingham, as well as Kevin Weil, who formerly headed product development at Twitter, as high-ranking executives at Instagram.[26]
As of October 2015, 40 billion pictures had been shared on Instagram.[4]
As of June 2016, Instagram has over 500 million active users.[27]
Also in 2016, CNN quoted a study according to which Snapchat was regarded as the most important social network among teenagers aged 14 to 19, the first time in two years that Instagram did not feature at the top.[28]
Instagram currently employs around 450 people.[26] The app is used by 600 million people per month and 300 million per day.[26] Its competitors Snapchat and Twitter employ more people for a smaller user base, with Twitter having 3,500 employees for 317 million monthly users, and Snapchat employing 1,500 people for half of Instagram’s daily user base.[26]
In the future, Systrom seeks to develop Instagram further to better integrate the use of videos into the app.[29] He also stated that in a few years, the company might be getting involved in Virtual Reality products.[29]
According to Quartz and the New York Times, Systrom and Krieger implemented a system to overcome bottlenecks and slow decision-making in the company by scheduling meetings in which only decisions are taken.[30][31] This approach was informed by Systrom's interest in academic business theories, in particular Clayton M. Christensen's concept of the “The Innovator’s Dilemma”.[31]
Views on copying ideas in the industry[edit]
Instagram has been called out in multiple occasions for copying various new functions from its closest competitor Snapchat.[32] Regarding the issue, Systrom argued that all new services launched by tech companies nowadays are "remixes" of existing products, and that "all of these ideas are original when you remix them and bring your own flavour".[33]
Forbes list[edit]
In 2013, Systrom was listed in the Forbes 30 under 30 list under the Social/Mobile category.[34]
In 2016, the magazine ranked Systrom as a billionaire with an estimated net worth of $1.1 billion.[35] The fortune came about as a result of Facebook stocks rising more than 500%.[35]
Personal life[edit]
According to The Guardian, Systrom enjoys "fine food, golf, skiing and holidays at California’s Lake Tahoe." 
In February 2016, Systrom met with Pope Francis at the Vatican, where they discussed the power of images in uniting people "across borders, cultures and generations."[36]

How Kevin Systrom of Instagram got his start | Fortune.comFeaturesSearchSearchFortune 500AT&T Executives to Run Combined Company After Time Warner DealKatie CouricIt’s the End of the Katie Couric Era at YahooCOMPARECARDSSPONSOREDDivorceAnthony Scaramucci’s Wife Has Reportedly Filed for DivorceCourtesy of Instagram40 Under 40How Kevin Systrom got startedDaniel RobertsOct 10, 2014Kevin Systrom didn't plan on starting a company he'd sell to Facebook for $1 billion. He got his start in a record store, of all places. But it was a sudden love of photography combined with an affinity for technology—perhaps inspired by his mother, who worked in the sector— that led to the creation of the now-ubiquitous photo-sharing app. In this excerpt from Zoom: Surprising Ways to Supercharge Your Career—a book Fortune released last year that tells the exclusive origin stories of 33 alums of the 40 Under 40 over the years—Daniel Roberts recounts how Systrom, no. 8 on our 2014 40 Under 40 list and the newest boardmember at Walmart, got his start in business. Kevin Systrom's mother was early to technology.She worked at Monster.com during the first tech startup boom and, later, at Zipcar. Much like how Jess Lee (co-founder and CEO of Polyvore, no. 32 on the 2012 40 Under 40) was influenced by her mother being an entrepreneur, Systrom's fierce love of technology and his own entrepreneurship were ushered along by his mother's work at hot tech companies.As a teenager, Systrom created programs that would prank his friends by appearing to hack their AOL Instant Messenger accounts. But his first real job once he got to high school wasn’t about technology at all: he worked at Boston Beat, an old-school, vinyl-record store on posh Newbury Street. “I was obsessed with deejaying,” he tells Fortune. “So I would e-mail the store every other day to get a job there. I pestered them and pestered them and finally they let me in, and I worked a couple hours a week.” Thanks to his experience at Boston Beat, Systrom was soon opening for real DJs at Boston club shows, though he had to get help from older friends to sneak into the clubs, since he was still under 18. “One thing about my background is I get very obsessed with something,” Systrom explains, adding that he used to stockpile giant stacks of records in a corner of his bedroom. Both this single-minded focus and retro sensibility would serve him well with Instagram.When it came time to apply to college, the obvious choice was Stanford, with its tech offerings and deep ties to Silicon Valley. Systrom applied early-decision with a planned focus on computer science, but once he got there, he found that the classes were more academic than applied, so he switched to Stanford’s management science and engineering program, which had a focus on more practical subjects like finance and economics.[object Object] .  Photo: Brad Barket/Getty Much as Mark Zuckerberg (who would later buy Systrom’s company) did at Harvard, toying with code to create games for his friends to use, Systrom built web programs in his free time. One of them was a photo site he and his fraternity brothers had set up to share party pictures internally. Soon enough, he realized just how much photography interested him. During a junior year abroad in Florence, an Italian professor showed Systrom a Holga—a cheap camera, first popular in China, that developed a cult following because of its low-fi, retro-style photos. The young tech whiz adored the aesthetic of the images. They looked hip.During the summer before his senior year in college, Systrom interned at Odeo, a podcast startup created by Evan Williams, who would go on to co-found Twitter. Odeo, which launched at about the same time as Facebook, gave users an easy way to record and share podcasts, which were becoming popular thanks to the ubiquity of the iPod and digital music. One of the people working at Odeo full- time while Systrom was interning there was Jack Dorsey (another Twitter co-founder, with Williams and Biz Stone). Systrom and Dorsey hit it off, tweaking apps together for Odeo; Dorsey would later come in handy as a key connection for Systrom in the tech world. “I learned so much from Ev and Jack,” he says. “The whole thing was really eye-opening for me.”MORE: Instagram: Big, bad, and ready to make moneyIn his senior year at Stanford, Systrom had opportunities at a number of tech companies, including Microsoft, but he took a marketing job at Google, which in many ways was the place to be for Stanford grads eager to make their mark. But Systrom wasn’t writing code or working on cool new products; he was handling marketing projects for Gmail and Calendar. After two years, he managed to switch to Google’s M&A division, where he learned about big tech deals and the money it takes to do them. Still, three years into his time at Google, Systrom grew restless. He had gone there straight out of college, and the large, corporate environment took its toll on someone who had always wanted to be an entrepreneur. “I always had this itch,” he says. “I wanted to get back in the social space.” He left Google for a job at a social site called Nextstop, which offered travel recommendations. There he was able to do more of what he had wanted all along: write code and create app-style programs for the site, including games revolving around photos.It was becoming more and more obvious to Systrom that he had to pursue his passion for photography and social sharing full-time. He was ready to start his own thing, something that married those two interests and rode the rising tide of mobile, location-based gaming and social networking. He began working on it in his spare time and called the idea Burbn (matching the typical misspellings and missing letters of your typical startup names, and also paying homage to his favorite spirit, bourbon). He made a prototype for the app, which allowed for location-based photo sharing (a mashup, in a sense, of Foursquare and Flickr).At a party in January 2010, Systrom met and impressed Steve Anderson, a Bay Area venture capitalist who had founded the firm Baseline Ventures. Though Burbn was still just an idea, Anderson committed $250,000. In the same round, Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, whose venture capital firm was and remains one of Silicon Valley’s best known, also invested $250,000. Systrom quit his job at Nextstop, which was bought by Facebook that July.Because so many successful tech startups seemed to have a pair of co-founders (or a trio, but rarely just one person), Systrom felt he needed a co-founder. He tapped his friend Mike Krieger, a fellow Stanford graduate two years his junior. Krieger, too, was working on an app—his was a chat platform called Meebo—but when Systrom showed him the Burbn prototype, he dug it. Krieger came aboard in March 2010, but almost immediately Systrom wanted the company to pivot. Burbn was really too similar to Foursquare, he reasoned, which was becoming very popular. Burbn got a lot of hype in tech blogs, but it didn’t really go anywhere. One piece of it, however, caught on: photo sharing.The duo decided to make photos the whole point. Burbn had had too many different features. What would be a hit, they knew, was something simple that did one thing. They stripped the app of its bells and whistles and made it a tool, tailored for only the iPhone at first—the iPhone 4 had just come out and had a high-quality built-in camera—that would overlay pictures with Holga-inspired lenses (the app calls them filters and today has 20 of them to choose from) that make them hip and artsy. Systrom thought of it as an “instant telegram,” hence the name Instagram.MORE from Zoom: How we started Rent the RunwaySystrom and Krieger worked on Instagram feverishly for eight weeks, tweaking code and refining the visual design, but they also didn’t sweat the details beyond photo filters and basic sharing buttons. Perhaps that goes against the usual logic for launching a company, but in their case, it worked well. Says Systrom: “We had worked on Burbn for so long; this time we just wanted to get it out and get it into users’ hands.”Mike Krieger (L) and Kevin Systrom. Photographed in Menlo Park, CA, May 2014.  Photograph by Robyn Twomey for Fortune On the night of Oct. 6, 2010, when they were at last ready to go, they pressed the launch button and tweeted about the new app. Press coverage followed right away, much of it from blogs that had written about Systrom when his app was called Burbn. Two hours after Instagram went live, its servers came tumbling down because of the rush of traffic. Systrom and Krieger freaked out and feared instant failure, but in fact it was the best thing they could have hoped for. They pulled an all-nighter, working like crazy to get the servers back up and then to keep them online and running.Close to 25,000 people had signed up for an account in Instagram’s first 24 hours. The next day, “after getting three hours of sleep,” Systrom recalls, “we were exhausted, but we knew we had created something different. We had a really good feeling about it.”People loved the way the app allowed them to make their photographs unique, and they liked the presentation of the entire interace—all squared or rounded edges, bright colors, neat cursive, and tiny profile pictures for each user. The app wasn’t bogged down with personal information or a list of friends and interests; you merely chose to “follow” others, à la Twitter, and once you applied a filter and pushed “share,” your photo was out there for anyone to enjoy. To show that you liked someone else’s picture, you could double-tapped it with your finger and a heart popped up.RelatedAppleBozoma Saint John Leaving Apple, Report SaysAppleBozoma Saint John Leaving Apple, Report SaysInstagram, of course, was not without competition. Systrom says that when they launched it, “a slew of people came out [with similar apps], and I think since then, one by one, they’ve begun to do other things.” That included Color, a particularly hyped app that touted itself as a Facebook for photos.MORE from Zoom: Dolf van den Brink stands fast with HeinekenWithin nine months, Instagram had 7 million users, includ- ing influential tech-loving celebrities like Justin Bieber and Ryan Seacrest, and “to instagram” became its own verb in the tech world vernacular. “The majority of folks sign up thinking they’re going to just make cool photos,” explains Systrom. “But then as part of that, they’ll start posting and discover all these other users and this strong community. They trade likes, comments, and it becomes a whole new social graph.”That’s likely what caused Facebook to take notice. Some users had stopped using Mark Zuckerberg’s network to post photos and instead were sharing them via their Instagram feed, which had a different visual layout that they liked and was for mobile phones only. In April 2012, less than two years after Insta- gram launched, Facebook announced it was buying the startup. The news rocked the tech world, made Systrom a star, and brought the app to the immediate attention of anyone who somehow still had not heard of it.When Systrom first spoke to Fortune, a year after Instagram’s launch and mere months before Facebook came calling, he wrestled with the question of where his app fit in among the bigger players. “As we grow larger, like to 70 million users,” Systrom said, “the question is, Where do we fit in the ecosystem of the Twitters, the Facebooks, etc.? Because we’re so image-focused, I think we’ll find a very nice natural home.” That home, though he didn’t know it then, would be Facebook, which, after buying Instagram, allowed Systrom and his still-tiny, 16-person team to continue working independently within the larger social network. Systrom had predicted, too, its value to a larger company: “As offline dollars start to shift to online, people are ready to spend money on social media,” he said. “How that manifests itself is still many months out, but we think it’s a multibillion-dollar market.”MORE: Best instagrammers of the 2014 40 Under 40In contrast to its parent company, which has become busier and more multifaceted, with additional sections and features every month, Instagram has kept things remarkably simple even while rapidly scaling. It has added more filters, made it easier to tweet a photo right from within the Instagram app, and offered the Facebook-like ability to tag a friend in a photo. It has added advertising through sponsored photos that appear in your stream. But overall the service has not drastically changed from what it was four years ago. In November 2012, Instagram added an online component, which let users view their photos on a web browser, making the product no longer strictly mobile, but the feature still didn’t represent a major change in its function. Systrom's star has continued to rise (recently he became a Walmart boardmember) and his app remains red-hot, despite some fears when Facebook bought it. He and Krieger have kept it uncomplicated.“Anyone can build a social photo-sharing site,” says Systrom. “And in fact many people have. Our community is our biggest asset, so we need to protect that—make sure people are happy. We realize that no one on this earth has the golden touch, and we try to stay humble.” That, and stay simple too.Customer ServiceSite MapPrivacy PolicyAdvertisingAd ChoicesTerms of UseYour California Privacy RightsCareers© 2017 Time Inc.
