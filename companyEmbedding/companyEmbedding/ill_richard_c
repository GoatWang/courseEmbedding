History[edit]
1980s[edit]
Triumph Group was formerly one of the companies in Alco Standard Corporation, a loose conglomerate of diversified companies that operated across a large number of unrelated fields, including office supplies.[5] By the latter half of the decade, officers of Alco Standard Corporation were concentrating on office supplies, paper products and food services, their three core competencies. The former was the fastest growing market for the company.
In 1986, Alco was considering selling Triumph Group and its distribution businesses, the former of which competed in the aerospace industry and earned just under 3% of Alco Standard's revenue.
1990s[edit]
In addition to its aerospace factions, Triumph also had a stake in the U.S. steel industry. Because customers were becoming more demanding with respect to product quality, Alco Standard formed a new organization named Alco Diversified Services out of the 11 companies that comprised the Triumph Group, the two paper companies and their aerospace subsidiary. Richard Ill, who led Triumph Group for several years, was promoted to president of Alco Diversified Services.
In 1991, Alco sold their food division. In 1992, the corporation made an announcement that it was trying to sell Alco Diversified Services and purchase 49.9% percent of IMM Office Systems Holding. In 1993, Triumph Group took over Alco Diversified Services in a leveraged buyout. Triumph conducted aviation repair and overhaul, industrial machining, paper converting and steel converting. The companies employed 1450 people at 22 US locations, with aviation accounting for just over 25% of total sales.
In 1995, due to Department of Defense cutbacks, Triumph sold Otto Konigslow Manufacturing Company (which manufactured aerospace components) to two of its supervisors.
In the middle of the 1990s, commercial aviation sales went from $200 million to $300 million in three years, with forecasts indicating that sales would reach $500 million before the end of the decade. The aviation businesses provided 67% of the company's revenue. With never-before-seen demand for airline travel around 1996, Boeing produced close to 500 aircraft per annum. To meet this unprecedented production rate, Boeing outsourced a greater number of components and services.
In 1996, the corporation had 1500 workers and yearly earnings of $300 million. Six divisions worked in aviation while the other seven worked in specialty materials. The company went public at that time, which provided over $50 million in revenue.
The company focused on purchasing aviation companies in an attempt to increase profits by 20% per annum, and extend their product lines. Such acquisitions included Air Lab (1995), Teleflex Controls (1996), Hydro-Mill Company (1997), DV Industries (1998), DG Industries (1998), Chase Aerospace Limited (1998) and Hartford Tool and Die (1998).
The company also sold businesses that were not part of their aviation-focused strategy, such as Quality Park Products (1996) and Air Lab (1997).
In 1998, when Ill subsequently announced his preoccupations about cutbacks in aircraft production at Boeing Company, he also stated that there may be more work forthcoming on the new Boeing 737. This was an excellent fit for Triumph Air Repair, as much of their work consisted of servicing the Boeing 727 and 737 aircraft. It was at this time that Boeing Company purchased McDonnell Douglas, the first company to manufacture the KC-10 aircraft, which was the aerial refueling version of the Boeing DC-10. Soon to follow would be Triumph Air Repair's largest contract ever, a twelve-month deal to service auxiliary power units and line replaceable units for the United States Air Force KC-10 tankers. Boeing had several options to renew, increasing the potential of this arrangement ninefold.
In 1998, Triumph acquired four additional companies, bringing its grand total of subsidiaries to eighteen and its employee count to over two thousand in early 1999. It was at this time that Triumph purchased Ralee Engineering, a manufacturer of gigantic aircraft components and assemblies. This gave the conglomerate the ability to produce almost all of the parts used in commercial aircraft.
In 1999, Triumph infused six more companies into its colossal lineup of subsidiaries. The company produced flight control surfaces, control systems, and metal parts while providing MRO for almost every aircraft system except cabins, communications devices, landing gear, engines and the most comprehensive maintenance checks.[6]
2000s[edit]
In 2003, the Boeing Company's failing Spokane, Washington facility was acquired, which is now known as Triumph Composite Systems. The conglomerate now stood at 41 companies.[7] In the same quarter of that year, the company restructured by discontinuing its Metals Group and combining its five aviation segments into three. The Control Systems and Structures Groups were combined into Triumph Aerospace Systems Group. The Gas Turbine Services and Operational Components Groups were unified, becoming Triumph Components Group. Triumph Aftermarket Services Group added Advanced Materials Technologies and Aerospace Technologies to its portfolio.[8]
Shortly thereafter, Triumph acquired the Parker Hannifin Corporation United Aircraft Products Division and Rolls-Royce Gear Systems. The company then reorganized into two groups, Triumph Aftermarket Services and Triumph Aerospace Systems. It also combined several of its Arizona subsidiaries into Triumph Engineered Solutions, which was decommissioned at the end of 2004.[9]
In 2009, Triumph Group purchased Mexmil Company, Kongsberg Automotive, Merritt Tool Company and Saygrove Defense & Aerospace Group.[10]
2010s[edit]
In June 2010, Triumph Group acquired Vought Aircraft Industries, a leading producer of aerostructures from the Carlyle Group. This acquisition close to doubled the company workforce, and created a 'Tier One Capable' supplier.[11][12]
In January 2014 the company sold its division Lee Aerospace back to the its original founder, Jim Lee. Triumph had owned Lee Aerospace for 14 years.[13]
In December 2015, Triumph Group Inc. announced that Daniel J. Crowley would be named president and chief executive officer effective 4 January 2016. Crowley succeeds Richard C. Ill, CEO from 1993-2012. Ill left retirement to step in after Jeffry D. Frisby resigned.[14]

History[edit]
1980s[edit]
Triumph Group was formerly one of the companies in Alco Standard Corporation, a loose conglomerate of diversified companies that operated across a large number of unrelated fields, including office supplies.[5] By the latter half of the decade, officers of Alco Standard Corporation were concentrating on office supplies, paper products and food services, their three core competencies. The former was the fastest growing market for the company.
In 1986, Alco was considering selling Triumph Group and its distribution businesses, the former of which competed in the aerospace industry and earned just under 3% of Alco Standard's revenue.
1990s[edit]
In addition to its aerospace factions, Triumph also had a stake in the U.S. steel industry. Because customers were becoming more demanding with respect to product quality, Alco Standard formed a new organization named Alco Diversified Services out of the 11 companies that comprised the Triumph Group, the two paper companies and their aerospace subsidiary. Richard Ill, who led Triumph Group for several years, was promoted to president of Alco Diversified Services.
In 1991, Alco sold their food division. In 1992, the corporation made an announcement that it was trying to sell Alco Diversified Services and purchase 49.9% percent of IMM Office Systems Holding. In 1993, Triumph Group took over Alco Diversified Services in a leveraged buyout. Triumph conducted aviation repair and overhaul, industrial machining, paper converting and steel converting. The companies employed 1450 people at 22 US locations, with aviation accounting for just over 25% of total sales.
In 1995, due to Department of Defense cutbacks, Triumph sold Otto Konigslow Manufacturing Company (which manufactured aerospace components) to two of its supervisors.
In the middle of the 1990s, commercial aviation sales went from $200 million to $300 million in three years, with forecasts indicating that sales would reach $500 million before the end of the decade. The aviation businesses provided 67% of the company's revenue. With never-before-seen demand for airline travel around 1996, Boeing produced close to 500 aircraft per annum. To meet this unprecedented production rate, Boeing outsourced a greater number of components and services.
In 1996, the corporation had 1500 workers and yearly earnings of $300 million. Six divisions worked in aviation while the other seven worked in specialty materials. The company went public at that time, which provided over $50 million in revenue.
The company focused on purchasing aviation companies in an attempt to increase profits by 20% per annum, and extend their product lines. Such acquisitions included Air Lab (1995), Teleflex Controls (1996), Hydro-Mill Company (1997), DV Industries (1998), DG Industries (1998), Chase Aerospace Limited (1998) and Hartford Tool and Die (1998).
The company also sold businesses that were not part of their aviation-focused strategy, such as Quality Park Products (1996) and Air Lab (1997).
In 1998, when Ill subsequently announced his preoccupations about cutbacks in aircraft production at Boeing Company, he also stated that there may be more work forthcoming on the new Boeing 737. This was an excellent fit for Triumph Air Repair, as much of their work consisted of servicing the Boeing 727 and 737 aircraft. It was at this time that Boeing Company purchased McDonnell Douglas, the first company to manufacture the KC-10 aircraft, which was the aerial refueling version of the Boeing DC-10. Soon to follow would be Triumph Air Repair's largest contract ever, a twelve-month deal to service auxiliary power units and line replaceable units for the United States Air Force KC-10 tankers. Boeing had several options to renew, increasing the potential of this arrangement ninefold.
In 1998, Triumph acquired four additional companies, bringing its grand total of subsidiaries to eighteen and its employee count to over two thousand in early 1999. It was at this time that Triumph purchased Ralee Engineering, a manufacturer of gigantic aircraft components and assemblies. This gave the conglomerate the ability to produce almost all of the parts used in commercial aircraft.
In 1999, Triumph infused six more companies into its colossal lineup of subsidiaries. The company produced flight control surfaces, control systems, and metal parts while providing MRO for almost every aircraft system except cabins, communications devices, landing gear, engines and the most comprehensive maintenance checks.[6]
2000s[edit]
In 2003, the Boeing Company's failing Spokane, Washington facility was acquired, which is now known as Triumph Composite Systems. The conglomerate now stood at 41 companies.[7] In the same quarter of that year, the company restructured by discontinuing its Metals Group and combining its five aviation segments into three. The Control Systems and Structures Groups were combined into Triumph Aerospace Systems Group. The Gas Turbine Services and Operational Components Groups were unified, becoming Triumph Components Group. Triumph Aftermarket Services Group added Advanced Materials Technologies and Aerospace Technologies to its portfolio.[8]
Shortly thereafter, Triumph acquired the Parker Hannifin Corporation United Aircraft Products Division and Rolls-Royce Gear Systems. The company then reorganized into two groups, Triumph Aftermarket Services and Triumph Aerospace Systems. It also combined several of its Arizona subsidiaries into Triumph Engineered Solutions, which was decommissioned at the end of 2004.[9]
In 2009, Triumph Group purchased Mexmil Company, Kongsberg Automotive, Merritt Tool Company and Saygrove Defense & Aerospace Group.[10]
2010s[edit]
In June 2010, Triumph Group acquired Vought Aircraft Industries, a leading producer of aerostructures from the Carlyle Group. This acquisition close to doubled the company workforce, and created a 'Tier One Capable' supplier.[11][12]
In January 2014 the company sold its division Lee Aerospace back to the its original founder, Jim Lee. Triumph had owned Lee Aerospace for 14 years.[13]
In December 2015, Triumph Group Inc. announced that Daniel J. Crowley would be named president and chief executive officer effective 4 January 2016. Crowley succeeds Richard C. Ill, CEO from 1993-2012. Ill left retirement to step in after Jeffry D. Frisby resigned.[14]

History[edit]
1980s[edit]
Triumph Group was formerly one of the companies in Alco Standard Corporation, a loose conglomerate of diversified companies that operated across a large number of unrelated fields, including office supplies.[5] By the latter half of the decade, officers of Alco Standard Corporation were concentrating on office supplies, paper products and food services, their three core competencies. The former was the fastest growing market for the company.
In 1986, Alco was considering selling Triumph Group and its distribution businesses, the former of which competed in the aerospace industry and earned just under 3% of Alco Standard's revenue.
1990s[edit]
In addition to its aerospace factions, Triumph also had a stake in the U.S. steel industry. Because customers were becoming more demanding with respect to product quality, Alco Standard formed a new organization named Alco Diversified Services out of the 11 companies that comprised the Triumph Group, the two paper companies and their aerospace subsidiary. Richard Ill, who led Triumph Group for several years, was promoted to president of Alco Diversified Services.
In 1991, Alco sold their food division. In 1992, the corporation made an announcement that it was trying to sell Alco Diversified Services and purchase 49.9% percent of IMM Office Systems Holding. In 1993, Triumph Group took over Alco Diversified Services in a leveraged buyout. Triumph conducted aviation repair and overhaul, industrial machining, paper converting and steel converting. The companies employed 1450 people at 22 US locations, with aviation accounting for just over 25% of total sales.
In 1995, due to Department of Defense cutbacks, Triumph sold Otto Konigslow Manufacturing Company (which manufactured aerospace components) to two of its supervisors.
In the middle of the 1990s, commercial aviation sales went from $200 million to $300 million in three years, with forecasts indicating that sales would reach $500 million before the end of the decade. The aviation businesses provided 67% of the company's revenue. With never-before-seen demand for airline travel around 1996, Boeing produced close to 500 aircraft per annum. To meet this unprecedented production rate, Boeing outsourced a greater number of components and services.
In 1996, the corporation had 1500 workers and yearly earnings of $300 million. Six divisions worked in aviation while the other seven worked in specialty materials. The company went public at that time, which provided over $50 million in revenue.
The company focused on purchasing aviation companies in an attempt to increase profits by 20% per annum, and extend their product lines. Such acquisitions included Air Lab (1995), Teleflex Controls (1996), Hydro-Mill Company (1997), DV Industries (1998), DG Industries (1998), Chase Aerospace Limited (1998) and Hartford Tool and Die (1998).
The company also sold businesses that were not part of their aviation-focused strategy, such as Quality Park Products (1996) and Air Lab (1997).
In 1998, when Ill subsequently announced his preoccupations about cutbacks in aircraft production at Boeing Company, he also stated that there may be more work forthcoming on the new Boeing 737. This was an excellent fit for Triumph Air Repair, as much of their work consisted of servicing the Boeing 727 and 737 aircraft. It was at this time that Boeing Company purchased McDonnell Douglas, the first company to manufacture the KC-10 aircraft, which was the aerial refueling version of the Boeing DC-10. Soon to follow would be Triumph Air Repair's largest contract ever, a twelve-month deal to service auxiliary power units and line replaceable units for the United States Air Force KC-10 tankers. Boeing had several options to renew, increasing the potential of this arrangement ninefold.
In 1998, Triumph acquired four additional companies, bringing its grand total of subsidiaries to eighteen and its employee count to over two thousand in early 1999. It was at this time that Triumph purchased Ralee Engineering, a manufacturer of gigantic aircraft components and assemblies. This gave the conglomerate the ability to produce almost all of the parts used in commercial aircraft.
In 1999, Triumph infused six more companies into its colossal lineup of subsidiaries. The company produced flight control surfaces, control systems, and metal parts while providing MRO for almost every aircraft system except cabins, communications devices, landing gear, engines and the most comprehensive maintenance checks.[6]
2000s[edit]
In 2003, the Boeing Company's failing Spokane, Washington facility was acquired, which is now known as Triumph Composite Systems. The conglomerate now stood at 41 companies.[7] In the same quarter of that year, the company restructured by discontinuing its Metals Group and combining its five aviation segments into three. The Control Systems and Structures Groups were combined into Triumph Aerospace Systems Group. The Gas Turbine Services and Operational Components Groups were unified, becoming Triumph Components Group. Triumph Aftermarket Services Group added Advanced Materials Technologies and Aerospace Technologies to its portfolio.[8]
Shortly thereafter, Triumph acquired the Parker Hannifin Corporation United Aircraft Products Division and Rolls-Royce Gear Systems. The company then reorganized into two groups, Triumph Aftermarket Services and Triumph Aerospace Systems. It also combined several of its Arizona subsidiaries into Triumph Engineered Solutions, which was decommissioned at the end of 2004.[9]
In 2009, Triumph Group purchased Mexmil Company, Kongsberg Automotive, Merritt Tool Company and Saygrove Defense & Aerospace Group.[10]
2010s[edit]
In June 2010, Triumph Group acquired Vought Aircraft Industries, a leading producer of aerostructures from the Carlyle Group. This acquisition close to doubled the company workforce, and created a 'Tier One Capable' supplier.[11][12]
In January 2014 the company sold its division Lee Aerospace back to the its original founder, Jim Lee. Triumph had owned Lee Aerospace for 14 years.[13]
In December 2015, Triumph Group Inc. announced that Daniel J. Crowley would be named president and chief executive officer effective 4 January 2016. Crowley succeeds Richard C. Ill, CEO from 1993-2012. Ill left retirement to step in after Jeffry D. Frisby resigned.[14]

Celeste & Richard C. Ill '73
“My experience and passions woven through school and work  experience inspired this support for Drexel University. I want to provide  entrepreneurs with educational experiences that can help them be as prepared as  I was for the challenges that lie ahead.”
Chance favored the solidly prepared Richard C. Ill ‘73,  current Chairman of Triumph Group, Inc. and new member of Drexel University’s  board of trustees, throughout his career of hard work, civil service and “luck”  as he humbly points out. The type of luck that happens when one is very, very  prepared and able to spot opportunities where others might not see it. Richard  and his wife Celeste, are generously giving back in a way inspired by Richard’s  career, and are helping Drexel’s entrepreneurs create their own “luck.”
    	          Richard, who was named Regional Award Winner: An  Entrepreneur of the Year and a runner up on the national level by Ernst &  Young in 2009, has been highly recognized for his innovative and leading  talents in the complex aerospace industry. Upon stepping down as CEO he found  himself with the focused time and financial ability to give back. Giving to  entrepreneurial education through Drexel’s Laurence A. Baiada Institute for  Entrepreneurship—part of the Charles D. Close School of  Entrepreneurship—provides student entrepreneurs with programs integral to  exploring their ideas in real world situations, the foundation for solid  preparation to make invention happen. Richard and Celeste’s gift generously  provides insider access including: business incubation, subject matter experts,  company mentoring, participation in annual business plan competitions and  access to entrepreneurial conferences—all forwarding cooperative  entrepreneurial education at Drexel University. These opportunities will  provide students with the tools they need to build, compete and lead in a  highly competitive world. They will be prepared to find opportunities and  fearlessly go forward with their ideas. 
    	          As a Drexel MBA student in the early 1970s, Richard—freshly  back from serving as a captain in the US Army—completed his master’s degree  over five packed years of work and school at Drexel’s College of Business  Administration. Fresh out of the Army Richard landed a mail clerk job at the  former Alco Standard, a company that served the chemical, electrical,  metallurgical, and distribution industries. His employment experience at Alco  informed his studies and his studies influenced his rapidly developing career.  Open communication with his teachers and an early disagreement with a professor  over whether you can market more then one product with one company brand became  a topic for a thesis: Marketing within the Multi-Products Company. Richard was  certain it could be done. Ironically, that is what Triumph, the aerospace  branch of the former conglomerate at Alco came to be under Richard’s  leadership. His personal and professional engagements in the Army, work and  school fostered people skills, bringing manpower and ideas together, while  serving him and his employees well. “My experience and passions woven through  school and work experience inspired this support for Drexel University.” states  Richard. “I want to provide entrepreneurs with educational experiences that can  help them be as prepared as I was for the challenges that lie ahead.”
   	            In gratitude for Richard and Celeste’s generosity Drexel has  named the Celeste and Richard Ill Incubator for Entrepreneurial and  Experiential Education after them. A plaque will adorn the entrance of this  main room on Drexel’s brand new LeBow College of Business’s main floor  laboratory, celebrating their generous gift that will create chances for our  prepared entrepreneurs.

        Richard C. Ill, Director and Founder of Triumph, Named President and 
        Chief Executive Officer
      

        Jeffry D. Frisby Steps Down as President and CEO
      

        General Ralph “Ed” Eberhart Named Non-Executive Chairman
      






April 08, 2015 08:05 AM Eastern Daylight Time



BERWYN, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Triumph Group, Inc. (NYSE:TGI) today announced that the Board of 
      Directors has appointed Richard C. Ill as President and Chief Executive 
      Officer and that Jeffry D. Frisby has stepped down as President and 
      Chief Executive Officer and as a director of the company, effective 
      immediately. With this transition, director General Ralph E. Eberhart 
      was named non-executive Chairman succeeding Executive Chairman Mr. Ill, 
      the founder of the company, who will also remain a director.
    

      The Triumph Board has formed a Search Committee comprised of independent 
      directors and led by Richard C. Gozon, lead independent director, to 
      identify a permanent CEO. The Committee will retain a leading executive 
      recruiting firm, and internal and external candidates will be considered 
      as part of the search process.
    

      Mr. Ill said, “Triumph today is a recognized global leader in 
      aerostructures, aerospace systems and aftermarket services that is 
      solidly positioned in our end markets. We have a deep and committed 
      management team and over 14,000 hardworking and dedicated employees. Our 
      Board is committed to improving execution, increasing profitability, 
      expanding margins, and generating strong cash flow and will continue to 
      leverage the strength of our portfolio to drive sustainable growth and 
      value for all of our stakeholders. On behalf of the Board of Directors, 
      I thank Jeff for his many years of service and contributions to Triumph 
      and wish him all the best in his future endeavors.”
    

      Mr. Frisby said, “It has been a privilege to be a part of the Triumph 
      family for the past 17 years as President of the Aerospace Systems Group 
      and most recently as the company’s President and CEO. Triumph has an 
      outstanding team of committed employees focused on operating with 
      integrity and delivering products and quality service to customers. I 
      know the company will build upon its momentum to ensure Triumph’s 
      continued growth and success.”
    

      Mr. Gozon said, “We believe this is the right time to transition 
      leadership as our company embarks on this next phase of growth and 
      development and we are fortunate to have Rick step in and lead Triumph 
      as CEO during this period. As the founder of Triumph, our former CEO and 
      a member of the Board, Rick is intimately familiar with the company’s 
      operations, products and customers, and is fully committed to its 
      success. The Board will conduct a thorough and comprehensive search to 
      identify the best candidate to serve as the company’s next CEO.”
    

Fourth Quarter and Full Fiscal 2015 Earnings Conference Call


      On May 7, 2015, Triumph will report its fourth quarter and full fiscal 
      2015 earnings after the market close. The company also will host a
