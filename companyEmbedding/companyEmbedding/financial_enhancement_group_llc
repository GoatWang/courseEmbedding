HOW WE'RE DIFFERENT








Financial Enhancement Group practices comprehensive financial planning and is an independent Registered Investment Advisory firm with three offices in Central Indiana. Our partners envisioned a firm that was client-focused, fully transparent, and rooted with Midwestern values.

Our Clients Are What Matter Most

We adopt a fiduciary relationship with all of our clients. This binds us with not only a legal obligation to act in our clients best interests but the partners of our firm have also aligned their own personal assets alongside those of the client’s for which we manage money.
 
Our clients range from (to name a few) entrepreneurs, executives, school teachers, doctors, farmers, and engineers, and from those that are nearing retirement to others that are just starting their careers. 
 
Our staff is committed to helping families plan for their financial future. With a team of professionals that are experienced in handling unique planning needs, our clients are our top priority and we refuse to deviate from that.

A Personal Relationship

We are a one call shop. That means you can pick up the phone and talk to a real person, one who will be your advocate should you have a question or a need. Our firm’s belief is that a life of work should yield an enjoyable life after work. Many people don’t want to worry about how to invest, where to invest, or how to plan for retirement. We strive to make the process of financial planning easy to understand, results-driven, and centered around our firm’s most important asset, our clients.
 
Clients of Financial Enhancement Group have 24/7 access to their accounts with complete transparency via our custodian, TD Ameritrade, as well as our firm’s client portal found on our website. We provide comprehensive reporting on a quarterly basis, as well as weekly commentary via our Market Carver video that’s emailed each Thursday. We also host a bi-annual dinner in Anderson and Lafayette for the families we work with, updating them on changes in the market and economy as well as updates on financial planning topics and possible changes coming from Congress and the IRS that may impact their financial future.

A Customized Approach

Many financial planning firms focus on developing a six or seven figure number that they tell their clients they’ll need to reach far off in the future. We are more realistic in our process. Planning for retirement or other financial goals is a journey and requires unceasing attention on our part. The investment, tax, and legal landscapes are constantly changing and your plan for the future often needs to change with them.
 
Our financial planning practice, unified in the trademarked Family Focus® Process, creates conversations we have with our clients about the 5 Critical Elements we believe help shape the journey towards reaching their goals.

Balancing Yield and Tax Considerations In Your Portfolio

Posted on February 12, 2015 3:11 PM by Joseph Clark, CFP

As the world’s most tracked stock index, the S&P 500 was never intended to be an investment guidance tool.  Rather, the index was developed to serve as an indicator economists could use when comparing various sectors of the U.S. economy.

The index’s creators based the design on the theory that the economy vacillates between market peaks and bottoms, expanding and contracting in a cyclical manner. Standard and Poor’s was commissioned to identify U.S. companies representing various sectors which would presumably perform differently based on the economic movement. For example, utilities and consumer goods companies are expected to perform well when the economy contracts into a recession. Likewise, industrial companies should do better when the economy is expanding. While most financial professionals discount the index as a reliable economic indicator, it continues to serve as a central measure of investment performance nonetheless.

Today’s S&P index is composed of nine sectors and the difference in dividend yields between one sector and another can be substantial. Let’s say you are a passive investor and simply own an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) that attempts to replicate the performance of the S&P500 in both a qualified and non-qualified account. You have an equal amount of money in your IRA and in your taxable account each owning the fund. Becoming proactive from a tax investment perspective can put money in your billfold.

Currently, the dividend yield in XLY, the exchange traded fund representing the consumer discretionary stocks within the S&P 500 is 1.29%. Though each sector has a positive yield, XLY’s yield is currently the lowest. The highest yielding sector is XLV, the ETF for the Health Care sector, at 3.23% - a 2% difference over XLY.

If you put the higher dividend yielding sectors in your IRA and the lower yielding sectors in your taxable account the investment profile remains the same creating simultaneous tax efficiency. The higher your marginal bracket the better this gets.  Being a proactive investor means paying attention to the taxes as well as fees and expenses not just the investments themselves.

Planning for Physical and Fiscal Fitness

Waking up early and heading to the gym is tough. But once the workout is over, the payoff is often a tremendous energy boost. While people exercise for many reasons, they usually expect to benefit from their “sweat equity” not in the current moment, but in the future.
 
We will all encounter health issues at some time and the medical world assures us we will be better equipped to deal with health problems if we get – and stay – physically fit. Preparation matters.
 
Perhaps you’re asking what exercise has in common with financial planning and investing. Good question! The answer is very few individuals prepare to invest. Most folks look at the choices in their retirement plan and make selections. Studies have shown that more than 68% of 401k plan participants made no changes in 2008 -- perhaps the most volatile market year in history!  
 
Getting back to the fitness analogy, the greatest benefits of exercise come from the stress we intentionally place on our muscles so that when a health problem arises, our bodies are in better condition to deal with the situation. From an investment perspective, investors who choose to go it alone need a methodical regimen for taking in and processing market data. They also need to develop a strategy to accommodate unforeseen yet inevitable future events.
 
When it comes to market data, investors should not allow random news clips to guide their decisions and they must filter out market “noise” in determining how to act on the data. For the record, you don't have to make changes in your portfolio just because something changed; but you must be prepared to consider adjustments when the information dictates conditions have shifted.
 
The financial industry refers to this as an investment policy statement. I prefer to use the term investment playbook.  The playbook specifies how we intend to respond to change with a disciplined approach aimed at particular objectives. It’s a much better approach than reacting to Wall Street and the media’s noise.  Great stock or even mutual fund opportunities may arise, but if they don't match the investor’s playbook, they need to stay on the bench.
 
The playbook should describe what the investor is trying to achieve and how market changes will be managed. A well-designed playbook keeps investors from making emotional decisions or “freezing up” during confusing times like those the market experienced in 2008. The playbook should clearly document investment information sources, the technology involved in investing and why a particular investment was purchased.
 
I have been married for 26 years and people continue to ask me how I met my bride Barb. The initial decision matters in marriage and it should matter in investing as well.  Why was an investment purchased and when will it be sold off?  Unlike marriage, stocks are rarely lifetime decisions!
 
When you go to the gym, you can wander aimlessly or plan to invest your energy.  I think you know which one works best. Investing is no different.

A Gifting Strategy for Tax Savings

Posted on January 30, 2015 11:59 AM by Joseph Clark, CFP

Categories:
												Newspaper Column 
The current tax code allows U.S. taxpayers to make financial gifts of up to $14,000 to any other U.S. citizen for 2015. These gifts are tax-free to the donor and the recipient, provided the gifts are of “present interest,” meaning no strings attached. Beneficiaries must be able to use the gift without any restrictions.

Many of us have children that are in lower tax brackets than ourselves, yet who still have earned income. Even a child working part time may have earned more than $5,500 of earned income in 2014. Provided the child has not contributed to another IRA and does indeed have $5,500 or more of income ($6,500 if they are over 50 years of age), they can make 2014 IRA contributions up until April 15, 2015. Alas, one common problem often arises -- they have no money left! This is a frequent issue for younger folks and low income earners. Consequently, building tax-free wealth in a Roth IRA becomes out of the question given their financial means.

That is where gifts of $14,000 or less come into play. The money contributed to a Roth IRA doesn’t have to come from the account owner’s paycheck.  He or she simply must have paid taxes on $5,500 or more of earned income in the taxable year. Keep in mind that income could have also been earned by a spouse. As long as their joint income is less than $181,000 filing jointly, or $114,000 filling as individuals, they are eligible to contribute.

Better yet, let’s say you were fortunate enough to buy a stock or exchange traded fund (ETF) more than a year ago and it has substantially increased in value. Let’s also assume at some point in your life you need or want to subsidize a wedding or some other life event for a child or grandchild. The Roth gifting strategy maybe a perfect fit for you.

Roth accounts offer liquidity as contributions can always be withdrawn on demand and the money has already been taxed.  Just realize that growth on IRA contributions must remain in the account for at least five years or until age 59.5 depending on the tax code at the time and the need for the money.  But the contribution is always available.

So if Grandpa Joe gives his granddaughter $5,500, which is less than $14,000, no taxes are due. If the granddaughter places the money in a Roth IRA, it will count as a contribution and she may retrieve the money anytime she needs or wants it. Grandpa Joe could also decide to gift his grandchild $5,500 worth of appreciated stock instead of using cash. If the grandchild’s marginal tax bracket is 15% or less, then she would pay zero capital gains tax on the sale of the stock in her name.

In this perfect world example, we have paid zero taxes on capital gains, allowed for a grandchild to start a tax-free retirement plan and helped pre-fund an anticipated future expense.

Planning a Trip? Consider Currency Changes

Posted on January 21, 2015 4:03 PM by Joseph Clark, CFP

Calculating currency valuations from one country to another is complex and most people don’t give the subject much thought until it is time to travel. They may visit their bank for a few euros’, but will usually use a credit card to cover their tab on the Spanish Rivera or at the Tuscan villa. Consequently, they count fluctuating currency rates as part of the vacation cost. But for corporations, fluctuating currency rates are much more impactful.

Switzerland surprised the world by reaffirming its commitment to keep the franc at $1.20 to the euro on January 12, then suddenly changed its position on January 15,  sending the euro falling and the franc soaring. So what?

German businesses suddenly found it much more expensive to buy Swiss watches (or chocolates or cheese) and Switzerland’s exporters were caught in a battle literally overnight.  Meanwhile Swiss citizens enjoyed welcome wealth. Unlike an American who may plan an occasional trip to Paris, it is quite common for a Swiss citizen to drive to France for a day. Thus, the currency move noted above suddenly put an extra 15-20% of buying power into the hands of Swiss citizens visiting France. Would it surprise you that they bought all the fresh meat in sight? They did!

We live in a global society and understanding currency fluctuation is much more than calculating travel costs. Exporters win or lose every time currency valuations change. Keep in mind the euro has declined from $1.60 to the U.S. dollar in 2008, to $1.15 in January 2015. The new Mercedes is more affordable here, but Apple iPhones are much more expensive in Germany. Don’t feel too flush with the dollar’s value. Remember, nearly half the earnings in the S&P 500 come from companies based outside the U.S. Unlike consumers who consider currency fluctuation part of an occasional trip, the business of companies like GE and Caterpillar are significantly affected by currency fluctuations daily.

Like all financial decisions including investments and retirement planning, the further out you plan your trip the more successful your journey will be. Remember to add currency to your budgeting discussion!

The Tough Decisions Companies Make with Earnings

Posted on January 14, 2015 4:00 PM by Joseph Clark, CFP

												Newspaper Column 

Business CEOs and their boards must make many decisions: Where do they invest in their business? Do they add new business models, buy competitors or dive deeper into their niche? What do they do with leftover profits?  
 
Amid all of these questions, a key consideration to keep in mind is that the decisions business leaders make don’t take place in a vacuum, but are influenced – and sometimes even dictated -by external conditions. In today’s context, the conditions we are discussing include very low interest rates and changing tax policy.
 
A company’s board has basically three decisions with regards to how to use the company’s profits. They can reinvest in the business today or at a later time, issue dividends to shareholders or buy back shares.
 
The U.S. equity market has experienced significant price appreciation in recent years. In large part, that growth has been driven by several sources and reflects multiple sectors across the economy.
 
In the aftermath of the economic collapse of 2008, business leaders were forced to focus tightly on the bottom line. By embracing technology, concentrating on profitability and making some very difficult and often unpopular decisions, business leaders continued to defend the bottom line. Consequently, as profits have increased annually, top line revenue has flat lined. This is not an ideal situation.
 
The very low interest rate environment has allowed leaders to borrow money in the bond market with yields that are near the dividend yield their stocks are paying.  Keep in mind a coupon payment on a bond doesn't fluctuate over the life of the bond and that the payments are fully deductible from a tax standpoint. In contrast, a stock’s dividend yield is calculated based on the current share price of the stock. If a stock trades at $10 per share and pays a $1 dividend, the yield is 10%. If the same stock rises to $20 per share, the dividend yield falls to 5% - continually in flux as stock prices change.
 
Dividends are taxable to both to the corporation and to the shareholder.  The tax changes in 2013 made dividends even more taxable for individuals earning higher incomes. The combination of lower rates and tax policy has led to market appreciation in the form of reducing the shares. If a company makes $100 but reduces the number of shares outstanding, then the earnings per share increase even though the business didn't necessarily grow.
 
Our economy has certainly come a long way from 2008. In comparison to our European counterparts, we are still experiencing minor inflation while the Eurozone has fallen into deflation. That is very concerning for all of us. While experts expect interest rates to rise this year, they errantly made the same prediction last year. As a result, the opportunity to borrow at low rates and buy back shares is diminishing.
 
Just as CEOs must decide where to invest profits, you must decide where to invest your nest egg.  Proceed with caution.

YOUR FINANCIAL VISION







 
A Tailored Approach
 
Your financial vision is carefully crafted and articulated to provide a mutual guidance and appreciation for your financial future. By assisting you in creating a direction for your wealth you also create insight and clarity about who you are and what you care about. This provides our team direction as we navigate a fluid economic environment as well as changing tax code.
 
A Guideline for Your Plan
 
The financial vision provides both yourself and our team the ingredients for solid discernment and intuition in making the right financial decisions for your family for years to come. Undoubtedly all of our lives will have changes, challenges and opportunities and a clarified, agreed upon and recorded vision serves to ensure we both fully comprehend and understand the hopes and expectations for the future.
 
Here are some examples of Financial Visions other clients have created:
 
 

Live comfortably and maintain my current living standard without running out of money.
	 

To continue our comfortable lifestyle and leave a legacy to our children and grandchildren.
	 


I’d like to get to a point where I can drive around in a truck, with my dog in the back, helping others in need.
	 


I want to work at 75 because I want to, not because I have to.
	 


I want to have the opportunity to give more money away to charity than I spend on myself each year.
	 


At 92 I don’t want to be a ‘bag lady.’ My money has to last longer than I do.
	 


We want to begin the process toward retirement in 4 to 5 years and be able to assist with college expenses for our children.
	 


Our vision is to be able to retire within 12-15 years debt-free and with the financial freedom to be able to travel.
	 


We just had our second child and want to prepare for their higher education and make sure both of our kids are financially protected.
	 


I’ve always wanted to own a flower shop, so I’d like to save enough money to open my own shop in the next six years.
