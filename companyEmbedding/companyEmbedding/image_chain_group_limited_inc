(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition or Plan of Operation  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q ("Quarterly Report") may contain "forward-looking statements," as that term is used in federal securities laws, about Image Chain Group Limited, Inc.'s financial condition, results of operations and business. These statements include, among others:  ? statements concerning the potential benefits that Image Chain Group Limited, Inc. ("ICGL," "we," "our," "us," the "Company," "management") may experience from its business activities and certain transactions it contemplates or has completed; and  ? statements of ICGL's expectations, beliefs, future plans and strategies, anticipated developments and other matters that are not historical facts. These statements may be made expressly in this Quarterly Report. You can find many of these statements by looking for words such as "believes," "expects," "anticipates," "estimates," "opines," or similar expressions used in this Quarterly Report. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties that may cause ICGL's actual results to be materially different from any future results expressed or implied by ICGL in those statements. The most important facts that could prevent ICGL from achieving its stated goals include, but are not limited to, the following:  (a) volatility or decline of ICGL's stock price;  (b) potential fluctuation of quarterly results;  (c) failure of ICGL to earn revenues or profits as a result of acquiring revenue-generating companies and assets;  (d) inadequate capital to continue or expand its business, and inability to raise additional capital or financing to implement its business plans;  (e) failure to secure demand, or declining demand, for ICGL's products and services;  (f) rapid adverse changes in markets;  (g) litigation with or legal claims and allegations by outside parties against ICGL, including but not limited to litigation related to the disposition of assets in November 2016; and  (h) insufficient revenues to cover operating costs.  There is no assurance that ICGL will be profitable in the near future, ICGL may not be able to source and consummate attractive acquisitions and may not successfully develop, manage or market the products and services of future acquired companies, ICGL may not be able to attract or retain qualified executives and personnel, ICGL may not be able to obtain customers for products or services that it markets in the future, additional dilution in outstanding stock ownership may be incurred due to the issuance of more shares, warrants and stock options, or the exercise of outstanding warrants and stock options, and other risks inherent in ICGL's businesses.  Because the statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. ICGL cautions you not to place undue reliance on the statements, which speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report. The cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section should be considered in connection with any subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements that ICGL or persons acting on its behalf may issue. ICGL does not undertake any obligation to review or confirm analysts' expectations or estimates or to release publicly any revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Quarterly Report, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.  Overview  Image Chain Group Limited, Inc. (formerly Have Gun Will Travel Entertainment, Inc.) ("ICGL", "we", "us" or the "Company") was incorporated under the laws of Nevada on December 18, 2013, and initially sought to create reality television programming. On June 11, 2015, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation in order to change its name to Image Chain Group Limited, Inc. and to increase the authorized shares of common stock from 70,000,000 to 400,000,000 (the "Amendments"). The name change was undertaken in order to more closely align with the operations of the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Fortune Delight Holdings Group Ltd ("FDHG"). The increase in authorized shares was undertaken to allow the Company to utilize the newly available shares to raise capital.  On May 5, 2015, ICGL entered into a share exchange agreement (the "Exchange Agreement") with FDHG and Wu Jun Rui, on behalf of himself and certain other individuals who are to receive shares of ICGL pursuant to the Exchange Agreement (the "Shareholders"). On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Exchange Agreement, on May 5, 2015, Wu Jun Rui transferred all 50,000 shares of FDHG common stock, consisting of all of the issued and outstanding shares of FDHG, to ICGL in exchange for the issuance to the shareholders of 59,620,000 shares of the Company's common stock, par value $.001 per share and 5,000,000 shares of the Company's preferred stock, par value $.001 per share. On February 13, 2017 the Company filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada a Certificate of Correction (the "Certificate of Correction") to correct a mistake made in the Company's original Articles of Incorporation with regard to the preferred stock issued in connection with the Exchange Agreement. The Company also entered into an agreement in which the holder of the preferred stock agreed to retire the preferred stock in exchange for receiving an equal number of common stock of the Company.  As a result of the closing of the Exchange Agreement, FDHG became the Company's wholly owned subsidiary. FDHD, through its subsidiaries, manufactured and sold "Image Tea"-branded tea products from its tea garden in Yunnan Province.  On or about November 15, 2016, FDHG disposed of its ownership of all operating assets, and as a result ICGL became a shell company, as defined by Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act (the "Disposition Event"). The Disposition Event is evidenced by a bought and sold note stamped by the Inland Revenue Department of Hong Kong, which we believe is a legally binding document. Because ICGL does not currently have any substantial operations, we are currently reviewing potential acquisition targets.  Results of Operations  As described in Note 1, on or around November 15, 2016, the Company disposed of all of its operating assets. As a result of the Disposition Event, the Company has since on or around November 15, 2016, been operating as a shell company, as that word is defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act. Consequently, the Company's results of operations consist of $0 of revenue for the three month period ended March 31, 2017.  Comparison of the three months ended March 31, 2017 and the three months ended March 31, 2016  Loss from continuing operations for the three month period ended March 31, 2017 was $50,626, as compared to $30,830 for the three month period ended March 31, 2016. The increase is attributable to legal, accounting and consulting expenses incurred as a result of maintaining public company status for our Company and in connection with our efforts to source revenue-generating corporate acquisition targets.  Liquidity and Capital Resources March 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Change Cash $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 ) Total assets $ 0 $ 49,328 $ (49,328 ) Total liabilities $ 36,973 $ 35,675 $ 1,298 Stockholders' equity (deficit) $ (36,973 ) $ 13,653 $ (50,626 )  Working Capital March 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Change Current assets $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 Current liabilities $ 36,973 $ 35,675 $ 1,298 Working capital deficiency $ (36,973 ) $ (35,675 ) $ (1,298 )  The Company's cash and cash equivalents, our only current assets, were $0 at March 31, 2017 and at December 31, 2016.  As at March 31, 2017, current liabilities consisted of $36,973, including $5,802 owed to related parties and accounts payable of $6,591, as compared to current liabilities of $35,675, including $0 owed to related parties and accounts payable of $0, at December 31, 2016. We do not consider this minor increase in current liabilities to be material.  Cash Flows Three Months Three Months Ended Ended March 31, 2017 March 31, 2016 Cash used in operating activities $ (55,130 ) $ (30,830 ) Cash provided by investing activities 0 0 Cash provided by financing activities (55,130 ) (30,830 ) Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents for the period $ 0 $ 0  Cash Flow from Operating Activities  During the three months ended March 31, 2017, our company used $55,130 in cash from operating activities, compared to $30,830 cash used in operating activities during the three months ended March 31, 2016. The cash used from operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2017 consisted of expenses paid to legal, accounting and other service providers in connection with complying with our continuing reporting obligations and sourcing and analyzing acquisition targets.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  (See "Recent Accounting Pronouncements" in Note 2 of Notes to the Financial Statements.)  Going Concern  If the Company does not raise additional money via public or private offerings or related party loans, the Company may be unable to continue as going concern. Additional financing may not become available on acceptable terms and there can be no assurance that any additional financing that the Company does obtain will be sufficient to meet its needs in the long term.

	Company
	History and Recent Developments





	 




	Image
	Chain Group Limited, Inc. (formerly Have Gun Will Travel Entertainment, Inc.) (“ICGL”, “we”, “us”
	or the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of Nevada on December 18, 2013. From inception through the date
	of the Share Exchange as defined below, we were an emerging forward-thinking full-service television pre-production company dedicated
	to the creation of original concepts and programming with a bold and innovative edge in the reality television space for sale,
	option and licensure to independent producers, cable television networks, syndication companies, and other entities. On June 11,
	2015, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation with the State of Nevada in order to change its name to Image Chain Group
	Limited, Inc. and to increase the authorized shares of common stock from 70,000,000 to 400,000,000 (the “Amendments”).
	The name change was undertaken in order to more closely align with the operations of the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary,
	Fortune Delight Holdings Group Ltd (“FDHG”). The increase in authorized shares was undertaken to allow the Company
	to utilize the newly available shares to raise capital. The board of directors and the stockholders of the Company approved the
	Amendments on May 8, 2015.




	 




	On
	May 5, 2015, ICGL entered into a share exchange agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with FDHG and Wu Jun Rui, on
	behalf of himself and certain other individuals who are to receive shares of ICGL pursuant to the Exchange Agreement (the “Shareholders”).
	On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Exchange Agreement, on May 5, 2015, Wu Jun Rui transferred all 50,000
	shares of FDHG common stock, consisting of all of the issued and outstanding shares of FDHG, to ICGL in exchange for the issuance
	to the shareholders of 59,620,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $.001 per share and 5,000,000 shares of
	the Company’s preferred stock, par value $.001 per share. The preferred stock was issued to Mr. Xinyuan Yang. Because the
	Company’s original articles of incorporation did not specifically designate the preferred stock as “preferred stock,”
	and did not designate the rights and privileges of the preferred stock, on February 13, 2017 the Company filed with the Secretary
	of State of the State of Nevada a Certificate of Correction (the “Certificate of Correction”), authorized under Chapter
	78.0296 of the Nevada Revised Statutes, which revised the originally filed articles of incorporation of the Company to designate
	the Additional Shares as preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share, which changes were retroactively effective as of the original
	filing date of the Company’s articles of incorporation. Concurrently with the filing of the Certificate of Correction, the
	Company also entered into a Stock Settlement and Release Agreement (the “Release Agreement”) with Mr. Yang in which
	the Company agreed to issue to Mr. Yang 5,000,000 shares of common stock in exchange for (i) the transfer to the Company and cancellation
	of the 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock issued to Mr. Yang in connection with the Exchange Agreement and (ii) an agreement
	by Mr. Yang to release the Company from any and all liability in connection with prior transactions between the Company and Mr.
	Yang, including but not limited to the Exchange Agreement.




	 




	As
	a result of the closing of the Exchange Agreement, FDHG became the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary. At the closing, FDHD
	was the parent company of Silver Channel Industrial Ltd., a Hong Kong company. Heyuan Image Machinery Import and Export Co., Ltd.,
	a P.R.C. company, is the wholly-owned subsidiary of Silver Channel Industrial Ltd. (“Silver Channel”). Guangzhou Image
	Agricultural Technology Ltd., a Guangzhou company (“Guangzhou Image”), is the wholly-owned subsidiary of Heyuan Image
	Machinery Import and Export Co., Ltd. (“Heiyuan Image”). Guangzhou Image Agricultural Technology Ltd. owns 100% of
	the capital stock of Yunnan Image Tea Industrial Ltd. (“Yunnan Image”). Through the aforementioned companies, ICGL
	altered its business plan to manufacture and sell “Image Tea”-branded tea products from its tea garden in Yunnan Province.

	On
	or about November 15, 2016, the Company’s subsidiary FDHG disposed of its ownership in Silver Channel, which include all
	of the assets and liabilities of Silver Channel, Heiyuan Image, Guangzhou Image, and Yunnan Image (the “Disposition Event”).
	All of the Company’s substantial operations were conducted through these subsidiaries of FDHG. The disposition was carried
	out by the sole director of both FDHG and Silver Channel. Following the closing of the Disposition Event, ICGL became a shell
	company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act. The Disposition Event is evidenced by a bought and sold note stamped
	by the Inland Revenue Department of Hong Kong, which we believe is a legally binding document. Because ICGL does not currently
	have any substantial operations, we are currently reviewing potential acquisition targets.




	 




	On
	February 14, 2017, the Company entered into a share exchange agreement (the “ICSML Agreement”) with Image Convenience
	Store Management Limited, a company registered under the laws of the British Virgin Islands (“ICSML”), and Wang Fa
	Sung, the sole shareholder of ICSML (the “Seller”). Pursuant to the ICSML Agreement, the Company agreed to acquire
	one share of ICSML, representing 100% of ICSML’s issued and outstanding stock, from the Seller in exchange for the issuance
	of 200,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, after giving effect to a 1-for-100 reverse stock split (the “Reverse
	Stock Split”) and other transactions provided for in the ICSML Agreement (the “ICSML Exchange”). As of the date
	of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company has not yet effected the Reverse Stock Split and has not closed the
	ICSML Exchange. The closing of the ICSML Exchange was initially expected to occur no later than May 13, 2017, however we anticipate
	that we will need to amend the ICSML Agreement to postpone closing of the ICSML Exchange.




	 





	Corporate
	Structure





	 




	Prior
	to the Disposition Event, the Company, through its wholly owned operating subsidiaries, was in the business of promoting and distributing
	its owned branded teas that are grown, harvested, cured, and package in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”).
	The Company products were sold in the PRC for domestic consumption.




	 




	FDHG
	is an investment holding company incorporated on January 8, 2015 and is domiciled in the British Virgin Islands. FDHG continues
	to be a wholly-owned subsidiary of ICGL.




	 




	As
	of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, ICGL is a shell company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act. As
	a shell company, ICGL does not own substantial operating assets.




	 





	Our
	Products, Services and Customers





	 




	Following
	the Disposition Event, ICGL is not engaged in the manufacture, marketing and selling of tea products or any other goods or services.
	We are currently considering corporate acquisition targets. We have identified a number of potential targets and have begun performing
	initial diligence. With the exception of the ICSML Agreement described above in this Item 1 to the Annual Report on Form 10-K,
	we have not entered into any definitive agreements with any potential investment targets.




	 





	Competition





	 




	We
	face substantial competition from private equity funds, strategic corporate acquirers, high net worth and ultra high net worth
	individuals, family wealth offices, sovereign wealth funds, public pension funds and any other entities or individuals looking
	to acquire performing assets in the Asian region. ICGL continues to seek performing assets in the consumer products industry serving
	the domestic PRC market. We believe that our history of manufacturing, marketing and selling quality tea products in the domestic
	PRC market provides us with the experience that we need to develop and maintain a competitive advantage in the sectors that we
	seek to enter.

	Government
	and Industry Regulation





	 




	Consumer
	products being sold in the PRC are subject to central government regulation as well as provincial government regulation in the
	provinces in which products are sold. Business and product licenses must be obtained through application to the central, provincial
	and local governments. Business, company and product registrations are certified on a regular basis and companies must comply
	with the laws and regulations of the PRC, provincial and local governments and industry agencies.




	 




	If
	we enter the health foods and consumer product sectors that we are contemplating, we will be required to comply with applicable
	hygiene and food safety standards in relation to our production processes. Failure to pass these inspections, or the loss of or
	failure to renew our licenses and permits, could require us to temporarily or permanently suspend some or all of our production
	activities, which could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business.




	 





	Employees





	 




	As
	of the date of this report, we have 8 employees. We have not experienced any strikes or shutdowns and have not been involved in
	any labor disputes.




	 





	Intellectual
	Property





	 




	We
	currently do not have any patents, trademarks, licenses, franchises, concessions, royalty agreements, or labor contracts.

	for this office space is approximately $90.40. We believe the leased premise is sufficient to meet the immediate needs of our

	Statements





	 




	This
	Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Annual Report”) may contain “forward-looking statements,” as that term is
	used in federal securities laws, about Image Chain Group Limited, Inc.’s financial condition, results of operations and
	business. These statements include, among others:




	 








	6

	 









	 







	 






	 




	●




	statements
	concerning the potential benefits that Image Chain Group Limited, Inc. (“ICGL,” “we,” “our,”
	“us,” the “Company,” “management”) may experience from its business activities and certain
	transactions it contemplates or has completed; and






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	statements of ICGL’s
	expectations, beliefs, future plans and strategies, anticipated developments and other matters that are not historical facts.
	These statements may be made expressly in this Annual Report. You can find many of these statements by looking for words such
	as “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” “opines,”
	or similar expressions used in this Annual Report. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks
	and uncertainties that may cause ICGL’s actual results to be materially different from any future results expressed
	or implied by ICGL in those statements. The most important facts that could prevent ICGL from achieving its stated goals include,
	but are not limited to, the following:






	 






	 




	(a)




	volatility
	or decline of ICGL’s stock price;






	 




	 




	 






	 




	(b)




	potential fluctuation
	of quarterly results;

	failure of ICGL
	to earn revenues or profits;






	 




	 




	 






	 




	(d)




	inadequate capital
	to continue or expand its business, and inability to raise additional capital or financing to implement its business plans;






	 




	 




	 






	 




	(e)




	decline in demand
	for ICGL’s products and services;






	 




	 




	 






	 




	(f)




	rapid adverse changes
	in markets;






	 




	 




	 






	 




	(g)




	litigation with
	or legal claims and allegations by outside parties against ICGL, including but not limited to challenges to ICGL’s intellectual
	property rights; and






	 




	 




	 






	 




	(h)




	insufficient revenues
	to cover operating costs.






	 




	There
	is no assurance that ICGL will be profitable in the near future, ICGL may not be able to source and consummate attractive acquisitions
	and may not successfully develop, manage or market the products and services of future acquired companies, ICGL may not be able
	to attract or retain qualified executives and personnel, ICGL may not be able to obtain customers for products or services that
	it markets in the future, additional dilution in outstanding stock ownership may be incurred due to the issuance of more shares,
	warrants and stock options, or the exercise of outstanding warrants and stock options, and other risks inherent in ICGL’s
	businesses.




	 




	Because
	the statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by
	the forward-looking statements. ICGL cautions you not to place undue reliance on the statements, which speak only as of the date
	of this Annual Report. The cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section should be considered in connection with
	any subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements that ICGL or persons acting on its behalf may issue. ICGL does not undertake
	any obligation to review or confirm analysts’ expectations or estimates or to release publicly any revisions to any forward-looking
	statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Annual Report, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated

	Overview





	 




	Image
	Chain Group Limited, Inc. (formerly Have Gun Will Travel Entertainment, Inc.) (“ICGL”, “we”, “us”
	or the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of Nevada on December 18, 2013, and initially sought to create reality
	television programming. On June 11, 2015, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation in order to change its name to Image
	Chain Group Limited, Inc. and to increase the authorized shares of common stock from 70,000,000 to 400,000,000 (the “Amendments”).
	The name change was undertaken in order to more closely align with the operations of the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary,
	Fortune Delight Holdings Group Ltd (“FDHG”). The increase in authorized shares was undertaken to allow the Company
	to utilize the newly available shares to raise capital.

	On
	May 5, 2015, ICGL entered into a share exchange agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with FDHG and Wu Jun Rui, on
	behalf of himself and certain other individuals who are to receive shares of ICGL pursuant to the Exchange Agreement (the “Shareholders”).
	On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Exchange Agreement, on May 5, 2015, Wu Jun Rui transferred all 50,000
	shares of FDHG common stock, consisting of all of the issued and outstanding shares of FDHG, to ICGL in exchange for the issuance
	to the shareholders of 59,620,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $.001 per share and 5,000,000 shares of
	the Company’s preferred stock, par value $.001 per share. On February 13, 2017 the Company filed with the Secretary of State
	of the State of Nevada a Certificate of Correction (the “Certificate of Correction”) to correct a mistake made in
	the Company’s original Articles of Incorporation with regard to the preferred stock issued in connection with the Exchange
	Agreement. The Company also entered into an agreement in which the holder of the preferred stock agreed to retire the preferred
	stock in exchange for receiving an equal number of common stock of the Company.




	 




	As
	a result of the closing of the Exchange Agreement, FDHG became the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary. FDHD, through its
	subsidiaries, manufactured and sold “Image Tea”-branded tea products from its tea garden in Yunnan Province.




	 




	On
	or about November 15, 2016, FDHG disposed of its ownership of all operating assets, and as a result ICGL became a shell company,
	as defined by Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act (the “Disposition Event”). The Disposition Event is evidenced by a
	bought and sold note stamped by the Inland Revenue Department of Hong Kong, which we believe is a legally binding document. Because
	ICGL does not currently have any substantial operations, we are currently reviewing potential acquisition targets.




	 







	Results
	of Operations





	 




	As
	a result of the Disposition Event, the Company does not currently have any substantial operations and is a shell company, as such
	term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act. Because of the Disposition Event, the Company has restated our 2015 financial
	statements to reflect accurate comparable financial data between the period ended December 31, 2016, and 2015. As of December
	31, 2016, the Company had accumulated deficits of $59,396,596 due to the substantial losses incurred in operations that have been
	discontinued in 2016, and management’s previous plan to support the Company’s operations and maintain its business
	strategy by raising additional funds through public and private offerings, or loans from related parties, or to rely on officers
	and directors to perform essential functions with minimal compensation was unsuccessful.




	 






	Discontinued
	Operations Nine month Period Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Fiscal year Ended December 31, 2015









	 







	Note
	8 of Notes to the Financial Statements sets forth the financial information of the discontinued operations of the Company, for
	the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. After taking into account the reduced
	time period for reporting the financial information for 2016, from the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 to the nine month period
	ended September 30, 2016, the Company experienced a considerable 77% reduction in net sales, an increase of accrued liabilities
	from $2,321 to $578,799, and a 57% increase in inventories. We attribute these considerably divergent numbers to a lack of focus
	on the part of management of our operating subsidiaries, deterioration in the quality of inventories from water and moisture damage,
	and mismanagement of Company expenses at the operating subsidiary level.

	a result of the Disposition Event, the Company does not currently have any substantial operations and is a shell company, as such
	term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act.

	The
	Company’s operating loss from continuing operations was $51,821,967 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, as compared
	to $7,128,165 for the same period in 2015. This is mostly attributable to a $41,661,015 write-off of subscription receivable,
	as the Company’s management determined that it would no longer pursue payment for shares issued but not yet paid up.




	 







	Liquidity
	and Capital Resources





	 




	The
	Company did not have cash or cash equivalents at December 31, 2016. As a shell company, our operating expenses are minimal, and
	we intend to finance future acquisitions by issuing shares of capital stock of the Company.




	 





	Critical
	Accounting Policies and Estimates





	 




	The
	preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
	our management to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements, including
	the notes thereto, and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies, if any. We consider our critical accounting policies
	to be those that require the more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of financial statements, including the
	following:




	 






	Use
	of Estimates






	 




	In
	preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, management
	makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets
	and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
	reporting years. These accounts and estimates include, but are not limited to, the estimation on useful lives of property, plant
	and equipment. Actual results could differ from those estimates.




	 






	Fair
	Value of Financial Instruments






	 




	For
	certain of the Company’s financial instruments, including cash and equivalents, accounts and other receivables, accounts
	and other payables, accrued liabilities and short-term debt, the carrying amounts approximate their fair values due to their short
	maturities. ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” requires disclosure of the fair value of financial
	instruments held by the Company. ASC Topic 825, “Financial Instruments,” defines fair value, and establishes a three-level
	valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement that enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measures. The
	carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for receivables and current liabilities each qualify as financial instruments
	and are a reasonable estimate of their fair values because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments
	and their expected realization and their current market rate of interest. The three levels of valuation hierarchy are defined
	as follows:




	 






	 




	●




	Level
	1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	Level 2 inputs to
	the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are
	observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	Level 3 inputs to
	the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.






	 




	The
	Company analyzes all financial instruments with features of both liabilities and equity under ASC 480, “Distinguishing Liabilities
	from Equity,” and ASC 815.




	 








	9

	 









	 







	 




	The
	Company’s financial instruments include other receivable, and balances due from and due to related parties. Management estimates
	the carrying amounts of the related party financial instruments approximate their fair values due to their short-term nature.




	 






	Valuation
	of Long-Lived Assets






	 




	The
	Company adopts Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 360, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
	Long-Live Assets”, which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets.
	The Company periodically evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used in accordance with ASC 360 which
	requires impairment losses to be recorded on long-lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and
	the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets’ carrying amounts. In that
	event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair market value of the long-lived assets.




	 




	The
	long-lived assets held and used by the Company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
	that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. It is reasonably possible that these assets could become impaired as
	a result of technology or other industry changes. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is determined by comparing the
	carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the assets.




	 




	If
	such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount
	of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount
	or fair value less costs to sell. During the reporting periods, there was no impairment loss.

	with Sadler on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure.

	Item
	9A. Controls and Procedures.





	 






	Evaluation
	of Disclosure Controls and Procedures






	 




	Disclosure
	controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information we are required to disclose
	is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Commission. Wenchang
	Gu, our Principal Executive Officer and our Principal Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining our disclosure
	controls and procedures.




	 




	Under
	the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial
	Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule
	15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Principal Executive
	Officer and Principal Financial Officer has concluded that, as of December 31, 2016, these disclosure controls and procedures
	were not effective in ensuring that all information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under
	the Exchange Act is: (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission’s
	rule and forms; and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal
	Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.




	 




	The
	term “internal control over financial reporting” is defined as a process designed by, or under the supervision of,
	the registrant’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
	by the registrant’s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
	of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
	accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:




	 






	●




	pertain
	to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of
	the assets of the registrant;






	 




	 






	●




	provide reasonable
	assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
	accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the registrant are being made only in accordance with
	authorizations of management and directors of the registrant; and






	 




	 






	●




	provide reasonable
	assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the registrant’s
	assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.






	 





	Management’s
	Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting





	 




	Our
	management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control
	over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Principal Executive Officer and Principal
	Financial Officer and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding
	the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
	accepted accounting principles.




	 




	The
	framework our management uses to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting is based on the guidance
	provided by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in its 1992 report: INTERNAL CONTROL - INTEGRATED
	FRAMEWORK. Based on our evaluation under the framework described above, our management has concluded that our internal control
	over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2016.




	 








	11

	 









	 







	 




	The
	Company’s internal control over financial reporting is not effective due to a lack of sufficient resources to hire a support
	staff in order to separate duties between different individuals. The Company lacks the appropriate personnel to handle all the
	varying recording and reporting tasks on a timely basis.




	 




	This
	annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company’s registered public accounting firm regarding internal
	control over financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation requirements by the company’s
	registered public accounting firm.




	 





	Inherent
	Limitations over Internal Controls





	 




	ICGL’s
	management does not expect that its disclosure controls or its internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect
	all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
	assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there
	are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent
	limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or
	fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within ICGL have been detected. These inherent
	limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple
	error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people,
	or management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the
	likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all
	potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over
	time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies
	or procedures.




	 




	Our
	disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of that our reports will be accurate. Our Principal
	Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concludes that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective, as
	of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-K. Our future reports shall also indicate that our disclosure controls and procedures
	are designed for this reason and shall indicate the related conclusion by the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial
	Officer as to their effectiveness.




	 






	Changes
	in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting






	 




	There
	have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the last fiscal quarter of 2016 that have materially
	affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

	From
	2006 to the present, Mr. Gu has been the Manager at Fuhai Tea Industrial Ltd., where he developed a tailor-made tea concept that
	became one of the top three daily trade tea products in the Chinese market. From 2013 until the Disposition Event described in
	Item 1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Mr. Gu was the Business Development Manager at Yunnan Image Tea Industrial Ltd., where
	he developed the company’s business. Mr. Gu is the Commerce member of the Guangzhou Fujian Chamber and the committee member
	of Hainan Eaglewood Collection Association.

	Term
	of Office






	 




	All
	directors hold office for a one (1) year period and have been duly elected and qualified. There is no agreement with respect to
	the election of directors. The Company has not compensated its directors for service on the Board of Directors of ICGL or any
	of its subsidiaries or any committee thereof. Any non-employee director of ICGL or its subsidiaries will be reimbursed for expenses
	incurred for attendance at meetings of the Board of Directors and any committee of the Board of Directors, although no such committee
	has been established. Each executive officer of ICGL is appointed by and serves at the discretion of the Board of Directors.




	 




	None
	of the officers or directors of ICGL is currently an officer or director of a company required to file reports with the Securities

	Involvement
	in Certain Legal Proceedings






	 




	To
	our knowledge, no director, nominee for director, or executive officer of the Company has been a party in any legal proceeding
	material to an evaluation of his ability or integrity during the past ten years.




	 





	Board
	Committees





	 






	Audit
	committee






	 




	We
	do not have a separately-designated standing audit committee. The Board of Directors performs the functions of an audit committee,
	but no written charter governs the actions of the Board of Directors when performing the functions that would generally be performed
	by an audit committee. The Board of Directors approves the selection of our independent accountants and meets and interacts with
	the independent accountants to discuss issues related to financial reporting. In addition, the Board of Directors reviews the
	scope and results of the audit with the independent accountants, reviews with management and the independent accountants our annual
	operating results, considers the adequacy of our internal accounting procedures and considers other auditing and accounting matters
	including fees to be paid to the independent auditor and the performance of the independent auditor.




	 






	Compensation
	and Nominations Committees






	 




	We
	currently have no compensation or nominating committee or other board committee performing equivalent functions. Currently, the

	Shareholder
	communications





	 




	The
	Company does not have a process for security holders to send communications to the board of directors due to the fact that minimal
	securities are traded on a stock exchange.




	 





	Code
	of Conduct and Ethics





	 




	We
	have adopted a Code of Ethics, as required by sections 406 and 407 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. It has been filed as an
	Exhibit to our registration statement on Form S-1 on February 5, 2014.

	Compensation






	 





	No
	officer or director has received annual compensation since the inception of the Company. There has been no compensation awarded
	to, earned by, or paid to the named executive officer or director. As we source and acquire performing assets, we hope to generate
	sufficient revenues to hire and begin paying salaries to officers and directors.




	 





	Stock
	option plan





	 




	We
	do not have a stock option plan and we have not issued any warrants, options or other rights to acquire our securities.

	Item
	12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters.





	 






	Beneficial
	Ownership of officers, directors and persons holding more than 5% of any class of ICGL’s voting securities.






	 




	The
	following table sets forth certain information as of the date hereof with respect to the beneficial ownership of our shares of
	common stock by (i) each executive officer and director, (ii) all executive officers and directors as a group, and (iii) beneficial
	owners of 5% or more of the outstanding common stock of the Company. Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the
	rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and generally includes voting or investment power with respect to securities.
	Common stock subject to options, warrants or convertible securities exercisable or convertible within 60 days as of the date hereof
	are deemed outstanding for computing the percentage of the person or entity holding such options, warrants or convertible securities
	but are not deemed outstanding for computing the percentage of any other person and is based on 395,000,000 shares issued and
	outstanding as of April 17, 2017. Unless otherwise indicated, we believe that all persons named in the table have sole voting
	and investment power with respect to all ordinary shares beneficially owned by them. The Company does not maintain any equity
	compensation plans.

	As
	of December 31, 2016, there are no arrangements that would result in a change in control of the Company.





	 









	Item
	13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.





	 





	Related
	Party Transactions





	 




	The
	Company operates its principal office under a sublease with Image Industrial Development Ltd., an entity that owns 20% of the
	issued and outstanding common equity of the Company. Under our sublease, we pay approximately $90.40 per month in rental payments,
	which represents a substantial discount to the prevailing market rental rates for comparable office space.




	 





	Director
	Independence





	 




	We
	adhere to the NASDAQ listing standards in determining whether a director is independent. Our board of directors consults with
	its counsel to ensure that the board’s determinations are consistent with those rules and all relevant securities and other
	laws and regulations regarding the independence of directors. The NASDAQ listing standards define an “independent director”
	as a person, other than an executive officer of a company or any other individual having a relationship which, in the opinion
	of the issuer’s board of directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities
	of a director.




	 




	Consistent
	with these considerations, and considering his position as an executive officer of the Company, we have determined that Mr. Gu
	does not qualify as an independent director. We do not maintain a compensation, nominating or audit committee.

	REPORT
	OF REGISTERED INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM





	 






	To:




	The
	Board of Directors and Stockholders of






	 




	Image
	Chain Group Limited, Inc.






	 




	We
	have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Image Chain Group Limited, Inc. as of December 31, 2016 and 2015
	and the related consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for the
	years then ended. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility
	is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.




	 




	We
	conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
	standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
	free of material misstatement. The company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control
	over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing
	audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness
	of the company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
	examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
	principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.




	 




	In
	our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
	of Image Chain Group Limited, Inc. as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the
	years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.




	 




	The
	accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
	in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company had incurred substantial losses in previous years and has a working capital
	deficit, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regards
	to these matters are also described in Note 3. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from
	the outcome of this uncertainty.




	 




	As
	detailed in Note 1 to the financial statements, during the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company disposed of all its substantial
	operations. Management did not assert that as part of the disposition procedures of such operations that a fair value for those
	assets was obtained by a third-party assessor. It was not clear to us, as auditor, that the management was able to exercise diligence
	on the transaction or the buyer of the discontinued operations.

	Business






	 





	Image
	Chain Group Limited, Inc. (formerly Have Gun Will Travel Entertainment, Inc.) (“ICGL” or the “Company”)
	was incorporated under the laws of Nevada on December 18, 2013. From inception through the date of the Share Exchange as defined
	below, the Company was an emerging forward-thinking full-service television pre-production company dedicated to the creation of
	original concepts and programming with a bold and innovative edge in the reality television space for sale, option and licensure
	to independent producers, cable television networks, syndication companies, and other entities. On June 11, 2015, the Company
	amended its Articles of Incorporation with the State of Nevada in order to change its name to Image Chain Group Limited, Inc.
	and to increase the authorized shares of common stock from 70,000,000 to 400,000,000 (the “Amendments”). The name
	change was undertaken in order to more closely align with the operations of the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Fortune
	Delight Holdings Group Ltd (“FDHG”). The increase in authorized shares was undertaken to allow the Company to utilize
	the newly available shares to raise capital. The board of directors and the stockholders of the Company approved the Amendments
	on May 8, 2015.




	 




	FDHG,
	through its wholly-owned operating subsidiaries, is in the business of promoting and distributing its own branded teas that are
	grown, harvested, cured, and packaged in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”). The Company’s headquarters
	is located in Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, PRC. Currently, the Company’s products are sold in the PRC for domestic consumption.




	 





	Share
	Exchange





	 




	On
	May 5, 2015, ICGL entered into a share exchange agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with FDHG and Wu Jun Rui, on behalf of himself
	and certain other individuals who were to receive shares of ICGL pursuant to the Exchange Agreement (the “Shareholders”). On the
	terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Exchange Agreement, on May 5, 2015, Wu Jun Rui transferred all 50,000 shares
	of FDHG common stock, consisting of all of the issued and outstanding shares of FDHG, to ICGL in exchange for the issuance to
	the shareholders of 59,620,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $.001 per share and 5,000,000 shares of the Company’s
	preferred stock, par value $.001 per share. The preferred stock is not convertible nor mandatorily redeemable; it does not pay
	dividends or carrying any voting rights.




	 




	As
	a result of the closing of the Exchange Agreement, FDHG became the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary. FDHG is an investment
	holding company incorporated and domiciled in the British Virgin Islands. FDHG wholly owns Silver Channel Industrial Limited,
	a limited company incorporated, registered, and domiciled in Hong Kong.




	 




	The
	securities purchase agreement transaction is referred to hereafter as the “reverse-merger transaction.” The share
	exchange transaction has been accounted for as a recapitalization of ICGL where ICGL (the legal acquirer) is considered the accounting
	acquiree and FDGH (the legal acquiree) is considered the accounting acquirer. As a result of this transaction, ICGL is deemed
	to be a continuation of the business of FDDG.




	 




	Accordingly,
	the accompanying consolidated financial statements are those of the accounting acquirer, FDGH. The historical stockholders’
	equity of the accounting acquirer prior to the share exchange has been retroactively restated as if the share exchange transaction
	occurred as of the beginning of the first period presented.




	 





	Organization
	History of Silver Channel Industrial Limited and its subsidiaries






	 





	On
	January 28, 2011, Silver Channel incorporated Heyuan Image Equipment Import Export Co., Ltd. (“Heyuan Image”) as a
	wholly foreign owned enterprise (“WFOE”) registered in Heyuan City, Guangdong Province, PRC. Heyuan Image was dormant
	for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Heyuan Image is wholly owned by Silver Channel. Heyuan Image has a registered capital
	of HKD 4,000,000 of which HKD 3,380,000 has been paid up.

	NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	 




	On
	August 18, 2014, the Company, through its subsidiary Heyuan Image, acquired 100% equity of Guangzhou Image Agricultural Technology
	Co., Ltd. (“Guangzhou Image”). Guangzhou Image is a limited liability company registered in Guangzhou City, Guangdong
	Province, PRC. Guangzhou Image has not yet engaged in operating activities since its incorporation. Guangzhou Image is wholly
	owned by Heyuan Image. Guangzhou Image has a registered capital of RMB 10 million of which is still outstanding.




	 




	On
	February 16, 2015, Guangzhou Image entered into an equity transfer agreement with all the shareholders of Yunnan Image Tea Industry
	Co., Ltd. (“Yunnan Image”). Guangzhou Image paid RMB 3,000,000 to all the shareholders of Yunnan Image for 100% equity
	interest in Yunnan Image. Yunnan Image is a limited liability company registered in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan Province PRC. Yunnan
	Image was incorporated on August 23, 2013. Yunnan Image is the primary operating entity to carry out the Company’s core
	business activities of selling and marketing its own branded teas. Yunnan Image is wholly-owned by Guangzhou Image. Yunnan Image
	had a registered capital of RMB 3 million. The capital has been paid up in its entirety.




	 





	Disposal
	of Silver Channel and its subsidiaries





	 




	On
	or about November 15, 2016, the Company’s subsidiary FDGH disposed of its ownership in Silver Channel which include all
	of the assets and liabilities of Silver Channel, Heiyuan Image, Guangzhou Image, and Yunnan Image. All of the Company’s
	substantial operations were conducted through the above four mentioned subsidiaries. The disposition was carried out by, Zheng
	Zewu, whom is the Director of both FDGH and Silver Channel. Silver Channel was sold to Hong Kong Private Medical Services Limited
	for nominal value as indicated by the bought and sold note stamped by the Inland Revenue Department of Hong Kong. The Company
	recorded a net gain on disposal, as those subsidiaries were a net liability to the Company. The Company did not retain special
	counsel or appraisers to determine a fair value for the disposition of Silver Channel and its subsidiaries. Silver Channel’s
	subsidiaries: Heiyuan Image, Guangzhou Image, and Yunnan Image, which are located in the PRC, were primarily managed by Mr. LinQishui
	whom is the authorized legal representative. It is unclear that the Company’s management would have been able to exercise
	diligence in determining a fair value for the sale of those subsidiaries located in the PRC, as they were primary components of
	the value of Silver Channel. Financial information regarding those subsidiaries were poorly kept and physical assets did not appear
	to be properly safeguarded. Limited inspections of the Company’s inventory indicated significant moisture on its tea products
	which would render their value to be impaired. The Company’s management did not find evidence that the management of the
	PRC subsidiaries made efforts to recover accounts or other receivables and employ proper controls over the Company’s bank
	and cash. Silver Channel was the owner of a luxury motor vehicle with dual license to operate in both in the mainland PRC and
	Hong Kong; there was no evidence to support that the value of the vehicle and the license were included in the determination of
	fair value for Silver Channel at the time it was disposed. Any previous net balances owed to the Company or FDGH by Silver Channel,
	Heiyuan Image, Guangzhou Image, and Yunnan Image have been determined as uncollectible by the Company’s management; accordingly,
	they have been written off.




	 




	As
	of the date of this report, after the disposal of Silver Channel, the Company does not currently have any substantial operations.
	The Company is currently reviewing potential acquisition targets.

	(d)






	Economic
	and Political Risks








	 





	The
	Company’s operations in the PRC are subject to special considerations and significant risks not typically associated with
	companies in North America and Western Europe. These include risks associated with, among others, the political, economic, legal
	environment and foreign currency exchange. The Company’s results may be adversely affected by changes in the political and
	social conditions in the PRC, and by changes in governmental policies with respect to laws and regulations, anti-inflationary
	measures, currency conversion, restriction on international remittances, and rates and methods of taxation, among other things.




	 





	 




	(e)






	Use
	of Estimates







	 




	In
	preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, management
	makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets
	and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
	reporting years. These accounts and estimates include, but are not limited to, the estimation on useful lives of property, plant
	and equipment. Actual results could differ from those estimates.




	 





	 




	(f)






	Cash
	and Cash Equivalents







	 




	Cash
	and cash equivalents include cash in hand and cash in time deposits, certificates of deposit and all highly liquid debt instruments
	with original maturities of three months or less. As of December 31, 2015, cash and cash equivalents were mainly denominated in
	RMB and were placed with banks in the PRC. These cash and cash equivalents may not be freely convertible into foreign currencies
	and the remittance of these funds out of the PRC may be subjected to exchange control restrictions imposed by the PRC government.
	The Company had no cash or cash equivalents in its continuing operations at December 31, 2016.




	 





	 




	(g)






	Accounts
	Receivable







	 




	The
	Company maintains allowances for potential credit losses on accounts receivable. Management reviews the composition of accounts
	receivable and analyzes historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit worthiness, current economic trends and
	changes in customer payment patterns to evaluate the adequacy of these allowances. Terms of sales vary. Allowances are recorded
	primarily on a specific identification basis.




	 




	As
	of December 31, 2015, no provision for allowance for doubtful accounts was provided.

	(h)
	Other receivables





	 




	Other
	receivables are recognized and carried at the original invoice amount less allowance for any uncollectible amounts. An allowance
	for doubtful accounts is made when recovery of the full amount is doubtful.




	 





	(i)
	Inventories





	 




	Inventories
	are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost is computed using the first-in, first-out method and includes all costs
	of purchase and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Market value is determined
	by reference to the sales proceeds of items sold in the ordinary course of business or estimates based on prevailing market conditions.




	 





	(j)
	Property, plant and equipment





	 




	Property
	and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to earnings as incurred; additions, renewals
	and betterments are capitalized. When property and equipment are retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated
	depreciation are removed from the respective accounts, and any gain or loss is included in operations. Depreciation of property
	and equipment is provided using the straight-line method for substantially all assets with estimated lives of:

	(k)
	Accounting for Impairment of Long-Lived Assets





	 




	The
	Company adopts Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 360, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
	Long-Live Assets”, which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets.
	The Company periodically evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used in accordance with ASC 360 which
	requires impairment losses to be recorded on long-lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and
	the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets’ carrying amounts. In that
	event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair market value of the long-lived assets.




	 




	The
	long-lived assets held and used by the Company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
	that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. It is reasonably possible that these assets could become impaired as
	a result of technology or other industry changes. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is determined by comparing the
	carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the assets.




	 




	If
	such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount
	of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount
	or fair value less costs to sell. During the reporting periods, there was no impairment loss.

	advance was received from customers in connection with orders of products to be delivered in future periods.





	 






	(m)
	Revenue Recognition





	 




	The
	Company’s revenue recognition policies are in compliance with Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) 104, included
	in the Codification as ASC 605,

	Revenue Recognition

	. Sales revenue is recognized at the date of shipment to customers when
	a formal arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, the delivery is completed, no other significant obligations of
	the Company exist and collectability is reasonably assured. Payments received before all of the relevant criteria for revenue
	recognition are satisfied are recorded as unearned revenue.




	 




	The
	Company does not allow its customers to return products. The Company’s customers can exchange products only if they are
	damaged in transportation.




	 




	Revenue
	reported is net of value added tax.




	 





	(n)
	Cost of Sales





	 




	The
	Company’s cost of sales is comprised of the inbound acquisition cost of packaged finished goods for resale, inbound shipping,

	Selling
	expenses are comprised of salaries for the sales force, client entertainment, commissions, advertising, and travel and lodging
	expenses.




	 





	(p)
	General & Administrative Expenses





	 




	General
	and administrative expenses include executive compensation, general overhead such as the finance department and administrative
	staff, depreciation, office rental and utilities.




	 





	(q)
	Foreign Currency Translation





	 




	The
	Company maintains its financial statements in the functional currencies on Chinese Renminbi (RMB) and Hong Kong Dollars (“HKD”).
	Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional
	currency at rates of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet dates. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional
	currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchanges rates prevailing at the dates of the transaction. Exchange
	gains or losses arising from foreign currency transactions are included in the determination of net income for the respective
	periods.




	 




	For
	financial reporting purposes, the financial statements of the Company, which are prepared using the functional currency, have
	been translated into United States dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates at the balance sheet dates
	and revenue and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates and stockholders’ equity is translated at historical
	exchange rates. Translation adjustments are not included in determining net loss but are included in foreign exchange adjustment
	to other comprehensive loss, a component of stockholders’ equity.

	The
	Company adopts SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, included in the Codification as ASC 740,

	Income Taxes,

	which
	requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been
	included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences
	in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each period
	end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect
	taxable income. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to
	be realized.




	 




	On
	January 1, 2007, The Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes
	(“FIN 48”), included in the Codification as ASC 740,

	Income Taxes.

	The topic addresses the determination of
	whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under ASC
	740, the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax
	position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits
	recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater
	than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. ASC 740 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification,
	interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures.




	 





	(s)
	Statutory Reserve





	 




	Statutory
	reserve refers to the amount appropriated from the net income in accordance with PRC laws or regulations, which can be used to
	recover losses and increase capital, as approved, and, are to be used to expand production or operations. PRC laws prescribe that
	an enterprise operating at a profit, must appropriate, on an annual basis, from its earnings, an amount to the statutory reserve
	to be used for future company development. Such an appropriation is made until the reserve reaches a maximum equal to 50% of the
	enterprise’s registered capital.




	 





	(t)
	Fair Value of Financial Instruments





	 




	For
	certain of the Company’s financial instruments, including cash and equivalents, accounts and other receivables, accounts
	and other payables, accrued liabilities and short-term debt, the carrying amounts approximate their fair values due to their short
	maturities. ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” requires disclosure of the fair value of financial
	instruments held by the Company. ASC Topic 825, “Financial Instruments,” defines fair value, and establishes a three-level
	valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement that enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measures. The
	carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for receivables and current liabilities each qualify as financial instruments
	and are a reasonable estimate of their fair values because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments
	and their expected realization and their current market rate of interest. The three levels of valuation hierarchy are defined
	as follows:




	 






	 




	●




	Level
	1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.






	 




	 




	 






	  




	●




	Level
	2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs
	that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial
	instrument.






	 




	 




	 






	  




	●




	Level
	3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.

	The
	Company analyzes all financial instruments with features of both liabilities and equity under ASC 480, “Distinguishing Liabilities
	from Equity,” and ASC 815.




	 




	The
	Company’s financial instruments include other receivable, and balances due from and due to related parties. Management estimates
	the carrying amounts of the related party financial instruments approximate their fair values due to their short-term nature.




	 





	(u)
	Other Comprehensive Income





	 




	The
	Company’s functional currency is the Renminbi (“RMB”). For financial reporting purposes, RMB were translated
	into United States Dollars (“USD” or “$”) as the reporting currency. Assets and liabilities are translated
	at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average rate of exchange
	prevailing during the reporting period. Translation adjustments arising from the use of different exchange rates from period to
	period are included as a component of stockholders’ equity as “Accumulated other comprehensive income”. Gains
	and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in income.




	 




	The
	Company uses FASB ASC Topic 220, “Reporting Comprehensive Income”. Comprehensive loss is comprised of net loss and
	all changes to the statements of stockholders’ equity, except for changes in paid-in capital and distributions to stockholders
	due to investments by stockholders.




	 





	(v)
	Business combination





	 




	Business
	combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805,

	Business Combinations.

	Under the acquisition method the acquiring entity in a business combination recognizes 100 percent of the acquired assets
	and assumed liabilities, regardless of the percentage owned, at their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. Any
	excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets and other identifiable intangible assets acquired is recorded as
	goodwill. To the extent the fair value of net assets acquired, including other identifiable assets, exceed the purchase price,
	a bargain purchase gain is recognized. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed from contingencies must also be recognized at fair
	value, if the fair value can be determined during the measurement period. Results of operations of an acquired business are included
	in the statement of earnings from the date of acquisition. Acquisition-related costs, including conversion and restructuring charges,
	are expensed as incurred.





	 






	(w)
	Recent Accounting Pronouncements





	 




	On
	January 5, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01 “Financial Instruments—Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and
	Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities”, which amends the guidance in U.S. GAAP on the classification
	and measurement of financial instruments. Although the ASU retains many current requirements, it significantly revises an entity’s
	accounting related to (1) the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and (2) the presentation of certain
	fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value. The ASU also amends certain disclosure requirements associated
	with the fair value of financial instruments. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those
	fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.




	 




	On
	February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02 “Leases (Topic 842)”, its new standard on accounting for leases.
	ASU 2016-02 introduces a lessee model that brings most leases on the balance sheet. The new standard also aligns many of the underlying
	principles of the new lessor model with those in ASC 606, the FASB’s new revenue recognition standard (e.g., those related
	to evaluating when profit can be recognized).

	NOTES
	TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS





	 




	Furthermore,
	the ASU addresses other concerns related to the current leases model. For example, the ASU eliminates the requirement in current
	U.S. GAAP for an entity to use bright-line tests in determining lease classification. The standard also requires lessors to increase
	the transparency of their exposure to changes in value of their residual assets and how they manage that exposure. The new model
	represents a wholesale change to lease accounting. As a result, entities will face significant implementation challenges during
	the transition period and beyond, such as those related to:




	 






	 




	●




	Applying
	judgment and estimating.






	 




	●




	Managing
	the complexities of data collection, storage, and maintenance.






	 




	●




	Enhancing
	information technology systems to ensure their ability to perform the calculations necessary for compliance with reporting
	requirements.






	 




	●




	Refining
	internal controls and other business processes related to leases.






	 




	●




	Determining
	whether debt covenants are likely to be affected and, if so, working with lenders to avoid violations.






	 




	●




	Addressing
	any income tax implications.






	 




	The
	new guidance will be effective for public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 (e.g., calendar
	periods beginning on January 1, 2019), and interim periods therein.




	 




	On
	March 15, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07 “Investments—Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Simplifying
	the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting”, which simplifies the equity method of accounting by eliminating the
	requirement to retrospectively apply the equity method to an investment that subsequently qualifies for such accounting as a result
	of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence. Consequently, when an investment qualifies for the equity
	method (as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence), the cost of acquiring the additional
	interest in the investee would be added to the current basis of the investor’s previously held interest and the equity method
	would be applied subsequently from the date on which the investor obtains the ability to exercise significant influence over the
	investee. The ASU further requires that unrealized holding gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income related to
	an available-for-sale security that becomes eligible for the equity method be recognized in earnings as of the date on which the
	investment qualifies for the equity method.




	 




	The
	guidance in the ASU is effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods
	within those fiscal years; early adoption is permitted for all entities. Entities are required to apply the guidance prospectively
	to increases in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence occurring after the ASU’s effective date. Additional
	transition disclosures are not required upon adoption.




	 




	On
	March 17, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent
	Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)”, which amends the principal-versus-agent implementation guidance and
	illustrations in the Board’s new revenue standard (ASU 2014-09). The FASB issued the ASU in response to concerns identified
	by stakeholders, including those related to (1) determining the appropriate unit of account under the revenue standard’s
	principal-versus-agent guidance and (2) applying the indicators of whether an entity is a principal or an agent in accordance
	with the revenue standard’s control principle. Among other things, the ASU clarifies that an entity should evaluate whether
	it is the principal or the agent for each specified good or service promised in a contract with a customer. As defined in the
	ASU, a specified good or service is “a distinct good or service (or a distinct bundle of goods or services) to be provided
	to the customer.” Therefore, for contracts involving more than one specified good or service, the entity may be the principal
	for one or more specified goods or services and the agent for others.




	 




	The
	ASU has the same effective date as the new revenue standard (as amended by the one-year deferral and the early adoption provisions
	in ASU 2015-14). In addition, entities are required to adopt the ASU by using the same transition method they used to adopt the
	new revenue standard.

	NOTES
	TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS





	 




	On
	March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09 “Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee
	Share-Based Payment Accounting”, which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions
	for both public and nonpublic entities, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding
	requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning
	after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those annual reporting periods.




	 




	On
	August 26, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)”. Stakeholders indicated that
	there is diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of
	cash flows under Topic 230, Statement of Cash Flows, and other Topics. This Update addresses eight specific cash flow issues with
	the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. The amendments in this Update are effective for public business
	entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is
	permitted, including adoption in an interim period. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments
	should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. An entity that elects early adoption
	must adopt all of the amendments in the same period. As a result, the Company has elected to early adopt this Update prospectively.
	As of December 31, 2016 and prior periods retrospective adjustments have not been applied.




	 




	As
	of December 31, 2016, except for the above, there are no recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted that would have
	a material effect on the Company’s financial statements.




	 





	(x)
	Contingencies





	 




	Certain
	conditions may exist as of the date the consolidated financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to the Company
	but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company’s management assesses
	such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies
	related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company or un-asserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the
	Company’s management evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or un-asserted claims as well as the perceived
	merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought.




	 




	If
	the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability
	can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. If the
	assessment indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but
	cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable
	and material would be disclosed.




	 




	Loss
	contingencies considered to be remote by management are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case
	the guarantee would be disclosed.




	 











	3.






	GOING
	CONCERN UNCERTAINTIES







	 




	These
	financial statements have been prepared assuming that Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization
	of assets and the discharge of liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future.




	 




	As
	of December 31, 2016, and 2015 (restated), the Company had accumulated deficits of $59,396,596 and 8,783,563 due to the substantial
	losses incurred in operations that have been discontinued in 2016. There was substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability
	to continue as going concern at December 31, 2016, and management’s previous plan to support the Company’s operations
	and maintain its business strategy by raising additional funds through public and private offerings, or loans from related parties,
	or to rely on officers and directors to perform essential functions with minimal compensation was unsuccessful.

	NOTES
	TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS





	 




	If
	the Company does not raise additional money via public or private offerings or related party loans, the Company may be unable
	to continue as going concern. Additional financing may not become available on acceptable terms and there can be no assurance
	that any additional financing that the Company does obtain will be sufficient to meet its needs in the long term.




	 




	The
	accompanying financial statements have been adjusted to the expected recoverable amounts. Management believes no further adjustments
	for recoverability and classification of assets or liabilities are necessary.

	INCOME
	TAX







	 




	The
	Company is subject to US Income taxes.




	 




	The
	Company’s subsidiary Fortune Delight Holdings Group Limited was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands. The British
	Virgin Islands is an income tax free jurisdiction.




	 




	Silver
	Channel, the Company former indirectly subsidiary was incorporated in Hong Kong and is subject to the Inland Revenue Ordinance
	of Hong Kong. Hong Kong adopted a uniform tax rate of 16.5% for all enterprises.




	 




	The
	Company’s former indirectly held subsidiaries that were incorporated in the PRC and are governed by the Income Tax Law of
	the PRC and various local income tax laws. Effective January 1, 2008, China adopted a uniform tax rate of 25% for all enterprises
	including foreign-invested enterprises.




	 




	For
	the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company has not provided for income tax provision as it incurred substantial net
	operating loss during the years.




	 




	The
	Company’s management did not recognize any deferred tax assets at December 31, 2016 and 2015, as a result of the substantial
	net operating losses during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 because the management was unable to determine when it
	would be able to generate taxable income to make use of such potential future tax assets.

	The
	values presented above are management presentation of the consolidated financial position and results of operations at September
	30, 2016. Management believes these values approximate the value of Silver Channel and its subsidiaries at the date of disposal.
	Those figures are unaudited and they are presented assuming that they will continue as going concerns. No adjustments for fair
	value, as no appraiser or valuator was hired, or liquidation value have been applied to those amounts.

	NOTES
	TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS






	 








	9.






	CORRECTION
	OF ERROR








	 





	The
	Company determined that other receivable, accrued liabilities, sales, and selling expenses were overstated for the year ended
	December 31, 2015, and accumulated deficit was understated for that same period. As a result of the figures at December 31, 2015
	and for the year then ended being reclassified and restated as a result of the discontinuance of operations during 2016 material
	figures are presented in a narrative format, as part of continuing operations, as follows: Other receivable, accrued liabilities,
	sales, selling, general and administrative expenses were previously recorded as: $2,038,105, $375,065, $151,777, and $5,572,120
	but have been adjusted to be $0, $28,479, $0, and $5,447,189, respectively. Accumulated deficit was increased by $1,680,977. The
	reason for the adjustment is that the Company recorded the funds received by a third party on the Company’s behalf, and
	related liability, for the commissions payable related to the sale of its shares. The funds were not received by the Company,
	but instead paid to the managers of the Company’s prior PRC subsidiaries. Upon discovery of this error, management has determined
	that the gross amount of these funds should be netted against commission expenses accrued as liabilities, and the expected net
	proceeds that were received by the managers of the PRC subsidiaries are no longer recoverable and should be written to the Company’s
	results of operations in 2015. The impact of the Company’s loss per share was an additional loss of $0.01.





	 








	10.






	LOSS
	ON SUBSCRIPTION RECEIVABLE







	 




	The
	Company’s management determined that it would no longer pursue payment for shares issued but not yet paid up that have been
	accounted for as the equity contra-account subscription receivable. Accordingly, the Company has charged the remaining unpaid
	balance of $41,661,015 to its result from operations for the year ended December 31, 2016.




	 









	11.






	SUBSEQUENT
	EVENT







	 




	On
	February 13, 2017, Xinyuan Yang, whom was transferred the right to the 5,000,000 shares of the Company's preferred stock that
	was originally entitled to Mr. Wu Jun Rui from the share exchange between the Company and FDGH and Mr. Wu, entered into an agreement
	with the Company to exchange his right to the preferred stock for common shares of the Company's stock.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  Cautionary Statements  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q ("Form 10-Q") may contain "forward-looking statements," as that term is used in federal securities laws, about Image Chain Group Limited, Inc. and its financial condition, results of operations and business. These statements include, among others:  ? statements concerning the potential benefits that Image Chain Group Limited, Inc. ("ICGL," "we," "our," "us," the "Company," "management") may experience from its business activities and certain transactions it contemplates or has completed; and  ? statements of ICGL's expectations, beliefs, future plans and strategies, anticipated developments and other matters that are not historical facts. These statements may be made expressly in this Form 10-Q. You can find many of these statements by looking for words such as "believes," "expects," "anticipates," "estimates," "opines," or similar expressions used in this Form 10-Q. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties that may cause ICGL's actual results to be materially different from any future results expressed or implied by ICGL in those statements. The most important facts that could prevent ICGL from achieving its stated goals include, but are not limited to, the following:  (a) volatility or decline of ICGL's stock price;  (b) potential fluctuation of quarterly results;  (c) failure of ICGL to earn revenues or profits;  (d) inadequate capital to continue or expand its business, and inability to raise additional capital or financing to implement its business plans;  (e) decline in demand for ICGL's products and services;  (f) rapid adverse changes in markets;  (g) litigation with or legal claims and allegations by outside parties against ICGL, including but not limited to challenges to ICGL's intellectual property rights; and  (h) insufficient revenues to cover operating costs.  There is no assurance that ICGL will be profitable, be able to successfully develop, manage or market its products and services, be able to attract or retain qualified executives and personnel, be able to obtain customers for its products or services, additional dilution in outstanding stock ownership may be incurred due to the issuance of more shares, warrants and stock options, or the exercise of outstanding warrants and stock options, and other risks inherent in ICGL's businesses.  Because the statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. ICGL cautions you not to place undue reliance on the statements, which speak only as of the date of this Form 10-Q. The cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section should be considered in connection with any subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements that ICGL or persons acting on its behalf may issue. ICGL does not undertake any obligation to review or confirm analysts' expectations or estimates or to release publicly any revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Form 10-Q, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.  Overview  The Company was incorporated under the laws of Nevada on December 18, 2013. From inception through the date of the Exchange Agreement as defined below, the Company was an emerging forward-thinking full-service television pre-production company dedicated to the creation of original concepts and programming with a bold and innovative edge in the reality television space for sale, option and licensure to independent producers, cable television networks, syndication companies, and other entities.  On May 5, 2015, ICGL entered into a share exchange agreement (the "Exchange Agreement") with Fortune Delight Holdings Group Ltd., a British Virgin Islands corporation ("FDHG") and Wu Jun Rui, on behalf of himself and certain other individuals who are to receive shares of ICGL ("Shareholders") pursuant to the Exchange Agreement. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Exchange Agreement, on May 5, 2015, Wu Jun Rui transferred all 50,000 shares of FDHG common stock, consisting of all of the issued and outstanding shares of FDHG to ICGL. In exchange for the transfer of such securities by Wu Jun Rui, ICGL issued, to the Shareholders, 59,620,000 shares of the Company's common stock, par value $.001 per share and 5,000,000 shares of the Company's preferred stock, par value $.001 per share.  As a result of the closing of the Exchange Agreement, FDHG became the Company's wholly owned subsidiary. FDHG is the parent company of Silver Channel Industrial Ltd., a Hong Kong company, which, in turn, holds 100% equity interest of Heyuan Image Machinery Import and Export Co., Ltd., a PRC corporation ("Heyuan Image"). Heyuan Image, through Guangzhou Image Agricultural Technology Ltd., a PRC corporation, owns 100% of Yunnan Image Tea Industrial Ltd. ("YITIL"). ICGL, through its wholly-owned operating subsidiaries, is in the business of promoting and distributing its owned branded teas that are grown, harvested, cured, and packaged in the People's Republic of China ("PRC").  The Company's headquarters is located in Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, PRC. Currently, the Company's products are sold in the PRC for domestic consumption.  On June 11, 2015, the Company changed its name to Image Chain Group Limited, Inc. in order to more closely align it with the company's current business.  Results of Operations  Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2015  The Company recognized $197,282 in sales revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to $113,872 for the three months ended June 30, 2015, representing an approximately increase of 73%. The change in the amount of sales revenue is a result of recovery from the Chinese economy downturn.  For the three months ended June 30, 2016, the Company recognized cost of sales of $290,513 as compared to $33,325 for the same period in 2015, representing an approximately 772% increase. The principal reason for this increase is due to the increase in sales.  For the three months ended June 30, 2016, the Company recorded operating expenses totaling $403,296, an approximately 92% decrease comparing to operating $4,993,560 for the three months ended June 30, 2015. This increase in operating expenses is primarily due to the decrease in general and administrative expenses.  As a result of the factors discussed above, the Company's net loss was $496,305 for the three months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to net loss of $4,903,907 during the three months ended June 30, 2015. The primary reason for the change is the decrease of operating expenses.  Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2015  The Company recognized $298,501 in sales revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to $222,893 for the six months ended June 30, 2015, representing an increase of approximately 33.9%. The change in the amount of sales revenue is a result of prospering overall Chinese economy.  For the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company recognized cost of sales of $323,793 as compared to $87,727 for the same period in 2015, representing a 269% increase. The principal reason for this increase is the increase in sales.  For the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company recorded operating expenses totaling $532,843, an approximately 89.5% decrease comparing to those of $5,083,114 for the six months ended June 30, 2015. This decline in operating expenses was primarily caused by the decrease in general and administrative expenses.  As a result of the factors discussed above, the Company's net loss was $511,277 for the six months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to net loss of $4,965,715 during the six months ended June 30, 2015. The reason for the change was primarily due to the decrease of operating expenses.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  The Company's cash and cash equivalents were $65,908 on June 30, 2016, as compared to $78,753 on December 31, 2015. As of June 30, 2016, the Company had total current assets of $3,797,357 and total current liabilities of $2,715,654 respectively, compared to $3,985,108 and $2,886,137 as of December 31, 2015. Net working capital was $1,081,703 on June 30, 2016 as compared to net working capital of $1,098,971 on December 31, 2015.  Net cash used in operating activities amounted to $362,875 for the six months ended June 30, 2016, as compared to net cash used from operating activities $1,908,654 for the six months ended June 30, 2015.  There was net cash of $522 used in investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and $201,718 of net cash used in investing activities in the six months ended June 30, 2015.  On an on-going basis, we may take steps to identify and plan our needs for liquidity and capital resources and to fund our day-to-day business operations. Our future capital expenditures will include, among others, expanding our product portfolios, conducting large scale long term marketing campaigns, and making acquisitions as deemed appropriate.  Based on our current plans for the next 12 months, we anticipate that the sales of the Company's tea products will be the primary organic source of funds for future operating activities in 2016. However, to fund continued expansion of our operations and extend our reach to broader markets, and to acquire additional entities, as we may deem appropriate, we may raise capital through public or private offerings. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain such funding on acceptable terms, if at all.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires our management to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements, including the notes thereto, and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies, if any. We consider our critical accounting policies to be those that require the more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of financial statements, including the following:  Use of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  The Company's financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, prepaid expenses, payables and accrued expenses. Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information about the financial instrument. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision. We consider the carrying values of our financial instruments in the consolidated financial statements to approximate fair value, due to their short-term nature.  Property and Equipment  Property and equipment are recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided for using straight-line methods over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, usually three to seven years.  Valuation of Long-Lived Assets  We periodically evaluate long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. If the estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) from the use of an asset were less than the carrying value, a write-down would be recorded to reduce the related asset to its estimated fair value. We do not believe that there has been any impairment to long-lived assets as of June 30, 2016 and 2015.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  (See "Recent Accounting Pronouncements" in Note 2 (w) of Notes to the Financial Statements.)  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.  Nov 14, 2016  (c) 1995-2016 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

 Image Chain Group Limited, Inc. (OTCMKTS:ICGL) Files An 8-K Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement

Item 1.02 Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.


On May 1, 2017, Image Chain Group Limited, Inc., a Nevada
corporation (ICGL or the Company), entered into a Termination of
Share Exchange Agreement (the Termination Agreement), by which
the Company, Image Convenience Store Management Limited, a
company registered under the laws of the British Virgin Islands
(ICSML), and Wang Fa Sung, the sole shareholder of ICSML (the
Seller) agreed to terminate that certain Share Exchange
Agreement, dated February 14, by and between the Company, ICSML
and the Seller (the Agreement) to Section 9.1(a) of the
Agreement.


Under the Agreement, the Company agreed to acquire one share of
ICSML, representing 100% of ICSMLs issued and outstanding stock,
from the Seller in exchange for the issuance of 200,000,000
shares of the Companys common stock (the Exchange), after giving
effect to a 1-for-100 reverse stock split and other transactions
provided for in the Agreement. After further review of the due
diligence materials related to the Exchange, the new management
of the Company felt that it was in the Companys best interest to
terminate the Agreement. The Agreement includes no penalties
material to the Company which result from the termination of the
Agreement.


The foregoing description of the Termination Agreement is a
summary only and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
full text of such document, filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1 and
incorporated herein by reference. Similarly, the foregoing
description of the Agreement is a summary only and is qualified
in its entirety by reference to the full text of such document,
filed with the SEC on February 14, 2017, and is incorporated
herein by reference.


Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers;
Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers;
Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.


Resignation of sole director and corporate
officer


On May 1, 2017, Wenchang Gu resigned from his positions as sole
director, president, CEO, treasurer and secretary of the Company.
The resignation was not the result of any disagreement with the
Company on any matter related to the Companys operations,
policies or practices. Because Mr. Gu was the sole director and
officer of the Company, the resignation was effected by a joint
board consent executed by Mr. Gu and the Appointed Directors (as
defined herein) on May 1, 2017 (the Board Consent), and ratified
by written consent of the stockholders of the Company on the same
date.


Appointment of directors


On May 1, 2017, the Companys board of directors and stockholders
approved, each by written consent, the appointment of Mr. David
Po and Mr. Kevin Lai (the Appointed Directors).


Mr. Po, 54, has a distinguished career in international business.
From 2003 until the date of this Current Report on Form 8-K, Mr.
Po served as President of Everbest Real Estate Services, a
marketing and sales company serving the Japanese, Chinese and
Hong Kong markets for a major U.S.-based residential,
multi-family, industrial and commercial real estate development
company. From 1998 to 2003, Mr. Po specialized in real estate
sales for a California real estate company. Mr. Po was raised in
California and received a bachelor of science degree from the
University of California, San Diego.


Mr. Lai, 35, is an investment analyst for Funde Asset Management
(Hong Kong) Co., Ltd., and he served ICGL from 2015 to 2016 as a
marketing manager. From 2009 to 2015, Mr. Lai served as
administrative director for Shanghai HuaPeng Explosion-proof
Technology Co., Ltd. (HuaPeng), a Shanghai-based company
specializing in safe transportation, storage and delivery of
flammable and hazardous materials. At HuaPeng, Mr. Lai focused on
operations and external relations.


Appointment of officers


to the Board Consent, the Company also appointed Mr. Po as the
Companys president, CEO, treasurer and secretary, to serve on an
at-will basis until he resigns or is removed by the Companys
board of directors. Owing to the urgency created by the
resignation of Mr. Gu as corporate officer of the Company, Mr. Po
and the Company have agreed to negotiate an employment agreement
in good faith at a date subsequent to the date of his appointment
as corporate officer. Mr. Po was selected based on his background
and history of transacting deals between Asia and western
countries, namely the United States. The Company believes that
Mr. Po possesses the attributes necessary to create value for
ICGL stockholders by way of sourcing and executing acquisitions
of high quality assets located in the Peoples Republic of China
and the greater Asia region.

	We
	have reviewed the accompanying interim consolidated balance sheets of Image Chain Group Limited, Inc. (the “Company”)
	as of September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, and the related statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the three
	and nine month periods ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, and the statements of cash flows for the nine month periods ended September
	30, 2015 and 2014. These interim consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management.




	 




	We
	conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). A review
	of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible
	for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards
	of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial
	statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.




	 




	Based
	on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying interim consolidated financial
	statements for them to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

	ORGANIZATION
	AND PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES








	 






	Business






	 





	Image
	Chain Group Limited, Inc. (formerly Have Gun Will Travel Entertainment, Inc.) (“ICGL” or the “Company”)
	was incorporated under the laws of Nevada on December 18, 2013. From inception through the date of the Share Exchange as defined
	below, the Company was an emerging forward-thinking full-service television pre-production company dedicated to the creation of
	original concepts and programming with a bold and innovative edge in the reality television space for sale, option and licensure
	to independent producers, cable television networks, syndication companies, and other entities. On June 11, 2015, the Company
	amended its Articles of Incorporation with the State of Nevada in order to change its name to Image Chain Group Limited, Inc.
	and to increase the authorized shares of common stock from 70,000,000 to 400,000,000 (the “Amendments”). The name
	change was undertaken in order to more closely align with the operations of the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Fortune
	Delight Holdings Group Ltd (“FDHG”). The increase in authorized shares was undertaken to allow the Company to utilize
	the newly available shares to raise capital. The board of directors and the stockholders of the Company approved the Amendments
	on May 8, 2015.




	 




	FDHG,
	through its wholly-owned operating subsidiaries, is in the business of promoting and distributing its own branded teas that are
	grown, harvested, cured, and packaged in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”). The Company’s headquarters
	is located in Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, PRC. Currently, the Company’s products are sold in the PRC for domestic consumption.




	 





	Share
	Exchange





	 




	On
	May 5, 2015, ICGL entered into a share exchange agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with FDHG and Wu Jun Rui, on
	behalf of himself and certain other individuals who were to receive shares of ICGL pursuant to the Exchange Agreement (the “Shareholders”).
	On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Exchange Agreement, on May 5, 2015, Wu Jun Rui transferred all 50,000
	shares of FDHG common stock, consisting of all of the issued and outstanding shares of FDHG, to ICGL in exchange for the issuance
	to the shareholders of 59,620,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $.001 per share and 5,000,000 shares of
	the Company’s preferred stock, par value $.001 per share

	.



	 




	As
	a result of the closing of the Exchange Agreement, FDHG became the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary. FDHG is an investment
	holding company incorporated and domiciled in the British Virgin Islands. From inception through March 24, 2015, the Company did
	not engage in any active business operations other than in search and evaluation of potential business opportunity to become an
	acquiree of a reverse-merger deal.




	 





	Reverse-Merger






	 





	On
	March 24, 2015, FDHG entered into a securities purchase agreement with Mr. Wu, Jun Rui and Mr. Wu, Ping as beneficial owners whereby
	FDHG issued 50,000 common shares to its shareholders as consideration for the Company’s reverse-merger with Silver Channel
	Industrial Limited.




	 




	The
	securities purchase agreement transaction is referred to hereafter as the “reverse-merger transaction.” The share
	exchange transaction has been accounted for as a recapitalization of FDHG where FDHG (the legal acquirer) is considered the accounting
	acquiree and Silver Channel Industrial Limited (the acquiree) is considered the accounting acquirer. As a result of this transaction,
	FDHG is deemed to be a continuation of the business of Silver Channel Industrial Limited.




	 




	Accordingly,
	the accompanying consolidated financial statements are those of the accounting acquirer, Silver Channel Industrial Limited. The
	historical stockholders’ equity of the accounting acquirer prior to the share exchange has been retroactively restated as
	if the share exchange transaction occurred as of the beginning of the first period presented.

	Co., Ltd. (“Guangzhou Image”). Guangzhou Image is a limited liability company registered in Guangzhou City, Guangdong
	Province, PRC. Guangzhou Image has not yet engaged in operating activities since its incorporation. Guangzhou Image is wholly
	owned by Heiyuan Image. Guangzhou Image has a registered capital of RMB 10 million of which is still outstanding.

	Co., Ltd. (“Yunnan Image”). Guangzhou Image paid RMB 3,000,000 to all the shareholders of Yunnan Image for 100% equity
	interest in Yunnan Image. Yunnan Image is a limited liability company registered in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan Province PRC. Yunnan
	Image was incorporated on August 23, 2013. Yunnan Image is the primary operating entity to carry out the Company’s core
	business activities of selling and marketing its own branded teas. Yunnan Image is wholly-owned by Guangzhou Image. Yunnan Image

	Economic
	and Political Risks







	 




	The
	Company’s operations in the PRC are subject to special considerations and significant risks not typically associated with
	companies in North America and Western Europe. These include risks associated with, among others, the political, economic, legal
	environment and foreign currency exchange. The Company’s results may be adversely affected by changes in the political and
	social conditions in the PRC, and by changes in governmental policies with respect to laws and regulations, anti-inflationary
	measures, currency conversion, restriction on international remittances, and rates and methods of taxation, among other things.




	 






	 





	(e)






	Use
	of Estimates







	 




	In
	preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, management
	makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets
	and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
	reporting years. These accounts and estimates include, but are not limited to, the estimation on useful lives of property, plant
	and equipment. Actual results could differ from those estimates.




	 






	 





	(f)






	Cash
	and Cash Equivalents







	 




	Cash
	and cash equivalents include cash in hand and cash in time deposits, certificates of deposit and all highly liquid debt instruments
	with original maturities of three months or less. As of September 30, 2015, cash and cash equivalents were mainly denominated
	in RMB and were placed with banks in the PRC. These cash and cash equivalents may not be freely convertible into foreign currencies
	and the remittance of these funds out of the PRC may be subjected to exchange control restrictions imposed by the PRC government.




	 






	 





	(g)






	Accounts
	Receivable







	 




	The
	Company maintains allowances for potential credit losses on accounts receivable. Management reviews 	the composition of accounts
	receivable and analyzes historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit worthiness, current economic trends and
	changes in customer payment patterns to evaluate the adequacy of these allowances. Terms of sales vary. Allowances are recorded
	primarily on a specific identification basis.




	 




	As
	of September 30, 2015, no provision for allowance for doubtful accounts was provided.




	 






	 





	(h)






	Other
	receivables








	 





	Other
	receivables are recognized and carried at the original invoice amount less allowance for any uncollectible amounts. An allowance
	for doubtful accounts is made when recovery of the full amount is doubtful.

	(i)






	Inventories







	 




	Inventories
	are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost is computed using the first-in, first-out method and includes all costs
	of purchase and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Market value is determined
	by reference to the sales proceeds of items sold in the ordinary course of business or estimates based on prevailing market conditions.




	 






	 





	(i)






	Property,
	plant and equipment







	 




	Property
	and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to earnings as incurred; additions, renewals
	and betterments are capitalized. When property and equipment are retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated
	depreciation are removed from the respective accounts, and any gain or loss is included in operations. Depreciation of property
	and equipment is provided using the straight-line method for substantially all assets with estimated lives of:

	(k)






	Accounting
	for Impairment of Long-Lived Assets








	 





	The
	Company adopts Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 360, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
	Long-Live Assets”, which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets.
	The Company periodically evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used in accordance with ASC 360 which
	requires impairment losses to be recorded on long-lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and
	the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets’ carrying amounts. In that
	event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair market value of the long-lived assets.




	 




	The
	long-lived assets held and used by the Company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
	that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. It is reasonably possible that these assets could become impaired as
	a result of technology or other industry changes. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is determined by comparing the
	carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the assets.




	 




	If
	such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount
	of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount
	or fair value less costs to sell. During the reporting periods, there was no impairment loss.




	 






	 





	(l)






	Revenue
	Recognition








	 





	The
	Company’s revenue recognition policies are in compliance with Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) 104, included
	in the Codification as ASC 605,

	Revenue Recognition

	. Sales revenue is recognized at the date of shipment to customers when
	a formal arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, the delivery is completed, no other significant obligations of
	the Company exist and collectability is reasonably assured. Payments received before all of the relevant criteria for revenue
	recognition are satisfied are recorded as unearned revenue.




	 




	The
	Company does not allow its customers to return products. The Company’s customers can exchange products only if they are
	damaged in transportation.




	 




	Revenue
	reported is net of value added tax.

	The
	Company’s cost of sales is comprised of the inbound acquisition cost of packaged finished goods for resale, inbound shipping,
	value added tax and business taxes recognized upon sales of goods.

	General

	(p)






	Foreign
	Currency Translation







	 




	The
	Company maintains its financial statements in the functional currencies on Chinese Renminbi (RMB) and Hong Kong Dollars (“HKD”).
	Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional
	currency at rates of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet dates. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional
	currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchanges rates prevailing at the dates of the transaction. Exchange
	gains or losses arising from foreign currency transactions are included in the determination of net income for the respective
	periods.




	 




	For
	financial reporting purposes, the financial statements of the Company, which are prepared using the functional currency, have
	been translated into United States dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates at the balance sheet dates
	and revenue and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates and stockholders’ equity is translated at historical
	exchange rates. Translation adjustments are not included in determining net loss but are included in foreign exchange adjustment
	to other comprehensive loss, a component of stockholders’ equity.

	Income
	Taxes







	 




	The
	Company adopts SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, included in the Codification as ASC 740,

	Income Taxes,

	which
	requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been
	included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences
	in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each period
	end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect
	taxable income. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to
	be realized.

	NOTES
	TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS





	 




	On
	January 1, 2007, The Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes
	(“FIN 48”), included in the Codification as ASC 740,

	Income Taxes.

	The topic addresses the determination of
	whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under ASC
	740, the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax
	position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits
	recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater
	than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. ASC 740 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification,
	interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures.

	Statutory
	Reserve








	 





	Statutory
	reserve refers to the amount appropriated from the net income in accordance with PRC laws or regulations, which can be used to
	recover losses and increase capital, as approved, and, are to be used to expand production or operations. PRC laws prescribe that
	an enterprise operating at a profit, must appropriate, on an annual basis, from its earnings, an amount to the statutory reserve
	to be used for future company development. Such an appropriation is made until the reserve reaches a maximum equal to 50% of the
	enterprise’s registered capital.

	Fair
	Value of Financial Instruments








	 





	For
	certain of the Company’s financial instruments, including cash and equivalents, accounts and other receivables, accounts
	and other payables, accrued liabilities and short-term debt, the carrying amounts approximate their fair values due to their short
	maturities. ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” requires disclosure of the fair value of financial
	instruments held by the Company. ASC Topic 825, “Financial Instruments,” defines fair value, and establishes a three-level
	valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement that enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measures. The
	carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for receivables and current liabilities each qualify as financial instruments
	and are a reasonable estimate of their fair values because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments
	and their expected realization and their current market rate of interest. The three levels of valuation hierarchy are defined
	as follows:




	 






	 




	●




	Level
	1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	Level
	2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs
	that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial
	instrument.






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	Level
	3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.






	 




	The
	Company analyzes all financial instruments with features of both liabilities and equity under ASC 480, “Distinguishing Liabilities
	from Equity,” and ASC 815.




	 




	The
	Company’s financial instruments include cash and equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable. Cash and cash equivalents
	consist deposits financial institutions with original maturities of three months or less. Management estimates the carrying amounts
	of the non-related party financial instruments approximate their fair values due to their short-term nature.

	Other
	Comprehensive Income







	 




	The
	Company’s functional currency is the Renminbi (“RMB”). For financial reporting purposes, RMB were translated
	into United States Dollars (“USD” or “$”) as the reporting currency. Assets and liabilities are translated
	at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average rate of exchange
	prevailing during the reporting period. Translation adjustments arising from the use of different exchange rates from period to
	period are included as a component of stockholders’ equity as “Accumulated other comprehensive income”. Gains
	and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in income.




	 




	The
	Company uses FASB ASC Topic 220, “Reporting Comprehensive Income”. Comprehensive loss is comprised of net loss and
	all changes to the statements of stockholders’ equity, except for changes in paid-in capital and distributions to stockholders
	due to investments by stockholders.





	 







	 





	(u)






	Business
	combination







	 




	Business
	combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805,

	Business Combinations.

	Under the acquisition method the acquiring entity in a business combination recognizes 100 percent of the acquired assets
	and assumed liabilities, regardless of the percentage owned, at their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. Any
	excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets and other identifiable intangible assets acquired is recorded as
	goodwill. To the extent the fair value of net assets acquired, including other identifiable assets, exceed the purchase price,
	a bargain purchase gain is recognized. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed from contingencies must also be recognized at fair
	value, if the fair value can be determined during the measurement period. Results of operations of an acquired business are included
	in the statement of earnings from the date of acquisition. Acquisition-related costs, including conversion and restructuring charges,
	are expensed as incurred.

	Recent
	Accounting Pronouncements







	 




	In
	August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, “Disclosure of Uncertainties About an Entity’s Ability to Continue as
	a Going Concern” (“ASU 2014-15”), which requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an
	entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued and provides
	guidance on determining when and how to disclose going concern uncertainties in the financial statements. Certain disclosures
	will be required if conditions give rise to substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern.
	ASU 2014-15 applies to all entities and is effective for annual and interim reporting periods ending after December 15, 2016,
	with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on the
	Company’s financial statements.

	NOTES
	TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS





	 




	In
	November 2014, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-16, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Determining Whether the
	Host Contract in a Hybrid Financial Instrument Issued in the Form of a Share Is More Akin to Debt or to Equity (a consensus of
	the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force).The amendments permit the use of the Fed Funds Effective Swap Rate (also referred to as the
	Overnight Index Swap Rate, or OIS) as a benchmark interest rate for hedge accounting purposes. Public business entities are required
	to implement the new requirements in fiscal years (and interim periods within those fiscal years) beginning after December 15,
	2015. All other types of entities are required to implement the new requirements in fiscal years beginning after December 15,
	2015, and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2014-16 to have material
	impact on the Company’s financial statement.




	 




	In
	January 2015, The FASB issued ASU No. 2015-01, “Income Statement—Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20)”.This
	Update eliminates from GAAP the concept of extraordinary items. Subtopic 225-20, Income Statement—Extraordinary and Unusual
	Items, required that an entity separately classify, present, and disclose extraordinary events and transactions. Presently, an
	event or transaction is presumed to be an ordinary and usual activity of the reporting entity unless evidence clearly supports
	its classification as an extraordinary item. Paragraph 225-20-45-2 contains the following criteria that must both be met for extraordinary
	classification:




	 






	 




	1.




	Unusual
	nature. The underlying event or transaction should possess a high degree of abnormality and be of a type clearly unrelated
	to, or only incidentally related to, the ordinary and typical activities of the entity, taking into account the environment
	in which the entity operates.






	 




	 




	 






	 




	2.




	Infrequency
	of occurrence. The underlying event or transaction should be of a type that would not reasonably be expected to recur in the
	foreseeable future, taking into account the environment in which the entity operates.






	 




	If
	an event or transaction meets the criteria for extraordinary classification, an entity is required to segregate the extraordinary
	item from the results of ordinary operations and show the item separately in the income statement, net of tax after income from
	continuing operations. The entity also is required to disclose applicable income taxes and either present or disclose earnings-per-share
	data applicable to the extraordinary item.




	 




	The
	amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December
	15, 2015. A reporting entity may apply the amendments prospectively. A reporting entity also may apply the amendments retrospectively
	to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. Early adoption is permitted provided that the guidance is applied
	from the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The effective date is the same for both public business entities and all other
	entities.




	 




	In
	September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16, the guidance eliminates the requirement to restate prior period financial statements
	for measurement period adjustments following a business combination. The new guidance requires that the cumulative impact of a
	measurement period adjustment (including the impact on prior periods) be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment
	is identified. The prior period impact of the adjustment should be either presented separately on the face of the income statement
	or disclosed in the notes. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the pronouncement will have on the Company’s consolidated
	financial statements.

	TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS





	 






	 





	(w)






	Contingencies







	 




	Certain
	conditions may exist as of the date the consolidated financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to the Company
	but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company’s management assesses
	such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies
	related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company or un-asserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the
	Company’s management evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or un-asserted claims as well as the perceived
	merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought.




	 




	If
	the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability
	can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. If the
	assessment indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but
	cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable
	and material would be disclosed.




	 




	Loss
	contingencies considered to be remote by management are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case
	the guarantee would be disclosed.




	 







	3.






	GOODWILL







	 




	Goodwill
	represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable assets acquired in a business
	combination. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 350, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”, goodwill is no longer
	subject to amortization. Rather, goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment, applying a fair-value based
	test. Fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis.




	 




	On
	February 16, 2015, the Company, through Guangzhou Image, entered into an equity transfer agreement to acquire 100% of Yunnan Image.
	As of December 31, 2014, the net assets of Yunnan Image were USD 166,022. The purchase consideration was USD 489,515 (equivalent
	to RMB 3,000,000), which resulted in goodwill of USD 323,493.

	RISKS
	CONCENTRATION








	 





	For
	the period ended September 30, 2015, a majority of the Company’s revenue was generated from one customer, which accounted
	for 11% of total sales.




	 




	For
	the period ended September 30, 2015, the Company had one major supplier in procuring tea. Payment in form of advances were paid
	to the supplier as part of its procurement process. This is due in part to the Company’s development of its product portfolio
	specifically for Pu’er tea, which is grown and harvested in Yunnan Province, PRC. As the Company expands its product portfolio
	to incorporate other teas, it expects to source different teas from different suppliers in different geographic areas in the PRC.





	 








	12.






	SEGMENT
	INFORMATION







	 




	For
	nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, all revenues of the Company represented the net sales of Pu’er tea products.
	No financial information by business segment is presented. Furthermore, as all revenues are derived from the PRC, no geographic
	information by geographical segment is presented.

	Cautionary
	Statements





	 




	This
	Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”) may contain “forward-looking statements,” as that term is
	used in federal securities laws, about Image Chain Group Limited, Inc.’s financial condition, results of operations and
	business. These statements include, among others:




	 





	 


	●



	statements
	concerning the potential benefits that Image Chain Group Limited, Inc. (“ICGL,” “we,” “our,”
	“us,” the “Company,” “management”) may experience from its business activities and certain
	transactions it contemplates or has completed; and

	statements
	of ICGL’s expectations, beliefs, future plans and strategies, anticipated developments and other matters that are not
	historical facts. These statements may be made expressly in this Form 10-Q. You can find many of these statements by looking
	for words such as “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” “opines,”
	or similar expressions used in this Form 10-Q. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks
	and uncertainties that may cause ICGL’s actual results to be materially different from any future results expressed

	but are not limited to, the following:






	 





	 



	(a)




	volatility
	or decline of ICGL’s stock price;





	 



	(b)




	potential
	fluctuation of quarterly results;





	 



	(c)




	failure

	adverse changes in markets;





	 



	(g)




	litigation
	with or legal claims and allegations by outside parties against ICGL, including but not limited to challenges to ICGL’s
	intellectual property rights;





	 



	(h)




	insufficient
	revenues to cover operating costs;






	 




	There
	is no assurance that ICGL will be profitable, ICGL may not be able to successfully develop, manage or market its products and
	services, ICGL may not be able to attract or retain qualified executives and personnel, ICGL may not be able to obtain customers
	for its products or services, additional dilution in outstanding stock ownership may be incurred due to the issuance of more shares,
	warrants and stock options, or the exercise of outstanding warrants and stock options, and other risks inherent in ICGL’s
	businesses.




	 




	Because
	the statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by
	the forward-looking statements. ICGL cautions you not to place undue reliance on the statements, which speak only as of the date
	of this Form 10-Q. The cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section should be considered in connection with
	any subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements that ICGL or persons acting on its behalf may issue. ICGL does
	not undertake any obligation to review or confirm analysts’ expectations or estimates or to release publicly any revisions
	to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Form 10-Q, or to reflect the
	occurrence of unanticipated events.




	 





	Overview





	 




	Image
	Chain Group Limited, Inc. (formerly Have Gun Will Travel Entertainment, Inc.) (“ICGL” or the “Company”)
	was incorporated under the laws of Nevada on December 18, 2013. From inception through the date of the Exchange Agreement as defined
	below, the Company was an emerging forward-thinking full-service television pre-production company dedicated to the creation of
	original concepts and programming with a bold and innovative edge in the reality television space for sale, option and licensure
	to independent producers, cable television networks, syndication companies, and other entities.




	 




	On
	May 5, 2015, ICGL entered into a share exchange agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with Fortune Delight Holdings
	Group Ltd., a British Virgin Islands corporation (“FDHG”) and Wu Jun Rui, on behalf of himself and certain other individuals
	who are to receive shares of ICGL (“Shareholders”) pursuant to the Exchange Agreement. On the terms and subject to
	the conditions set forth in the Exchange Agreement, on May 5, 2015, Wu Jun Rui transferred all 50,000 shares of FDHG common stock,
	consisting of all of the issued and outstanding shares of FDHG to ICGL. In exchange for the transfer of such securities by Wu
	Jun Rui, ICGL issued, to the Shareholders, 59,620,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $.001 per share and
	5,000,000 shares of the Company’s preferred stock, par value $.001 per share.




	 









	 



	21



	 









	 


	 


	 







	 




	As
	a result of the closing of the Share Exchange Agreement, FDHG became the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary. FDHG is the
	parent company of Silver Channel Industrial Ltd., a Hong Kong company, which, in turn, holds 100% equity interest of Heyuan Image
	Machinery Import and Export Co., Ltd., a PRC corporation (“Heyuan Image”). Heyuan Image, through Guangzhou Image Agricultural
	Technology Ltd., a PRC corporation, owns 100% of Yunnan Image Tea Industrial Ltd. (“YITIL”). ICGL, through its wholly-owned
	operating subsidiaries, is in the business of promoting and distributing its owned branded teas that are grown, harvested, cured,
	and packaged in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”).




	 




	The
	Company’s headquarters is located in Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, PRC. Currently, the Company’s products are sold
	in the PRC for domestic consumption.




	 




	On
	June 11, 2015, the Company changed its name to Image Chain Group Limited, Inc. in order to more closely align with its current
	business.




	 





	Results
	of Operations





	 






	Three
	Months Ended September 30, 2015 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2014







	 





	The
	Company recognized $37,490 in sales revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2015, as compared to $5,500 for the three
	months ended September 30, 2014. The material change in the amount of sales revenue is a result of the Company’s commencement
	of the operation in the business of promoting and distributing its own brand teas in 2015.




	 




	For
	the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recognized cost of sales of $44,173 as compared to $0 for the same period
	in 2014. The Company initially began delivering the tea products during the period; accordingly, the cost of sales increased significantly.




	 




	Gross
	loss was $6,683 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 as compared to gross profit of $5,500 for the same period in 2014.




	 




	For
	the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded operating expenses totaling $1,404,295 which was comprised of
	selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company’s operating expenses was mainly attributable to the salary and
	wages. For the three months ended September 30, 2014, our operating expenses were $14,133, which consisted of basic general and
	administrative expenses. Our increase in operating expenses is primarily due to the Company’s commencement of the operation
	in 2015.




	 




	As
	a result of the factors discussed above, the Company’s net loss was $1,411,008 for the three months ended September 30,
	2015, as compared to a net loss of $8,633 during the three months ended September 30, 2014.






	 








	Nine
	Months Ended September 30, 2015 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2014







	 





	The
	Company recognized $260,383 in sales revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, as compared to $24,000 for the nine
	months ended September 30, 2014. The Company began delivering products for orders previously placed in 2014 and new orders placed
	during the first six months of 2015. The material change in the amount of sales revenue is a result of the Company’s commencement
	of operations in addition to the initial availability of finished products, namely pu-er tea, that was made available for delivery
	to customer against orders placed in 2014. The Company had previously received advances from customers for tea dating back to
	2014.




	 




	For
	the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recognized cost of sales of $131,900 as compared $0 to the same period in
	2014. The Company initially began delivering substantial amounts of tea products during the period; accordingly, the cost of sales
	increased significantly and materially from zero.

	the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded operating expenses totaling $6,487,409 which was comprised of selling,
	general and administrative expenses. The Company’s operating expenses included $4,681,819 of non-cash stock compensation
	expenses. For the nine months ended September 30, 2014, our operating expenses were $27,506, which consisted of basic general
	and administrative expenses. The increase in operating expenses is primarily due to the issuance of stock compensation for marketing
	and consulting services rendered by outside service providers.




	 




	Gross
	profit was $128,483 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 as compared to gross profit of $24,000 for the same period in
	2014.

	a result of the factors discussed above, the Company’s net loss was $6,349,819 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015,
	as compared to a net loss of $3,506 during the nine months ended September 30, 2014.

	Liquidity
	and Capital Resources





	 




	The
	Company’s cash and cash equivalents were $136,150 at September 30, 2015, as compared to $70,107 at December 31, 2014. The
	increase in cash was due to the issuance of new shares. As of September 30, 2015, the Company had current assets of $4,696,023
	and current liabilities of $4,309,127, respectively, compared to $800,570 and $1,610,654 as of December 31, 2014. Net working
	capital of was $386,896 at September 30, 2015 as compared to net capital deficit of $810,084 at December 31, 2014. The Company’s
	net working capital increased primarily from an increase in advanced to suppliers, inventories and other receivables and partly
	offset by an increase in customer advance.




	 




	Net
	cash used in operating activities amounted to $7,459,101 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, as compared to $7,323 for
	the nine months ended September 30, 2014. The substantial change in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to the
	commencement of our operations in the business of promoting and distributing its own brand teas in 2015.




	 




	There
	was net cash of $215,967 used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and $4,346 of net cash
	used in investing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2014. Cash used in investing activities was for purchase of
	property plant and equipment.




	 




	There
	was net cash of $7,745,884 provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and $37,600 for the nine
	months ended September 30, 2014. This increase was due to the sale and issuance of restricted shares by the Company to certain
	investors in a private placement in 2015.




	 




	On
	an on-going basis, we may take steps to identify and plan our needs for liquidity and capital resources, to fund our operations
	and day to day business operations. Our future capital expenditures will include, among others, expanding our product portfolio,
	large scale long term marketing campaigns, and making acquisitions as deemed appropriate.




	 




	Based
	on our current plans for the next 12 months, we anticipate that the sales of the Company’s tea products will be the primary
	organic source of funds for future operating activities in 2015. However, to fund continued expansion of our operation and extend
	our reach to broader markets, and to acquire additional entities, as we may deem appropriate, we may raise capital through public
	or private offerings. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain such funding on acceptable terms, if at all.




	 





	Critical
	Accounting Policies and Estimates





	 




	The
	preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires
	our management to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements, including
	the notes thereto, and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies, if any. We consider our critical accounting policies
	to be those that require the more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of financial statements, including the
	following:




	 





	Use
	of Estimates





	 




	The
	preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
	requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
	of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
	during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.




	 





	Fair
	Value of Financial Instruments





	 




	The
	Company’s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, prepaid expenses, payables and
	accrued expenses, Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information about the financial
	instrument. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore
	cannot be determined with precision. We consider the carrying values of our financial instruments in the consolidated financial
	statements to approximate fair value, due to their short-term nature.




	 





	Property
	and Equipment





	 




	Property
	and equipment are recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided for using straight-line methods over
	the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, usually three to seven years.



	 








	 



	23



	 









	 


	 


	 







	 





	Valuation
	of Long-Lived Assets






	 





	We
	periodically evaluate long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
	value of an asset may not be recoverable. If the estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) from
	the use of an asset were less than the carrying value, a write-down would be recorded to reduce the related asset to its estimated
	fair value. We do not believe that there has been any impairment to long-lived assets as of September 30, 2015 and 2014.

	Evaluation
	of Disclosure Controls and Procedures






	 




	The
	Company is currently developing a set of disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be
	disclosed by the Company in the reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
	within the time periods specified by the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls are also designed with the objective
	of ensuring that this information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including the Company’s
	chief executive officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.




	 




	Pursuant
	to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, the Company carried out an evaluation with the participation of the Company’s
	management, including the Company’s chief executive officer, of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls
	and procedures (as defined under Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the quarter ended September 30, 2015. Based upon
	that evaluation, the Company’s chief executive officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures
	were ineffective; however, the Company is taking steps to remediate the deficiency. As noted above the Company is currently developing
	a set of disclosure controls and procedures and considering engaging outside service providers to provide expertise on this matter.




	 






	Changes
	in Internal Control over Financial Reporting






	 




	We
	will begin to regularly review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our processes and systems
	to improve controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes
	may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, consolidating activities, migrating processes, and consulting
	with outside experts. 




	 




	There
	have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2015 that have materially
	affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 




	 






	Inherent
	Limitations over Internal Controls






	 




	ICGL’s
	management does not expect that its disclosure controls or its internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect
	all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
	assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there
	are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent
	limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or
	fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within ICGL have been detected. These inherent
	limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple
	error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people,
	or management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the
	likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under
	all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks.
	Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with
	policies or procedures.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
