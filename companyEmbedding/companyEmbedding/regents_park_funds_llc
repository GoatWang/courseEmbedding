					Third District Court of Appeal State of Florida Opinion filed July 20, 2016. Not final until disposition of timely filed motion for rehearing. ________________ No. 3D16-529 Lower Tribunal No. 15-18141 ________________ Regents Park Investments, LLC, Appellant, vs. Bankers Lending Services, Inc., Appellee. An appeal from a non-final order from the Circuit Court for Miami-Dade County, John Schlesinger, Judge. Arnaldo Velez, P.A. and Arnaldo Velez, for appellant. Garbett, Allen & Roza, P.A. and David S. Garbett and B. Elizabeth Interthal, for appellee. Before SUAREZ, C.J., and WELLS and SALTER, JJ. SUAREZ, C.J. Appellant Regents Park Investments, LLC (“Regents”) appeals an Order discharging a lis pendens which it recorded on certain parcels of real property in connection with its suit for specific performance. We reverse. Regents was the buyer and Appellee Bankers Lending Services, Inc. (“Bankers”) was the seller in a contract for five parcels of land in Miami-Dade County. The sales contract was amended with eight addenda. Addendum Number 2 contained an agreement that any liens and claims would not render the title unmarketable or preclude closing and that instead the parties could escrow funds from the proceeds pending release of the liens. Paragraph 7 of Addendum Number 8 provided the option to escrow $50,000 at closing until resolution of the liens. Paragraph 7 also required the escrow agreement to be acceptable to Old Republic National Title Insurance Co., Regents’ title insurer. The Old Republic National Title Insurance Company Commitment required lot clearing liens to be released, but did not provide for escrow in lieu of the release of those liens. It is undisputed that the properties in question were encumbered with lot clearing liens in favor of the City of Miami. Bankers attempted to obtain release of the existing lot clearing liens by way of a suit against the lienholders. Bankers eventually entered into a settlement agreement with the lienholders under which it paid an agreed amount for release of the liens. The parties to that action also agreed to a joint stipulation and proposed order for release of the liens. The joint stipulation and proposed order were submitted to the court for approval and signature, but, as of the date of the closing, the stipulation had not been approved and the final order had not been signed by the trial court. 2 In light of the fact that the order was unsigned and the lot clearing liens were, therefore, still in place, Bankers was willing to have $50,000 of the purchase price placed into escrow at the closing and communicated that willingness to Regents. Bankers also attempted to establish a time for the closing of the sale. However, Old Republic Insurance Company was unwilling to agree to the escrow arrangement in lieu of release of the liens, so Regents did not proceed with the closing. After the date for closing lapsed, Bankers sent Regents a notice stating that it had been ready willing and able to close on the closing date and that Regents, as buyer, had failed to close. Shortly thereafter, Regents filed the present suit for specific performance and recorded the lis pendens at issue here. After discovery was undertaken, Bankers moved to discharge the lis pendens. After hearing on the motion, the trial court granted the motion for discharge. In its oral ruling the trial court stated that the correct standard for the trial court to use was “….the one that’s articulated in the Golden Shores1 case []. Under the circumstances, there’s a colorable case In Golden Shores Properties, LLC. v. Santopietro, 792 So. 2d 644 (Fla. 3d DCA 2001), this Court cited the language of Florida Statute Section 48.23(3) which states that when an action is not founded on a duly recorded instrument “the court shall control and discharge the recorded notice of lis pendens as the court would grant and dissolve injunctions.” Relying on that language this Court stated that that at a hearing on the motion to dissolve, “the party seeking the injunction [] has the burden of establishing a prima facie case to support the injunctive relief.” Golden Shores, 792 So. 2d at 645. With respect to the statutory language, the Florida supreme court stated in Chiusolo v. Kennedy, 614 So. 2d 491 (Fla. 1993): [T]he statutory reference to injunctions exists merely to 1 3 certainly, but I don’t think clear and convincing evidence has been presented to the court sufficient to overcome the motion to discharge or dissolve the lis pendens.” The trial court then dissolved the lis pendens. Regents argues, and we agree, that clear and convincing was not the proper standard for the trial court to use. However, the proper standard of proof is not entirely obvious under existing case law. Therefore, we must first examine what is the proper standard. As stated in Chiusolo v. Kennedy, 614 So. 2d 491 (Fla. 1993), a “lis pendens cannot be dissolved if, in the evidentiary hearing on request for discharge, the proponent can establish a fair nexus between the apparent legal or equitable ownership of the property and the dispute embodied in the lawsuit. . . . The relevant question is whether alienation of the property or the imposition of intervening liens, if either actually occurred, conceivably could disserve the purpose for which lis pendens exists.” Id. at 492. The question in this case is how that “fair nexus” can be shown and what burden of proof the proponent of the lis pendens bears. On this issue the court in Chiusolo stated only that “the quantum of proof necessary” was not “as severe” as the substantial likelihood on the merits standard which had been imposed by the permit property holders to ask in an appropriate case that the plaintiff post a bond where needed to protect the former from irreparable harm. Id. at 493. That language clarifies that the burden of proof is not actually clear and convincing evidence, as indicated by the trial court. 4 Fifth Circuit in its ruling. Id. at n. 2. In addition, in Acapulco Construction, Inc. v. Redavo Estates, Inc., 645 So. 2d 182 (Fla. 3d DCA 1994) this Court held that the burden was not “the greater weight of the evidence.” See also Christian v. Sanderhoff, 731 So. 2d 804, 805 (Fla. 4th DCA 1999). In Nu-Vision, LLC v. Corporate Convenience, Inc., 965 So. 2d 232 (Fla. 5th DCA 2007) the Court addressed a claim in which a tenant/proponent of a lis pendens sought review of an order granting discharge where it claimed to have an option to purchase the real property which was the subject of its lease and of an eviction action against it. In upholding the discharge order, the Court there stated: [E]stablishing a ‘fair nexus’ between a claim in litigation and the property’s title requires a little more than simply pleading a theoretical nexus. To establish a fair nexus requires the showing of a good faith, viable claim. In this case, [tenant] cannot make that showing because the December 16, 2004 letter cannot support an action for specific performance as a matter of law. *** [W]ith respect to the specific performance count, we find that the complaint fails to state a cause of action, and could not therefore support a finding of a ‘fair nexus’ as a matter of law. *** In our view, [] Chiusolo simply left unanswered the question as to the quantum of proof required of a lis pendens proponent to succeed in defending against a motion to dissolve the lis pendens. The Court stated only that ‘the burden of proof rests on the proponent’ and that the ‘quantum of proof is not as severe as’ the substantial 5 likelihood of success on the merits standard necessary to maintain a temporary injunction under Florida law. The Court would not have needed to place the burden of proof on either party if there was nothing to prove – which would be the case if any allegation in a pleading that states a theoretical connection to the title in real property was sufficient to maintain a lis pendens throughout the litigation. In our view, it would also be contrary to sound public policy to allow a lis pendens proponent to tie up real property belonging to another person when the proponent cannot even make a minimal showing that there is at least some basis for the underlying claim. And requiring the proponent to show that he or she has a good faith basis to allege facts supporting a claim and that the facts alleged would at least state a viable claim, if true, is completely consistent with Chiusolo. . . . For these reasons, we have elected to follow the definition of ‘fair nexus’ adopted by the Third and Fourth Districts after Chiusolo, which requires the proponent to demonstrate a good faith, viable claim. Id. at 234-236. Citing similar language Bankers argues that because the proponent of a lis pendens must make an evidentiary showing of “a good faith, viable claim” Regents was required to establish that its claim for specific performance was “viable” -i.e. that it could establish all the necessary elements of that claim – at the hearing on the motion for discharge. We think Bankers goes too far because such a standard would have required Regents to fully prove its underlying claim in a preliminary “mini trial.” 6 As this Court stated in Invego Auto Parts, Inc. v. Rodriguez, 34 So. 3d 103, 105 (Fla. 3d DCA 2010): In order to invoke the remedy of specific performance, . . . . the plaintiff must prove that ‘as a condition precedent to specific performance it either paid the contract sum; tendered it; was ready willing and able to do so; or was excused from so doing.’ [internal citations omitted] In the case below, the parties disagree about whether Regents can satisfy any one of the four alternative means of proving the condition precedent. Bankers alleges that Regents cannot prove any of the alternatives and Regents argues that the evidence will show (once fully developed and once the matter is ripe for trial) that it was either ready, willing and able to close or that it was excused from doing so. As this case demonstrates, it is impracticable to require a proponent of a lis pendens to fully prove each element of its claim in an evidentiary hearing where the case has not been noticed for trial and the parties may not even have completed discovery. Consequently, we agree with the Court in Nu-Vision, that to establish a “fair nexus” between the plaintiff’s claim and the property or properties subject to a lis pendens by way of a “good faith, viable claim,” the proponent of the lis pendens must make “a minimal showing that there is at least some basis for the underlying claim [a]nd … show that he or she has a good faith basis to allege facts supporting a claim and that the facts alleged would at least state a viable claim.” Nu-Vision, 965 So. 2d at 236. 7 This is essentially the standard applied in Eurohome di Soleil, LLC v. The Oaks Group, Inc., 912 So. 2d 1271 (Fla. 4th DCA 2005), where the parties disagreed about the timing of a deposit due under the contract. In finding that the lis pendens was proper, the court there stated: [a]lthough it may turn out that the parties intended that the second deposit was to be made in five days, the contract fails to specify when the second deposit is to be delivered. The court accordingly erred in dissolving the lis pendens on the ground that the buyer was in default, at this stage of the proceeding. Id. at 1272. Other cases in which that minimal burden has been established include Von Mitschke-Collande v. Kramer, 869 So. 2d 1246 (Fla. 3d DCA 2004), where heirs showed that funds acquired through a breach of trust were used to purchase the property at issue and so demonstrated a potential constructive trust in the specified property, and J.B.J. Investment of South Florida, Inc. v. Maslanka, 163 So. 3d 726, 728 (Fla. 5th DCA 2015), where the proponent of the lis pendens presented “substantial evidence” which demonstrated that the subject property was intended to be included in a mortgage or that it was entitled to an equitable lien on the property. There are many cases in which the proponent of the lis pendens has been found unable to meet even the minimal burden described in Nu-Vision. For example, in Blue Star Palms, LLC v. LED Trust, LLC, 128 So. 3d 36 (Fla. 3d DCA 2012) the court declined to enforce the lis pendens because the claims 8 alleged were against a subsidiary corporation and not the condominiums subject to the lis pendens. As the court there stated: A complaint which will not support a claim against the specific property at issue cannot provide a basis for tying it up by a filing of notice of lis pendens. … When a plaintiff can be afforded complete relief on a claim without reference to the title to the real property, a lis pendens cannot be maintained. Under the Florida cases a lis pendens is proper only when the required relief might specifically affect the property in question. [internal citations and quotations omitted]. Id. at 38-39. See also, Nobe Bay Holdings, LLC v. Garcia, 140 So. 3d 693 (Fla. 3d DCA 2014) (holding the claim was unprovable because the plaintiff had agreed to limit his claim to money damages); India America Trading Co. v. White, 896 So. 2d 859 (Fla. 3d DCA 2005) (finding claim for specific performance was unprovable because it was based on an oral contract which was unenforceable under the statute of frauds). Applying the standard of a minimal showing that there is at least some basis for the underlying claim and a good faith basis to allege facts that would at least state a viable claim, we conclude that Regents met that standard. Regents’ showing that its claims arose out of a written contract for sale of the subject properties established a “fair nexus” to the properties and its Interrogatory answers swearing that it was ready, willing and able to close on the closing date, together with evidence that Bankers was not able to close because of the outstanding lot clearing liens against the property, 9 provided a sufficient minimal basis to support either a claim that Regents could have performed or that its performance was excused. Consequently, we find that the trial court should not have discharged the lis pendens and reverse with instructions that it be reinstated. We add that this opinion concerns solely the issue of the discharge of the lis pendens. We do not address, nor should it be inferred that we have reached any conclusion about, Regents’ ultimate ability to sustain its claim for specific performance. These are two entirely different issues. Reversed and remanded with instructions to reinstate the lis pendens. 10

Urban Exposure and Namos Capital Complete £5m Residential Development Funding



Share Article

















Urban Exposure and Namos Capital have completed the £5m funding of a residential development in Regents Park, London. The funds have been provided as junior debt on an 18 month term, with the senior debt provided by Close Brothers.






London (PRWEB UK)
6 October 2011
 Urban Exposure and Namos Capital have completed the £5m funding of a residential development in Regents Park, London. The funds have been provided as junior debt on an 18 month term, with the senior debt provided by Close Brothers.
The project will involve the complete refurbishment of a Grade I listed Nash residence of circa. 7,000 square feet and adjoining mews, with direct frontage onto the park. The project will be carried out by a market leading Prime Central London developer.
Randeesh Sandhu heads Urban Exposure’s Mezzanine lending operation, and has 10 years of experience in UK property, providing expert knowledge on all aspects of residential investment and development:
“We are optimistic about market prospects in London and the South East.  London has totally different drivers to the rest of UK and many other cities internationally. We work only with developers with an established track record of delivering saleable product and profit.” 
Randeesh recognises the importance of supporting prospective developers in the current market, and the provision of mezzanine lending demonstrates their commitment to the residential sector: “raising development finance is still difficult in the UK and throws up opportunities for lenders such as ourselves,” said Randeesh Sandhu. “We aim to bridge the gap between the senior debt ratios available in the market, and developer equity. We use our extensive experience to underwrite projects, but also work with developers to achieve the best from a site. We aim to be a partner, not just a lender.”
Jason Meads, Managing Partner at Namos Capital comments:
“We are pleased to have invested in this transaction on behalf of our clients. We have committed to the London Super-Prime residential market as a key area for investment for our clients. The prime end of the London residential market is set to see strong growth over the next few years as it cements its position as a global “safe haven” destination. We are delighted to have invested into this deal with Urban Exposure and are now looking for further opportunities in this space for our investors.”
Urban Exposure Ltd
Urban Exposure is a property investment, lending and development company, established in 2002. The directors of Urban Exposure are experienced in all aspects of property lending, structured finance, property development, and property sales and marketing. 
Urban Exposure established a mezzanine lending arm in 2009, and is fast growing a reputation as one of the key lenders of residential development finance in the market. Urban Exposure has excellent relationships with developers, senior debt lenders, solicitors and estate agents, and concentrates on projects in Prime Central London and the South East, partnering only with developers with established track records.
Namos Capital
Namos Capital is a boutique London based property investment management firm, headed by Jason Meads (ex Patron Capital) and Mark Hamilford (Intermark Savills). The firm focuses on investing equity into the London market from HNW Russian/CIS individuals into mezzanine finance, residential development and investment grade offices.

The U.S. Housing and Urban Development’s Choice Neighborhoods, a $122 million program meant to revitalize certain neglected communities in Boston, Chicago, New Orleans, San Francisco and Seattle, has awarded $30.5 million to Chicago’s Woodlawn community.
According to Crain’s Chicago Business, the Boston-based non-profit real estate developer will use the funds to redevelop Grove Parc Plaza, a 12-acre,  Section 8 housing community built in the 1960s along South Cottage Grove. The existing distressed 504 housing units will be completely demolished and replaced with on-site or nearby mixed-income apartments. The developer will expand the former Grove Parc site by adding 420 new, green housing units that would create Woodlawn Park, a healthier mixed-use community. The redevelopment will also benefit from 95,000 square feet of retail and community space along the South Cottage Grove Avenue corridor.
In other South Side residential news, a two-tower apartment community, located at 5020- 5050 S. Lake Shore Drive was purchased by Englewood, N.J.-based Antheus Capital LLC for an undisclosed amount, informs ChicagoRealEstateDaily.com. However, according to sources quoted by the website, the sales price could range from $160 million to $170 million.
Regents Park, a 1,031-unit lakefront property next to Hyde Park, was completed in 1972 and overlooks Lake Michigan and Burnham Park to the east and Harold Washington Park to the south. The building was bought in 2005 by Miami-based developer Crescent Heights for $128 million. The two apartment towers, which are currently 95 percent occupied, offer rents ranging from $1,202 for a studio to $2,581 for a four-bedroom unit. However, ChicagoRealEstateDaily.com notes that after renovating the community, Antheus Capital might increase rents.

PhosphonicS, a UK-based developer of precious metal scavenger products, has raised £3.5 million in second-round funding. Seventure Partners led the round, and was joined by return backers like Regents Park Partners. PhosphonicS is a spinout from Queen Mary University of London.
PRESS RELEASE
PhosphonicS, a spin out from Queen Mary University of London which uses proprietary chemistry to make novel materials has secured second round financing of £3.5m (US$5.75m).
·        The investment was led by Seventure Partners with additional participation from existing backers Regents Park Partners, a LBS venture capital fund, and private investors.
·        The new capital will be used principally to fund the global market development of a range of precious metal catalyst recovery products. Currently these extremely expensive metals such as platinum, rhodium and palladium are lost in dilute, low parts per million waste streams.
·        PhosphonicS new precious metal scavenger products make economic recovery of these valuable metals possible thereby eliminating waste and improving process economics.
Oxford, 13th April 2010 – Phosphonics announced today that it has received an additional £3.5m (US$5.75m) million funding.
This new capital will allow the company to expand its core team, accelerate the launch of the precious metal scavenger product range in numerous international markets, and continue the development of further industrial applications based on the company’s proprietary chemistry to make functionalised silicas. 





 
This second round funding was led by pan-European venture capital firm Seventure Partners. This is the first time that Seventure has invested in the UK.  Existing investors participated in the round.
“The success of this funding round is a great vote of confidence in our unique technology and the dedication and enthusiasm of the team that has been developing since the company was spun out of Queen Mary University of London,” said David Astles, PhosphonicS’ CEO.
“Our most recent results from successful plant scale trials clearly demonstrate the potential of our technology and have caught the interest of customers and potential partners throughout our target markets. We are very excited by the prospects and look forward to building the precious metal recovery business and new applications for our materials.”
Nick Cross, Chairman, said “With this new financing we will be able to accelerate the commercial development of our proprietary functional silica chemistry platform. It is very encouraging to have secured investment from a new value-add investor, such as Seventure when venture capital funding in the UK is so very scarce.”
Seventure General Partner, Isabelle de Cremoux, said “PhosphonicS is an exciting company based around a novel chemistry platform. The company has already sold its scavengers commercially. With technology and market potential already validated through customer traction, PhosphonicS represents a compelling investment opportunity for us in the Cleantech area. PhosphonicS is Seventure’s first investment in the UK and we look forward to working with David and other members of this entrepreneurial executive team.” 





Iain Wilcock of Seventure will join PhosphonicS’ Board of Directors. Wilcock comes to PhosphonicS with extensive experience of Healthcare and Cleantech investing. He has previously served as a non-executive director of a number of companies, including Avidex, Oxxon Therapeutics, Xention, and Vivacta. He also represents Seventure on the Board of BiancaMed, Dublin.

Regents Park Business Funding & Business Finance







Do you run a small business 
                in 
                Regents Park
                and need to obtain funding?
            
Making sure that your new venture has 
                sufficient funding in the early stages is critical 
                and there are a number of money based subjects that 
                you need to consider. 
            




Do You Need Funds To Start Your Business?

It wasn't that long ago that borrowing from your bank, friends, or relatives were pretty much the only available options if you need to raise money to start your business. How times have changed!
                
While some high street banks are still an option for a robust proposition with match funding or the security of the equity in your home, many start-ups have found that traditional bank overdrafts and loan facilities are no longer a realistic hope.
Thankfully, a whole new world of 'alternative funding' is emerging. You may or may not have heard (apparently 95% of UK businesses survey haven't) of equity based crowd funding, reward based crowd funding, peer-to-peer lending, pension-led funding, invoice trading, debt-based securities business angels and private investing (as seen on TV's Dragon's Den).
The government also recognises that start-ups can play their part in the economy as potential tax payers and employers hence the introduction of the  Start Up Loan Company. This fund allows you to apply for up to £25,000 per person - Find out more
Grants - some areas do have grants available to aid new businesses. They tend to be location and/or sector dependent but a fanstatic boost for anyonee who qualifies.
 The only problem now is knowing which of these is likely to be best for you! To help yoiu decide, we have created the following free funding report...





 

Free Funding Report
 If you need to raise some money for your new or existing business and would like to know what options are open to you (without any obligation), please complete and submit this simple form.
We will also send you a FREE guide which explains all of these 'new' funding choices in simple English.

Leasing For Business 

                Who Are Leasing For Business? Leasing For Business have been involved in leasing and asset finance for 19 years, and have a portfolio of funders who want to lend, rather than banks who don’t!

What Is Leasing? Leasing is an alternative line of credit. Leasing is a tax based funding option, which allows businesses to acquire equipment at an agreed fixed cost for an agreed fixed term.

Who Can Lease Equipment? Lease finance is a Business to Business Funding Product. Whether you are a new start, growing, or established business, Leasing is an option open to your business.

What Can Be Leased? Any type of equipment used in a business can be considered for lease funding.
Recent examples include fit out costs, coffee machines, furniture, mobile fish and chip vans, beer kegs, commercial kitchen and catering equipment, the list is endless!

What Are The Benefits of Leasing? There are numerous benefits of leasing a product. The four main ones are;

1. The Biggest Benefit You Take From The Product, Is In The Use Of It, NOT In The Ownership.

2. Leasing Conserves Cash Reserves. Leasing enables you to acquire the solution you need without making a substantial lump sum cash payment. This can then be used to better effect elsewhere in the organisation – such as product development, new staff or new business opportunities.

3. Leasing Is Tax Efficient. If you pay corporation tax, leasing can be particularly attractive. Payments may be deducted from taxable profits and so the net cost of leasing the equipment is reduced.

4. Leasing Can Provide 100% Financing. In most cases, all of the costs of a solution can be covered in your payments. We will finance equipment and services from a variety of suppliers, thereby simplifying your payments.

How Giftly works

                  Buy a gift card for any amount under $1,000. Suggest to the recipient where to go and what to get.

They choose to receive the funds on a Visa® gift card, which they can use at Regents Park Pharmacy, or somewhere else, if they'd like. Like a cash gift, but way more fun and personalized.
                

                  Suggest where to go and what to get - the recipient always gets what they want. Thoughtful, customizable, and convenient too.

PRODUCTS

SPOT RATE: BUYING CURRENCY AT CURRENT RATES
If you need to make an immediate lump sum payment such as a deposit, then this is the product for you. These are called a ‘spot trade’, and allow you to purchase and transfer funds to most countries on the same day.
FORWARD CONTRACT: USE CURRENT RATES TO SECURE FUNDS FOR A FUTURE DATE
This option is fantastic for property buyers who have stage payments and want the peace of mind that no matter what happens in the currency market, the value of their financial commitment won’t change. These are called ‘forward contracts’ as they allow you to use the current rate to secure forward for a date in the future.


MARKET ORDER: BUYING CURRENCY AT A PRE-ARRANGED RATE OF EXCHANGE
This option is called a ‘market order’ and is particularly helpful for people who need a designated rate of exchange in order to make the transaction viable. This allows you to designate a rate that you’re willing to wait for; when the market achieves that rate, the currency is purchased on your behalf. This allows you to save money and use market fluctuations to your adventure.
