		Investors in 2017 are facing a world in transition. The result of the U.S. presidential election and the earlier vote by British citizens to leave the European Union potentially reflect populist sentiment that appears to be challenging the decades-long march of globalization. What’s more, investors are recognizing that aggressive central bank stimulus may have reached its limits, and a transition to fiscal policy is at hand. Where should investors turn in such an environment? Our 2017 Outlook takes a trip around the globe, detailing the most important economic and investment themes as well as the portfolio implications from investing in a changing world.
	

		The global economy continues along its low-growth path, but there are a number of bright spots. In the U.S., despite the political uncertainty, a strengthening consumer is driving stronger growth. A large fiscal stimulus under the new administration could well provide another boost to the U.S. economy. And in many emerging markets the rebound that began in 2016 appears to have momentum, supported by higher commodities prices and structural reforms. Europe remains challenged by uncertainty about the future of the European Union, low growth and high unemployment. 
	

		A seven-year equity bull market has lifted stock valuations in the U.S., but many parts of the world are trading at discounts. Emerging markets and international markets are both below their 10-year average price-to-earnings ratio. Political and economic uncertainty remains, but there are bargains to be found for active investors seeking solid companies at attractive prices.
	

		U.S. government bond yields are near record lows, but are actually quite high relative to the rest of the world. Currently, 10-year Treasuries yield more than 85% of developed market sovereign debt. Even if U.S. rates rise and the new presidential administration’s policies are inflationary, the “lower for longer” trend seems sustainable well into next year while Europe and Japan continue to experiment with negative policy rates and quantitative easing.
	

		Results from the U.S. presidential election and Britain’s vote to leave the European Union highlighted a year where political populism gained momentum. But even amid that uncertainty, markets climbed a wall of worry in 2016. The lesson for this? It’s better to stick to your long-term plan and not get distracted by the latest political drama. Looking ahead, policy changes will affect individual businesses in different ways, so active investors will have an opportunity to build attractive company-by-company portfolios.

Important Disclosure

Unless otherwise stated, portfolio facts and statistics are shown for Class A shares; other classes may have different characteristics.

†NAV: Unless you are eligible for a waiver, the public offering price you pay when you buy Class A shares of the Fund is the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the shares plus an initial sales charge. The initial sales charge varies depending upon the size of your purchase.  No sales charge is imposed where Class A or Class C shares are issued to you pursuant to the automatic investment of income dividends or capital gains distributions. It is the responsibility of the financial intermediary to ensure that the investor obtains the proper “breakpoint” discount. Class C, Class I and Class Y do not have an initial sales charge; however, Class C does charge a contingent deferred redemption charge.  See the 
        
    prospectus and summary prospectus for more information.
1Van Eck Associates Corporation (the “Adviser”) has agreed to waive fees and/or pay Fund expenses to the extent necessary to prevent the operating expenses of the Fund (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, interest expense, trading expenses, dividends and interest payments on securities sold short, taxes and extraordinary expenses) from exceeding 1.60% for Class A, 2.50% for Class C, 1.00% for Class I, and 1.10% for Class Y of the Fund’s average daily net assets per year until May 1, 2018. During such time, the
        expense limitation is expected to continue until the Board of Trustees acts to discontinue all or a portion of such expense limitation.

The views and opinions expressed are those of VanEck. Fund manager commentaries are general in nature and should not be construed as investment advice. Opinions are subject to change with market conditions. Any discussion of specific securities mentioned in the commentaries is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation to buy these securities. Fund holdings will vary.
You can lose money by investing in the Fund. Any investment in the Fund should be part of an overall investment program, not a complete program. The Fund is subject to the risks associated with its investments in emerging markets securities, which tend to be more volatile and less liquid than securities traded in developed countries. The Fund’s investments in foreign securities involve risks related to adverse political and economic developments unique to a country or a region, currency fluctuations or controls, and the possibility of arbitrary action by foreign governments, including the takeover of property without adequate compensation or imposition of prohibitive taxation. The Fund is subject to risks associated with investments in debt securities, derivatives, commodity-linked instruments, illiquid securities, asset-backed securities, CMOs and small or mid-cap companies. The Fund is also subject to inflation risk, short-sales risk, market risk, non-diversification risk and leverage risk. Please see the 
        
    prospectus and summary prospectus for information on these and other risk considerations.
Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal. An investor should consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the investment company carefully before investing. The prospectus and summary prospectus contain this and other information.  Please read them carefully before investing.

EMSD - WisdomTree Strong Dollar Emerging Markets Equity Fund
































































                                    Emerging markets continue to offer diversification and growth potential, 
                                    but the U.S. dollar’s recent strengthening trend has strongly affected returns.

                                    on the emerging market companies and sectors expected to perform better in strong U.S. 
                                    dollar environments, while maintaining diversification.

                                                        Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks,

                                                        There are risks associated with investing, including possible loss of principal. 
                                                        Foreign investing involves special risks, such as risk of loss from currency 
                                                        fluctuation or political or economic uncertainty. Funds focusing on a single sector 
                                                        generally experience greater price volatility. Investments in emerging, offshore or 
                                                        frontier markets are generally less liquid and less efficient than investments in 
                                                        developed markets and are subject to additional risks, such as risks of adverse 
                                                        governmental regulation and intervention or political developments. 
                                                        A Fund that has exposure to one or more sectors may be more vulnerable to any single 
                                                        economic or regulatory development. The Fund invests in the securities included in, 
                                                        or representative of, its Index regardless of their investment merit, and the Fund does 
                                                        not attempt to outperform its Index or take defensive positions in declining markets. 
                                                        Please read the Fund’s prospectus for specific details regarding the Fund’s risk profile.

Last week, Professor Siegel and I chatted with Marc Chandler, Head of Global Markets Strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman, about his views on divergent central bank policy actions, implications for the U.S. dollar, euro and yen, as well as his thoughts regarding emerging markets (EM). Below is a summary of our conversation.
Spotlight on the Federal Reserve (Fed) and the European Central Bank (ECB) 
Markets have become increasingly convinced that the Fed will embark on interest rate normalization at its policy meeting today. Professor Siegel agreed it would happen, barring a large market swoon early in the week. As a result, divergent central bank policy in the developed markets is anticipated to be in focus. With the ECB pledging to extend its quantitative easing (QE) program and taking its monetary policy rate deeper into negative territory, and the Bank of Japan (BOJ) in the midst of QE, the question remains how policy divergence will impact their local currencies.  
Understanding Fed Funds Futures 
The Fed Funds Target Rate implied by futures market pricing is the average effective rate over the course of the month. Many pricing models assume the Fed will target its effective rate at the midpoint of the Fed’s target range (currently 0 to 25 basis points [bps] ). But that is not necessarily the case, and the Fed may actually target a lower half of the range when setting the policy rate. Given that the board includes a large number of doves, this may be the more likely scenario, in which case the Federal Funds futures market probabilities estimating a rate hike—those based on the midpoint of the range—are understating the actual chance of a hike. That said, a hike today is widely anticipated, and it would be more disruptive to markets if the Fed did not move.  
Would a Rate Hike Be Good for Stocks?  
Professor Siegel and Marc Chandler both believe that markets may continue to perform well, despite a rate hike from the Fed. Chandler states that investors have had a long time to digest this rate hike and it could be seen as good housekeeping, where the economy is strong enough to withstand policy normalization. While the markets do not typically respond well to tightening policy rates, the removal of uncertainty over this hike may become a positive force going into the end of the year.  
Interest Rate Differentials to Drive Euro Lower  
Interest rate differentials are a large driver of currency trends. Chandler outlines the current market environment: at the end of 2007, Germany’s two-year bund yielded more than 100 basis points higher than the U.S. two-year. Today the U.S. two-year yields more than 125 basis points above the German two-year bund. This could drive capital flows to the U.S.  
Against the backdrop of the Fed’s continuing to hike next year and the ECB potentially having to do more QE if inflation remains low, interest rate differentials may stay in favor of the U.S. As a result, it is likely that the U.S. dollar will remain well supported from the perspective of interest rate differentials.  
Challenging Environment for EM Currencies  
While EM currencies are currently inexpensive based on historical measures of valuations, Chandler states that they are likely to get even less expensive. There are a host of factors that contribute to this general pessimism, the first of which being lower-for-longer commodity prices that are likely to push EM currencies lower. Additionally, lower commodity prices have led to a decrease in companies’ profitability—particularly in the metals, mining and energy sectors—which have, subsequently, led to cuts in dividends. EM currencies can account for a large chunk of underperformance across both the equity (historically one-third of returns) and fixed income asset classes (historically two-thirds of volatility in returns).  
Secondly, there are serious geopolitical issues in the EM block. The geopolitical landscape for many EM countries—Russia, Brazil, South Africa, Turkey and Malaysia, to name a few—makes the perspectives for EM currencies less encouraging.  
 
China Unlikely to Drastically Weaken Currency 
Chandler believes it is more likely that China will weaken its currency only modestly. While a strong dollar is appropriate for the U.S., it is increasingly inappropriate for China, given the country’s growth considerations—having pegged its currency to a large degree to the U.S. dollar. Chandler believes it is likely for the Chinese yuan to experience a slow depreciation, possibly moving 3%–5% next year. Given China’s large trade surplus, which ranges between $50 and $60 billion per month, the political backlash may be severe if China depreciates its currency drastically.  
Bottom Line 
In summary, divergent central bank policies in developed markets are likely to result in further U.S. dollar strength against the euro and the yen. While the current market environment may be challenging for EM, a first rate hike from the Fed and a subsequent slow pace of hikes may provide the region with some temporary reprieve.

Important Risks Related to this Article
Foreign investing involves special risks, such as risk of loss from currency fluctuation or political or economic uncertainty.
Investments in emerging, offshore or frontier markets are generally less liquid and less efficient than investments in developed markets and are subject to additional risks, such as risks of adverse governmental regulation and intervention or political developments.
Investments focused in Japan or Europe increase the impact of events and developments associated with those regions, which can adversely affect performance.
