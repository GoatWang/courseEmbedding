Sanderson Farms Announces Retirement of Board Member Charles W. (“Tex”) Ritter, Jr.
 

LAUREL, Miss. (October 18, 2016) — Sanderson Farms, Inc. (NASDAQ: SAFM) today announced that Charles W. (“Tex”) Ritter, Jr. has informed the Company that he will retire from the Sanderson Farms’ Board of Directors when his current term ends at the 2017 annual shareholders’ meeting.
 
“Tex Ritter joined Sanderson Farms’ Board of Directors in 1988 and is the longest serving Board member,” stated Joe F. Sanderson, Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of Sanderson Farms, Inc.  “He has been a valued advisor to Sanderson Farms for many years, and the Company has experienced tremendous success and growth under his 28 years of leadership.  Not only has his advice and counsel as a Board member and Chairman of the Audit Committee contributed to the Company’s success, but the example in leadership, integrity and honesty he provides all of us has set a tone for the entire Company.  Tex knew the Company’s founders well, and he embodied their spirit, principles and ethics in his leadership on our Board.  We thank him for his service to Sanderson Farms and for his contributions to building long-term shareholder value.  We will miss his good humor, keen business insight, and the historical perspective he provided as a Board member.  On a personal note, I will miss his wise counsel and advice, his wit and his generosity, and I wish him a long and satisfying retirement with his wife Caroline, their children and grandchildren.”
 
Mr. Ritter previously served as President and Director of the Attala Company from 1967 until his retirement in 1992.  Mr. Ritter retired as a director of First M&F Corp. and Merchants and Farmers Bank in Kosciusko, Mississippi, in 2011.
 
Sanderson Farms, Inc. is engaged in the production, processing, marketing and distribution of fresh and frozen chicken and other prepared food items.  Its shares trade on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol SAFM.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/24/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

                                                    3:22 PM ET 06/02/2017
                                                


Chinese agricultural delegations are set to visit the United States in the coming months, raising hopes that Beijing may lift a ban on U.S. poultry imports. A decision by Beijing to cancel the ban would benefit U.S. farmers nervous about trade policies under U.S. President Donald Trump, who pulled out of the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership in January and pledged to renegotiate NAFTA.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.

First M & F Corp. has a class of securities registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

The Board believes Mr. Ritter should serve as a director because of his experience in and knowledge of both the banking and grain industries. He is our longest serving outside director. Mr. Ritter contributes a broad business perspective to the Board of Directors as well as a long-term perspective on the evolution of our Company from a family business to a large, publicly held corporation. He knew personally the founders of our Company and brings an understanding of their long-term vision and core values to the Board table.
