Robert Langley, Owner & CEORobert Langley started in Harlan, Kentucky as a rural shopping center developer and today owns office, retail and industrial real estate in Kentucky and North Carolina. Robert also owns several Texas Roadhouse franchises in Kentucky, West Virginia, and Western Pennsylvania. 
Robert developed the first strip shopping center—Woodland Shopping Center—in his hometown of Harlan in 1974.

In the late 1990s, Robert and his partners acquired the struggling Kincaid Towers office building and Lexington Green shopping development in Lexington, Kentucky. Today, those properties are the cornerstones of Robert’s real estate holdings and among the most recognizable properties in Central Kentucky.
Kincaid Towers, once considered a white elephant of Lexington’s central business district, underwent major renovations in 2001 and 2002 under Langley management. Renamed 300 West Vine, the property today is a hallmark of downtown Lexington and is home to many of the region’s top professional firms and businesses.
Lexington Green recently underwent its second phase of redevelopment under Robert’s ownership and is now one of the region’s top retail locations.

Leasing Properties






Langley Properties Leasing OpportunitiesEven the right property in the right location will not thrive without the right mix of tenants. LPC's leasing and management team recognizes that the tenants drive the success of the properties. LPC takes as much care in selecting the optimal mix of tenants as in selecting and developing the retail and office centers.
Based on the unique needs of the surrounding communities and the distinct characteristics of each property, LPC targets a complimentary mix of quality national, regional and local tenants for each establishment. LPC's well-respected tenant list includes such national retailers as Anthropologie, Whole Foods Market and Target, as well as regional favorites like Joseph-Beth Booksellers.
Our commitment doesn't end with the lease-signing. For existing tenants, LPC focuses on providing desirable, clean, safe and well-maintained facilities to conduct business and attract customers. LPC uses a proactive management approach to minimize tenant concerns, responding to requests or questions within 24 hours of a call or email.Properties with Availability

 Robert LangleyOwner & CEO

Robert Langley, Owner & CEORobert Langley started in Harlan, Kentucky as a rural shopping center developer and today owns office, retail and industrial real estate in Kentucky and North Carolina. Robert also owns several Texas Roadhouse franchises in Kentucky, West Virginia, and Western Pennsylvania. 
Robert developed the first strip shopping center—Woodland Shopping Center—in his hometown of Harlan in 1974. After replicating his success with similar centers in Eastern Kentucky, Robert shifted his focus to redeveloping existing properties with great potential. In the late 1990s, Robert and his partners acquired the struggling Kincaid Towers office building and Lexington Green shopping development in Lexington, Kentucky. Today, those properties are the cornerstones of Robert’s real estate holdings and among the most recognizable properties in Central Kentucky.
Kincaid Towers, once considered a white elephant of Lexington’s central business district, underwent major renovations in 2001 and 2002 under Langley management. Renamed 300 West Vine, the property today is a hallmark of downtown Lexington and is home to many of the region’s top professional firms and businesses.
Lexington Green recently underwent its second phase of redevelopment under Robert’s ownership and is now one of the region’s top retail locations. Lexington Green is home to Joseph-Beth Booksellers, one of the Midwest’s largest bookstores; Whole Foods, Anthropologie and several upscale fashion tenants.

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 09/27/2013
            

                BBB has determined that Stewart Langley Properties, LLC meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.

4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth









            Honestly represent products and services, including clear and adequate disclosures of all material terms.

                    1. Upon request, provide BBB with all information required to evaluate compliance with BBB standards.

5. the business' return/refund policy

                            6. any recurring commitment into which the customer may be entering, including information on how future billing will occur

Be Responsive









            Address marketplace disputes quickly, professionally, and in good faith.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,
                                
2. addresses all of the issues raised by the complainant,
3. includes appropriate evidence and documents supporting the business' position, and

                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.
                

                    4. Cooperate with BBB in efforts to eliminate the underlying cause of patterns of customer complaints that are identified by BBB.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.
