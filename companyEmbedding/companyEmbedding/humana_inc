Humana Inc. Key Developments

Humana Inc. and Oscar Health Enter Strategic Partnership to Offer Consumer-Focused, Technology-Driven Commercial Small Business Health Insurance
Jul 12 17
Humana Inc. and Oscar Health are launching a strategic partnership to offer commercial health insurance to small businesses in a nine-county Nashville, Tenn. area. The announcement follows the recent launch of Oscar for Business, the country’s first technology-driven health insurance for employers in April 2017. The new plans will be available this fall, pending regulatory approval. This is a unique partnership that merges Humana’s deep expertise and experience in provider collaboration, coordinated care, and health and wellness with Oscar’s technology and data-driven approach to member engagement to offer a seamless, simple, and consumer-focused experience to Nashville’s small business community. The partnership springs from Humana and Oscar’s shared vision to make health care an easier, more reliable and affordable experience for their members through technology and connected care. The health insurance product will deliver a unique member experience that leverages Oscar’s Concierge care teams that use data-driven alerts to help members with their care, 24/7 access to telemedicine and care search tools, and a mobile experience that empowers members to manage their health. Both Humana and Oscar chose to introduce this partnership in Nashville because it is home to one of the fastest growing small business communities in the country and has established itself as a hotbed for health technology innovation. Under the Nashville partnership, Humana and Oscar will initially focus on commercial health insurance for small businesses with 50 or fewer employees in the nine-county Nashville area. It will be closely coordinated and run by an executive leadership committee formed between the two companies. The partnership does not include Oscar’s individual insurance products.

Jun 23 17
Humana Inc. has named Sam Deshpande to the newly created position of Senior Vice President and Chief Risk Officer to oversee development of the company’s Chief Risk Office. In this new, executive-level role, Deshpande will report directly to Humana President and CEO Bruce Broussard, and will serve as a member of Humana’s Management Team. Deshpande will set direction and establish policy in the areas of enterprise risk management and compliance, while building a risk strategy and a culture that manages risk appropriately. Risk management and compliance have always been top priorities at Humana.  Reaffirming this focus on risk and compliance with the addition of Deshpande will enable the company to establish a consistent definition of risk across the enterprise and drive connections and collaboration throughout the business to ensure timely, proactive discovery and faster mitigation of risks and their causes. Deshpande joins Humana after an extensive external search, bringing 28 years of compliance, marketing and strategy experience to his new position. He comes to Humana from Capital One. Deshpande spent 17 years there in key leadership positions, most recently as Business Chief Risk Officer for the U.S. and international card business.

How the assessment works: 
You’ll answer some basic questions to get a confidential health profile tailored just for you.  Your personal report comes with recommendations for improving your health that you can share with your doctor.  It'll get you thinking about how to enhance and maintain your health.  More knowledge about your health gives you power; you may discover some easy ways to get or stay healthy.

Limit your food intake:
    While fasting is not required, it’s often suggested that you not eat or drink (aside from water) for 9 to 12 hours before your test to get the most accurate results. Talk with your doctor if you are uncertain whether you should fast or not.
Carry your cards:
    Bring your Humana  member identification card and a valid photo ID.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score

Growth Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

      Public Company Information:          




NYSE:HUM 







  "We are very proud of the tremendous effort and        commitment of our associates during this extended period of uncertainty        and their continuing focus and dedication to helping our members achieve        their best health." 



LOUISVILLE, Ky.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Humana Inc. (NYSE: HUM) today announced the mutual termination of its 
      merger agreement with Aetna Inc. (Aetna), following a ruling from the 
      United States District Court for the District of Columbia granting a 
      United States Department of Justice request to enjoin the merger. Under 
      the terms of the merger agreement, Humana is entitled to a breakup fee 
      of $1 billion, or approximately $630 million, net of tax.
    

      “The healthcare industry is in a dynamic state, and the public is 
      looking to companies like Humana to improve the cost of care and the 
      consumer experience,” said Bruce D. Broussard, Humana’s President and 
      Chief Executive Officer. “As an independent company, we will continue to 
      innovate and sharpen our focus on the local healthcare experience of all 
      our members, especially seniors living with chronic conditions. Our 
      strategy not only improves the value we bring to members, doctors and 
      other healthcare professionals, but it also helps reduce costs and 
      enhances the growth platform for both our health plans and our 
      Healthcare Services businesses, thus positioning us well for long-term, 
      sustainable growth.”
    

      Broussard added, “We are very proud of the tremendous effort and 
      commitment of our associates during this extended period of uncertainty 
      and their continuing focus and dedication to helping our members achieve 
      their best health.”
    


Strategic Update



      As an independent company, Humana will continue to build upon its 
      integrated care delivery strategy by intensifying its focus on people 
      living with chronic conditions – particularly those aging into or 
      already in Medicare Advantage or dual eligible plans. This population is 
      fast-growing, with greater than 85 percent of seniors having at least 
      one chronic condition and 65 percent having multiple chronic conditions (a). 
      To further advance this strategy, the company will maintain its employer 
      group customer focus, continuing to establish relationships with 
      Medicare age-ins, while leveraging its clinical and operating platforms 
      and furthering partnerships with doctors and other healthcare 
      professionals. This brings value-added capabilities to the company’s 
      employer group customers, particularly small to mid-size employers.
    

      As the company’s business model demonstrates, when Humana integrates 
      care with doctors and other healthcare professionals and serves members 
      outside of traditional institutions, its members’ health improves, care 
      is more cost-effective, and consumers are more engaged. These are key 
      drivers to enabling more affordable healthcare for consumers and 
      facilitating higher Star quality ratings, while also improving financial 
      performance.
    

      Humana is enhancing its integrated care delivery strategy in several key 
      areas to further enable a rich, locally delivered healthcare experience 
      for members, by doing the following:
    


        Increasing risk-based arrangements through expanding partnerships with 
        risk providers, offering sophisticated population health technology 
        and services, and expanding primary care clinics.
      

        Expanding complementary clinical capabilities that assist members 
        outside of the doctors’ offices and institutions, with focus on home 
        health services, local pharmacy access and behavioral health.
      

        Integrating technology between healthcare professionals, members and 
        Humana together with advanced analytics to simplify the experience, 
        eliminate “friction points”, increase transparency and make access to 
        care more convenient.
      


      “By extending and expanding the local capabilities of our Healthcare 
      Services businesses and supporting doctors and other healthcare 
      professionals with innovative and unsurpassed population-health tools, 
      we believe we can remove barriers for our members. This will help them 
      achieve their best health by enabling a more simplified healthcare 
      experience – one that combines the lifestyles of our members and the 
      clinical aspects so critical to improving lifelong health and 
      well-being,” said Broussard. “We believe this will, in turn, continue to 
      drive growth across the enterprise and favorable returns for our 
      stockholders.”
    

      The company will continue its practice of evaluating its portfolio of 
      businesses to ensure focus on those lines of business where its 
      integrated care delivery strategy can add value for health plan members, 
      healthcare professionals and its government program and employer group 
      customers.
    

      Regarding the company’s individual commercial medical coverage 
      (Individual Commercial), substantially all of which is offered 
      on-exchange through the federal Marketplaces, Humana has worked over the 
      past several years to address market and programmatic challenges in 
      order to keep coverage options available wherever it could offer a 
      viable product. This has included pursuing business changes, such as 
      modifying networks, restructuring product offerings, reducing the 
      company’s geographic footprint and increasing premiums.
    

      All of these actions were taken with the expectation that the company’s 
      Individual Commercial business would stabilize to the point where the 
      company could continue to participate in the program. However, based on 
      its initial analysis of data associated with the company’s healthcare 
      exchange membership following the 2017 open enrollment period, Humana is 
      seeing further signs of an unbalanced risk pool. Therefore, the company 
      has decided that it cannot continue to offer this coverage for 2018. 
      Through the remainder of 2017, Humana remains committed to serving its 
      current members across 11 states where it offers Individual Commercial 
      products. And, as it has done in the past, Humana will work closely with 
      its state partners as it navigates this process.
    


Capital Deployment Plans



      The company today also announced strategic changes to its capital 
      deployment plans to increase its return of capital to stockholders and 
      to create capacity for strategic investments.
    


        The company’s Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend to 
        stockholders of $0.40 per share, payable on April 28, 2017, to 
        stockholders of record on March 31, 2017, an increase of 38 percent 
        from the prior quarter’s cash dividend of $0.29 per share.
      

        Humana anticipates share repurchases totaling at least $2.00 billion 
        in 2017, to be accomplished through a variety of means, including a 
        $1.50 billion accelerated share repurchase program in the first 
        quarter of 2017, and open-market repurchases, with at least 
        $500 million in additional share repurchases through the remainder of 
        the year, subject to market conditions. To that end, the company’s 
        Board of Directors has approved a new share repurchase authorization 
        in the aggregate amount of $2.25 billion, expiring December 31, 2017.
      

        The company remains committed to a solid balance sheet and an 
        investment grade rating, which provide the capacity and flexibility to 
        invest in growth opportunities. Humana is likely to access the capital 
        markets in the coming months, depending upon market conditions, 
        raising its debt-to-capital ratio to within the range of 30 to 35 
        percent. The higher debt-to-capital ratio has been anticipated in the 
        company’s financial guidance for the year ending December 31, 2017 
        (FY17). The company also noted that it would consider going above that 
        range, temporarily, if needed for strategic purposes.
      



Investor Day 2017



      Humana also announced its intention to host an Investor Day in New York, 
      NY on April 25, 2017, where it will provide more detail on the company’s 
      strategic actions and its financial prospects. Specific details for that 
      event will be announced at a later date.
    


2017 Financial Guidance



      Humana provided its Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and 
      Adjusted EPS guidance for FY17 as detailed below. GAAP and Adjusted 
      results for the year ended December 31, 2016 (FY16) are shown below for 
      comparison. Adjusted FY16 results have been recast to exclude the 
      Individual Commercial business given the company’s decision to no longer 
      offer these products beginning in 2018, as discussed above.

Retail Segment primarily reflecting:

             
          



Individual Medicare Advantage: 
(1) higher 
              projected pretax margins approaching the company’s target pretax 
              margin range of 4.5 to 5.0 percent and (2) a projected net 
              increase in individual Medicare Advantage membership in the 
              range of 30,000 to 40,000
            


Group Medicare Advantage:
 (1) a net increase in 
              group Medicare Advantage membership in the range of 70,000 to 
              80,000 more than offset by (2) margin pressure associated with 
              the competitive environment
            


Stand-alone PDP:
 (1) strong membership growth more 
              than offset by (2) a competitive pricing environment
            


State-based contracts
 primarily reflecting (1) a 
              more favorable Florida rate environment and (2) management 
              operating initiatives

Healthcare Services Segment primarily reflecting the 
          offsetting impacts of:

             
          



Humana Pharmacy Services: 
(1) higher projected 
              health plan membership, (2) higher anticipated mail-order 
              penetration and (3) improvements in operating cost structure
            


Other Healthcare Services businesses: 
(1) lower 
              projected earnings in the company’s provider assets, (2) 
              optimization of the company’s clinical programs and (3) 
              continued investments in integrated care delivery capabilities

      (b) FY17 Adjusted EPS projections exclude the 
      following:



        Operating losses of approximately $45 million pretax, or $0.17 per 
        diluted common share, for the company’s Individual Commercial business 
        given the company’s planned exit on January 1, 2018.
      

        Net gain from termination of transaction with Aetna of approximately 
        $945 million pretax, or $4.32 per diluted common share; includes the 
        break-up fee from Aetna, Humana’s portion of the break-up fee 
        associated with the Molina Healthcare, Inc. and transaction costs net 
        of the tax benefit associated with certain expenses which were 
        previously non-deductible.
      

        Amortization expense for identifiable intangibles of approximately $71 
        million pretax, or $0.31 per diluted common share.
      

        The one-year beneficial effect of a lower effective tax rate of 
        approximately $2.14 per diluted common share in light of pricing and 
        benefit design assumptions associated with the 2017 temporary 
        suspension of the non-deductible health insurance industry fee; 
        excludes Individual Commercial business impact.
      

        Estimated guaranty fund assessment expense of approximately $30 
        million pretax, or $0.13 per diluted common share, to support the 
        policyholder obligations of Penn Treaty (an unaffiliated long-term 
        care insurance company).
      


      (c) FY16 Adjusted EPS (Recast) excludes the 
      following:



        Operating losses of $291 million pretax, or $1.37 per diluted common 
        share, for the company’s Individual Commercial business given the 
        company’s planned exit on January 1, 2018.
      

        Pretax transaction and integration costs of $104 million, or $0.64 per 
        diluted common share, associated with the then-pending transaction 
        with Aetna.
      

        Pretax amortization expense associated with identifiable intangibles 
        of $77 million, or $0.32 per diluted common share.
      

        The pretax write-off of approximately $583 million, or $2.43 per 
        diluted common share, in receivables associated with the risk corridor 
        premium stabilization program. See related footnote (d).
      

        Pretax expenses of $505 million, or $2.11 per diluted common share, of 
        reserve strengthening related to the company’s non-strategic closed 
        block of long-term care insurance business. See related footnote (e).
      


      (d) On November 10, 2016, the U.S. Court of Federal Claims ruled in 
      favor of the government in one of a series of cases filed by insurers 
      against the Department of Health and Humana Services (HHS) to collect 
      risk corridor payments, rejecting all of the insurer’s statutory, 
      contract and Constitutional claims for payment. The company had 
      maintained the receivable in previous periods in reliance upon the 
      interpretation previously promulgated by HHS that the risk corridor 
      receivables were obligations of the U.S. government. Given this court 
      decision, however, the company’s conclusion with respect to the ultimate 
      collectability of the receivable has shifted, and accounting rules 
      required that the receivable be written off. Land of Lincoln Mutual 
      Health Insurance Company v. United States; United States Court of 
      Federal Claims No. 16-744C.


      (e) As noted above, in addition to previously-disclosed adjustments, EPS 
      for FY16 included a strengthening of reserves for the company’s 
      non-strategic closed block of long-term care business. In connection 
      with its acquisition of KMG America in 2007, the company acquired a 
      non-strategic closed block of long-term care insurance policies. These 
      policies were sold between 1995 and 2005, of which approximately 30,800 
      remained in force as of December 31, 2016. During the fourth quarter of 
      2016, the company recorded a reserve strengthening for this closed block 
      of policies as it determined the present value of future premiums, 
      together with its existing reserves were not adequate to provide for 
      future policy benefits. This adjustment was primarily driven by emerging 
      experience indicating longer claims duration, a prolonged lower interest 
      rate environment and an increase in policyholder life expectancies.
    

      (f) The company’s reserving practice is to consistently recognize the 
      actuarial best estimate of its ultimate benefits expense. Actuarial 
      standards require the use of assumptions based on moderately adverse 
      experience, which generally results in favorable reserve development 
      related to the prior year. In FY16, the company experienced prior period 
      reserve development that exceeded what it would expect in a typical year 
      primarily due to higher than normal claim recoveries.
    


Cautionary Statement



      This news release includes forward‐looking statements within the meaning 
      of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. When used in 
      investor presentations, press releases, Securities and Exchange 
      Commission (SEC) filings, and in oral statements made by or with the 
      approval of one of Humana’s executive officers, the words or phrases 
      like “expects,” “believes,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “likely will 
      result,” “estimates,” “projects” or variations of such words and similar 
      expressions are intended to identify such forward‐looking statements.
    

      These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future 
      performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, 
      including, among other things, information set forth in the “Risk 
      Factors” section of the company’s SEC filings, a summary of which 
      includes but is not limited to the following:
    


        The merger agreement with Aetna Inc. has affected and may in the 
        future, materially and adversely affect our results of operations, due 
        to continuing liability for transaction costs, diverted management 
        attention to transaction and integration planning efforts, customer 
        uncertainty over when or if the merger would be completed, certain 
        restrictions on the conduct of Humana’s business prior to termination 
        of the merger agreement, and other uncertainties that have impaired 
        Humana’s ability to retain, recruit and motivate key personnel.
      

        If Humana does not design and price its products properly and 
        competitively, if the premiums Humana receives are insufficient to 
        cover the cost of healthcare services delivered to its members, if the 
        company is unable to implement clinical initiatives to provide a 
        better healthcare experience for its members, lower costs and 
        appropriately document the risk profile of its members, or if its 
        estimates of benefits expense are inadequate, Humana’s profitability 
        could be materially adversely affected. Humana estimates the costs of 
        its benefit expense payments, and designs and prices its products 
        accordingly, using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon, among 
        other relevant factors, claim payment patterns, medical cost 
        inflation, and historical developments such as claim inventory levels 
        and claim receipt patterns. We continually review estimates of future 
        payments relating to benefit expenses for services incurred in the 
        current and prior periods and make necessary adjustments to our 
        reserves, including premium deficiency reserves, where appropriate. 
        These estimates, however, involve extensive judgment, and have 
        considerable inherent variability because they are extremely sensitive 
        to changes in claim payment patterns and medical cost trends, so any 
        reserves we may establish, including premium deficiency reserves, may 
        be insufficient. In addition, there can be no guarantees that the 
        reconsideration that Humana filed with respect to certain of the 
        Company’s Star rating measures for the 2018 bonus year will be 
        successful, that operational measures Humana may take will 
        successfully mitigate any negative effects of Star quality ratings for 
        the 2018 bonus year, or that Humana will not experience a decline in 
        membership growth for 2017 or 2018 as a result of the Company’s 2018 
        bonus year Star ratings.
      

        If Humana fails to effectively implement its operational and strategic 
        initiatives, particularly its Medicare initiatives, state-based 
        contract strategy, and its participation in the new health insurance 
        exchanges, the company’s business may be materially adversely 
        affected, which is of particular importance given the concentration of 
        the company’s revenues in these products.
      

        If Humana fails to properly maintain the integrity of its data, to 
        strategically implement new information systems, to protect Humana’s 
        proprietary rights to its systems, or to defend against cyber-security 
        attacks, the company’s business may be materially adversely affected.
      

        Humana is involved in various legal actions, or disputes that could 
        lead to legal actions (such as, among other things, provider contract 
        disputes relating to rate adjustments resulting from the Balanced 
        Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended, commonly 
        referred to as “sequestration”; other provider contract disputes; and 
        qui tam litigation brought by individuals on behalf of the government) 
        and governmental and internal investigations, any of which, if 
        resolved unfavorably to the company, could result in substantial 
        monetary damages or changes in its business practices. Increased 
        litigation and negative publicity could also increase the company’s 
        cost of doing business.
      

        As a government contractor, Humana is exposed to risks that may 
        materially adversely affect its business or its willingness or ability 
        to participate in government healthcare programs including, among 
        other things, loss of material government contracts, governmental 
        audits and investigations, potential inadequacy of government 
        determined payment rates, potential restrictions on profitability, 
        including by comparison of profitability of the company’s Medicare 
        Advantage business to non-Medicare Advantage business, or other 
        changes in the governmental programs in which Humana participates.
      

        The Healthcare Reform Law, including The Patient Protection and 
        Affordable Care Act and The Healthcare and Education Reconciliation 
        Act of 2010, could have a material adverse effect on Humana’s results 
        of operations, including restricting revenue, enrollment and premium 
        growth in certain products and market segments, restricting the 
        company’s ability to expand into new markets, increasing the company’s 
        medical and operating costs by, among other things, requiring a 
        minimum benefit ratio on insured products, lowering the company’s 
        Medicare payment rates and increasing the company’s expenses 
        associated with a non-deductible health insurance industry fee and 
        other assessments; the company’s financial position, including the 
        company’s ability to maintain the value of its goodwill; and the 
        company’s cash flows. Additionally, potential legislative changes, 
        including activities to repeal or replace, in whole or in part, the 
        Health Care Reform Law, creates uncertainty for Humana’s business, and 
        when, or in what form, such legislative changes may occur cannot be 
        predicted with certainty.
      

        Humana’s continued participation in the federal and state health 
        insurance exchanges, which entail uncertainties associated with mix, 
        volume of business and the operation of premium stabilization programs 
        that are subject to federal administrative action, could adversely 
        affect the company’s results of operations, financial position and 
        cash flows.
      

        Humana’s business activities are subject to substantial government 
        regulation. New laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or 
        regulations or their manner of application could increase the 
        company’s cost of doing business and may adversely affect the 
        company’s business, profitability and cash flows.
      

        If Humana fails to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships 
        with the providers of care to its members, the company’s business may 
        be adversely affected.
      

        Humana’s pharmacy business is highly competitive and subjects it to 
        regulations in addition to those the company faces with its core 
        health benefits businesses.
      

        Changes in the prescription drug industry pricing benchmarks may 
        adversely affect Humana’s financial performance.
      

        If Humana does not continue to earn and retain purchase discounts and 
        volume rebates from pharmaceutical manufacturers at current levels, 
        Humana’s gross margins may decline.
      

        Humana’s ability to obtain funds from certain of its licensed 
        subsidiaries is restricted by state insurance regulations.
      

        Downgrades in Humana’s debt ratings, should they occur, may adversely 
        affect its business, results of operations, and financial condition.
      

        The securities and credit markets may experience volatility and 
        disruption, which may adversely affect Humana’s business.

      address or update them in future filings or communications regarding its 
      business or results. In light of these risks, uncertainties, and 
      assumptions, the forward‐looking events discussed herein may or may not 
      occur. There also may be other risks that the company is unable to
