			    		accounts to online accounts. The online registration process must be followed and all relevant documentation, including a letter 
			    		instructing us to transfer all the shares and cash balances from the existing account. Please state the account number. 
			    		The new online account will be activated within 48 hours (during a business week) of the original instruction letter being received.Clients who want to split their existing portfolio should complete the registration process; including signing the mandate and 
			    		enclosing all the relevant documentation, including a letter to Absa Stockbrokers and Portfolio Management instructing us as to which shares should be 
			    		transferred.Non-resident investorsIt is important that non-resident accountholders declare this fact when they complete the mandate. Failure to do so could be deemed 
			    		to be a contravention of foreign exchange regulations.South African non-residents will need to contact us for our non-resident trust account details when transferring funds.Placing ordersThis service is only available to accounts registered to trade shares online.Orders placed in the Online Trading System will only be entered into the JSE™ Trading System once the market opens. 
			    		The JSE™ is open for trading from 09:00 to 17:00 (GMT+2), Monday to Friday, excluding Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve where, 
			    		if applicable, the market closes at 12:00. The JSE™ is closed on South African public holidays.For any order to be executed, there needs to be a corresponding counterparty, thus for "buy" orders, a corresponding offer 
			    		is required and for "sell" orders, a corresponding bid needs to be available. All orders are matched on price only, therefore if 
			    		insufficient shares are available to match an order completely, then the order may be only partially executed.Orders placed "At Market" will be executed immediately, in part or in full, at the best price, assuming there is a counterparty 
			    		available. If there is no bid or offer available, orders will be placed at the ruling price. It is therefore strongly recommended 
			    		that for illiquid stocks and in particular warrants, orders are placed "At Limit".An "At Limit" order determines the maximum price (buy) or minimum price (sell) at which the share is to be traded. If, however, 
			    		the order can be executed at a better price at that point in time, the client will benefit. An "At Limit" order will be queued in 
			    		time and price priority and will only be executed once all orders ahead of it in the queue have been executed.Once an order has been submitted, the order will appear under the "Today's Order Book" schedule until such time as the order is 
			    		executed, cancelled or it expires. Email confirmation will be sent to the client when:an order is placed on the Online Trading Systeman order is entered into the JSE™ Trading Systeman order is executed or partially executedan order is cancelled or it expiresCustomer communicationsAn email message will be deemed to be sent by:The client, at the time at which Absa Stockbrokers and Portfolio Management is capable of accessing such message;Absa Stockbrokers and Portfolio Management, at the time shown on the message as having been sent, or if not so shown, at the time shown on

			      			of such authority or by an automated system programmed by Absa Stockbrokers and Portfolio Management and such system operated without error or malfunction.Unauthorised use of access codesThe client must keep his/her password secret.
