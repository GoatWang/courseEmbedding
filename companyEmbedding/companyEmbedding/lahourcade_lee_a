HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Houston Trust Company announced today that a new slate of senior 
      officers has been appointed to lead the company. Lee A. Lahourcade has 
      been named Chief Executive Officer and James S. D’Agostino, Jr. has been 
      named Chairman. Additionally, the Company named Stephanie Pollock as 
      Chief Financial Officer.
    


      Mr. Lahourcade will succeed William C. McCain, Jr., who announced his 
      retirement after nearly 20 years with Houston Trust Company. Mr. McCain 
      joined James A. Elkins III and David R. Lummis when the firm was founded 
      in 1994 and has been responsible for administration and operations since.
    

      “The board and shareholders acknowledge Bill’s contribution to building 
      Houston Trust to over $3.7 billion of fiduciary assets under management. 
      We thank him for his years of service and stewardship of the 
      organization,” said David R. Lummis, President and Co-Founder of Houston 
      Trust Company. “We are delighted to be able to put a very strong 
      management team in place for the future. Both Jim and Lee are well 
      recognized for their management skills, knowledge of wealth management 
      and trust, and commitment to excellent client service.”
    

      “I am pleased to join Houston Trust Company,” said Mr. Lahourcade. “I am 
      honored to become part of a team of highly experienced professionals who 
      are dedicated to extraordinary personal service.”
    

      “I am delighted to join Lee and David in continuing Jim Elkins’ and the 
      shareholders’ long-term commitment to remaining independent,” said newly 
      appointed Chairman James D’Agostino. “We have a strong capital position 
      to support future growth. Lee is just the CEO we need to guide Houston’s 
      leading independent trust and wealth management company for future 
      generations.”
    

      Mr. Lahourcade has over 30 years of investment management and research 
      experience, including more than 10 years in executive management at 
      Vaughan Nelson, a Houston-based investment firm. During his CEO tenure, 
      that firm’s assets under management grew from $3 billion to $8 billion. 
      He has been actively involved in the Houston community serving on 
      various boards, including Presbyterian School, Family Services 
      Foundation, Children’s Museum of Houston and Houston Wilderness. Mr. 
      Lahourcade is a graduate of Vanderbilt University with a B.A. in 
      Economics, Magna Cum Laude. He also earned a Master of Business 
      Administration from Harvard Business School. He is a Chartered Financial 
      Analyst and Chartered Investment Counselor and has served as Director of 
      Houston Society of Financial Analysts.
    

      Mr. D’Agostino retired as Chairman and CEO of Encore Bancshares, Inc. 
      after its sale in 2012. He led a group of Houston investors that founded 
      Encore Bank which grew to $1.6 billion in assets and was sold for $250 
      million in 2012. Mr. D’Agostino has over 40 years of experience in 
      banking, wealth management, and insurance, including 13 years with 
      American General Corporation and 10 years with Citibank. He currently 
      serves as a director of Basic Energy Services, Inc. Mr. D’Agostino is on 
      the board of Main Street Ministries and the Houston World Affairs 
      Council, and he is an Advisory Director of Goodwill Industries. He 
      graduated from Villanova University with a B.S. in Economics and 
      received a J.D. from Seton Hall University School of Law. He also 
      completed the Advanced Management Program of Harvard School of Business.
    

      Mrs. Pollock was most recently Senior Vice President, Comptroller and 
      Chief Accounting Officer at Encore Bancshares, Inc. prior to its 
      acquisition in 2012. Stephanie is a CPA with over 15 years of accounting 
      experience in financial services and in public accounting. She has a 
      Bachelor of Business Administration from the University of Houston.

A must for every man’s arsenal: a few reliable pairs of jeans that have a classic look with a modern flair and a great fit. Lee jeans for men provide high-quality pants for anyone looking to add denim durability and unbeatable style to their everyday look. Keep loose and stay comfortable with the freeing forms of relaxed or bootcut jeans. More of a traditionalist? Stick with what you know and look great in a pair of straight or slim fit pants. Take advantage of extra pocket space with a trusty set of carpenter jeans. Too hot for long pants? Get the same quality you’re used to with a bit less length. From cargo shorts to flat-front shorts—and denim to khaki, Lee shorts give you an attractive summer style and a great way to stay cool. Whether you’re shopping for weekday work attire or weekend casual, our Lee jeans and pants will give you a classic look for a lot less.
