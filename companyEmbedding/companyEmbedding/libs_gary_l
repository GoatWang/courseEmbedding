Warning: This DVD contains profanity and adult humor and is not recommended for performers under the age of 18.

What do you say when...

What do you say when you're in the middle of your show and all of a sudden  there's a huge crashing noise heard from backstage?
What do you say when a baby starts wailing away in the middle of your act? What do you say when somebody interrupts your show by walking in ten minutes late?
What do you say when a prop malfunctions?
What do you say when you walk out on stage, start talking and your mike doesn't work?
What do you say when your audience starts talking in the middle of your show?
What do you say when an audience member starts heckling you?
What do you say when you belch or sneeze or caugh or WORSE on stage?
What do you say when  THINGS GO WRONG!

It's gonna happen!


As a live entertainer, you face a never ending barrage of technical difficulties, interruptions, and stuff just generally going wrong WHILE THE SPOTLIGHT IS ON YOU! 

But that doesn't mean you have to lose your cool.  Being a true professional means knowing how to handle ANY SITUATION you're presented with so that no matter what happens the  audience gets their money's worth and more.


Gary Darwin is famous for having the perfect response for any situation.  His audiences think that's because he's an incredible ad-lib artist, and that's true... but it's not the WHOLE TRUTH.  The whole truth is that Darwin and other top professionals PLAN for these situations and PRACTICE their responses ahead of time.  That way they just have to pick the right line, (not write it too!) when the pressure is on and the unexpected happens.



For this incredible new course Darwin has assembled a live and VERY VOCAL audience of top professional magicians, MCs, jugglers, ventriloquists and comedians to help contribute the one-liners that have worked for them close-up, stand-up and on stage.  What results is a free-for-all in which Darwin and Company cover a TON of material, heckle and get heckled, trade advice (and insults), and everyone has a good laugh.

This is serious business, though, and if you're a live entertainer you'll benefit greatly from thinking and planning what you're going to say when the unexpected happens... BEFORE IT HAPPENS.  This course is a tremendous resource and a huge head start in your quest to be prepared for anything on stage.  Don't venture into your next live performance without it!


Have the PERFECT LINE for the 200 most common UNEXPECTED situations!


Manufacturer Says
This course was filmed live and is being offered to you completely unsensored!

Darwin and his studio audience of seasoned entertainers cover everything from kid and family show humor to  blue material designed for adult audiences.

            This dvd is garbage - period. These quote, unquote "reaction ad-libs" are of the lamest
1950's variety. None of them are applicable in modern society and only a roomfull of geriatrics
would even laugh at it - as long as their hearing aids are turned up that is. Thankfully, I never
had to buy this. A friend bought it, brought it over, and then proceeded to steal about an hour of
my life away while watching Gary Darwin dish out some of the dumbest ad-libs that only Milton Berle
could love. Avoid this, unless of course you've built a time machine and are planning to
take your act to the Jersey shore in 1960. While your at it, stop by my house about 6 months ago and
stop me from watching this piece of trash so that I won't have to remember it.

            Do you have an uncle who thinks he's funny, but all he does is repeat tired old lines you've heard a
million times?  You smile politely, but it's unfunny and uncomfortable? The title of this
disc is misleading.  "Adlib" means "made up spontaneously", but this DVD is instead a lame
collection of a few tired old one-liners.  You are getting a home-made video taken at some
convention. Darwin suggests an onstage situation, offers a few lame comments (sometimes just one)
and then asks the audience to throw in more.  The problem is, about half the time, they've got
nothing, and neither does he.   Worse yet, there were a couple guys in his audience whose
idea of humor is nasty and demeaning.  If you want your audience to hate you, there are some great
lines here.  Darwin goes on at length to worship Don Rickles, a sour, demeaning 82 year old "comic"
sometimes known as the "Master of Venom".  If you think insulting your audience is funny, you might
actually like this disc. Honestly, there are three laughs on this whole DVD.  Everything
else is "take my wife, please" kind of lame non-spontaneous non-humor.  Long sections are devoted to
worshiping Rickles and other off-topic filler. Darwin can be heard, but the audience responses are
often inaudible. Production values are shoddy and unprofessional.  It's awful. --
Alternative: the same day I bought this disc, I bought Gregory Wilson's Pyrotechnic Pasteboards. 
Greg is full of genuinely funny adlibs, both in his performance and tutorials, and he is a masterful
teacher.  I got way more material from his live shows than I got from "Reaction Adlibs".

            this is just a bunch of old guys sitting around telling OLD OLD OLD jokes.  some famous people show
up, but save your money and search google for bad vaudeville jokes.

            this is one of the few non magic dvds that i have found useful. it helps the magician find his/her
way out of difficult situations or with difficult spectators. this is a situation that we have all
found ourselves in and it helped me handle such situations

            a typical "in your face" style of reactions and quotes. there are a few good one liners in there,
which you could adapt and use for your own show, but there is a lot of poor material with it.

            this isnt a heckler stopper miracle cure, but these are suggestions straight from the mouths of
todays top pros.  gary darwin isnt the only one on this dvd, its got lance burton, jonny thompson,
dixie dooley, the amazing jonathan, jay noblezada, and the list goes on. unfortunately its hard to
understand some suggestions from the audience. its all very tongue in cheek and if thats not your
style then this may not be for you.

            ok, i love gary darwin.  if you have seen his thumbtip dvd, you will know he is very funny.  but
this dvd is lame.  the lines they use are kinda corny.  when the other magicians in the audience
speak you can't hear them sometimes... there should have been a mic in the crowd...    i was very
disappointed when i saw this....not to mention waiting 4 months for the dvd to show up

            It´s not a baaaad DVD, but I really expected more. The gags are like jokes, I thought Gary would
tell how to deal with "problems" and difficult situations at the show, not just say a joke every
time. It was really under my expectations. But, if you are the type of magician who say jokes EVERY
time, buy it. Guilherme Avila.

            I could see where some would complain about the DVD, because he solicits input from the very
experienced crowd (some of the biggest names in magic are in the crowd), but then you can't hear all
of their comments.  However, there is good stuff in the DVD.
