	PART I








	Item

	1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.





	Narrative Description of the Business 






	We plan to make early stage investments that will bring alternative energy technologies to commercialization and then actively manage these investments. We plan to generate management fees based on the size of the investments that we oversee and incentive income based on the performance of these investments.  

	Our principal business has been to

	provide consulting to related parties with respect to their investments in alternative energy projects.





	As to our investments, we will not limit ourselves to any single area of alternative energy. We will look at any and all forms of alternative energy. We actively screen investments with emphasis towards finding opportunities with potential for long term success.





	Operations






	In the past, we have acted as a consultant to with respect to client investments in alternative energy projects. We performed due diligence and ongoing research and evaluation with respect to projects on a fee basis. We are not currently generating revenues as a consultant.





	We also plan to seek, develop, and manage alternative energy investments for our own account. We screen investments with emphasis towards finding opportunities with long term potential. We do not limit ourselves to any single area of alternative energy. We will look at any and all forms of alternative energy.





	We have a proprietary investment screening process to make our investments.  This process is based upon the experience of Mr. Brian Klemsz, our President, and outside consultants as we develop our company.  





	For the fiscal years ended 2016 and 2015, we have not been profitable. While we have lost our only source of revenue, we have been pursuing new clients to replace the lost revenue stream and are also exploring the possibility of merging with an existing company who has revenues and, potentially, earnings. At this time, we have no definitive arrangements for either replacing our lost revenue or identifying a merger candidate.





	We operate out of one office in Colorado. We have no specific plans at this point for additional offices.  


	 


	 




	 




	- 3 -








	 


	 



	We operate out of one office in Colorado. We have no specific plans at this point for additional offices.  



	 


	 



	Markets







	We believe that the primary reason that clients would procure services from us rather than competitors would be the existing relationships that we possess and can develop. We believe that client loyalty and satisfaction can be the basis for success in this business. Therefore, we plan to develop and expand on already existing relationships to develop a competitive edge. We utilize the expertise of our principal officer to market our proprietary investment screening process business.



	 


	 



	Raw Materials






	   

	      The use of raw materials is not a  factor in our operations at the present time. The use of raw materials may become a material factor in the future as we develop operations.






	Customers and Competition






	Our business plan involves acting as both a consultant and an investor in alternative energy technologies. This business is highly competitive. There are numerous similar companies providing such services in the United States of America. Our competitors will have greater financial resources and more expertise in this business. Our ability to develop our business will depend on our ability to successfully identify alternative energy technology investments in this highly competitive environment. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so successfully.


	 


	Over the past several years, the size and number of funds that focus on alternative energy technologies has continued to increase. If this trend continues, it is possible that it will become increasingly difficult for us to raise funds to grow our Company. Competition is based on a variety of factors, including:


	  






	 



	• 




	investment performance;












	 



	• 




	investor perception of investment managers’ drive, focus and alignment of interest;












	 



	• 




	quality of service provided to and duration of relationship with investors;












	 



	• 




	business reputation; and












	 



	• 




	level of fees and expenses charged for services.






	 












	- 4 -












	 


	      We compete with a large number of management firms and other financial institutions. A number of factors serve to increase our competitive risks:


	 





	 



	• 




	investors may develop concerns that we will allow a business to grow to the detriment of its performance;












	 



	• 




	some of our competitors have greater capital, lower targeted returns or greater sector or investment strategy specific expertise than we do, which creates competitive disadvantages with respect to investment opportunities; some of our competitors may perceive risk differently than we do which could allow them either to outbid us for investments in particular sectors or, generally, to consider a wider variety of investments;






	 





	 



	• 




	there are relatively few barriers to entry impeding new private equity and hedge fund management firms, and the successful efforts of new entrants into our various lines of business, including former ‘‘star’’ portfolio managers at large diversified financial institutions as well as such institutions themselves, will continue to result in increased competition; and












	 



	• 




	other industry participants could  seek to recruit our best and brightest investment professionals away from us.









	    These and other factors could reduce our earnings and revenues and materially adversely affect our business.





	Employees







	   

	      We have one full-time employee: Mr. Klemsz. Mr. Klemsz does not draw a salary or receive any other kind of compensation. However, we reimburse our employee for all necessary and customary business related expenses.  We have no plans or agreements which provide health care, insurance or compensation on the event of termination of employment or change in our control.  We do not pay our Directors separately for any Board meeting they attend.


	 



	Proprietary Information





	                We have a proprietary investment screening process to make our investments.  Otherwise, we own no proprietary information.





	Government Regulation





	At some point, we may be required to file to become a registered investment advisor, but we currently do not expect government regulations or environmental laws to have any material impact on us.





	Research and Development





	We have never spent any amount in research and development activities.





	 




	- 5 -














	Environmental Compliance





	We believe that we are not subject to any material costs for compliance with any environmental laws.


	 


	How to Obtain our SEC Filings


	 



	We file annual, quarterly, and special reports, proxy statements, and other information with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). Reports, proxy statements and other information filed with the SEC can be inspected and copied at the public reference facilities of the SEC at 100 F Street N.E., Washington, DC 20549. Such material may also be accessed electronically by means of the SEC's website at

	www.sec.gov

	.





	Our investor relations department can be contacted at our principal executive office located at our principal office, 1001-A E. Harmony Road, #366, Fort Collins, Colorado 80525.  Our telephone number is (970) 223-4499. We do not have a corporate website.










	1A

	. RISK FACTORS






	   

	      You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information in this prospectus before deciding to invest in shares of our common stock.


	 



	   

	      The occurrence of any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating result. In this case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you might lose all or part of your investment.






	Risks Related to Our Business and Industry








	While we were profitable for the four fiscal years prior to 2014, we have not been profitable for the subsequent fiscal years

	.

	We have lost our only client, and we may never be profitable again.  If we cannot develop revenue, we could go out of business.







	We were formed as a Colorado business entity in November, 2007. For four fiscal years prior to 2014, our operations were profitable.  However, we have lost our only client, and have not been able to replace the revenue in the subsequent fiscal years. We cannot guarantee that we will be profitable again. If we cannot develop revenue


	,


	we could go out of business.

	Currently, we believe that we have sufficient capital to sustain our business operations through March 31, 2018.







	We have relied upon one client for all of our revenues, which means that the loss of this client

	has

	severely

	impacted

	our operations. If we cannot replace the lost revenue or merge with a company, we could go out of business.





	One client in fiscal year 2013 accounted for 100% of our revenues. This client was a related party, EastMountain Alternative Energy, LLC. EastMountain Alternative Energy, LLC gave notice to us that, effective December 31, 2013, it planned to terminate the asset management services contract it

	had

	with us.  We

	have been and

	could

	continue to

	be materially impacted by the loss of this client. The loss of this one client makes us subject to uncertain revenue results. With the termination of the asset management services contract between us and EastMountain Alternative Energy, LLC, we no longer provide asset management services to any clients and have no current revenue source going forward. While we have lost our only source of revenue, we

	have been seeking

	additional clients to replace our lost revenue, although we have no definite arrangements at this point. In the alternative, we may seek a merger candidate, although we have not identified any definitive acquisitions at this time. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to replace our lost revenue or to identify a merger candidate. If we cannot either replace our lost revenue or identify a merger candidate, we may eventually cease business. An investor could lose his entire investment.





	Our lack of operating history makes it difficult for us to evaluate our future business prospects and make decisions based on those estimates of our future performance. An investor could lose his entire investment.





	We have a limited operating history. An investor has no frame of reference to evaluate our future business prospects.  This makes it difficult, if not impossible, to evaluate us as an investment. An investor could lose his entire investment if our future business prospects do not result in our sustaining our current profitability.






	 


	 




	- 6 -








	 


	 



	 

	If we do not generate adequate revenues to finance our operations, our business may fail.



	            



	We began generating revenues in 2008. As of December 31, 2016, we had a cash position of $138,812 and an additional $155,854 in Certificates of Deposit. Our operating costs for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 were $52,999. These operating costs include insurance, taxes, utilities, maintenance, contract services and all other costs of operations. We will use contract employees who will be paid on an hourly basis as each investment transaction is evaluated. However, the operating costs and expected revenue generation are difficult to predict. Since there can be no assurances that revenues will be sufficient to cover operating costs for the foreseeable future, it may be necessary to raise additional funds. Due to our lack of consistent profitable operating history, raising additional funds may be difficult.





	Competition in the alternative energy industry is intense.


	 


	Our business plan involves acting as a consultant and making investments in alternative energy projects. This business is highly competitive. There are numerous similar companies seeking such investments in the United States of America. Our competitors will have greater financial resources and more expertise in this business. Our ability to develop our business will depend on our ability to successfully develop investments in this highly competitive environment. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so successfully.





	The share control position of WestMountain Green, LLC will limit the ability of other shareholders to influence corporate actions.


	 



	            

	Our largest shareholder, WestMountain Green, LLC, of which Mr. Klemsz is a 16.8% member, owns 8,050,000 shares and thereby controls approximately 90% of our outstanding shares. Because WestMountain Green, LLC individually beneficially controls more than a majority of the outstanding shares, other shareholders, individually or as a group, will be limited in their ability to effectively influence the election or removal of our directors, the supervision and management of our business or a change in control of or sale of our company, even if they believed such changes were in the best interest of our shareholders.  





	Our future success depends, in large part, on the continued service of our President and Treasurer and the continued financing of WestMountain Green, LLC.


	 


	             We depend almost entirely on the efforts and continued employment of Mr. Klemsz, our President and Treasurer. Mr. Klemsz is our primary executive officer, and we will depend on him for nearly all aspects of our operations. In addition, WestMountain Green, LLC, is our only source of external financing. We do not have an employment contract with Mr. Klemsz, and we do not carry key person insurance on his life. The loss of the services of Mr. Klemsz through incapacity or otherwise, would have a material adverse effect on our business. It would be very difficult to find and retain qualified personnel such as Mr. Klemsz and a financing source to replace WestMountain Green, LLC

	.

	At the present time, there is no contractual commitment for WestMountain Green, LLC to fund us.





	Our revenue and profitability fluctuate, particularly inasmuch as we cannot predict the timing of realization events in developing future investments, which may make it difficult for us to achieve steady earnings growth on a quarterly basis and may cause volatility in the price of our shares.





	We may experience significant variations in revenues and profitability during the year

	based upon potential future equity investments we may develop . If we engage in future equity investments,

	the timing and receipt of income generated by bringing new alternative energy projects to market is event driven and thus highly variable, which contributes to the volatility of our revenue, and our ability to realize incentive income from our

	potential

	funds may be limited. We cannot predict when, or if, any realization of

	any potential

	investments will occur. If we were to have a realization event in a particular quarter, it may have a significant impact on our revenues and profits for that particular quarter which may not be replicated in subsequent quarters. In addition, our

	potential

	equity investments

	would be

	adjusted for accounting purposes to fair value at the end of each quarter, resulting in revenue attributable to our

	potential

	principal investments, even though we

	would

	receive no cash distributions from our equity funds, which could increase the volatility of our quarterly earnings.

	We have no such equity investments at this time.





	 


	 


	 


	 


	 




	- 7 -








	 


	 





	Difficult market conditions can adversely affect our funds in many ways, including reducing the value or performance of the investments we make in our investments and reducing the ability of our company to raise or deploy capital, which could materially reduce our revenue and results of operations.





	If economic conditions are unfavorable our projects may not perform well and we may not be able to raise money in existing or new projects. Our investments will be materially affected by conditions in the global financial markets and economic conditions throughout the world. The global market and economic climate may deteriorate because of many factors beyond our control, including rising interest rates or inflation, terrorism or political uncertainty. In the event of a market downturn, our businesses could be affected in different ways.





	A general market downturn, or a specific market dislocation, may cause our revenue and results of operations to decline by causing: 


	 





	 



	•




	The value of our investments to decrease;












	 



	•




	lower investment returns, reducing incentive income; and












	 



	•




	material reductions in the value of our ownership in investments.






	 


	Furthermore, while difficult market conditions may increase opportunities to make certain alternative energy investments, such conditions also increase the risk of default with respect to investments held by us with debt investments.





	The success of our business depends, in part, upon proprietary technologies and information which may be difficult to protect and may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties.





	We believe that the identification, acquisition and development of proprietary technologies are key drivers of our business. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain patents, license the patents of others, maintain the secrecy of our proprietary technology and information, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties. We currently do not license any patents. We cannot assure you that the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business, that the patents that we license will provide us with competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties, that we will acquire additional proprietary technology that is patentable or that any patents issued to us will provide us with competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties. Further, we cannot assure you that others will not independently develop similar or superior technologies, duplicate elements of any technology we may own or design around it.





	In order to successfully commercialize any proprietary technologies, it is possible that we may need to acquire licenses to, or to contest the validity of, issued or pending patents or claims of third parties. We cannot assure you that any license acquired under such patents would be made available to us on acceptable terms, if at all, or that we would prevail in any such contest. In addition, we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves in suits brought against us for alleged infringement of another party’s patents or in defending the validity or enforceability of our patents, or in bringing patent infringement suits against other parties based on our patents.





	In addition to the protection afforded by patents, we may also rely on trade secrets, proprietary know-how and technology that we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our prospective joint venture partners, employees and consultants. We cannot assure you that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any such breach, or that our trade secrets and proprietary know-how will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by others.

	Because we are smaller and have fewer financial and other resources than many alternative energy companies, we may not be able to successfully compete in the very competitive alternative energy industry.





	Alternative energy functions as a commodity. There is significant competition among existing alternative energy producers. Our business could face competition from a number of producers that can produce significantly greater volumes of alternative energy than we can or expect to produce, producers that can produce a wider range of products than we can, and producers that have the financial and other resources that would enable them to expand their production rapidly if they chose to. These producers may be able to achieve substantial economies of scale and scope, thereby substantially reducing their fixed production costs and their marginal productions costs. If these producers are able to substantially reduce their marginal production costs, the market price of alternative energy products may decline and we may not be able to produce alternative energy products at a cost that allows us to operate profitably. Even if we are able to operate profitably, these other producers may be substantially more profitable than us, which may make it more difficult for us to raise any financing necessary for us to achieve our business plan and may have a materially adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.





	Increased alternative energy production in the United States could increase the demand for feedstocks and the resulting price of feedstocks, reducing our profitability.





	New alternative energy

	 

	projects are under construction throughout the United States. Increased production from alternative energy sources could increase feedstock demand and prices, resulting in higher production costs and lower profits.


	 


	Price increases or interruptions in needed energy supplies could cause loss of customers and impair our profitability.


	 


	Alternative energy production requires a constant and consistent supply of energy. If there is any interruption in our supply of energy for whatever reason, such as availability, delivery or mechanical problems, we may be required to halt production. If we halt production for any extended period of time, it will have a material, adverse effect on our business. Natural gas and electricity prices have historically fluctuated significantly. We expect to purchase significant amounts of these resources as part of our alternative energy production. Increases in the price of natural gas or electricity would harm our business and financial results by increasing our energy costs.


	 


	Risks Related to Government Regulation and Subsidization





	The United States alternative energy industry is highly dependent upon federal and state legislation and regulation and any changes in that legislation or regulation could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. The elimination or significant reduction in the federal tax incentive could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.


	 


	The production of alternative energy has historically been related to federal tax incentives. The elimination or significant reduction in the federal tax incentives on any or all alternative energy projects could negatively impact or proposed operations.

	Lax enforcement of environmental and energy policy regulations may adversely affect the demand for alternative energy products.


	 


	Our success will depend, in part, on effective enforcement of existing environmental and energy policy regulations. Many of our potential customers are unlikely to switch from the use of conventional fuels unless compliance with applicable regulatory requirements leads, directly or indirectly, to the use of alternative energy. Both additional regulation and enforcement of such regulatory provisions are likely to be vigorously opposed by the entities affected by such requirements. If existing emissions-reducing standards are weakened, or if governments are not active and effective in enforcing such standards, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. Even if the current trend toward more stringent emissions standards continues, our future prospects will depend on the ability of alternative energy to satisfy these emissions standards more efficiently than other existing technologies. Certain standards imposed by regulatory programs may limit or preclude the use of our products to comply with environmental or energy requirements. Any decrease in the emission standards or the failure to enforce existing emission standards and other regulations could result in a reduced demand for alternative energy products. A significant decrease in the demand for alternative energy products will reduce the price of such products, adversely affect our profitability and decrease the value of your stock.


	 


	Costs of compliance with burdensome or changing environmental and operational safety regulations could cause our focus to be diverted away from our business and our results of operations to suffer.


	 


	We expect to be subject to complicated environmental regulations of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and regulations and permitting requirements of the various states with respect to our alternative energy projects. These regulations are subject to change and such changes may require additional capital expenditures or increased operating costs. Consequently, considerable resources may be required to comply with future environmental regulations. We do not currently expect to incur material capital expenditures for environmental controls in this or the succeeding fiscal year. In addition, our proposed projects could be subject to environmental nuisance or related claims by employees, property owners or residents near our projects arising from air or water discharges. Environmental and public nuisance claims, or tort claims based on emissions, or increased environmental compliance costs could significantly increase our operating costs.


	 


	Any new alternative energy plants will be subject to federal and state laws regarding occupational safety. Risks of substantial compliance costs and liabilities are inherent in alternative energy production. We may be subject to costs and liabilities related to worker safety and job related injuries, some of which may be significant. Possible future developments, including stricter safety laws for workers and other individuals, regulations and enforcement policies and claims for personal or property damages resulting from operation of our projects could reduce the amount of cash that would otherwise be available to further enhance our business.





	 


	Risks Related to an Investment in Our Common Stock


	 


	The lack of a broker or dealer to create or maintain a market in our stock could adversely impact the price and liquidity of our securities.


	 


	      We have no agreement with any broker or dealer to act as a market maker for our securities and there is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining any market makers. Thus, no broker or dealer will have an incentive to make a market for our stock. The lack of a market maker for our securities could adversely influence the market for and price of our securities, as well as your ability to dispose of, or to obtain accurate information about, and/or quotations as to the price of, our securities.





	We have limited experience as a public company.


	 


	We have only operated as a public company since January, 2009. We trade

	on a limited basis

	on the OTC Bulletin Board under the trading symbol WETM. Thus, we have limited experience in complying with the various rules and regulations which are required of a public company. As a result, we may not be able to operate successfully as a public company, even if our operations are successful. We plan to comply with all of the various rules and regulations which are required of a public company. However, if we cannot operate successfully as a public company, your investment may be materially adversely affected. Our inability to operate successfully as a public company could be the basis of your losing your entire investment in us.

	We may be required to register under the Investment Company Act of 1940, or the Investment Advisors Act, which could increase the regulatory burden on us and could negatively affect the price and trading of our securities.





	Because our proposed business involves, in part, the identification, acquisition and development of alternative energy investments, we may be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 or the Investment Advisors Act and analogous state law. While we believe that we are currently either not an investment company or an investment advisor or are exempt from registration as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 or the Investment Advisors Act and analogous state law, either the SEC or state regulators, or both, may disagree and could require registration either immediately or at some point in the future. As a result, there could be an increased regulatory burden on us which could negatively affect the price and trading of our securities.





	We may be impacted by new regulatory requirements as a result of the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act.





	In July, 2010, Congress enacted the Dodd-Frank Act, which instituted major changes in the regulatory regime for public companies, particularly those in the financial sector. At the present time, we do not believe that we will be impacted in a material way by this legislation. However, the implementation of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to regulations which have not yet been written and its statutory provisions have not been the subject of extensive judicial review, so we cannot guarantee that we may not come under its purview at some point in the future and be affected negatively by it.





	Our stock has a limited public trading market and there is no guarantee a trading market will ever develop for our securities.





	There has been, and continues to be, a limited public market for our common stock. An active trading market for our shares has not, and may never develop or be sustained. If you purchase shares of common stock, you may not be able to resell those shares at or above the initial price you paid. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the following:






	 *    actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;





	 *    changes in financial estimates by securities analysts or our failure to perform in line with such estimates;





	 *    changes in market valuations of other companies, particularly those that market services such as ours;





	 *    announcements by us or our competitors of significant innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;





	 *    introduction of product enhancements that reduce the need for the products our projects may develop;





	 *    departures of key personnel.


	 



	Of our total outstanding shares as of December 31, 2016, a total of 8,325,000, or approximately 91.4%, are restricted from immediate resale but are potentially available to be sold into the market under Rule 144. This could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.


	 


	      As restrictions on resale end, the market price of our stock could drop significantly if the holders of restricted shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them.

	Applicable SEC rules governing the trading of "Penny Stocks" limit the liquidity of our common stock, which may affect the trading price of our common stock.





	Our common stock currently trades from time to time and always below $5.00 per share. As a result, our common stock is considered a "penny stock" and is subject to SEC rules and regulations that impose limitations upon the manner in which our shares can be publicly traded.  These regulations require the delivery, prior to any transaction involving a penny stock, of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock and the associated risks.  Under these regulations, certain brokers who recommend such securities to persons other than established customers or certain accredited investors must make a special written suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the written purchaser's agreement to a transaction prior to purchase.  These regulations have the effect of limiting the trading activity of our common stock and reducing the liquidity of an investment in our common stock.





	The over-the-counter market for stock such as ours is subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations.





	The securities of companies such as ours have historically experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations during certain periods. These broad market fluctuations and other factors, such as new product developments and trends in the our industry and in the investment markets generally, as well as economic conditions and quarterly variations in our operational results, may have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock.





	Buying low-priced penny stocks is very risky and speculative.





	Our common shares are defined as a penny stock under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, and rules of the Commission. The Exchange Act and such penny stock rules generally impose additional sales practice and disclosure requirements on broker-dealers who sell our securities to persons other than certain accredited investors who are, generally, institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with net worth in excess of $1,000,000, exclusive of the value of principal residence, or annual income exceeding $200,000, or $300,000 jointly with spouse, or in transactions not recommended by the broker-dealer. For transactions covered by the penny stock rules, a broker-dealer must make a suitability determination for each purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement prior to the sale. In addition, the broker-dealer must make certain mandated disclosures in penny stock transactions, including the actual sale or purchase price and actual bid and offer quotations, the compensation to be received by the broker-dealer and certain associated persons, and deliver certain disclosures required by the Commission. Consequently, the penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to make a market in or trade our common stock and may also affect your ability to resell any shares you may purchase in the public markets.





	Issuances of our stock could dilute current shareholders and adversely affect the market price of our common stock, if an active public trading market develops.





	We have the authority to issue up to 100,000,000 shares of common stock, 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, and to issue options and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock without stockholder approval. Although no financing is planned currently, we may need to raise additional capital to fund operating losses. If we raise funds by issuing equity securities, our existing stockholders may experience substantial dilution. In addition, we could issue large blocks of our common stock to fend off unwanted tender offers or hostile takeovers without further stockholder approval.





	The issuance of preferred stock by our board of directors could adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock. An issuance of preferred stock could result in a class of outstanding securities that would have preferences with respect to voting rights and dividends and in liquidation over the common stock and could, upon conversion or otherwise, have all of the rights of our common stock. Our board of directors' authority to issue preferred stock could discourage potential takeover attempts or could delay or prevent a change in control through merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise by making these attempts more difficult or costly to achieve.

	Colorado law and our Articles of Incorporation protect our directors from certain types of lawsuits, which could make it difficult for us to recover damages from them in the event of a lawsuit.


	 


	       Colorado law provides that our directors will not be liable to our company or to our stockholders for monetary damages for all but certain types of conduct as directors. Our Articles of Incorporation require us to indemnify our directors and officers against all damages incurred in connection with our business to the fullest extent provided or allowed by law. The exculpation provisions may have the effect of preventing stockholders from recovering damages against our directors caused by their negligence, poor judgment or other circumstances. The indemnification provisions may require our company to use our assets to defend our directors and officers against claims, including claims arising out of their negligence, poor judgment, or other circumstances.





	We do not expect to pay dividends on common stock.





	We have not paid any cash dividends with respect to our common stock, and it is unlikely that we will pay any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Earnings, if any, that we may realize will be retained in the business for further development and expansion.

	The Securities Enforcement and Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990





	The Securities and Exchange Commission has also adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 (other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the Nasdaq system, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system).


	 


	A purchaser is purchasing penny stock which limits the ability to sell the stock. Our shares will remain penny stocks for the foreseeable future. The classification of penny stock makes it more difficult for a broker-dealer to sell the stock into a secondary market, which makes it more difficult for a purchaser to liquidate his/her investment. Any broker-dealer engaged by the purchaser for the purpose of selling his or her shares in us will be subject to Rules 15g-1 through 15g-10 of the Securities and Exchange Act. Rather than creating a need to comply with those rules, some broker-dealers will refuse to attempt to sell penny stock.





	The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the Commission, which:


	 





	 



	•




	contains a description of the nature and level of risk in the market for penny stocks in both public offerings and secondary trading;












	 



	•




	contains a description of the broker's or dealer's duties to the customer and of the rights and remedies available to the customer with respect to a violation to such duties or other requirements of the Securities Act of 1934, as amended;






	 





	 



	•




	contains a brief, clear, narrative description of a dealer market, including "bid" and "ask" prices for penny stocks and the significance of the spread between the bid and ask price;












	 



	•




	contains a toll-free telephone number for inquiries on disciplinary actions;












	 



	•




	defines significant terms in the disclosure document or in the conduct of trading penny stocks; and






	 





	 



	•




	contains such other information and is in such form (including language, type, size and format) as the Securities and Exchange Commission shall require by rule or regulation;






	 


	 


	 


	 




	- 14 -








	 


	 






	   

	      The broker-dealer also must provide, prior to effecting any transaction in a penny stock, to the customer:


	 





	 



	•




	the bid and offer quotations for the penny stock;












	 



	•




	the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction;












	 



	•




	the number of shares to which such bid and ask prices apply, or other comparable information relating to the depth and liquidity of the market for such stock; and






	 





	 



	•




	 monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account.






	 



	   

	      In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules; the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement, a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks, and a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement. These disclosure requirements will have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our stock because it will be subject to these penny stock rules. Therefore, stockholders may have difficulty selling their securities.

The payment of dividends on our common stock is within the discretion of our board of directors. We intend to retain any earnings for use in our operations and the expansion of our business. Payment of dividends in the future will depend on our future earnings, future capital needs and our operating and financial condition, among other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. We are not under any contractual restriction as to our present or future ability to pay dividends.

	The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes included in this report.






	General




	We plan to make early stage investments that will bring alternative energy technologies to commercialization, and then actively manage these investments. We also currently are in the business to provide consulting to clients with respect to their investments in alternative energy projects. We have lost our only management services client, effective December 31, 2013.  Historically, we earned management fees based on the size of the funds managed, and incentive income based on the performance of the funds. With the cessation of the asset management services contract between us and EastMountain Alternative Energy, LLC, we no longer provide asset management services to any clients and have no current revenue source going forward. While we have lost our only current source of revenue, we have been pursuing new clients to replace the lost revenue stream and also exploring the possibility of merging with an existing company who has revenues and, potentially, earnings. At this time, we have no definitive arrangements for either replacing our lost revenue or identifying a merger candidate.





	As to our investments, we will not limit ourselves to any single area of alternative energy. We will look at any and all forms of alternative energy. We actively screen investments with emphasis towards finding opportunities with potential for long term success.





	Our principal business address is 1001-A E. Harmony Road, #366, Fort Collins, Colorado 80525. Our phone number is (970) 223-4499. We operate out of one office in Colorado. We have no specific plans at this point for additional offices.  





	Bohemian Companies, LLC and BOCO Investments, LLC are two companies under common control.  Mr. Klemsz, our President, has been the Chief Investment Officer of BOCO Investments, LLC since March 2007.  Since there is common control between the two companies and a relationship with our Company President, we are considering all transactions with Bohemian Companies, LLC and BOCO Investments, LLC. related party transactions.





	We have not been subject to any bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings.





	Results of Operations





	 For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had revenues of $-0-.





	For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, operating expenses were $52,999 and $63,499, respectively. The major component of general and administrative expenses is professional fees.





	For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had a net loss of $52,859 and net loss of $63,376 respectively.   In 2016 and 2015, the Company booked a full tax allowance against its deferred tax asset.





	  Our ability to maintain profitability and positive cash flow is dependent upon our ability our ability to generate revenues, and to a lesser extent, to successfully develop investments.



	 





	 


	 


	 




	- 16 -








	 










	To try to operate at a break-even level based upon our current level of proposed business activity, we believe that we must generate approximately $60,000 in revenue per year. However, if our forecasts are inaccurate, we will need to raise additional funds.





	In addition, we expect that we will need to raise additional funds if we decide to pursue more rapid expansion, the development of new or enhanced services or products, appropriate responses to competitive pressures, or the acquisition of complementary businesses or technologies, or if we must respond to unanticipated events that require us to make additional investments. We cannot assure that additional financing will be available when needed on favorable terms, or at all.





	We expect to incur operating profits in future periods when we have developed new revenue sources. Currently, we continue to incur operating losses and expect to do so until we can develop a reliable revenue source.







	Liquidity and Capital Resources.





	As of December 31, 2016, we had cash of $138,812 and $155,854 in certificates of deposit.





	For the year ended December 31, 2016 net cash used in operating activities was $47,510, while for the year ended December 31, 2015 net cash used by operating activities was $48,880.  





	For the year ended December 31, 2016 net cash used in investing activities was $140 while for the year ended December 31, 2015 we had net cash provided by investing activities of $49,878. In 2015, the Company transferred $49,878 from a certificate of deposit account into a cash account. In the first quarter of 2016, the money was reinvested into another certificate of deposit account.





	For the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 we had net cash provided by financing activities of $0.





	Currently, we believe that we have sufficient capital to sustain our business operations through December 31, 2017.

	  We have been seeking replacement clients, although we have no definite arrangements at this point. In the alternative, we may seek a merger candidate, although we have not identified any definitive acquisitions at this time. We do not anticipate needing to raise additional capital resources in the next twelve months.






	Our principal source of liquidity historically was our cash flow generated from our operations. Our business activity is closely tied to the U.S. economy. Our ability to maintain profitability and positive cash flow is dependent upon our ability to successfully develop alternative energy investments, provide consulting to related parties with respect to their investments in alternative energy projects and our ability to generate revenues.


	 






	In any case, we try to operate with minimal overhead. Our primary activity will be to seek to develop alternative energy investments and, consequently, increase our revenues. We cannot guarantee that this will ever occur. Our plan is to build our company in any manner which will be successful.

	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements





	We have no off-balance sheet arrangements with any party.





	Critical Accounting Policies





	Our discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis, including those related to provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable, inventories, valuation of intangible assets and contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.





	The accounting policies that we follow are set forth in Note 1 to our financial statements as included in this prospectus. These accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the financial statements.


	 


	Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements






	On August 27, 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, which is intended to define management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. This standard is effective for the Company for the year ending on December 31, 2016. The adoption of ASU No. 2014-15 did not have an impact on our financial statements.





	 In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, "Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes." This update requires an entity to classify deferred tax liabilities and assets as non-current within a classified statement of financial position. ASU 2015-17 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods therein, beginning after December 15, 2016. This update may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. Early application is permitted as of the beginning of the interim or annual reporting period. We adopted ASU 2015-17 on a prospective basis as of December 31, 2015. The adoption of ASU 2015-17 did not have an impact on our financial statements.





	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which supersedes previous revenue recognition guidance. This standard introduces a new five-step revenue recognition model in which an entity should recognize revenue. The new standard requires that a company recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Companies will need to use more judgment and estimates than under the guidance currently in effect, including estimating the amount of variable revenue to recognize over each identified performance obligation. Additional disclosures will be required to help users of financial statements understand the nature, amount and timing of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts. This standard will become effective for WestMountain Alternative Energy, Inc. beginning with the first quarter 2018 and can be adopted either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or as a cumulative effect adjustment as of the date of adoption.

	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM











	Stockholders and Board of Directors


	WestMountain Alternative Energy, Inc.


	Fort Collins, Colorado









	We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of WestMountain Alternative Energy, Inc. (the "Company") as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related statements of operations, changes in shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the years then ended.  The Company's management is responsible for these financial statements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.


	 


	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.


	  


	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of WestMountain Alternative Energy, Inc. as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

	Notes

	to the Financial Statements


	 










	1)   


	 

	Nature of Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies






	Nature of Organization and Basis of Presentation


	WestMountain Alternative Energy, Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated in the state of Colorado on November 13, 2007 and on this date approved its business plan and commenced operations. 






	Use of Estimates


	The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.





	Cash and Cash Equivalents


	The Company considers all highly liquid securities with original maturities of three months or less when acquired to be cash equivalents.  As of December 31, 2016 and 2015 there were no cash equivalents. 





	Accounts Receivable


	Accounts receivable consists of amounts due from the management fees. The Company considers accounts more than 30 days old to be past due. The Company uses the allowance method for recognizing bad debts. When an account is deemed uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance. Management records reasonable allowances to fairly represent accounts receivable amounts that are collectable.  For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company did not consider an allowance for doubtful accounts necessary.





	Revenue


	The Company plans to generate revenue by earning consulting fees and raising, investing and managing private equity and direct investment funds for high net worth individuals and institutions. Revenue is recognized through management fees based on the size of the funds that are managed and incentive income based on the performance of these funds.





	Incentive revenue is recognized under the full accrual method. Under the full accrual method, profit may be realized in full when funds are invested and managed, provided (1) the profit is determinable and (2) the earnings process is virtually complete (the Company is not obligated to perform significant activities).





	Fair Value of Financial Instruments


	The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, certificates of deposit, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities, as reflected in the balance sheets, approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments.





	Property and Equipment


	Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, ranging from three to seven years. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense when incurred. Expenditures for major renewals and betterments, which extend the useful lives of existing property and equipment, are capitalized and depreciated. Upon retirement or disposition of property and equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in the statements of operations.





	Income Taxes


	The Company recognizes deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.  Considerable judgment is required in determining when these events may occur and whether recovery of an asset, including the utilization of a net operating loss or other carryforward prior to its expiration, is more likely than not.

	WestMountain Alternative Energy, Inc.


	Notes to the Financial Statements


	 






	(1)    Nature of Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)







	The Company has analyzed filing positions in all of the federal and state jurisdictions where it is required to file income tax returns, as well as all open tax years in these jurisdictions.  The Company has identified its federal tax return and its state tax return in Colorado as "major" tax jurisdictions, as defined.  The tax years 2011-2015 remain open to examination.  We are not currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service or any other jurisdiction.  The Company believes that its income tax filing positions and deductions will be sustained on audit and does not anticipate any adjustments that will result in a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, or cash flow.  Therefore, no reserves for uncertain income tax positions have been recorded. 





	Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements





	On August 27, 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, which is intended to define management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. This standard is effective for the Company for the year ending on December 31, 2016. The adoption of ASU No. 2014-15 did not have an impact on our financial statements.





	 In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, "Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes." This update requires an entity to classify deferred tax liabilities and assets as non-current within a classified statement of financial position. ASU 2015-17 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods therein, beginning after December 15, 2016. This update may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. Early application is permitted as of the beginning of the interim or annual reporting period. We adopted ASU 2015-17 on a prospective basis as of December 31, 2015. The adoption of ASU 2015-17 did not have an impact on our financial statements.





	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which supersedes previous revenue recognition guidance. This standard introduces a new five-step revenue recognition model in which an entity should recognize revenue. The new standard requires that a company recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Companies will need to use more judgment and estimates than under the guidance currently in effect, including estimating the amount of variable revenue to recognize over each identified performance obligation. Additional disclosures will be required to help users of financial statements understand the nature, amount and timing of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts. This standard will become effective for WestMountain Alternative Energy, Inc. beginning with the first quarter 2018 and can be adopted either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or as a cumulative effect adjustment as of the date of adoption.








	 

	(2)   Certificates of Deposit






	The Company has made it a policy to invest funds over and above the forecasted operating expenses in certificates of deposit.  Certificate of deposits typically have contractual maturities of 90-180 days.








	(3)  Property and Equipment





	The Company's property and equipment consists of a computer and related software.  As of December 31, 2016, the net cost of property and equipment was $0 and $2,280, respectively.  For each of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded $2,280 and $4,654 in depreciation expense.

	Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.





	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.

	i.            pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;


	ii.            provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of our  consolidated financial statements in  accordance with U. S. generally accepted accounting principles, and  that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with  authorizations of our management and directors; and


	iii.           provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.


	 



	Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework.





	Management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2016.




	Inherent Limitations Over Internal Controls





	Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and circumvention by collusion or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even an effective internal control system may not prevent or detect material misstatements on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.


	 


	Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.





	We have made no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

	Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements


	(Unaudited)




	 



	 


	(1) Nature of Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies



	 



	Nature of Organization and Basis of Presentation



	 



	WestMountain Alternative Energy, Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated in the state of Colorado on November 13, 2007 and on this date approved its business plan and commenced operations. 





	Unaudited Interim Condensed Financial Statements


	 


	The accompanying interim financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") for quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and do not include all of the information and note disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles. These financial statements and notes herein are unaudited, but in the opinion of management, include all the adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the Company's financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the periods presented. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 as filed with the SEC. Interim operating results are not necessarily indicative of operating results for any future interim period or for the full year.






	Cash and Cash Equivalents



	The Company considers all highly liquid securities with original maturities of three months or less when acquired to be cash equivalents.


	 



	Income Taxes



	Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future income tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or income tax returns. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse.






	In evaluating the ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax assets will be realized. Management establishes a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred income tax assets will not be utilized. The ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income, which must occur prior to the expiration of the net operating loss carry forwards. As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Company has provided a full valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets.





	Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements




	On August 27, 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, which is intended to define management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. This standard is effective for the Company for the year ending on December 31, 2016. The adoption of ASU No. 2014-15 did not have an impact on our financial statements.






	 In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, "Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes." This update requires an entity to classify deferred tax liabilities and assets as non-current within a classified statement of financial position. ASU 2015-17 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods therein, beginning after December 15, 2016. This update may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. Early application is permitted as of the beginning of the interim or annual reporting period. We adopted ASU 2015-17 in the first quarter of 2017. The adoption of ASU 2015-17 did not have an impact on our financial statements.

	WestMountain Alternative Energy, Inc.


	Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements


	(Unaudited)






	 




	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which supersedes previous revenue recognition guidance. This standard introduces a new five-step revenue recognition model in which an entity should

	 

	recognize revenue. The new standard requires that a company recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Companies will need to use more judgment and estimates than under the guidance currently in effect, including estimating the amount of variable revenue to recognize over each identified performance obligation. Additional disclosures will be required to help users of financial statements understand the nature, amount and timing of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts. This standard will become effective for WestMountain Alternative Energy, Inc. beginning with the first quarter 2018 and can be adopted either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or as a cumulative effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. Currently the Company has not recorded any revenue. As such, we do not expect this ASU to impact our financial reporting. Should we have revenue, we will review and disclose the expected impact at that time.


	 





	(2) Related Parties


	 



	The Company entered into an agreement with SP Business Solutions ("SP") to provide accounting and related services for the Company. The owner, Joni Troska, was appointed Secretary of WestMountain Alternative Energy, Inc. on March 19, 2010, and is considered to be a related party. Total expenses incurred with SP were $500 and $500 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As of March 31, 2017 an accrual of $500 has been recorded for unpaid services.

	ITEM 2.      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS AND PLAN OF OPERATION



	 


	The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by, the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in, Item 1 in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  This item contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.  Actual results may differ materially from those indicated in such forward-looking statements.






	Forward-Looking Statements


	 


	           This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the documents incorporated herein by reference contain forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, estimates, and projections about our industry, management beliefs, and certain assumptions made by our management.  Words such as "anticipates", "expects", "intends", "plans", "believes", "seeks", "estimates", variations of such words, and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements.  These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict; therefore, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in any such forward-looking statements.  Unless required by law, we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.   However, readers should carefully review the risk factors set forth herein and in other reports and documents that we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, particularly Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and any Current Reports on Form 8-K.


	 


	General


	 


	We plan to make early stage investments that will bring alternative energy technologies to commercialization, and then actively manage these investments. Historically we have acted as a consultant with respect to client investments in alternative energy projects. We performed due diligence and ongoing research and evaluation with respect to projects on a fee basis. We are not currently generating revenues as a consultant.





	EastMountain Alternative Energy, LLC, a related party, gave notice that, effective December 31, 2013 it would terminate the asset management services contract it had with us.  With the termination of the asset management services contract between us and EastMountain Alternative Energy, LLC, we no longer provide asset management services to any clients and have no current revenue source going forward. While we lost our only current source of revenue, we are pursuing new clients to replace the lost revenue stream and also exploring the possibility of merging with an existing company who has revenues and, potentially, earnings. At this time, we have no definitive arrangements for either replacing our lost revenue or identifying a merger candidate.


	 


	 



	 




	-8 -








	 


	 


	 


	As to our investments, we will not limit ourselves to any single area of alternative energy. We will look at any and all forms of alternative energy. We actively screen investments with emphasis towards finding opportunities with potential for long term success.





	Our principal executive offices are located at 1001-A E. Harmony Road, #366, Fort Collins, Colorado 80525.





	We have no specific plans at this point for additional offices.  





	We have not been subject to any bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceeding.


	 



	 



	Results of Operations


	 


	The following discussion involves our results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.





	We had revenues of $-0- for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.







	Operating expenses, consisting primarily of selling, general and administrative costs were $11,566 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to $13,906 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. Most of the costs were attributable to professional and contract services. We do not anticipate these professional fees or contract services to increase significantly in the near future.





	We had a net loss of $11,531 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to a net loss of $13,871 for the three months ended March 31, 2016.






	Liquidity and Capital Resources





	Our cash on March 31, 2017 was $122,555.  We had an additional amount of $155,889 in Certificates of Deposit. We anticipate that operating costs will range between $50,000 and $60,000, for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2017. These operating costs include insurance, taxes, utilities, maintenance, contract services and all other costs of operations. We will use contract employees who will be paid on an hourly basis as each investment transaction is evaluated. However, the operating costs and expected revenue generation are difficult to predict. We will use contract employees who will be paid on an hourly basis as each investment transaction is evaluated.





	Cash flows used in operating activities were $16,257 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to cash flows used in operating activities of $17,976 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. We had revenues of $-0- for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016. In March 2017, the Company paid annual fees of $8,000 to OTC Markets that was posted as a prepaid expense and was offset by $2,333 amortization expense to contract services on the income statement.


	 


	Cash flows provided by investing activities were $-0- for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.








	Cash flows provided by financing activities were $-0- for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016


	, respectively.






	Over the next twelve months we do not expect any material capital costs in our operations.





	Currently, we believe that we have sufficient capital in the next twelve months for our current level of operations. While we lost our only source of revenue, effective December 31, 2013, we continue to seek replacement clients, although we have no definite arrangements at this point. In the alternative, we may seek a merger candidate, although we have not identified any definitive acquisitions at this time. We do not anticipate needing to raise additional capital resources in the next twelve months.





	Our principal source of liquidity historically was our cash flow generated from our operations. Our business activity is closely tied to the U.S. economy. Our ability to maintain profitability and positive cash flow is dependent upon our ability to successfully develop alternative energy investments, provide consulting to related parties with respect to their investments in alternative energy projects and our ability to generate revenues.






	In any case, we try to operate with minimal overhead. Our primary activity will be to seek to develop alternative energy investments and, consequently, increase our revenues. We cannot guarantee that this will ever occur. Our plan is to build our company in any manner which will be successful.

	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

	 


	As of the end of the period covered by this report, based on an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a -15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) under the Exchange Act), our Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.





	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 


	There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.





	This report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.

	PART II.  OTHER INFORMATION







	ITEM 1.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS


	 



	There are no legal proceedings, to which we are a party, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.


	 







	ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS


	 


	 You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below; and all of the other information included in this document. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results and could negatively impact the value of your investment.


	 


	 The occurrence of any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating result. In this case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you might lose all or part of your investment.





	We have a limited operating history. While we have been profitable in the past, we were not profitable in our most recent fiscal year and recent fiscal quarter.  We may never be profitable again, and, as a result, we could go out of business.


	 


	We were formed as a Colorado business entity in November, 2007. While we have been profitable in the past, we were not profitable in our most recent fiscal year and recent fiscal quarter. We have lost our only current client and have not been able to replace the revenue. We cannot guarantee that we will be profitable again. If we do not continue to be profitable, we could go out of business.


	 


	We have relied upon one client for all of our revenues, which means that the loss of this client has severely impacted our operations. If we cannot replace the lost revenue or merge with a company, we could go out of business.





	In the past, one client accounted for 100% of our revenues. This client was a related party, EastMountain Alternative Energy, LLC. EastMountain Alternative Energy, LLC gave notice to us that, effective December 31, 2013, it planned to terminate the asset management services contract it had with us.  We have been and could continue to be materially impacted by the loss of this client. The loss of this one client makes us subject to uncertain revenue results. With the termination of the asset management services contract between us and EastMountain Alternative Energy, LLC, we no longer provide asset management services to any clients and have no current revenue source going forward. While we have lost our only source of revenue, we have been seeking additional clients to replace our lost revenue, although we have no definite arrangements at this point. In the alternative, we may seek a merger candidate, although we have not identified any definitive acquisitions at this time. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to replace our lost revenue or to identify a merger candidate. If we cannot either replace our lost revenue or identify a merger candidate, we may eventually cease business. An investor could lose his entire investment.


	 


	Our lack of operating history makes it difficult for us to evaluate our future business prospects and make decisions based on those estimates of our future performance. An investor could lose his entire investment.





	We have a limited operating history. An investor has no frame of reference to evaluate our future business prospects.  This makes it difficult, if not impossible, to evaluate us as an investment. An investor could lose his entire investment if our future business prospects do not result in profitability.







	 







	-11 -

















	If we do not generate adequate revenues to finance our operations, our business may fail.





	We began generating revenues in 2008. As of March 31, 2017, we had a cash position of $122,555 and an additional $155,889 in Certificates of Deposit. We anticipate that operating costs will range between $50,000 and $60,000, for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2017. These operating costs include insurance, taxes, utilities, maintenance, contract services and all other costs of operations. We will use contract employees who will be paid on an hourly basis as each investment transaction is evaluated. However, the operating costs and expected revenue generation are difficult to predict. We will use contract employees who will be paid on an hourly basis as each investment transaction is evaluated.





	However, the operating costs and expected revenue generation are difficult to predict. Since there can be no assurances that revenues will be sufficient to cover operating costs for the foreseeable future, it may be necessary to raise additional funds. Due to our lack of operating history, raising additional funds may be difficult.





	Competition in the alternative energy industry is intense.


	 


	 Our business plan involves making investments in alternative energy projects. This business is highly competitive. There are numerous similar companies seeking such investments in the United States of America. Our competitors will have greater financial resources and more expertise in this business. Our ability to develop our business will depend on our ability to successfully develop investments in this highly competitive environment. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so successfully.





	The share control position of WestMountain Green, LLC will limit the ability of other shareholders to influence corporate actions.


	 



	            

	Our largest shareholder, WestMountain Green, LLC, of which Mr. Klemsz is a 16.8% member, owns 8,050,000 shares and thereby controls approximately 90% of our outstanding shares. Because WestMountain Green, LLC individually beneficially controls more than a majority of the outstanding shares, other shareholders, individually or as a group, will be limited in their ability to effectively influence the election or removal of our directors, the supervision and management of our business or a change in control of or sale of our company, even if they believed such changes were in the best interest of our shareholders generally.


	 


	Our future success depends, in large part, on the continued service of our President and Treasurer and the continued financing of WestMountain Green, LLC.


	 


	             We depend almost entirely on the efforts and continued employment of Mr. Klemsz, our President and Treasurer. Mr. Klemsz is our primary executive officer, and we will depend on him for nearly all aspects of our operations. In addition, WestMountain Green, LLC, is our only source of external financing. We do not have an employment contract with Mr. Klemsz, and we do not carry key person insurance on his life. The loss of the services of Mr. Klemsz through incapacity or otherwise, would have a material adverse effect on our business. It would be very difficult to find and retain qualified personnel such as Mr. Klemsz and a financing source to replace WestMountain Green, LLC. At the present time, there is no contractual commitment for WestMountain Green, LLC. to fund us.





	Our revenue and profitability fluctuate, particularly inasmuch as we cannot predict the timing of realization events in developing future investments, which may make it difficult for us to achieve steady earnings growth on a quarterly basis and may cause volatility in the price of our shares.





	We may experience significant variations in revenues and profitability during the year. The timing and receipt of income generated by bringing new alternative energy projects to market is event driven and thus highly variable, which contributes to the volatility of our revenue, and our ability to realize incentive income from our funds may be limited. We cannot predict when, or if, any realization of investments will occur. If we were to have a realization event in a particular quarter, it may have a significant impact on our revenues and profits for that particular quarter which may not be replicated in subsequent quarters. In addition, our equity investments are adjusted for accounting purposes to fair value at the end of each quarter, resulting in revenue attributable to our principal investments, even though we receive no cash distributions from our equity funds, which could increase the volatility of our quarterly earnings.



	 



	 


	 


	 




	-12 -






	 


	 










	Difficult market conditions can adversely affect our funds in many ways, including reducing the value or performance of the investments we make in our investments and reducing the ability of our company to raise or deploy capital, which could materially reduce our revenue and results of operations.





	If economic conditions are unfavorable, our projects may not perform well and we may not be able to raise money in existing or new projects. Our investments will be materially affected by conditions in the global financial markets and economic conditions throughout the world. The global market and economic climate may deteriorate because of many factors beyond our control, including rising interest rates or inflation, terrorism or political uncertainty. In the event of a market downturn, our businesses could be affected in different ways.





	A general market downturn, or a specific market dislocation, may cause our revenue and results of operations to decline by causing:


	 




	 



	●




	The value of our investments to decrease;










	 



	●




	lower investment returns, reducing incentive income; and










	 



	●




	material reductions in the value of our ownership in investments.








	      Furthermore, while difficult market conditions may increase opportunities to make certain alternative energy investments, such conditions also increase the risk of default with respect to investments held by us with debt investments.


	 


	The success of our business depends, in part, upon proprietary technologies and information which may be difficult to protect and may infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties.





	We believe that the identification, acquisition and development of proprietary technologies are key drivers of our business. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain patents, license the patents of others, maintain the secrecy of our proprietary technology and information, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties. We currently do not license any patents. We cannot assure you that the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business, that the patents that we license will provide us with competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties, that we will acquire additional proprietary technology that is patentable or that any patents issued to us will provide us with competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties. Further, we cannot assure you that others will not independently develop similar or superior technologies, duplicate elements of any technology we may own or design around it.


	 


	In order to successfully commercialize any proprietary technologies, it is possible that we may need to acquire licenses to, or to contest the validity of, issued or pending patents or claims of third parties. We cannot assure you that any license acquired under such patents would be made available to us on acceptable terms, if at all, or that we would prevail in any such contest. In addition, we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves in suits brought against us for alleged infringement of another party's patents or in defending the validity or enforceability of our patents, or in bringing patent infringement suits against other parties based on our patents.





	In addition to the protection afforded by patents, we may also rely on trade secrets, proprietary know-how and technology that we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our prospective joint venture partners, employees and consultants. We cannot assure you that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any such breach, or that our trade secrets and proprietary know-how will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by others.

	Because we are smaller and have fewer financial and other resources than many alternative energy companies, we may not be able to successfully compete in the very competitive alternative energy industry.





	Alternative energy functions as a commodity. There is significant competition among existing alternative energy producers. Our business could face competition from a number of producers that can produce significantly greater volumes of alternative energy than we can or expect to produce, producers that can produce a wider range of products than we can, and producers that have the financial and other resources that would enable them to expand their production rapidly if they chose to. These producers may be able to achieve substantial economies of scale and scope, thereby substantially reducing their fixed production costs and their marginal productions costs. If these producers are able to substantially reduce their marginal production costs, the market price of alternative energy products may decline and we may not be able to produce alternative energy products at a cost that allows us to operate profitably. Even if we are able to operate profitably, these other producers may be substantially more profitable than us, which may make it more difficult for us to raise any financing necessary for us to achieve our business plan and may have a materially adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.





	Increased alternative energy production in the United States could increase the demand for feedstocks and the resulting price of feedstocks, reducing our profitability.





	New alternative energy

	 

	projects are under construction throughout the United States. Increased production from alternative energy sources could increase feedstock demand and prices, resulting in higher production costs and lower profits.


	 


	Price increases or interruptions in needed energy supplies could cause loss of customers and impair our profitability.


	 


	Alternative energy production requires a constant and consistent supply of energy. If there is any interruption in our supply of energy for whatever reason, such as availability, delivery or mechanical problems, we may be required to modify our operations. If we modify operations for any extended period of time, it will have a material, adverse effect on our business. Natural gas and electricity prices have historically fluctuated significantly. We expect to purchase significant amounts of these resources as part of our alternative energy production. Increases in the price of natural gas or electricity would harm our business and financial results by increasing our energy costs.


	 


	Risks Related to Government Regulation and Subsidization





	The United States alternative energy industry is highly dependent upon federal and state legislation and regulation and any changes in that legislation or regulation could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. The elimination or significant reduction in the federal tax incentive could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.


	 


	The production of alternative energy has historically been related to federal tax incentives. The elimination or significant reduction in the federal tax incentives on any or all alternative energy projects could negatively impact our proposed operations.





	Lax enforcement of environmental and energy policy regulations may adversely affect the demand for alternative energy products.


	 


	Our success will depend, in part, on effective enforcement of existing environmental and energy policy regulations. Many of our potential customers are unlikely to switch from the use of conventional fuels unless compliance with applicable regulatory requirements leads, directly or indirectly, to the use of alternative energy. Both additional regulation and enforcement of such regulatory provisions are likely to be vigorously opposed by the entities affected by such requirements. If existing emissions-reducing standards are weakened, or if governments are not active and effective in enforcing such standards, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. Even if the current trend toward more stringent emissions standards continues, our future prospects will depend on the ability of alternative energy to satisfy these emissions standards more efficiently than other existing technologies. Certain standards imposed by regulatory programs may limit or preclude the use of our products to comply with environmental or energy requirements. Any decrease in the emission standards or the failure to enforce existing emission standards and other regulations could result in a reduced demand for alternative energy products. A significant decrease in the demand for alternative energy products will reduce the price of such products, adversely affect our profitability and decrease the value of your stock.



	 


	 


	 




	-14 -






	 









	Costs of compliance with burdensome or changing environmental and operational safety regulations could cause our focus to be diverted away from our business and our results of operations to suffer.


	 


	We expect to be subject to complicated environmental regulations of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and regulations and permitting requirements of the various states with respect to our alternative energy projects. These regulations are subject to change and such changes may require additional capital expenditures or increased operating costs. Consequently, considerable resources may be required to comply with future environmental regulations. We do not currently expect to incur material capital expenditures for environmental controls in this or the succeeding fiscal year. In addition, our proposed projects could be subject to environmental nuisance or related claims by employees, property owners or residents near our projects arising from air or water discharges. Environmental and public nuisance claims, or tort claims based on emissions, or increased environmental compliance costs could significantly increase our operating costs.


	 


	Any new alternative energy plants will be subject to federal and state laws regarding occupational safety. Risks of substantial compliance costs and liabilities are inherent in alternative energy production. We may be subject to costs and liabilities related to worker safety and job related injuries, some of which may be significant. Possible future developments, including stricter safety laws for workers and other individuals, regulations and enforcement policies and claims for personal or property damages resulting from operation of our projects could reduce the amount of cash that would otherwise be available to further enhance our business.


	 


	Risks Related to an Investment in Our Common Stock


	 


	The lack of a broker or dealer to create or maintain a market in our stock could adversely impact the price and liquidity of our securities.


	 


	We have no agreement with any broker or dealer to act as a market maker for our securities and there is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining any market makers. Thus, no broker or dealer will have an incentive to make a market for our stock. The lack of a market maker for our securities could adversely influence the market for and price of our securities, as well as your ability to dispose of, or to obtain accurate information about, and/or quotations as to the price of, our securities.


	 


	We have limited experience as a public company.





	We have only operated as a public company since January, 2009. We trade on the OTC Bulletin Board under the trading symbol WETM. Thus, we have limited experience in complying with the various rules and regulations which are required of a public company. As a result, we may not be able to operate successfully as a public company, even if our operations are successful. We plan to comply with all of the various rules and regulations which are required of a public company. However, if we cannot operate successfully as a public company, your investment may be materially adversely affected. Our inability to operate as a public company could be the basis of your losing your entire investment in us.


	 


	We may be required to register under the Investment Company Act of 1940, or the Investment Advisors Act, which could increase the regulatory burden on us and could negatively affect the price and trading of our securities.





	Because our proposed business involves the identification, acquisition and development of alternative energy investments, we may be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 or the Investment Advisors Act and analogous state law. While we believe that we are currently either not an investment company or an investment advisor or are exempt from registration as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 or the Investment Advisors Act and analogous state law, either the SEC or state regulators, or both, may disagree and could require registration either immediately or at some point in the future. As a result, there could be an increased regulatory burden on us which could negatively affect the price and trading of our securities.



	 


	 


	 




	-15 -
















	We may be impacted by new regulatory requirements as a result of the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act.





	In July, 2010, Congress enacted the Dodd-Frank Act, which instituted major changes in the regulatory regime for public companies, particularly those in the financial sector. At the present time, we do not believe that we will be impacted in a material way by this legislation. However, the implementation of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to regulations which have not yet been written and its statutory provisions have not been the subject of extensive judicial review, so we cannot guarantee that we may not come under its purview at some point in the future and be affected negatively by it.





	Our stock has a limited public trading market and there is no guarantee a trading market will ever develop for our securities.





	There has been, and continues to be, a limited public market for our common stock. An active trading market for our shares has not, and may never develop or be sustained. If you purchase shares of common stock, you may not be able to resell those shares at or above the initial price you paid. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control, including the following:





	 *    actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;





	 *    changes in financial estimates by securities analysts or our failure to perform in line with such estimates;





	 *    changes in market valuations of other companies, particularly those that market services such as ours;





	*   announcements by us or our competitors of significant innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;





	 *    introduction of product enhancements that reduce the need for the products our projects may develop;





	 *    departures of key personnel.





	Of our total outstanding shares as of March 31, 2017, a total of 8,325,000, or approximately 91.4%, will be restricted from immediate resale but may be sold into the market in the near future. This could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.


	 


	As restrictions on resale end, the market price of our stock could drop significantly if the holders of restricted shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them.





	Applicable SEC rules governing the trading of "Penny Stocks" limit the liquidity of our common stock, which may affect the trading price of our common stock.


	 


	Our common stock currently trades from time to time and always below $5.00 per share. As a result, our common stock is considered a "penny stock" and is subject to SEC rules and regulations that impose limitations upon the manner in which our shares can be publicly traded.  These regulations require the delivery, prior to any transaction involving a penny stock, of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock and the associated risks.  Under these regulations, certain brokers who recommend such securities to persons other than established customers or certain accredited investors must make a special written suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the written purchaser's agreement to a transaction prior to purchase.  These regulations have the effect of limiting the trading activity of our common stock and reducing the liquidity of an investment in our common stock.


	 



	 


	 


	 




	-16 -



















	The over-the-counter market for stock such as ours is subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations.





	The securities of companies such as ours have historically experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations during certain periods. These broad market fluctuations and other factors, such as new product developments and trends in the industry and in the investment markets generally, as well as economic conditions and quarterly variations in our operational results, may have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock.





	Buying low-priced penny stocks is very risky and speculative.





	Our common shares are defined as a penny stock under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, and rules of the Commission. The Exchange Act and such penny stock rules generally impose additional sales practice and disclosure requirements on broker-dealers who sell our securities to persons other than certain accredited investors who are, generally, institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with net worth in excess of $1,000,000, exclusive of the value of principal residence, or annual income exceeding $200,000, or $300,000 jointly with spouse, or in transactions not recommended by the broker-dealer. For transactions covered by the penny stock rules, a broker-dealer must make a suitability determination for each purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement prior to the sale. In addition, the broker-dealer must make certain mandated disclosures in penny stock transactions, including the actual sale or purchase price and actual bid and offer quotations, the compensation to be received by the broker-dealer and certain associated persons, and deliver certain disclosures required by the Commission. Consequently, the penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to make a market in or trade our common stock and may also affect your ability to resell any shares you may purchase in the public markets.


	 


	Issuances of our stock could dilute current shareholders and adversely affect the market price of our common stock, if an active public trading market develops.


	 


	   We have the authority to issue up to 100,000,000 shares of common stock, 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, and to issue options and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock without stockholder approval. Although no financing is planned currently, we may need to raise additional capital to fund operating losses. If we raise funds by issuing equity securities, our existing stockholders may experience substantial dilution. In addition, we could issue large blocks of our common stock to fend off unwanted tender offers or hostile takeovers without further stockholder approval.





	               The issuance of preferred stock by our board of directors could adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock. An issuance of preferred stock could result in a class of outstanding securities that would have preferences with respect to voting rights and dividends and in liquidation over the common stock and could, upon conversion or otherwise, have all of the rights of our common stock. Our board of directors' authority to issue preferred stock could discourage potential takeover attempts or could delay or prevent a change in control through merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise by making these attempts more difficult or costly to achieve.


	 


	Colorado law and our Articles of Incorporation protect our directors from certain types of lawsuits, which could make it difficult for us to recover damages from them in the event of a lawsuit.


	 


	   Colorado law provides that our directors will not be liable to our company or to our stockholders for monetary damages for all but certain types of conduct as directors. Our Articles of Incorporation require us to indemnify our directors and officers against all damages incurred in connection with our business to the fullest extent provided or allowed by law. The exculpation provisions may have the effect of preventing stockholders from recovering damages against our directors caused by their negligence, poor judgment or other circumstances. The indemnification provisions may require our company to use our assets to defend our directors and officers against claims, including claims arising out of their negligence, poor judgment, or other circumstances.






	We do not expect to pay dividends on common stock.





	We have not paid any cash dividends with respect to our common stock, and it is unlikely that we will pay any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Earnings, if any, that we may realize will be retained in the business for further development and expansion.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Notes to
the Financial Statements

(
Unaudited)

 

 

 

(1) Nature
of Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies

 

Nature of
Organization and Basis of Presentation

 

WestMountain
Alternative Energy, Inc. (the “Company”) was
incorporated in the state of Colorado on November 13, 2007 and on
this date approved its business plan and commenced operations. The
Company was in the development stage through December 31,
2010.

 

The
accompanying interim financial statements have been prepared
pursuant to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the "SEC") for quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and do not include
all of the information and note disclosures required by generally
accepted accounting principles. These financial statements and
notes herein are unaudited, but in the opinion of management,
include all the adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring
adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the
Company’s financial position, results of operations, and cash
flows for the periods presented. These financial statements should
be read in conjunction with the Company's audited financial
statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010 as filed with the SEC.
Interim operating results are not necessarily indicative of
operating results for any future interim period or for the full
year.

 

Cash and
Cash Equivalents

The
Company considers all highly liquid securities with original
maturities of three months or less when acquired to be cash
equivalents. At June 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, the Company
had no cash equivalents.

 

Income
Taxes

The
Company recognizes deferred tax liabilities and assets for the
expected future tax consequences of events that have been included
in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method,
deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the
difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets
and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in
which the differences are expected to reverse.

 

The
Company has analyzed filing positions in all of the federal and
state jurisdictions where it is required to file income tax
returns, as well as all open tax years in these jurisdictions. The
Company has identified its federal tax return and its state tax
return in Colorado as “major” tax jurisdictions, as
defined. The tax year 2007 remains open to examination. We are not
currently under examination by the Internal Revenue Service or any
other jurisdiction. The Company believes that its income tax filing
positions and deductions will be sustained on audit and does not
anticipate any adjustments that will result in a material adverse
effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of
operations, or cash flow. Therefore, no reserves for uncertain
income tax positions have been recorded.

 

(2)
Certificates of Deposit

 

The
company has made it a policy to invest funds over and above the
forecasted operating expenses in certificates of deposit. The terms
on the certificates have ranged from three to six
months.

 

(3)
Related Parties

 

Bohemian
Companies, LLC and BOCO Investments, LLC are two companies under
common control. Mr. Klemsz, our President, has been the Chief
Investment Officer of BOCO Investments, LLC since March 2007. Since
there is common control between the two companies and a
relationship with our Company President, we are considering all
transactions with Bohemian Companies, LLC and BOCO Investments,
LLC, related party transactions.

Notes to
the Financial Statements

(Unaudited)

 

On January
1, 2008, we entered into a Service Agreement with Bohemian
Companies, LLC to provide us with certain defined services. These
services include financial, bookkeeping, accounting, legal and tax
matters, as well as cash management, custody of assets, preparation
of financial documents, including tax returns and checks, and
coordination of professional service providers as may be necessary
to carry out the matters covered by the Service Agreement. We
compensate Bohemian Companies, LLC by reimbursing this entity for
the allocable portion of the direct and indirect costs of each
employee of Bohemian Companies, LLC that performs services on our
behalf. We receive invoices monthly from Bohemian Companies, LLC.
This Service Agreement expires on December 31, 2011.  Total
expenses incurred with Bohemian Companies were $3,000 for each of
the quarters ended June 30, 2011 and 2010. As of June 30, 2011 the
Company had no balance due to Bohemian Companies, LLC.

 

We earn
management fees based on the size of the funds managed, and
incentive income based on the performance of the funds. For the
quarter ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, we recorded $31,250 and
$31,164, respectively in revenue for management fees charged to
EastMountain Alternative Energy, LLC, a related party through its
ownership interest in WestMountain Green, LLC. As of June 30, 2011,
we recorded $31,250 as an account receivable that represents the
2nd quarter management fees that are due to us from EastMountain
Alternative Energy, LLC. We expect the receivable to be paid prior
to the end of the third quarter 2011.

 

The
Company entered into an agreement with SP Business Solutions
(“SP”) to provide accounting and related services for
the Company. The owner, Joni Troska, was appointed Secretary of
WestMountain Alternative Energy, Inc on March 19, 2010, and is
considered to be a related party. As of June 30, 2011 an accrual of
$300 has been recorded for unpaid services.

 

(4)
Concentration of Credit Risk for Cash

 

The
Company has concentrated its credit risk for cash by maintaining
deposits in financial institutions, which may at times exceed the
amounts covered by insurance provided by the United States Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"). As of June 30, 2011, the
Company has no risk for the excess of the deposit liabilities
reported by the financial institution over the amount that would
have been covered by FDIC. The Company has not experienced any
losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any
significant credit risk to cash.

ITEM
2.   MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS AND
PLAN OF OPERATION

 

The
following discussion of our financial condition and results of
operations should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in
its entirety by, the consolidated financial statements and notes
thereto included in, Item 1 in this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q.  This item contains forward-looking statements that
involve risks and uncertainties.  Actual results may
differ materially from those indicated in such forward-looking
statements.

 

Forward-Looking

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the documents incorporated herein
by reference contain forward-looking statements. Such
forward-looking statements are based on current expectations,
estimates, and projections about our industry, management beliefs,
and certain assumptions made by our management.  Words
such as “anticipates”, “expects”,
“intends”, “plans”, “believes”,
“seeks”, “estimates”, variations of such
words, and similar expressions are intended to identify such

guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks,
uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict;
therefore, actual results may differ materially from those
expressed or forecasted in any such forward-looking
statements.  Unless required by law, we undertake no
obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements,
whether as a result of new information, future events, or
otherwise.  However, readers should carefully review the
risk factors set forth herein and in other reports and documents
that we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, particularly Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly
reports on Form 10-Q and any Current Reports on Form
8-K.

 

General

 

We seek,
develop, and manage alternative energy investments for our own
account. We will screen investments with emphasis towards finding
opportunities with long term potential. We will not limit ourselves
to any single area of alternative energy. We will look at any and
all forms of alternative energy.

 

 Our
principal business address is 123 North College Avenue, Suite 200,
Fort Collins, Colorado 80524. We operate out of one office in
Colorado. We have no specific plans at this point for additional
offices.  On January 1, 2008, we entered into a Service
Agreement with Bohemian Companies, LLC to provide us with certain
defined services. These services include financial, bookkeeping,
accounting, legal and tax matters, as well as cash management,
custody of assets, preparation of financial documents, including
tax returns and checks, and coordination of professional service
providers as may be necessary to carry out the matters covered by
the Service Agreement.  We will compensate Bohemian Companies,
LLC by reimbursing this entity for the allocable portion of
the direct and indirect costs of each employee of Bohemian
Companies, LLC who performs services on our behalf. We will receive
invoices monthly from Bohemian Companies, LLC. This Service
Agreement matures on December 31, 2011. Total expenses
incurred with Bohemian Companies were $3,000 each for the quarters
ending June 30, 2011 and 2010 and $6,000 each for the six months
ending June 20, 2011 and 2010.  As of June 30, 2011 the
Company had no balance due to Bohemian Companies, LLC.

 

We have
not been subject to any bankruptcy, receivership or similar
proceeding.

 

Results of
Operations

 

The
following discussion involves our results of operations for the
quarter ended June 30, 2011, for the quarter ended June 30, 2010
and for the six months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010.

 

We had
revenues of $31,250 for the quarter ended June 30, 2011, compared
to $31,164 for the quarter ended June 30, 2010. We had $62,500 for
the six months ended June 30, 2011, compared to $62,300 for the six
months ended June 30, 2010.

 

Operating
expenses, consisting primarily of selling, general and
administrative costs were $11,482 for the quarter ended June 30,
2011, compared to $9,326 for the quarter ended June 30, 2010.
 Selling, general and administrative costs were $21,643 for
the six months ended June 30, 2011, compared to $27,942 for the six
months ended June 30, 2010.  Most of the costs were
attributable to professional and contract services. We do not
anticipate these professional fees to be as significant in the
future. However we believe that our selling, general and
administrative costs will increase as we grow our business
activities going forward.

 

We had
net income of $15,550 for the quarter ended June 30, 2011, compared
to net income of $22,071 for the quarter ended June 30, 2010.
 We had net income of $31,879 for the six months ended June
30, 2011, compared to net income of $34,896 for the six months
ended June 30, 2010.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources

 

Our cash
or cash equivalents on June 30, 2011
were $183,649.  We had an additional amount of
$204,905 in Certificates of Deposit.

 

Cash
flows provided by operating activities were $26,655 for the
six months ended June 30, 2011, compared to cash flows provided by
operating activities of $26,251 for the six months ended June 30,
2010.

 

Net cash
used in investing activities was $249 for the six months ended June
30, 2011, compared to $1,466 for the six months ended June 30,
2010.

 

Cash
flows provided by financing activities were $-0- for the six
months ended June 30, 2011 and June 30, 2010.

 

Over the
next twelve months we do not expect to incur  material
capital costs in our operations.

 

We
believe that we have sufficient capital for our current level of
operations. This is because we currently have sufficient revenue
within our present organizational structure to be profitable. We do
not anticipate needing to raise additional capital in the next
twelve months.

 

Our
principal source of liquidity will be our operations. We expect
variation in revenues to account for the difference between a
profit and a loss. Also business activity is closely tied to the
U.S. economy. Our ability to achieve and maintain profitability and
positive cash flow is dependent upon our ability to successfully
develop alternative energy investments and our ability to generate
revenues.

 

In any
case, we try to operate with minimal overhead. Our primary activity
will be to seek to develop alternative energy investments and,
consequently, our revenues. If we succeed in generating sufficient
sales, we will become profitable. We cannot guarantee that this
will ever occur. Our plan is to build our company in any manner
which will be successful.

 

ITEM
3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET
RISK.

 

 None.

 

ITEM
4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

 

 Not
applicable

 

ITEM 4T.
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

 

As of the
end of the period covered by this report, based on an evaluation of
our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a
-15(e) and 15(d)-15(e) under the Exchange Act), our Chief Executive
Officer and the Chief Financial Officer has concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures are effective.

 

There
were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting
that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting.

 

This
report does not include an attestation report of our registered
public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial
reporting. Identified in connection with the evaluation required by
paragraph (d) of Rule 240.13a-15 or Rule 240.15d-15 of this chapter
that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting.

PART
II.  OTHER INFORMATION

 

ITEM
1.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

 

There are
no legal proceedings, to which we are a party, which could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or
operating results.

 

ITEM 1A.
RISK FACTORS

 

You
should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described
below; and all of the other information included in this document.
Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our
business, financial condition or operating results and could
negatively impact the value of your investment.

 

The
occurrence of any of the following risks could materially and
adversely affect
our business, financial condition and operating result. In this
case, the trading price of our common stock could decline
and you might lose all or part of your
investment.

 

We have a
limited operating history. While we have been profitable for our
two most recent fiscal year ends, we may not continue to be
profitable, and, as a result, we could go out of
business.

 

We were
formed as a Colorado business entity in November, 2007. At the
present time, we have been profitable at our two most recent fiscal
year ends. We cannot guarantee that we will continue to be
profitable, and, as a result, we could go out of
business.

 

We
currently rely upon one client for all of our revenues, which means
that we could be severally impacted by the loss of the
client.

 

 One
client has accounted for all of our revenues for both 2010 and
2009. This client, EastMountain Alternative Energy,
LLC,  is a related party. Our revenue projections are
subject to greater uncertainty than if we had revenue commitments
from a number of clients. We could be materially impacted by the
loss of this client. As long as we rely upon one client for a
majority of our revenue, we could be subject to uncertain revenue
results. While we have no basis to believe that we will not
continue to generate revenue from this client, we cannot assure you
that this client or any of our clients, will continue to purchase
our products or services in significant volume, or at
all.

 

Our lack
of operating history makes it difficult for us to evaluate our
future business prospects and make decisions based on those
estimates of our future performance. An investor could lose his
entire investment.

 

We have a
limited operating history. An investor has no frame of reference to
evaluate our future business prospects.  This makes it
difficult, if not impossible, to evaluate us as an investment. An
investor could lose his entire investment if our future business
prospects do not result in our ever sustaining
profitability.

 

 
If we do not generate adequate revenues to finance our
operations, our business may fail.

 

We began
generating revenues in 2008. As of June 30, 2011, we had a cash
position of $183,649 and an additional $204,905 in Certificates of
Deposit. We anticipate that operating costs will range between
$60,000 and $100,000, for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2011.
These operating costs include insurance, taxes, utilities,
maintenance, contract services and all other costs of operations.
We will use contract employees who will be paid on an hourly basis
as each investment transaction is evaluated. However, the operating
costs and expected revenue generation are difficult to predict. We
expect to generate revenues in the next twelve months

My sons like energy drinks, but i have always questioned their safety and health-risks.  Guru has made an effort to bring a better product to this popular beverage choice.

has a slight citrus taste, gave me the boost i needed without the crash.  much rather drink this than red bull, rockstar or monster as this is organic!  found my new favorite energy drink pre-workout or just when i'm dragging on certain days.  also it doesn't have a ton of calories, big plus! 
Would you purchase again? -  Yes!

I like the taste ! but bI don't drink energy drunk too often. That's why I'm not going to purchase the product.  But I do recommend people to try and  then they can decide for themselves.

This product was tasting and refreshing. It helped provide energy. I'm not sure of the importance of it being vegan for an energy drink though.

I don't usually drink energy drinks, but this one is an exception to the rule. It's organic, low calorie, non-GMO and contains ingredients that I can actually trust.  I did not experience a crash afterwards. I read that this has to do with the fact that they use naturally-occurring caffeine from Green Tea and Guarana. I don't know why you would drink any other energy drink than this. Definitely loading up on these again soon! Great price not expensive at all!
Would you purchase again? -  Yes!

Definitely better tasting than something like Red Bull---and just as importantly, better smelling.  I can't be the only person who gags at the smell of Red Bull....  In contrast, this stuff is much more palatable, less artificially sweet, and doesn't leave that horrendous aftertaste coating your tongue.    It's harder to find than Red Bull, so when you see it, stock up.

I don't drink energy drinks often, mostly because they don't typically taste great and I drink coffee already. However, I was impressed with Guru. I couldn't put my finger on the flavor at first, but reading the ingredients it was the green tea that leaves a mild aftertaste, kind of like matcha. The nose is citrusy and refreshing. That said, although I stayed perky after drinking it; I would say it's safe for people who only drink caffeine moderately to drink it too, and if you're dead tired it might not make much of a difference. It only has caffeine from the tea, so not at all the "crack" type of artificial energy drink like a Monster or Red Bull, which I think taste gross and are horrible for you!

I was extremely pleased with the taste of this drink. There was no bitterness unlike other artificially sweet drinks. The plus point of this drink is that its organic, low calorie and contains ingredients that are not harmful to the body. The caffeine in this drink is derived from natural sources like green tea. So I can have as many drinks I desire without feeling guilty. I tried the Lite version of the drink. The only negative point for this product is the price. Costing around $2 per can is quite expensive!

This was actually the first energy drink I ever tried! I was a little skeptical at first but I thought it was delicious! It was a lovely soda, lots of carbonation, no aftertaste (kind of like a citrus apple cider with tea) but there was a little too much sugar. I pay attention to carb intake as I am Type 1 Diabetic and there was quite a bit of sugar...too much for my taste. I don't even think it needed it but it was still yummy!

I was pleasantly surprised with the overall energy factor of this drink. It tastes much like that of Redbull, but without the tendency of giving you a throbbing headache. I was quite thrilled with the amount of energy I obtained from a single 8.4 fl oz serving. It does taste much like most traditional energy drinks, a bit canny and tin-like but the energy you get is well worth the metallic taste. I can actually see myself purchasing this on a regular basis. 5/5 stars for sure!

As someone who is always on the run, I like having a large variety of different energy drinks to fuel my day as a substitute for coffee. I tried the GURU organic energy drink out and liked that it didn't taste like the typical energy beverage with the taurine flavor that is so prevalent. Generally if you're putting caffeine into your body, you'd like it to be as unadulterated as possible. I like that the ingredients used in the drink are organic, gluten-free, and NON=GMO verified.

I'm not much an engery drinks kind of person but when I do need a lift of engery I like to drink something that is not super high in sugar or have a list of ingredients I can barely pronounce.

If one is in need of an extra boost of energy and prefer something that is organic Guru is the way to.

The first thing I did when I bought this product was read the ingredients. To my surprise I could read all the ingredients and there was no caffeine. I wake up at 5 o'clock in the morning everyday for work. I'm usually a little tired. About two hours into the workday, this particular work day,  the first thing I did was drink the guru light. I did not feel tired all day and did not feel overly energized.  Plainly said, I felt normal and this was good for me.  That means the drink did what it was supposed to do.  I don't think I'D  drink it everyday but I will definitely keep a few spares around for days when I play hockey until midnight and have to work at 5 in the morning or days where I'm working all day and I need that extra push to get me through. #trynatural

My husband has been gluten-free for almost two years and while I do blend my own gluten-free flour at times, sometimes I'm just pressed for time and looking for an off-the-shelf GF flour that acts like regular flour.

I have never heard such things like organic energy drinks. The drink is just like redbull only it's cherry flavor. I'm not a big fan of cherry flavored drink, so I would not consider buying Guru in the future. But for people who like cherry flavored soda, Guru might be a go-for energy drink.

I appreciated the fact that this drink was made with natural products - I felt both more alert and awake after drinking this but it was not an artificial sugar induced buzz and I did not crash immediately afterward as I do with most energy drinks. Tasted like a standard energy drink which is the one thing I would like to see improved - not a big fan of the citrus taurine flavor.

The overall taste is very mild. The ease of drinking this beverage is commendable. It tasted like a natural drink and not like the artificial ones.

Wow, this is definitely one of the best tasting energy drinks out on the market.  It has a really nice, sweet flavor to it, and has zero aftertaste.  You can definitely taste the white grape juice, but it's not overpowering   I definitely felt it starting to work immediately, which I also enjoy with energy drinks, as I like to sip them over the course of my afternoon.  I would definitely buy this one again as it was in the same price point as my other usual energy drinks.  I would also recommend it to a friend if they wanted a sweet, pick-me-up to keep them going,

I usually don't use energy drinks because of the flavor but I tried the Guru Organic energy drink and thought it was a step above the usual Red Bull or Monster drinks.  Upon reading the list of ingredients, I was pleased to see that they were all natural.  I was surprised to see echinacea listed as an ingredient, which I felt was a nice alternative to unpleasant tasting vitamin supplements.  My store did not carry the sugar free variety, so I had to settle for the 30 grams of sugar that came with the regular version.  It was very sweet, but the actual taste was good and I liked the level of carbonation.  I didn't get the jitters nor did I have the "crash and burn" that I would have expected with this type of drink.  I did not drink it all at once, but rather had it throughout the second half of the day, which is usually when I start feeling tired.  If I can find the sugar free version, I will definitely try it.  I do have to limit my caffeine intake, but for those occasions when I absolutely must have an extra boost, a cold sparkly Guru sounds like a great alternative to an iced coffee or tea.

I bought the Original version -  because I had read reviews on Amazon saying that it was better-flavored.  It had a nice fruity-citrusy taste, and wasn't overly sweet.  Since I usually buy low or no-calorie energy drinks I am used to a different flavor profile.  I got a nice "kick" from this drink, and it helped keep me stay alert during a long-distance drive.  I also appreciate the organic ingredients, since a lot of energy drinks are full of all sorts of "junk".  Will definitely buy this again!

I opted for the original as opposed to the lite. I've had several other brands of energy drinks in the past, and Guru definitely has a cleaner slightly refreshing taste. I like that guru is made with organic cane sugar, which surprised me as other drinks I've had can leave a artificial taste. The drink also contains sparkling water, organic white grape juice, and organic green tea leaf extract which is a great naturally occurring caffeine. Guru organic energy drink definitely holds its own when it comes to energy drinks and I would definitely purchase again.

I opened it and was pleasantly surprised that it was carbonated. The taste was not overly sweet... it was JUST right. I am not a fan of things that are TOO sweet.  The flavor was slightly fruity, like a mild version of a candy, again, not too sweet.  After about 10 minutes I started feeling more awake and alert. I love that it didn't get me pumped or jittery. It gave me the perfect amount of energy for it to feel natural. I would absolutely​ purchase this again. I never liked energy drinks, but GURU changed my mind.

I am not a fan of RedBull or coffee, but i like caffeine in other forms, so i decided to try Guru. I was pleasantly surprised, because it has wonderful taste. It is not as overwhelming as RedBull, it is more natural, fruity and refreshing. And the energy in it brought some muracles - on lazy and rainy Sunday afternoon, i did not have much hope to achieve anything, but... with Guru, i completed tasks and chores i was procrastinating about for weeks. The only thing to be aware of: if you live in Bay Area, this drink will cost you hefty tax. I was surprised it has the tax penalty for soft sugary drinks!

This product tastes great. I absolutely loved it and felt very energetic about 30 minutes after drinking it. It tastes great when chilled, although I would think it probably tastes good at room temperature as well. If I ever feel the need for some energy, I would definitely purchase this product. Recommended!

I personally am a connoisseur of energy drinks. I rely on caffeine for most of my projects at school and for late night coding sessions as well as marathon gaming. Although energy drinks can be considered a crutch, it's a lifestyle decision that many, many people embrace rather than attempt to avoid... I am one of these people.

That said, Guru Energy is fairly cheap ($1.25USD/can) if you buy it here off Amazon, it comes in the Redbull standard 8.3 fl/oz cans, and is shipped in a surprisingly lightweight and compact case (compare this to Monster, Rockstar, or any other brand with standard 16 fl/oz cans).

The taste, like Guru's website describes, is very indescribable. It is very sharp and light with a medium amount of carbonation. The caffeine buzz is more "natural"... it has more of an upslope and downslope rather than a sudden cracked out (which is arguably awesome too in its own respect) then big crash sort of feeling. This is because the caffeine in Guru is derived from 125mg of Guaranine (Guarana Herb) rather than synthetically separated then added. There is no mention about how much of the 125mg of Guaranine is real caffeine, but since Red Bull checks in at 80mg / 8.3oz it seems that Guru is in pretty good shape.

I think a particular good feature of Guru is that it uses cane sugar rather than high fructose corn syrup. I appreciate a good quality soda, particularly microbrew colas, and they often exclusively contain cane sugar.

So in summary, this energy drink is fairly cheap, good buzz, all natural, and great for coding, gaming, or studying.

Nice drink for a pick-me-up - refreshing and pleasant tasting.  Ideal replacement for a soda - the carbonation without all the sugar was perfectly satisfying!  Zero guilt!

The biggest question is DOES IT WORK?? 
The answer to your question is, YES! I was busy all day long and had the best energy I've had in awhile. It feels a lot better than using Redbull.. I'm very sensitive to caffeine so drinking it gives me a lot of energy I have no question about that. But this energy felt like I've slept the whole night without waking up and best bed ever. So pretty much I felt really good!! 
The taste isn't the best but it not a lot you drink so if you hate it a lot then just chug it. It's a little herbaly but not bad. Just different.

Coming from someone who at one point drank a decent amount of Monster Energy drinks, I can say that the GURU Organic Energy drink definitely makes me feel better after consumption. You still get a decent kick of caffeine, but there is less crap (i.e. less gnarly, processed ingredients) in it. I don't consume energy drinks often anymore, but I'd grab one of these if they are available the next time I want one.

I really enjoyed this energy drink. It kept me alert but not at all jittery. So many energy drinks leave me shaky and jittery but this one did not. A BIG bonus for me is that t does not have gross or unpronounceable ingredients in it- it is organic and naturally sweetened with only 10 calories. (This is the lite version- my store did not carry the original) It has a pleasant taste- not great but not bad.
When I need an energy drink again, I will definitely buy this one.

I really enjoyed the Organic Energy Drink by Guru. It was reminiscent of a Slurpee with a slight aftertaste of cough syrup. But the cough syrup taste was not overwhelming. It gave me energy like a normal energy drink would. It is a good-sized drink and has a total of 143 milligrams of caffeine which is only 20 milligrams less than the Monsters that I usually drink. I definitely recommend this and will be buying more.

After popping open the can, I had whiffs of the Red Bull scent. So I was quite surprised after tasting it. Not only did it not taste like Red Bull, it had a fruity flavor, which is a plus! I liked how it was carbonated and that all the ingredients were organic and natural. I tried the regular flavor which was a bit too sweet for me so the Lite may have been a better choice; nonetheless, the original was still pretty good. I do not know if I would recommend it since the sugar (30g) is quite high for one serving, but over other energy drinks, I would. It is probably the best tasting energy drink I have tried so far.

I drink a lot of coffee and a lot of energy drinks. This was was pretty good. It wasn't my favorite, but I enjoyed it. The flavor reminded me if two things. At first, it sort of reminded me of Coca-Cola. Then, the second half sort of reminded me of a 7-11 slurpee. Despite those connotations, it did not taste thick and sugary. It was pretty light and I felt great after drinking it.

Excellent taste and a good source of energy. If you don't care much about sugar content then don't get the lite because the normal one is pretty good too! The can packs a decent punch and the organic components of the product make me feel like I'm not wiring myself up on some synthetic creation that tastes like plastic. The product isn't priced the most competitively but maybe that is because I purchased it at bristol farms, I wouldn't be surprised if whole foods had it for a bit less. I enjoyed my Guru chilled but I totally see how it could be fine on the go at room temperature. Overall I'm happy with my guru experience.

The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the taste.

I don't usually buy traditional energy drinks because I prefer clean ingredients. This Guru energy drink is very clean (it's organic, too!), and has very low calories. I actually liked the taste a lot better than I thought I would but you can definitely taste the stevia. It's a little bitter but the lemon juice and added sugar help to balance that out. I did not notice a huge lift in energy but it did perk me up at work. I'd probably purchase this in the future to drink after lunch/early afternoon at work.

I really enjoyed the sustained, healthy energy this drink provided. Other energy drinks contain scary amounts of caffeine and vitamin B (like it could give you irregular heart rhythms scary) which causes an energy crash, This one takes a more natural approach. The result is a productive pep that does not make you feel (or seem) like you're on crack and it doesn't cause a sudden drop in energy either. The energizing ingredients are green tea extract, guarana seed, and ginseng. There is also echinacea which is great for the immune system. At first I found the stevia to be overwhelming, but the berry flavor presumably from the luo han guo fruit kept me sipping. I have a suspicion I would like the non-lite version a bit more, but this drink is great for those who are used to the powerful sweetness of stevia.

This seems to be a rarity of an energy drink that does not have awful additives in it!  It has no color and has a light, refreshing texture and slightly sweet taste, without being too much.  It has natural, organic ingredients that provide energy rather than artificial ones and no sugar alcohols (erythritol etc) which usually cause me problems.  I therefore felt a nice, natural energy boost without any discomfort.  Loved it!

While I occasionally consume energy drinks, I often worry about the ingredients in conventional varieties which are often made up of chemicals that I can hardly pronounce and rarely recognize. I wonder about the safety and potential effects on my health from those products, and I'm also not particularly fond of the often strongly artificial taste. As such. I was really interested in learning about and trying out Guru Organic Energy, which is made up of organic ingredients and naturally occurring caffeine. Given that I avoid calories in drinks, I chose the Lite version to try, and I was pleasantly surprised. The flavor was different, and although I wouldn't say it was delicious, it was refreshing and not as aversive as other energy drinks I've tried. I didn't feel a huge kick of energy, but caffeine rarely has a tremendous effect on me and I did feel alert if not energetic. Overall, I think the Guru Organic Energy Drink is a preferable choice for those looking for energy beverages over the typical energy drink laden with artificial ingredients. Although I'm not a regular connoisseur of energy drinks, the next time I want one I will choose Guru Organic. #trynatural

GURU Lite is very tasty and refreshing, especially on a hot day. Unlike most Stevia sweetened drinks, the taste is well balanced with no bitter aftertaste. There's a nice lemony flavor and the carbonation is on-point.

I don't usually drink energy drinks, but this one is an exception to the rule. It's organic, low calorie, non-GMO and contains ingredients that I can actually trust. Another big bonus I noticed is that I did not experience a crash afterwards. I read that this has to do with the fact that they use naturally-occurring caffeine from Green Tea and Guarana. I don't know why you would drink any other energy drink than this. Definitely loading up on these again soon!

This product is packed with good, natural ingredients, unlike most energy drinks out there, and still packs the same amount of caffeine! The flavor of this drink is somewhat like a gummy bear, although just slightly watered down from the flavors of other energy drinks, which I didn't mind. I have tried other natural energy drinks in the past which did not agree with me, however I did not have the same issues with this drink. I really enjoyed it. If there is one thing i could say about it, is there wasn't any selection at the store I went to. They had one flavor of the drink, in one size. The drink was also about a dollar more than comparable energy drinks. I would be most likely to buy this product if they offered a multi-pack with a small discount.

Midday and I just ate too much for lunch and all I wanted to do was take a nap. It was a perfect time to give Guru a try. I wasn't super happy with the taste it was kind of bitter but just sweet enough that I didnt mind it after a few more sips. This drink definately gave me the boost I was hoping for. Not a jittery jolt but just enough to get me out of my slump. I was also happy to know I wasn't filling my body with harmful stuff to achieve that boost. I would recommend this product to friends, family, and co workers.

A good drink if you are able to find the lite version. The regular version is basically all sugar, which I do not like. The lite version is much better but harder to find. Taste is good, on par with other energy drinks. Not sure if being organic is worth the extra retail cost though.

Really good tasting product! The thing that stood out to me was that it tasted somewhat like redbull, but with a more pleasing aftertaste. It reminded me of cane sugar soda, but much healthier. There are 30g of natural sugar, which is better than most sodas, and there are few ingredients, all of them organic. My only issue was the manufacturer's coupon, which confused the cashier, and in the end, I had to pay sales tax. Other than that, I really enjoyed this experience.

To be honest, I've never been a fan of energy drinks. I usually choose to go with the shots like the 5-hours just because I chug it and it's done. The Guru Energy drink actually has a natural taste though compared to the other energy drinks on the market which is good. The only issue I have with this is availability, This drink is not available a lot of places, which makes it hard to purchase when you do want to indulge. All in all, this is a MUCH better choice for energy drinks, the taste is pleasant and it gave me a nice jolt with absolutely no crash. I would recommend trying this for sure if you could find it! Thanks for the opportunity to taste.

I bought the lite version because I try to stay away from high sugar beverages. I like that the lite only has 3g of sugar and is sweetened with stevia. I enjoyed the taste of the energy drink; it has a light and refreshing cherry flavor. I definitely noticed an increase in energy and alertness after about 15 minutes. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it's still a little to sweet for me. I would buy it if I needed a quick boost of energy over other brands of energy drinks but I probably would not buy this on a regular basis since I currently purchase drinks like this only occasionally.

I am not a huge energy drink fan, due to the usual caffeinated cough syrup taste and often shakey feeling afterwards. However, with Guru I was actually pleasantly surprised! It tasted much better than other energy drinks that I have tried, and there wasn't such a drastic crash after the caffeine wore off. I like that I didn't experience any shakey feelings or feel ill after drinking. I will definitely be purchasing more when my coffee just isn't doing what I need.

The Guru Energy Drink is a great tasting alternative to other energy drinks. I'm primarily a Red Bull fan but I got to try the Guru Energy Drink.

I don't usually drink energy drinks or coffee because they make my heart race and I get shaky but with half a can of this drink I didn't feel over-caffeinated.

The taste, like Guru's website describes, is very indescribable. It is very sharp and light with a medium amount of carbonation. The caffeine buzz is more "natural"... it has more of an upslope and downslope rather than a sudden cracked out (which is arguably awesome too in its own respect) then big crash sort of feeling. This is because the caffeine in Guru is derived from 125mg of Guaranine (Guarana Herb) rather than synthetically separated then added. There is no mention about how much of the 125mg of Guaranine is real caffeine, but since Red Bull checks in at 80mg / 8.3oz it seems that Guru is in pretty good shape.

I usually don't like energy drinks, because I can't deal with the carbonation.

The taste is very fruity and mild, and I really like how sweet it is. I tried it on a day when I had to be out early, and it really helped me feeling up while running errands. I'd recommend it and buy it again.

There's two sizes. I used the larger sugar free one before starting my 8am shift. I drank it throughout my shift. I absolutely loved the taste of it! The price isn't to bad either. With some of the energy drinks out there at least this one you know is organic and better for you so it's worth it. Energy wise I def felt it when I first started drinking it. It wasn't overpowering but the right amount of energy. I usually sip it throughout my shift. The only problem I had with it was that after the half way point my energy was decreasing but I would definitely recommend it to my friends.

So, I am not an energy drink person & I got this for my husband & he was really skeptic about it cause he's used to the regular energy drinks at the gas station. But, he actually really enjoyed this.

At first taste I thought it was a bit bitter and had a weird taste but the more I drank it, the better it began to taste. It was very smooth and not as gassy as red bull. I began to feel very energetic as the day went on. By nightfall it began to wore off and I was able to sleep like normal. It had no lasting effects like Red Bull or Monster drinks and it tasted real good.  I can see myself buying it again, especially because it has natural and organic ingredients. I would definitely recommend this energy drink to others.

Tastes very refreshing, and the bubble is soft.
I didn't feel caffeine kicked in like  red bull does, but you don't feel any chemical instead.
I like the taste better than any other energy drinks.
I would like to buy if I could find this product not only organic store, but any regular market.

I didn't know what to expect from this drink, what if the flavor was not as strong as other competitors? Or what if the effect was not as strong or at least the same? But having the promise that it is a natural product, and non-GMO why not giving it a chance? 
The result? It is great! As long as you drink it cold it is very refreshing, the flavor is delicious, and it really gives you a boost of energy, perfect for those moments when you need help to stay awake. Even when I got my coupon to get a free drink, I noticed the price is not that high, making it an even better option. 
I'm definitely buying it again, and I'm recommending it to both friends and family. It is a product of great quality and great flavor. It delivers what it promises and I'm a happy consumer.

It was pretty tasty and I felt it worked almost as good as other energy drinks. Perhaps a little less as well but I felt better about it being natural and that was worth the slightly smaller effect. It didn't make my heart beat too fast or give me any of the weird side effects other energy drinks sometimes do.

I actually tried the Original flavor, not the Lite, but I am interested in going back and trying the Lite.

Very enjoyable! Tastes like a fizzy mélange of Jolt Cola, Double Bubble and Sweetarts -  complex dark cola flavors dance on the palette alongside hints of bubblegum and citrus, zaps you with a refreshing nose-tingling tang. Nice strong caffeine buzz without the jitters. Highly recommended!

A great pick me up...... recommend this as a before workout drink so you can quickly burn the sugar.  I wish they used organic sugar vice corn syrup which is more in keeping with organic ingredients.  The Lite version uses Stevia which is much better.

I would like to point out first that it seems that only the "original" flavor is organic (if that is something that is important to you). It did have a slight Red Bull like taste but overall it is one of the better tasting energy drinks. It didn't make me super jittery but it did give me a lil extra pep to make it through a late night.

I just tried the regular version of the Guru Organic Energy drink and it was quite good. The flavor was sort of similar to a very mild grapefruit flavor. I do feel energized, but I don't feel ill like some energy drinks can make you feel. Guru is refreshing and reading the ingredients the first thing I see is sparkling water. There is nothing chemical or strange in this drink. I would definitely switch over to this from the other drinks I have tried. If you want something light, refreshing, and tasty pick one of these up!

This product worked so well for my energy level. I was dead drag button tired when I drank it and felt steady energy all day. I would give a higher score, but whoo that aftertaste was something else; however it's nothing unbearable, just a slight bitterness. The drink itself is sweet though, the bitterness only comes after. My husband will probably stick to his normal energy drink, but I like this one myself.

For a natural energy drink, Guru was great. I liked that I knew what I was putting in my body and that the lite version of this drink only has 5 calories. However, I don't feel like it amped me up as much as a "regular" energy drink. It was a great substitute for my morning coffee, but I wouldn't rely on it for an all-nighter.

As a monster fanatic and a diabetic I am always happy to try new energy drinks that will give me the energy I need without the sugar that I don't need.

This is a great way to boost up your energy without any harmful chemicals of other energy drinks. I drank it early in the morning and it immediately gave me a boost of energy, like a cup of coffee usually does, and I did not feel a crash throughout the day. It lasts a good 10-12 hours, by the time I was ready for bed I slept soundly, definitely a great product!

This was a surprisingly pleasant beverage. I don't usually like energy drinks. Every now and again I break down and purchase one as an alternative to my usual coffee, but I'm not a big energy drink person. I think of them as having a rather off taste and an unpleasant effect on my heartbeat. This one, surprisingly, seemed to have neither of those. It was fresh tasting if you can believe it, and I found myself actually enjoying the flavor instead of merely tolerating it. The one detractor is that it did not seem to supply quite the same kick as a normal energy drink. The energy it did supply, however, came without heart palpitations or other unfortunate side effects, and for that I am quite grateful! I may not buy it often, but next time I reach for an energy drink I'll definitely reach for guru and I will not hesitate to suggest it to friends.

I'm glad that I was able to try this. It's honestly not to bad if you are looking for a more natural energy. But that being said there is some downsides. Natural Guarana has a steady rise of alertness and energy. But also comes with a sudden crash once it's all used up. That's because there are no synthetics that carry the Caffeine. The flavor is mellow yet sharp. Definitely has that "natural" flavor. All in all, it's not a bad drink. Definitely a plus for those looking for non synthetics and wanting natural energy.

I was a big coffee drinker until i realized how much sugar and creamer I was consuming in my 'cup of joe'. I also realized the energy crash later was due to my coffee fix. Discovering Guru was the perfect answer for me! The taste takes a little getting used to, (best ice cold) but the energy boost is just right and I don't seem to have the crash later. My son uses it for work-outs, and my employer and I swear it makes us happy! Also, I have gotten so I like the taste. Please don't ever stop making guru!

Not overpowering like most energy drinks that I buy. This has no B vitamins and doesn't taste like a vitamin B drink. Instead it has a real smooth lite flavor.

I must admit that I am always needing some sort of energy push, and I most definitely can become a connoisseur of energy drinks. Guru Natural Energy Drink came through 100%. The taste was not too sweet, and actually tasted like a flavorful light fruit beverage. Guru was not too heavy and I could feel the pick up immediately. Bottom line is this energy drink is great in taste, gives me the pick up I need, almost immediately, and does not hurt the pocket book, like so many other energy drinks.

I don't usually drink energy drinks since most are full of ingredients that can do more harm than good.  However, I recently attended an all day training for group fitness and I decided it to try out the GURU natural energy drink  to prepare me for the intense physical activities of the day.  Normally, I am sensitive to caffeine, but I didn't particularly feel any jitters or side effects when I drank GURU natural energy drink.  I liked the taste, which didn't have an aftertaste, as what I would expect...and it kept my energy going throughout the day.  Overall, I enjoyed trying this product out, and like that this is a healthier alternative energy drink than what's on the market.

I tried the original energy drink. The taste was fine. It tasted like other ones I've had. I had no problems with it. I don't know if it really gave me more energy. I felt the same after I drank it. It didn't make my heart beat faster like other energy drinks. That was a good thing.  I may try it again because of it.

I usually HATE the taste of energy drinks, however the GURU Natural Energy Drink is so different!  I actually LOVE the refreshing, crisp flavor.  It gives me energy without the caffeine jitters , and best part is it tastes great too.  I love that it is also all natural and does not have horrible chemicals in it and dangerous levels of caffeine.  I will most certainly be purchasing this energy drink from now on for my commute to work every morning!

I am surprised that this didn't taste as bad as most energy drinks. I try to avoid energy drinks unless I really need to have one. To me, it's a 4 star product because I wouldn't grab it if I was shopping in the store unless I was really in the need for it. It's not that bad but it's not something I would put in my body every time I need an energy boost. I am trying to be more "whole food, clean eating" type of person.  I would recommend this to others though!

Really surprised at the taste of this energy drink. The ones that I have tasted before were strong and the flavor was not very pleasant but this drink was different.

This actually worked to give me energy. I work in a physically demanding environment, and after 12 hour days, I really just have enough for the commute and then to crash out when I get home. Not so great when I am the primary caretaker of an energetic toddler. Much to my relief, the GURU drink was offered and for me it was a must have.
It actually worked rather well. The taste was smooth and not funky like a lot of energy drinks tend to be. It gave me the energy to keep pushing as I drank it with my break meal. It takes a lot to pep me up, but surprisingly, this did. Kudos!

A slightly sweet and fizzy all natural energy drink that doesn't make you feel guilty about drinking it. The can was easy to hold and I liked the design on the label, it was very eye-catching. I liked how I felt like I was drinking a soda but without all the extra calories. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a quick and long-lasting pick me up.

When taking all factors into consideration this is best energy drink by I've had hands down. The taste is unique, not artificial at all. The effect is more of a smooth climb with a bonus increase in mental awareness. No initial energy jolt and no hard crash. That being said if you have been up for two days you will not reap the full benefits of any energy drink, get some sleep.

When taking all factors into consideration this is best energy drink by I've had hands down. The taste is unique, not artificial at all. The effect is more of a smooth climb with a bonus increase in mental awareness. No initial energy jolt and no hard crash because instead of just caffeine anhydrous, this uses a blend of guarana, ginseng, and gingko biloba for energy., I can easily say that GURU is among the very best. Using natural, organic ingredients (organic, vegan, no gluten, no GMO's) and natural caffeine, GURU manages to be tastier than most of the competition without having to resort a bevy of artificial flavors.I find the taste enjoyable,  It's not too harsh and has refreshing flavor.

I drink energy drinks on occasion but not all the time. I usually don’t like getting the jitters and some do cause jitters. I also hate the taste of some of them. I really wanted to try Guru because I have never had Organic energy drinks before. I decided to take one after returning from a trip in the afternoon and decided that I wanted to go to yoga that night but wasn’t sure if I had the energy for it. I took it about an hour before going to the gym I ran for 15 minutes and did an hour yoga class.  I was pleasantly surprised at how good it tasted. It had a light sparkling natural taste. I felt really great throughout my workout. I didn’t get this surge or jolt of energy, but I noticed that I didn’t feel tired at all. I also never got the jitters which was my biggest concern. I really like Guru. I'm very impressed.  I would recommend it to any of my friends.

I really loved this product, I am a huge fan of energy drinks. Most conventional ones contain so many terrible ingredients, so it's kind of hard to justify purchasing them. It took a while for me to get a hold of this product since the store is a bit far, I wish they sold this in more locations. I really enjoyed it, it was sweet; but not overwhelming need water feel. It was very smooth and fizzy, and it didn't contain stevia. I usually hate natural organic drinks that contain stevia since they give me a headache; this product didn't do that. I enjoyed every minute of it and didn't want it to end. I would completely recommend this to everyone, I will purchase it on occasion since it's a bit higher in price; although I can justify paying higher for a healthier alternative. Overall I was beyond impressed, I was very surprised by the quality; I truly enjoyed it.

I also got a a good amount of energy from it and I didn't feel like it was energy from sugar either, I liked the way this energy felt, it felt natural. I would purchase this product again.  I received this product free or at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.

I love the flavor of the energy drink and what I especially liked about this is that it is only 5 calories.  It also is vegan and gluten-free it is also organic. It gave me a lot of energy.

I like that Guru natural energy drink is made from natural ingredients.  I just would prefer it to have less sugar.  The store I went to did not have the lite variety.  I would prefer the lite one.

Loved it. What's great about GURU is that it's not full of crap. And by that I mean pretty much everything in a RedBull. I love Redbull though, wait no, I love the IDEA of Redbull and that's exactly what GURU is! All the benefits without the toxicity.  I will always grab these now instead of the Redbull. I care about my health!

This energy drink is awesome.  You know that it is healthy because it is only carried in healthy stores.  This drink gives me lasting good energy without crashing later on.  Give it a try, it works great! I received this for free for testing purposes

First I want to tell you that this Energy drink Have my name on it :)-. I love the taste and that it is all organic. But I have tried the one with the red can and black GURU on it. Because that's what I had on my free coupon. I wasn't sure so that's what I grabbed what it shows in picture.

This was a great pick-me-up for a busy day. It didn't give a jolt of caffeine like some other brands, but gave me a little boost. The flavor was crisp and fresh, not thick and syrupy like some other energy drinks. I love that it's sweetened with Stevia instead of a chemical sweetener!

I have tried many different energy drinks in the past & Guru fits right in with the rest of them. The plus side is that this did not taste any different than non natural products. Bubbly with a smooth flavor. I felt awake after drinking it without having any of the "bloated" feeling afterward that some dinks leave me feeling. Overall I was very pleased and would recommend especially if you only want to drink natural energy drinks.
