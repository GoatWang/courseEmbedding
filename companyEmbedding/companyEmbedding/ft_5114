Frame Size Information
If you look on the inside of the arm of your glasses you find will something that looks like: 52 [] 16 135.
This is information on the size of your glasses: the lens diameter, the bridge width and the arm length, all measured in millimetres.



The Eye Width, or Lens Diameter, is the width of the lens (in mm), measured from the bridge. (In this example, the Eye Width is 52.)
The Bridge Width is the gap above your nose between the lenses. It should be comfortable. Too tight, and the glasses could pinch your nose; too loose and the glasses will not be stable on your face. (In this example, the Bridge Width is 16.)
The Temple Length, or Arm Length, is usually one of three standards ďż˝ 135, 140 or 145mm. The arm should be long enough to sit comfortably over your ears. Glasses with straight arms do not always have this measurement indicated. (In this example, the Temple Length is 135.)

For the day of 07/28/2017 














Karen Peters (State College PA)






 "The prescription glasses I ordered are perfect. It took about 2 1/2 weeks for them to arrive. I am pleased with the quality of the product and the customer service. " 













Debra Carter (Central New Jersey)






 "I was extremely satisfied with the price, the fantastic customer service, the selection!  I was concerned with certain details of the frame so Customer Service actually called the manufacturer to reassure me while I waited - she went out of her way.  The item was shipped promptly, was beautiful and just exactly as described; I was extremely pleased with the service, price and sunglasses!" 













Freda (Augusta, GA)






 "I am very pleased with my transaction.  Not only did I receive a great deal on my glasses (about $100 cheaper than everywhere else with FREE shipping too), but shipping was super fast as well!  I was a little skeptical about ordering from this site, but I will definitely recommend EZ Contacts to everyone I know!  "

                    My family loves this area! Located near the intersection of Cherry St Extension and Young Road. Very quiet with zero 'through' traffic, very friendly neighbors, and easy to get to Cherry St, Peach St, 38th St, I-90, and I-79. 
Nice mix of older homes and newer construction with a few lots still available for new homes.
Be sure to be in town for the neighborhood's Fourth of July party! Great food and a first row seat to a fantastic fireworks display!
