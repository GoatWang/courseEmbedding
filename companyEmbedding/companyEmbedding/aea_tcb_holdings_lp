Antares Capital Supports AEA Investors’ Acquisition of TricorBraun 
      Holdings, Inc.
























CHICAGO, Dec 05, 2016 (BUSINESS WIRE) --
Antares Capital announced today it is serving as administrative agent 
      and lead arranger on a $735 million senior secured credit facility to 
      support the acquisition of TricorBraun Holdings, Inc. (TricorBraun) by 
      AEA Investors LP (AEA).


                                        








TricorBraun helps bring their customers' new and existing products to 
      market efficiently as one of the packaging industry's largest suppliers 
      of plastic and glass containers, closures, dispensers and tubes from 
      over 40 locations throughout North America and internationally, 
      including London; Guangzhou, China; Hong Kong and Mumbai, India. 
      TricorBraun's award-winning design and innovation center gives their 
      customers forward-thinking service based on consumer insight, 
      understanding of the markets and creative solutions. In addition, 
      advisory services range from preliminary planning and manufacturing 
      oversight to an array of innovative warehousing and logistics programs.


                                        








“We are pleased to have Antares lead the financing for our investment in 
      TricorBraun,” said Thomas Pryma, partner with AEA Investors LP. “Given 
      our longstanding relationship with Antares, their knowledge of 
      TricorBraun and their capital markets expertise, we were confident the 
      team could execute with speed and flexibility.”


                                        








“We are very pleased to continue our 20-year relationship with 
      TricorBraun as they work with AEA to execute their growth strategy,” 
      said Chet Zara, senior managing director for Antares. “Given 
      TricorBraun’s successful track record, combined with the 
      non-discretionary nature of their end products and the stable demand 
      drivers within the packaging sector, we are excited to see what this new 
      partnership brings to bear for the company.”

Antares Capital Supports AEA Investors’ Acquisition of TricorBraun Holdings, Inc. | Business Wire


























































Antares Capital Supports AEA Investors’ Acquisition of TricorBraun 
      Holdings, Inc.






December 05, 2016 11:18 AM Eastern Standard Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Antares Capital announced today it is serving as administrative agent 
      and lead arranger on a $735 million senior secured credit facility to 
      support the acquisition of TricorBraun Holdings, Inc. (TricorBraun) by 
      AEA Investors LP (AEA).
    


      TricorBraun helps bring their customers' new and existing products to 
      market efficiently as one of the packaging industry's largest suppliers 
      of plastic and glass containers, closures, dispensers and tubes from 
      over 40 locations throughout North America and internationally, 
      including London; Guangzhou, China; Hong Kong and Mumbai, India. 
      TricorBraun's award-winning design and innovation center gives their 
      customers forward-thinking service based on consumer insight, 
      understanding of the markets and creative solutions. In addition, 
      advisory services range from preliminary planning and manufacturing 
      oversight to an array of innovative warehousing and logistics programs.
    

      “We are pleased to have Antares lead the financing for our investment in 
      TricorBraun,” said Thomas Pryma, partner with AEA Investors LP. “Given 
      our longstanding relationship with Antares, their knowledge of 
      TricorBraun and their capital markets expertise, we were confident the 
      team could execute with speed and flexibility.”
    

      “We are very pleased to continue our 20-year relationship with 
      TricorBraun as they work with AEA to execute their growth strategy,” 
      said Chet Zara, senior managing director for Antares. “Given 
      TricorBraun’s successful track record, combined with the 
      non-discretionary nature of their end products and the stable demand 
      drivers within the packaging sector, we are excited to see what this new 
      partnership brings to bear for the company.”
