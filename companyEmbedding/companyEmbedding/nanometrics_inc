	Products
Our suite of products encompasses all the necessary components for the development of seismic networks for a variety of applications.
The Trillium family of broadband seismometers offers industry-leading versatility and performance for weak motion seismic research. These low-power, easy-to-install, highly accurate, reliable and rugged seismometers are used in more seismic networks around the globe than any other seismometer of its kind.
Our innovative Meridian digitial seismometers take broadband to a whole new level by incorporating the sensor and digitzer in a single unit, for a highly portable and accurate option that's easy to install.
The Titan family of accelerometer and accelerographs serve the strong motion market, and are ideal for high-precision, free-field strong motion and structural monitoring, such as state-of-health of large structures, or in early warning/rapid notification systems.
	 
Our state-of-the-art Centaur digitizer simplifies high-performance seismic recordings for any deployment, portable or permanent, standalone or networked. The rugged Centaur offers redundant, fail-safe data archiving and removable storage and is suitable for broadband and passive sensors.
The Libra II VSAT system was specifically designed for the transmission of seismic and environmental data from remote locations where site preparation can be a challenge.  Nanometrics expertise in data management was applied to the development of Libra II system, resulting in a highly economical telemetry solution for seismic and environmental research applications.
Inherent to the success of any seismic or environmental network is the ability to effectively manage the steady flow of data being provided from field instruments. We've developed our Apollo suite of use-case specific software that facilitates the efficient acquisition and processing of network data.

PRODUCTS & SOLUTIONS
Our systems  address a broad range of process control requirements for applications such as semiconductor manufacturing and advanced semiconductor packaging, data storage, high-brightness LEDs and solar photovoltaic applications.
 
We continue to develop and offer advanced process control solutions that address advanced technology roadmap requirement trends.
 
Automated Standalone Metrology Systems 
Nanometrics automated systems are made up of both semi-automated and fully automated metrology systems which are employed in high and low-volume production environments. High-performance metrology systems provide thin film, optical critical dimension (OCD), overlay and wafer stress for transistor and interconnect metrology applications.
 
Integrated Metrology Systems 
Nanometrics integrated metrology (IM) systems are installed directly onto wafer processing equipment to provide near real-time measurements for improved process control and maximum throughput. Our IM systems are sold directly to end customers and through OEM channels.
 
Materials Characterization
Nanometrics materials characterization products include  systems that are used to monitor the physical, optical, electrical and material characteristics of HB-LED, compound semiconductor, strained silicon and silicon-on-insulator (SOI) devices, including composition, crystal structure, layer thickness, dopant concentration, contamination and electron mobility.

DATA STORAGE / THIN FILM HEAD MANUFACTURING
As the availability of consumer multimedia applications expands, so does the need for data storage media. Drive manufacturers, working to increase the performance and density of hard drives by shrinking device geometries, are encountering new challenges. Among these are the need to achieve uniform device features in thin film heads, as well as to measure film thickness and characterize surface topography. 
 
Our advanced metrology solutions help our customers to measure these important characteristics   and to correct manufacturing issues, leading to increased product yields. At Nanometrics, we provide a range of advanced process control metrology tools to solve the complex problems associated with developing next-generation data storage media. These solutions reduce manufacturing costs by helping our customers speed development and avoid costly excursions.

					Full Description



Nanometrics Incorporated, incorporated on January 18, 2005, is a provider of process control metrology and inspection systems used primarily in the fabrication of semiconductors and other solid-state devices, including sensors, optoelectronic devices, high-brightness (HB) light emitting diodes (LEDs), discretes and data storages components. The Company's automated and integrated metrology systems measure critical dimensions, device structures, topography and various thin film properties, including three-dimensional features and film thickness, as well as optical, electrical and material properties. The Company's process control solutions are deployed throughout the fabrication process, from front-end-of-line substrate manufacturing, to production of semiconductors and other devices, to three-dimensional wafer-level packaging applications. The Company's automated systems primarily consist of automated metrology systems that are employed in semiconductor production environments.The Company's Atlas III, Atlas II+, and Atlas XP/Atlas XP+ represent its line of metrology systems providing optical critical dimension (OCD), thin film metrology and wafer stress for transistor and interconnect metrology applications. The OCD technology is supported by its NanoCD suite of solutions, including its NanoDiffract software and NanoGen scalable computing engine that enables visualization, modeling and analysis of structures. The Company's integrated metrology (IM) systems are installed directly onto wafer processing equipment to provide near real-time measurements. Its Trajectory system provides in-line measurement of layers in thin film thickness and composition in semiconductor applications.The Company's materials characterization products include systems that are used to monitor the physical, optical, electrical and material characteristics of discrete electronic industry, opto-electronic, HB-LEDs, solar photovoltaics (PV), compound semiconductor, strained silicon and silicon-on-insulator (SOI) devices, including composition, crystal structure, layer thickness, dopant concentration, contamination and electron mobility. The RPMBlue is its photoluminescence mapping system designed specifically for the HB-LED market, and is complemented by the RPMBlue-FS. The Company sells Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) automated and manual systems in the QS2200/3300 and QS1200 respectively. The NanoSpec line, including the NanoSpec II, supports thin film measurement across all applications in production and research applications.The Company competes with KLA-Tencor Corporation and Nova Measuring Instruments Ltd.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Smaller, faster, more sophisticated chips. At 22nm and below, novel designs featuring 3D multi-gate transistors are helping to extend the roadmap for smaller devices. But moving to smaller technology nodes with these new structures presents manufacturing challenges.
 
Nanometrics offers a suite of process control tools to help manufacturers as they shrink designs to sub 30nm nodes and develop robust solutions for vertical IC integration.
