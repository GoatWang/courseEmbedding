I've found that I can always get access to my sky computer by paying double credits, even tho...ugh I don't need that kind of power. It would be much more cost efficient if I could use the power plan that I wanted without getting the "all servers in the datacenter are full" message. I wonder... if I can always connect while paying double price if they are discriminating against users who choose to pay less to use less power.  The forum is full of complaints with no resolutions, but as far as gaming goes, it works fine when the servers are up. I believe their pricing model may not allow them to provide the necessary network and computers to serve all current customers. There's a simple solution: Don't sell space you don't have. Everything else would be great, if I could simply rely on the fact that I will be able to connect when I want. 展开Ben Ebrahim · 2017年5月23日Good when working.  When I don't get the "servers are full message" and can actually log in and not just sit watching the "starting your skycomputer" message fo...r ages it works reasonably well.  I get some mouse lag occasionally and rare screen freezes where I need to jump back to the Liquidsky home page and back to my skycomputer to see my screen again.  But not too bad, it seems like it could be a good replacement for splashing out on hundreds to upgrade my PC.  It rarely works however, and apparently never during "peak" hours 6-8pm GMT for me.  Contacting support is just a waste of time as the only communication that seems to come out is from marketing and its one way communication. 展开Gavin Whittaker · 2017年4月18日First impressions were bad, really bad...couldn't even get logged in despite buying a package from the get-go. In the last few days i have managed to get logged... in and have an initial tinker.  FPS and quality is very good. It needs a few tweaks here and there yet for me it is all about the android app....really hoping that delivers like the Windows client! 展开Manuel Göbel · 2017年5月27日I'm in love with this new technology Liquidsky provides. My gaming experience with this service is great and it really feels like I'm using my own Laptop for ga...ming when I'm moving my mouse or typing something. I'm always connecting to the datacenter in Frankfurt, DE and I've never experienced technical problems there. I hope Liquidsky will become very successful and continue providing this great service in the future. 展开Seef Nasril Islam · 2017年7月6日i've been following liquidsky for months, until i finally decided to buy up a plan. i thought it would be awesome, i can use run a powerful pc on my own compute...r. but  at the end i regret it. after buying the plan, i click on create skycomputer, and it just simply STUCK on a video which never start that says "getting to know your skycomputer". although im not on the LiquidSky computer im just waiting, Liquidsky actually charging my skycredit. my advice to eveyone else who are thinking about using liquidsky. DON'T until atleast they release the full product which is currently on beta. you maybe lucky enough to not have to deal with bugs or even managing to use the LS like i didn't but simply not worth the risk. 展开Stefanos Neofytidis · 2017年7月17日Too many issues for a service in 2017. First of all the message "Servers are full" at 9.99$. Change the datacenter automatically if servers are full. Customers ...become disappointed if they see this message. They pay you money to play not to see this message. Secondly and most important... i was streaming at 4mbs but i had still lag with a 30mbs connection. I used a wired cable. Did not work either. I think its a nice try but service needs to be updated to work good. 展开Ákos Czakó · 2017年4月16日I tried it on pc works well, but nothing on tablet. I dont know if its actually works on tablets at the moment or it will be supported just later. However if it...s the case why can I download it from the appstore...  Tried to get a simple answer fornthis question but their site's support is only the usual bullshit. It ask me to log in to get more support and when you click on the link you go back to the homepage where is no log in.  If anyone knows something about it let me know.  Cheers 展开Chris Cronin · 2017年5月2日Considering I can't actually use the service, a proper review is not possible. I've been stuck on the server ping page for hours, and have implemented various f...ixes, but all efforts have been pointless. The communication from these guys is almost non-existant meaning the primary problem doesn't get resolved, or at least some indication of what's happening. Hopefully in the near future I can revise my revue, but until then It remains one star. 展开Kevin Burke · 2017年7月13日This service is garbage. I paid for access and tried to go back and forth with their "support". It's just canned responses that don't address the issues. I go t...o their community page to state what's going on, and the mod locks my account and deletes the threads. WORST customer service I've ever seen, and for a service that apparently doesn't even work. I haven't even gotten my money back, these incompetents can't even process a refund. Buyer beware. I'd give zero stars if I could, they basically stole my money. 展开Robert Francis Beck · 2017年7月24日It has a big future. It would be wise not to count this newcomers short; they've had a long alpha & beta, and people keep lining up for there service -minor kin...ks and all. The CEO is hard driven and faithful that he is filling an untapped niche. As hardware prices become stiffer on the pocket, not just GaaS, but its big offshoot DaaS, will be a standard that Liquid Sky is in a ripe position to leverage. 展开Allen Kaczorowski · 2017年7月8日One of the best software's i've ever used. I played fallout 4 on full graphic settings with absolutely no lag. Plus a great way to download music and videos/movies without taking up your own space. Please add the new client to android soon.Eduardo Gonzalez · 2017年6月5日Finally, gaming for low-income households!  After years playing with Steam in my host PC, none were capable of complying with my system specifications causing s...everely low frame rates, hangups, and crashes even with settings tuned for the lowest memory usage. And a gaming rig is beyond my monetary reach for the fact that I only earn $300 monthly.  Liquidsky became my remedy. Modest pricing, the configuration for ultra settings under 60 fps, what could go wrong? And with plans starting at $9.99/month, it's a steal.  If you cloud gamer, and sick of the other platforms that charge you $5/hour for using it giving you no results you were seeking, kick that out and make the switch today! 展开Alex Anastasiu · 2017年5月30日This actually sounds like some good stuff. With the basic ~10$/month plan it would take between 6 and 8 years to pay as much as you would on a brand new equival...ent gaming PC, by which point whatever you bought, would be somewhat dated. Of course how useful this is depends on the average number of hours you spend gaming, monthly.  Haven't tried it yet. Just thought I would reach out, share it and maybe get some feedback here. 展开Daniel Morales Roca · 2017年7月7日Slow, games are problematic, not as advertised, too much hype! they will NOT refundf your $$$ at least it was just $5 measly but money is money, could of bough something to eat with that ;-) LOL!Michał Dylla · 2017年5月26日The service is really great and as soon as things will start to work i will certainly become a customer. Too bad that at this moment it's nearly impossible to l...ogin to skycomputer as all data centers ar busy all the time.  UPDATE: Patch 0.2.9 fixed the problem although i had to delete my SkyComputer and all the data. 展开Josh Atkins · 2017年4月28日Customer Service Doesn't Serve. Plain and simple. They ignore problems, refuse refunds, release clients that doesn't work. Never listen to the 5 star  fanboys. ...I've been here since the very beginning, and the company is tanking fast. Used to love it, but they might as well be OnLive, EA, and Ubisoft rolled into one. 展开Isfar Malik · 2017年6月8日LiquidSky is 1 of the Cloud Gaming Service but it is the #1 FREE! Cloud Gaming Service! Its pricing is Cheap and OK! But it must include  Some more functions su...ch as 15 Free Credits for those who log in the SkyComputer Daily!, Also the Google Play Store Payment Method will be very Awesome for Android users, The Ads should be For everyone The Most Important Areas for Ads is Asia I founded 100K+ Paid LiquidSky Users!  LiquidSky Must Work on  •Ads for everyone, EveryWhere  •Free 15 Credits Per day for Log In  •Google Play Store Payment Method!  Thanks to LIQUIDSKY! 2.0 Cloud Gaming ! 展开Jakub Duhonský · 2017年6月1日Warning: It is NOT working at all - at least in Central Europe. I bought Skycredits yesterday, at first app stuck at starting screen. Now it says "All servers i...n this datacenter (Frankfurt) are full". All servers full @10p.m., all servers full @1a.m., @10.a.m. as well as @ 2.p.m. So, I just wasted 3 hours of my time and few bucks in addition. 展开Andy Hayes · 2017年4月23日PC is plugged directly into router with 110mbps download and still serious lag. Different issue everytime I log in, this time being the mouse cursor alignment. I understand this is still in beta. May return when it's finished.Neel Gupta · 2017年7月12日LOL...  "Ad availability and SkyCredit reward values will vary depending on the ads themselves... LiquidSky does NOT guarantee that a user will be able to earn 180 SkyCredits every single day." ...User eXperience will depend on the Country of residence !全部视频SketchUp1611Paint In Liquid Sky82The Sky is Loading...16183全部更多

Publisher's Description+


                From  Liquid Sky Software: 


    NOT A REMOTE DESKTOP. YOU GET A FULL PC IN THE CLOUD. LiquidSky lets you run any PC program or game on your Android device. Simply open the LiquidSky app and your device is transformed into a high end Windows Gaming Desktop PC. Run games like Fallout 4, Counter Strike, Witcher 3 and many more on their highest settings. You don't even need to own a computer. Once approved into the beta, you can login and access a full Windows desktop PC hosted in the cloud to install any Windows program or game. LiquidSky supports almost any OTG/Bluetooth keyboard, mouse or controller. LiquidSky requires a stable 4G/WiFi internet connection to function properly and may not be compatible with your Android device. For the best experience we recommend being within 1, 500km of a data center. We currently have 8 data centers across the world. Data Center Locations Include: San Jose, CA - Dallas, TX - Washington D. C. Frankfurt, Germany - London, UK -Hong Kong - Tokyo, Japan - Sydney, Australia We are always adding more locations so please let us know which locations you want us to consider here https://liquidsky. tv/en/data-centersHave questions? Visit our F. A. Q for more information: http://blog. liquidsky. tv/frequently-asked-questions/Apply for the beta at https://LiquidSky. tv to get your free trial access.

I've found that I can always get access to my sky computer by paying double credits, even tho...ugh I don't need that kind of power. It would be much more cost efficient if I could use the power plan that I wanted without getting the "all servers in the datacenter are full" message. I wonder... if I can always connect while paying double price if they are discriminating against users who choose to pay less to use less power.  The forum is full of complaints with no resolutions, but as far as gaming goes, it works fine when the servers are up. I believe their pricing model may not allow them to provide the necessary network and computers to serve all current customers. There's a simple solution: Don't sell space you don't have. Everything else would be great, if I could simply rely on the fact that I will be able to connect when I want. 展开Ben Ebrahim · 2017年5月23日Good when working.  When I don't get the "servers are full message" and can actually log in and not just sit watching the "starting your skycomputer" message fo...r ages it works reasonably well.  I get some mouse lag occasionally and rare screen freezes where I need to jump back to the Liquidsky home page and back to my skycomputer to see my screen again.  But not too bad, it seems like it could be a good replacement for splashing out on hundreds to upgrade my PC.  It rarely works however, and apparently never during "peak" hours 6-8pm GMT for me.  Contacting support is just a waste of time as the only communication that seems to come out is from marketing and its one way communication. 展开Gavin Whittaker · 2017年4月18日First impressions were bad, really bad...couldn't even get logged in despite buying a package from the get-go. In the last few days i have managed to get logged... in and have an initial tinker.  FPS and quality is very good. It needs a few tweaks here and there yet for me it is all about the android app....really hoping that delivers like the Windows client! 展开Manuel Göbel · 2017年5月27日I'm in love with this new technology Liquidsky provides. My gaming experience with this service is great and it really feels like I'm using my own Laptop for ga...ming when I'm moving my mouse or typing something. I'm always connecting to the datacenter in Frankfurt, DE and I've never experienced technical problems there. I hope Liquidsky will become very successful and continue providing this great service in the future. 展开Seef Nasril Islam · 2017年7月6日i've been following liquidsky for months, until i finally decided to buy up a plan. i thought it would be awesome, i can use run a powerful pc on my own compute...r. but  at the end i regret it. after buying the plan, i click on create skycomputer, and it just simply STUCK on a video which never start that says "getting to know your skycomputer". although im not on the LiquidSky computer im just waiting, Liquidsky actually charging my skycredit. my advice to eveyone else who are thinking about using liquidsky. DON'T until atleast they release the full product which is currently on beta. you maybe lucky enough to not have to deal with bugs or even managing to use the LS like i didn't but simply not worth the risk. 展开Stefanos Neofytidis · 2017年7月17日Too many issues for a service in 2017. First of all the message "Servers are full" at 9.99$. Change the datacenter automatically if servers are full. Customers ...become disappointed if they see this message. They pay you money to play not to see this message. Secondly and most important... i was streaming at 4mbs but i had still lag with a 30mbs connection. I used a wired cable. Did not work either. I think its a nice try but service needs to be updated to work good. 展开Ákos Czakó · 2017年4月16日I tried it on pc works well, but nothing on tablet. I dont know if its actually works on tablets at the moment or it will be supported just later. However if it...s the case why can I download it from the appstore...  Tried to get a simple answer fornthis question but their site's support is only the usual bullshit. It ask me to log in to get more support and when you click on the link you go back to the homepage where is no log in.  If anyone knows something about it let me know.  Cheers 展开Chris Cronin · 2017年5月2日Considering I can't actually use the service, a proper review is not possible. I've been stuck on the server ping page for hours, and have implemented various f...ixes, but all efforts have been pointless. The communication from these guys is almost non-existant meaning the primary problem doesn't get resolved, or at least some indication of what's happening. Hopefully in the near future I can revise my revue, but until then It remains one star. 展开Kevin Burke · 2017年7月13日This service is garbage. I paid for access and tried to go back and forth with their "support". It's just canned responses that don't address the issues. I go t...o their community page to state what's going on, and the mod locks my account and deletes the threads. WORST customer service I've ever seen, and for a service that apparently doesn't even work. I haven't even gotten my money back, these incompetents can't even process a refund. Buyer beware. I'd give zero stars if I could, they basically stole my money. 展开Robert Francis Beck · 2017年7月24日It has a big future. It would be wise not to count this newcomers short; they've had a long alpha & beta, and people keep lining up for there service -minor kin...ks and all. The CEO is hard driven and faithful that he is filling an untapped niche. As hardware prices become stiffer on the pocket, not just GaaS, but its big offshoot DaaS, will be a standard that Liquid Sky is in a ripe position to leverage. 展开Allen Kaczorowski · 2017年7月8日One of the best software's i've ever used. I played fallout 4 on full graphic settings with absolutely no lag. Plus a great way to download music and videos/movies without taking up your own space. Please add the new client to android soon.Eduardo Gonzalez · 2017年6月5日Finally, gaming for low-income households!  After years playing with Steam in my host PC, none were capable of complying with my system specifications causing s...everely low frame rates, hangups, and crashes even with settings tuned for the lowest memory usage. And a gaming rig is beyond my monetary reach for the fact that I only earn $300 monthly.  Liquidsky became my remedy. Modest pricing, the configuration for ultra settings under 60 fps, what could go wrong? And with plans starting at $9.99/month, it's a steal.  If you cloud gamer, and sick of the other platforms that charge you $5/hour for using it giving you no results you were seeking, kick that out and make the switch today! 展开Alex Anastasiu · 2017年5月30日This actually sounds like some good stuff. With the basic ~10$/month plan it would take between 6 and 8 years to pay as much as you would on a brand new equival...ent gaming PC, by which point whatever you bought, would be somewhat dated. Of course how useful this is depends on the average number of hours you spend gaming, monthly.  Haven't tried it yet. Just thought I would reach out, share it and maybe get some feedback here. 展开Daniel Morales Roca · 2017年7月7日Slow, games are problematic, not as advertised, too much hype! they will NOT refundf your $$$ at least it was just $5 measly but money is money, could of bough something to eat with that ;-) LOL!Michał Dylla · 2017年5月26日The service is really great and as soon as things will start to work i will certainly become a customer. Too bad that at this moment it's nearly impossible to l...ogin to skycomputer as all data centers ar busy all the time.  UPDATE: Patch 0.2.9 fixed the problem although i had to delete my SkyComputer and all the data. 展开Josh Atkins · 2017年4月28日Customer Service Doesn't Serve. Plain and simple. They ignore problems, refuse refunds, release clients that doesn't work. Never listen to the 5 star  fanboys. ...I've been here since the very beginning, and the company is tanking fast. Used to love it, but they might as well be OnLive, EA, and Ubisoft rolled into one. 展开Isfar Malik · 2017年6月8日LiquidSky is 1 of the Cloud Gaming Service but it is the #1 FREE! Cloud Gaming Service! Its pricing is Cheap and OK! But it must include  Some more functions su...ch as 15 Free Credits for those who log in the SkyComputer Daily!, Also the Google Play Store Payment Method will be very Awesome for Android users, The Ads should be For everyone The Most Important Areas for Ads is Asia I founded 100K+ Paid LiquidSky Users!  LiquidSky Must Work on  •Ads for everyone, EveryWhere  •Free 15 Credits Per day for Log In  •Google Play Store Payment Method!  Thanks to LIQUIDSKY! 2.0 Cloud Gaming ! 展开Jakub Duhonský · 2017年6月1日Warning: It is NOT working at all - at least in Central Europe. I bought Skycredits yesterday, at first app stuck at starting screen. Now it says "All servers i...n this datacenter (Frankfurt) are full". All servers full @10p.m., all servers full @1a.m., @10.a.m. as well as @ 2.p.m. So, I just wasted 3 hours of my time and few bucks in addition. 展开Andy Hayes · 2017年4月23日PC is plugged directly into router with 110mbps download and still serious lag.
