                           A classic of pure mathematics, this advanced graduate-level text explores the intersection of functional analysis and analytic
                              function theory. Close in spirit to abstract harmonic analysis, it is confined to Banach spaces of analytic functions in the
                              unit disc. The author devotes the first four chapters to proofs of classical theorems on boundary values and boundary integral
                              representations of analytic functions in the unit disc, including generalizations to Dirichlet algebras. The fifth chapter
                              contains the factorization theory of Hp functions, a discussion of some partial extensions of the factorization, and a brief
                              description of the classical approach to the theorems of the first five chapters. The remainder of the book addresses the
                              structure of various Banach spaces and Banach algebras of analytic functions in the unit disc. Enhanced with 100 challenging
                              exercises, a bibliography, and an index, this text belongs in the libraries of students, professional mathematicians, as well
                              as anyone interested in a rigorous, high-level treatment of this topic

                           Developed for an introductory course in mathematical analysis at MIT, this text focuses on concepts, principles, and methods.
                              Its introductions to real and complex analysis are closely formulated, and they constitute a natural introduction to complex
                              function theory. Starting with an overview of the real number system, the text presents results for subsets and functions
                              related to Euclidean space of n dimensions. It offers a rigorous review of the fundamentals of calculus, emphasizing power
                              series expansions and introducing the theory of complex-analytic functions. Subsequent chapters cover sequences of functions,
                              normed linear spaces, and the Lebesgue interval. They discuss most of the basic properties of integral and measure, including
                              a brief look at orthogonal expansions. A chapter on differentiable mappings concludes the text, addressing implicit and inverse
                              function theorems and the change of variable theorem. Exercises appear throughout the book, and extensive supplementary material
                              includes a bibliography, list of symbols, index, and appendix with background in elementary set theory
