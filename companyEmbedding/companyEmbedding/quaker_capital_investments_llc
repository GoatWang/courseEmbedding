What are analysts saying about Limelight Networks stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Limelight Networks stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "LIMELIGHT NETWORKS, INC. is a content delivery partner enabling the next wave of Internet business and entertainment. More than 1300 Internet, entertainment, software, and technology brands trust their robust, scalable platform to monetize their digital assets by delivering a brilliant online experience to their global audience.

LimeLight's proven network and passion for service assures their customers that every object in their library will be instantly delivered to every user, every time.   " (6/27/2017)
2. FBR & Co analysts commented, "LLNW delivered solid 4Q results that handily surpassed consensus expectations. A laser focus on cost management is driving material improvement in margins. Management appears to be finding a path of sustainable growth and improved profitability. Gross margin guidance of at least 150 bps of expansion in FY17 suggests to us that R&D investments are beginning to bear fruit, as incremental network capacity can be added at relatively low incremental cost, coinciding with steady growth in OTT content. During the quarter, the gross margin expanded by an impressive 387 bps YOY; the adjusted EBITDA margin surged by 478 bps YOY . Looking into FY17, management plans to increase marketing spending (following lower YOY marketing spending in FY16), which should benefit the top line and drive EBITDA growth, in our view. However, we also see AKAM moving more aggressively in the marketplace to replace lost revenue from DIY service providers, which could affect LLNW’s ability to sustain momentum. With that said, we maintain Market Perform and our $2.50 price target." (2/9/2017)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Limelight Networks (NASDAQ:LLNW) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Hold Rating, 3 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.75)Consensus Price Target: $3.43 (2.18% downside)
