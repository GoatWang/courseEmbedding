Any proceeds received from the sale of our common shares will be
deposited directly into our operating account.  We will be attempting
to raise up to $500,000, minus expenses of $20,000, from the sale of
our common shares.  These proceeds will be used as follows:


Gross Proceeds             $500,000   $300,000    $150,000    $ 75,000

Expenses                    20,000      20,000      20,000      20,000

Net Proceeds             $480,000     $280,000    $130,000    $ 55,000

SEC reporting costs        22,500       22,500      22,500      22,500
Advertising                91,500       51,500      21,500       6,500
Marketing and promotion   114,375       64,375      26,875       8,125

General working capital    22,875       12,875       5,375       1,625

Net Proceeds             $480,000     $280,000    $130,000    $ 55,000


In the event we are not successful in selling a portion of the securities to 
raise at least $75,000, we would give priority to allocating capital to 
complete everything necessary to be ready to meet our SEC reporting 
requirements. Any remaining capital would be used to fund our working capital
needs. If we are unable to raise the funds needed, Ms. Walker, an officer and 
director has verbally agreed to lend the necessary funds to move forward with 
the marketing and promotion. These monies shall be provided as her personal 
budget allows. These loans shall be without interest and shall have no 
specific repayment date. Any amounts loaned with be repaid when revenues 
allow, if ever. Ms. Walker has privately funded the business thus far. There 
has not been an established maximum that Ms. Walker is willing and able to 
loan. Loans to the company funded by Ms. Walker will be given on 
a project-by-project basis. Relevant factors considered in loan determination
include cost of the project, potential impact of the project on sales, and 
ability to fund the project. 

We will not receive any proceeds from the resale of securities by selling 
security holders.


The music industry is intensely competitive and fragmented. We will compete on 
the basis of price and selection against other small companies like ours, as 
well as large companies that have a similar business and large marketing 
companies. 

Some of our major competitors are: 

Heavy Hitters Music: Heavy Hitters Music has been in the music licensing 
business for over 30 years and seems to be the pioneer of the source music 
niche. Their website boasts a catalog of over 8,500 music tracks. In 2007, 
former CBS TV executive, Cindy Slaughter, and her husband, Mark purchased 
Heavy Hitters. 

MasterSource: Mastersource became the first real source music competitor for 
Heavy Hitters when it was formed in 1992 by Marc Ferrari. MasterSource seems 
to be the first and only competitor with tracks available to the general
public. 

Killer Tracks: Killer Tracks has been in business for twenty years according 
to their website. They boast 2000 CDs of music available, yet only a small 
fraction includes source music. They specialize in backgdround, score, special 
FX and studio music. 

J2R Music: J2R Music has a variety of source music for licensing to television 
and film. 

Free Play Music: Free Play Music has a large variety of production music, and 
a growing number of source music tracks. Although their name indicates the 
music is free, it is not free for commercial use. 

Sync Free Music: Sync Free Music has a large variety of production music, and 
a growing number of source music tracks. Although their name indicates the 
music is free, it is not free for commercial use. 

License Jazz: License Jazz is a new company targeting commercial jazz music 
needs. 

Pump Audio: Pump Audio started in 2001 and has some source music, but 
specializes in production and transition music.


Company Description
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on August 20, 2009. 
We are a development stage company, formed to license songs to the television 
and movie industry. From our inception to date, we have generated very little 
revenues, and our operations have been limited to


 organizational, start-up, 
and capital formation activities. We currently have no employees other than 
our officers, who are also our directors. 

We have never declared bankruptcy, have never been in receivership, and have 
never been involved in any legal action or proceedings. We have not made any 
significant purchase or sale of assets, nor has the registrant been involved 
in any mergers, acquisitions or consolidations. We are not a blank check 
registrant as that term is defined in Rule 419(a)(2) of Regulation C of the 
Securities Act of 1933, because we have a specific business plan and purpose. 
Neither the registrant, nor its officers, directors, promoters or affiliates, 
has had preliminary contact or discussions with, nor do we have any present 
plans, proposals, arrangements or understandings with any representatives of 
the owners of any business or company regarding the possibility of an 
acquisition or merger. 

License and Assignment Agreement. In 2000, Lecia L. Walker assisted in 
launching Private Wavs, a successful music library which licenses music to 
television and film, along with her husband at that time. Part of her roll in 
that endeavor was to do the market research, product and packaging design, 
sales and marketing. In 2007, she sold her interest in Private Wavs and in 
2008, started a new music library under a DBA of Original Source Music, Inc. 
Since that time she has placed more than 1,100 songs under contract. 

On August 21, 2009, Lecia Walker granted a license for a period of ten 
(10) years for the entire list of songs to the registrant under a License and 
Assignment Agreement. Pursuant to the License and Assignment Agreement, Ms. 
Walker was issued 3,000,000 common shares of the registrant 

Lecia L. Walker is now an officer and director of the registrant, bringing 
her experience to the registrant, and intends to continue to place many new 
songs under contract and then to license those songs to the television and 
movie industry. 

Convertible Promissory Note. On June 28, 2010, the registrant entered into 
a Convertible Promissory Note for an amount of $2,000 with American Business 
Services, Inc., a Colorado corporation, an unaffiliated entity. The 
promissory note is convertible into common stock of the registrant at 50% of 
the bid price of the stock at the time of conversion, if the stock is quoted 
on an exchange, or, if the stock is not quoted on an exchange, at double the 
par value of the stock. This could result in as much as an additional dilution
of 1,000,000 shares of stock, if the note was converted prior to the stock 
being quoted on an exchange.

Original Source Music, Inc. 8201 South Santa Fe Drive, Suite 229, Littleton, 
Colorado 80120. Our telephone number is (303) 495- 3728.

Products[edit]
Bratz[edit]
Main article: Bratz
Introduced in 2001, Bratz is MGA's most successful product line, with various spin-offs from the original teenage dolls, including miniature versions (Lil' Bratz), kid versions (Bratz Kidz) baby dolls (Bratz Babyz), pets (Bratz Petz), tiny baby dolls with pets (Lil' Angelz), two feature films (Bratz: The Movie and Bratz Girlz Really Rock) and numerous DVDs and soundtracks. Because of the lawsuit brought by Mattel against MGA in 2008, the Bratz Kidz and Bratz Lil' Angelz were renamed "4*Ever Kidz" and "4*Ever Lil' Angelz", respectively, before their eventual discontinuation in 2009. They returned in 2010 for their 10th Anniversary with brand new bodies and makeup, which resembled the makeup of the prototypes for the original dolls. In 2013, they were given a new, taller body and a brand new logo. They took a hiatus a year later to rebuild the brand to try and match their original success. They returned, once again, in 2015 with completely new branding, head and body molds, and the return of the original logo. They were met with low sales and dissatisfaction from children and fans alike, and were discontinued again in 2016. They are expected to return in 2018.
Moxie Girlz and Moxie Teenz[edit]
Main article: Moxie Girlz
In 2009, a new doll line named Moxie Girlz was introduced. These Moxie girlz are similar, but legally distinct, from the Bratz line of dolls. This is to circumvent the ruling from the lawsuit described below.
The Moxie Girlz were intended to replace Bratz, but when they came back, the Moxie Girlz became a separate line of their own. The line includes Avery, Lexa, Sophina, Bria and more characters, and has been around since 2009. They are similar to the Bratz line, only this line shows more modest fashions that typical tweens would wear.
The Moxie Teenz are a spin-off from the Girlz, and includes college girls with unique skills. The line launched in Fall 2010, the characters Melrose, Tristen, Arizona and Bijou were in the first two lines, and new characters Leigh and Gavin joined in Fall 2011.
No Moxie Teenz were made after 2011, and Moxie Girlz were discontinued in 2014. Leftover dolls were made into Moxie Girlz Friends (exclusive to Target) and the Storytime Princess Collection (exclusive to Toys "R" Us).
KaChooz[edit]
The KaChooz were introduced in 2011 - these are pencil toppers with wild hair. Each KaChooz character is in a group known as a Moop, and it's the buyer's job to reunite all of the characters in their Moops. Examples of Moops are Rainbow, Mohawk, Nervous, Highlights, Punk and 2-faced - each Moop has a different personality that the KaChooz are associated with.[citation needed]
Lalaloopsy[edit]
Main article: Lalaloopsy
MGA Entertainment introduced its Lalaloopsy brand in 2010 accompanied by the tagline "Sew Magical, Sew Cute."[4] Lalaloopsy were once rag dolls who magically came to life when their very last stitch was sewn. Each Lalaloopsy doll has a unique personality reflected by the fabrics used to make them. They live happily together in Lalaloopsy Land, a whimsical world full of fun and surprises around every corner. Each Lalaloopsy doll comes with his or her own pet.[5]
Lalaoopsy dolls stand approximately 13 inches. Large dolls include Rosy Bumps 'n' Bruises, Crumbs Sugar Cookie, Dot Starlight, Peanut Big Top and more. Recent additions to the line include Mango Tiki Wiki, Coral Sea Shells and Toffee Cocoa Cuddles. In Fall 2011, MGA released Suzette La Sweet, a Lalaloopsy collector doll who was sewn from pieces of a duchess' dress.
The Lalaloopsy line includes Littles dolls, the younger brothers and sisters of Lalaloopsy dolls. Just like their older siblings, the Littles magically came to life when their very last stich was sewn. The Lalaloopsy Littles have their own unique personalities and pets. There are currently eight Lalaloopsy Littles dolls, including Matey Anchors (Marina Anchors' brother), Bundles Snuggle Stuff (Mittens Fluff 'n' Stuff's sister) and Scribbles Splash (Spot Splatter Splash's sister). Laloopsys were a hit in 2010.
Also in the Lalaloopsy line are Mini Lalaloopsy, Lalaloopsy Micros and Accessories. The Accessories line includes outfits and furniture for the Lalaloopsy dolls and Littles dolls, and Mini Lalaloopsy playsets and vehicles.
Lalaloopsy dolls are sold in store and online at a variety of retailers. On December 7, 2010, Lalaloopsy had the People's Play Award for large dolls.
True Hope[edit]
True Hope is a special edition doll franchise introduced in 2012. In an effort to raise cancer awareness, MGA Entertainment created a line of bald Bratz and Moxie Girlz dolls stating that "courage is always in style." MGA Entertainment plans to donate one dollar from every sale to City of Hope Cancer Foundation.”
Novi Stars[edit]
Main article: Novi Stars
Novi Stars was a brand line which will be released around August 2012; MGA has partnered with Justice Stores to bring out these new characters. The line revolves around alien characters landing on the planet Earth to discover new trends. Each character has a special quality: for instance, Alie Lectric blushes, Ari Roma is scented, Una Verse glitters, and Mae Tallick can talk. The brand was discontinued in 2014.
The line's tagline is What on earth is going on?
Characters:

Alie Lectric (light up) - brainy, organized
Ari Roma (scented) - airy, romantic
Una Verse (water & glitter) - trendy, fashionable
Mae Tallick (talk) - talkative, clumsy
Nita Light (glows) - creative, artistic
Malie Tasker (her 4 arms stretch and glow)
Tula Toned (filled with two-colored goo)
Anne Arctic (her legs are filled with snow)
Ina Ferna (her hair glows)

Project Mc2[edit]
Main article: Project Mc2
Project Mc2 is a doll line introduced in 2015. There is also a live-action series on Netflix produced by AwesomenessTV, a division of DreamWorks Animation.
The line's tagline is Smart is the New Cool
Characters:

McKeyla McAlister
Adrienne Attoms
Bryden Bandweth
Camryn Coyle
Devon D'Marco
Ember Evergreen

Miscellaneous[edit]
MGA Entertainment also owns Little Tikes, a popular infant, pre-school and young child toy line.
Super Click-It[edit]
In 1999, a clone to the Bop It line of games was made by MGA Entertainment under the name Super Click-It, and it was also made under the name Bonk It. It was sold by a retailer in the UK called Marks and Spencer in 2003. The game unit has five actions which are Squish It (a double sided yellow button that is pressed), Zip It (a lever that can be pushed up and down), Twist It (an orange knob that looks similar to the Twist It knob from the Bop It Extreme), Blast It (a green fan that when the command is issued will work either by blowing or using one finger to make it work.) and Crack It (an object that is designed to pull backwards and then to normal position). The game has two game modes which are: One Player with Voice Commands (the voice will say: "One Player, Squish It!" when the player presses the Squish It button to select the game mode), One Player with Sound Commands (The voice will say "One Player" with a Squish It sound effect). There are also two two player game modes which are Two Player Voice Commands and Two Player Sound Commands.
The aim of the game is similar to Bop It where the game gives one command and the player has to obey and perform the action. The game has a maximum score of 100 points and on achieving the maximum score the player is celebrated with a fanfare. In the two player game mode, the game can continue up to 200 points if one player has scored 100 first. In the two player mode, the voice says "Switch" instead of "Pass It". Unlike Bop It, the game gives the player more time to respond to the command. The game doesn't have any screaming sounds when the player performs the wrong action or runs out of time, instead cartoon sound effects are heard such as the wa wa wa wa melody or a slip up sound effect when a cartoon character slips over a banana skin.
Lawsuit[edit]
On July 17, 2008, the U.S. District Court in Riverside ruled against MGA Entertainment and for Mattel Inc. in a battle over the creation rights of the Bratz doll line. The jury in the case determined that Carter Bryant, creator of the Bratz doll line, had violated his exclusivity contract and had designed the dolls while he was still working at Mattel. Mattel was awarded $100 million US in damages, far less than the $1 billion they were seeking.[6]
On December 3, 2008, U.S. District Judge Stephen Larson granted an injunction requested by Mattel, which effectively banned MGA from manufacturing and selling Bratz dolls, though he allowed MGA to continue selling Bratz through the end of the 2008 holiday season.[7] Larson determined that all of MGA's Bratz produced from 2001 through 2008, except for the Kidz and Lil Angelz lines, infringed on Mattel's intellectual property. Larson allowed MGA to continue to manufacture the Kidz and Lil Angelz lines, provided that they not be promoted under the Bratz brand. He also stipulated that MGA must, at their own cost, remove all Bratz merchandise from retailers' shelves, reimburse retailers for said merchandise, and turn all recalled product over to Mattel for disposal. In addition, MGA was to destroy all marketing materials, molds, and other materials that had been used in the manufacture and sale of Bratz.[8] MGA immediately filed for a permanent stay of the injunction and, on February 11, 2009, was granted a stay through at least the end of 2009.
On December 10, 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit granted MGA an immediate stay of the injunction, effectively halting the recall of Bratz product, which was to have begun on January 21, 2010. In their initial ruling, the Court found Larson's previous ruling to be unusually "draconian," questioned why Mattel had simply been handed ownership of the entire franchise rather than be awarded a stake in the ownership of the franchise or a share of the royalties from future Bratz sales, and ordered MGA and Mattel into mediation.
In April 2011, a federal court jury in Santa Ana, California, awarded MGA $88.4 Million and ruled that MGA didn't steal the idea for Bratz dolls from Mattel or infringe its copyright. Additionally, the jury found Mattel liable for stealing closely held trade secrets from MGA and other toymakers.
Due to a technical procedural issue having nothing to do with the merits of the claims, the Ninth circuit vacated without prejudice the $170 million judgment against Mattel for this misconduct. On January 13, 2014, MGA filed a complaint for these claims in State court in California seeking in excess of $1 billion, and this lawsuit is currently pending.[9]

Larson allowed MGA to continue to manufacture the Kidz and Lil Angelz lines, provided that they not be promoted under the Bratz brand. He also stipulated that MGA must, at their own cost, remove all Bratz merchandise from retailers' shelves, reimburse retailers for said merchandise, and turn all recalled product over to Mattel for disposal. In addition, MGA was to destroy all marketing materials, molds, and other materials that had been used in the manufacture and sale of Bratz.[8] MGA immediately filed for a permanent stay of the injunction and, on February 11, 2009, was granted a stay through at least the end of 2009.
On December 10, 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit granted MGA an immediate stay of the injunction, effectively halting the recall of Bratz product, which was to have begun on January 21, 2010. In their initial ruling, the Court found Larson's previous ruling to be unusually "draconian," questioned why Mattel had simply been handed ownership of the entire franchise rather than be awarded a stake in the ownership of the franchise or a share of the royalties from future Bratz sales, and ordered MGA and Mattel into mediation.
In April 2011, a federal court jury in Santa Ana, California, awarded MGA $88.4 Million and ruled that MGA didn't steal the idea for Bratz dolls from Mattel or infringe its copyright. Additionally, the jury found Mattel liable for stealing closely held trade secrets from MGA and other toymakers.
Due to a technical procedural issue having nothing to do with the merits of the claims, the Ninth circuit vacated without prejudice the $170 million judgment against Mattel for this misconduct. On January 13, 2014, MGA filed a complaint for these claims in State court in California seeking in excess of $1 billion, and this lawsuit is currently pending.[9]

Products[edit]
Bratz[edit]
Main article: Bratz
Introduced in 2001, Bratz is MGA's most successful product line, with various spin-offs from the original teenage dolls, including miniature versions (Lil' Bratz), kid versions (Bratz Kidz) baby dolls (Bratz Babyz), pets (Bratz Petz), tiny baby dolls with pets (Lil' Angelz), two feature films (Bratz: The Movie and Bratz Girlz Really Rock) and numerous DVDs and soundtracks. Because of the lawsuit brought by Mattel against MGA in 2008, the Bratz Kidz and Bratz Lil' Angelz were renamed "4*Ever Kidz" and "4*Ever Lil' Angelz", respectively, before their eventual discontinuation in 2009. They returned in 2010 for their 10th Anniversary with brand new bodies and makeup, which resembled the makeup of the prototypes for the original dolls. In 2013, they were given a new, taller body and a brand new logo. They took a hiatus a year later to rebuild the brand to try and match their original success. They returned, once again, in 2015 with completely new branding, head and body molds, and the return of the original logo. They were met with low sales and dissatisfaction from children and fans alike, and were discontinued again in 2016. They are expected to return in 2018.
Moxie Girlz and Moxie Teenz[edit]
Main article: Moxie Girlz
In 2009, a new doll line named Moxie Girlz was introduced. These Moxie girlz are similar, but legally distinct, from the Bratz line of dolls. This is to circumvent the ruling from the lawsuit described below.
The Moxie Girlz were intended to replace Bratz, but when they came back, the Moxie Girlz became a separate line of their own. The line includes Avery, Lexa, Sophina, Bria and more characters, and has been around since 2009. They are similar to the Bratz line, only this line shows more modest fashions that typical tweens would wear.
The Moxie Teenz are a spin-off from the Girlz, and includes college girls with unique skills. The line launched in Fall 2010, the characters Melrose, Tristen, Arizona and Bijou were in the first two lines, and new characters Leigh and Gavin joined in Fall 2011.
No Moxie Teenz were made after 2011, and Moxie Girlz were discontinued in 2014. Leftover dolls were made into Moxie Girlz Friends (exclusive to Target) and the Storytime Princess Collection (exclusive to Toys "R" Us).
KaChooz[edit]
The KaChooz were introduced in 2011 - these are pencil toppers with wild hair. Each KaChooz character is in a group known as a Moop, and it's the buyer's job to reunite all of the characters in their Moops. Examples of Moops are Rainbow, Mohawk, Nervous, Highlights, Punk and 2-faced - each Moop has a different personality that the KaChooz are associated with.[citation needed]
Lalaloopsy[edit]
Main article: Lalaloopsy
MGA Entertainment introduced its Lalaloopsy brand in 2010 accompanied by the tagline "Sew Magical, Sew Cute."[4] Lalaloopsy were once rag dolls who magically came to life when their very last stitch was sewn. Each Lalaloopsy doll has a unique personality reflected by the fabrics used to make them. They live happily together in Lalaloopsy Land, a whimsical world full of fun and surprises around every corner. Each Lalaloopsy doll comes with his or her own pet.[5]
Lalaoopsy dolls stand approximately 13 inches. Large dolls include Rosy Bumps 'n' Bruises, Crumbs Sugar Cookie, Dot Starlight, Peanut Big Top and more. Recent additions to the line include Mango Tiki Wiki, Coral Sea Shells and Toffee Cocoa Cuddles. In Fall 2011, MGA released Suzette La Sweet, a Lalaloopsy collector doll who was sewn from pieces of a duchess' dress.
The Lalaloopsy line includes Littles dolls, the younger brothers and sisters of Lalaloopsy dolls. Just like their older siblings, the Littles magically came to life when their very last stich was sewn. The Lalaloopsy Littles have their own unique personalities and pets. There are currently eight Lalaloopsy Littles dolls, including Matey Anchors (Marina Anchors' brother), Bundles Snuggle Stuff (Mittens Fluff 'n' Stuff's sister) and Scribbles Splash (Spot Splatter Splash's sister). Laloopsys were a hit in 2010.
Also in the Lalaloopsy line are Mini Lalaloopsy, Lalaloopsy Micros and Accessories. The Accessories line includes outfits and furniture for the Lalaloopsy dolls and Littles dolls, and Mini Lalaloopsy playsets and vehicles.
Lalaloopsy dolls are sold in store and online at a variety of retailers. On December 7, 2010, Lalaloopsy had the People's Play Award for large dolls.
True Hope[edit]
True Hope is a special edition doll franchise introduced in 2012. In an effort to raise cancer awareness, MGA Entertainment created a line of bald Bratz and Moxie Girlz dolls stating that "courage is always in style." MGA Entertainment plans to donate one dollar from every sale to City of Hope Cancer Foundation.”
Novi Stars[edit]
Main article: Novi Stars
Novi Stars was a brand line which will be released around August 2012; MGA has partnered with Justice Stores to bring out these new characters. The line revolves around alien characters landing on the planet Earth to discover new trends. Each character has a special quality: for instance, Alie Lectric blushes, Ari Roma is scented, Una Verse glitters, and Mae Tallick can talk. The brand was discontinued in 2014.
The line's tagline is What on earth is going on?
Characters:

Alie Lectric (light up) - brainy, organized
Ari Roma (scented) - airy, romantic
Una Verse (water & glitter) - trendy, fashionable
Mae Tallick (talk) - talkative, clumsy
Nita Light (glows) - creative, artistic
Malie Tasker (her 4 arms stretch and glow)
Tula Toned (filled with two-colored goo)
Anne Arctic (her legs are filled with snow)
Ina Ferna (her hair glows)

Project Mc2[edit]
Main article: Project Mc2
Project Mc2 is a doll line introduced in 2015. There is also a live-action series on Netflix produced by AwesomenessTV, a division of DreamWorks Animation.
The line's tagline is Smart is the New Cool
Characters:

McKeyla McAlister
Adrienne Attoms
Bryden Bandweth
Camryn Coyle
Devon D'Marco
Ember Evergreen

Miscellaneous[edit]
MGA Entertainment also owns Little Tikes, a popular infant, pre-school and young child toy line.
Super Click-It[edit]
In 1999, a clone to the Bop It line of games was made by MGA Entertainment under the name Super Click-It, and it was also made under the name Bonk It. It was sold by a retailer in the UK called Marks and Spencer in 2003. The game unit has five actions which are Squish It (a double sided yellow button that is pressed), Zip It (a lever that can be pushed up and down), Twist It (an orange knob that looks similar to the Twist It knob from the Bop It Extreme), Blast It (a green fan that when the command is issued will work either by blowing or using one finger to make it work.) and Crack It (an object that is designed to pull backwards and then to normal position). The game has two game modes which are: One Player with Voice Commands (the voice will say: "One Player, Squish It!" when the player presses the Squish It button to select the game mode), One Player with Sound Commands (The voice will say "One Player" with a Squish It sound effect). There are also two two player game modes which are Two Player Voice Commands and Two Player Sound Commands.
The aim of the game is similar to Bop It where the game gives one command and the player has to obey and perform the action. The game has a maximum score of 100 points and on achieving the maximum score the player is celebrated with a fanfare. In the two player game mode, the game can continue up to 200 points if one player has scored 100 first. In the two player mode, the voice says "Switch" instead of "Pass It". Unlike Bop It, the game gives the player more time to respond to the command. The game doesn't have any screaming sounds when the player performs the wrong action or runs out of time, instead cartoon sound effects are heard such as the wa wa wa wa melody or a slip up sound effect when a cartoon character slips over a banana skin.
Lawsuit[edit]
On July 17, 2008, the U.S. District Court in Riverside ruled against MGA Entertainment and for Mattel Inc. in a battle over the creation rights of the Bratz doll line. The jury in the case determined that Carter Bryant, creator of the Bratz doll line, had violated his exclusivity contract and had designed the dolls while he was still working at Mattel. Mattel was awarded $100 million US in damages, far less than the $1 billion they were seeking.[6]
On December 3, 2008, U.S. District Judge Stephen Larson granted an injunction requested by Mattel, which effectively banned MGA from manufacturing and selling Bratz dolls, though he allowed MGA to continue selling Bratz through the end of the 2008 holiday season.[7] Larson determined that all of MGA's Bratz produced from 2001 through 2008, except for the Kidz and Lil Angelz lines, infringed on Mattel's intellectual property.

He also stipulated that MGA must, at their own cost, remove all Bratz merchandise from retailers' shelves, reimburse retailers for said merchandise, and turn all recalled product over to Mattel for disposal. In addition, MGA was to destroy all marketing materials, molds, and other materials that had been used in the manufacture and sale of Bratz.[8] MGA immediately filed for a permanent stay of the injunction and, on February 11, 2009, was granted a stay through at least the end of 2009.
On December 10, 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit granted MGA an immediate stay of the injunction, effectively halting the recall of Bratz product, which was to have begun on January 21, 2010. In their initial ruling, the Court found Larson's previous ruling to be unusually "draconian," questioned why Mattel had simply been handed ownership of the entire franchise rather than be awarded a stake in the ownership of the franchise or a share of the royalties from future Bratz sales, and ordered MGA and Mattel into mediation.
In April 2011, a federal court jury in Santa Ana, California, awarded MGA $88.4 Million and ruled that MGA didn't steal the idea for Bratz dolls from Mattel or infringe its copyright. Additionally, the jury found Mattel liable for stealing closely held trade secrets from MGA and other toymakers.
Due to a technical procedural issue having nothing to do with the merits of the claims, the Ninth circuit vacated without prejudice the $170 million judgment against Mattel for this misconduct. On January 13, 2014, MGA filed a complaint for these claims in State court in California seeking in excess of $1 billion, and this lawsuit is currently pending.[9]

Products[edit]
Bratz[edit]
Main article: Bratz
Introduced in 2001, Bratz is MGA's most successful product line, with various spin-offs from the original teenage dolls, including miniature versions (Lil' Bratz), kid versions (Bratz Kidz) baby dolls (Bratz Babyz), pets (Bratz Petz), tiny baby dolls with pets (Lil' Angelz), two feature films (Bratz: The Movie and Bratz Girlz Really Rock) and numerous DVDs and soundtracks. Because of the lawsuit brought by Mattel against MGA in 2008, the Bratz Kidz and Bratz Lil' Angelz were renamed "4*Ever Kidz" and "4*Ever Lil' Angelz", respectively, before their eventual discontinuation in 2009. They returned in 2010 for their 10th Anniversary with brand new bodies and makeup, which resembled the makeup of the prototypes for the original dolls. In 2013, they were given a new, taller body and a brand new logo. They took a hiatus a year later to rebuild the brand to try and match their original success. They returned, once again, in 2015 with completely new branding, head and body molds, and the return of the original logo. They were met with low sales and dissatisfaction from children and fans alike, and were discontinued again in 2016. They are expected to return in 2018.
Moxie Girlz and Moxie Teenz[edit]
Main article: Moxie Girlz
In 2009, a new doll line named Moxie Girlz was introduced. These Moxie girlz are similar, but legally distinct, from the Bratz line of dolls. This is to circumvent the ruling from the lawsuit described below.
The Moxie Girlz were intended to replace Bratz, but when they came back, the Moxie Girlz became a separate line of their own. The line includes Avery, Lexa, Sophina, Bria and more characters, and has been around since 2009. They are similar to the Bratz line, only this line shows more modest fashions that typical tweens would wear.
The Moxie Teenz are a spin-off from the Girlz, and includes college girls with unique skills. The line launched in Fall 2010, the characters Melrose, Tristen, Arizona and Bijou were in the first two lines, and new characters Leigh and Gavin joined in Fall 2011.
No Moxie Teenz were made after 2011, and Moxie Girlz were discontinued in 2014. Leftover dolls were made into Moxie Girlz Friends (exclusive to Target) and the Storytime Princess Collection (exclusive to Toys "R" Us).
KaChooz[edit]
The KaChooz were introduced in 2011 - these are pencil toppers with wild hair. Each KaChooz character is in a group known as a Moop, and it's the buyer's job to reunite all of the characters in their Moops. Examples of Moops are Rainbow, Mohawk, Nervous, Highlights, Punk and 2-faced - each Moop has a different personality that the KaChooz are associated with.[citation needed]
Lalaloopsy[edit]
Main article: Lalaloopsy
MGA Entertainment introduced its Lalaloopsy brand in 2010 accompanied by the tagline "Sew Magical, Sew Cute."[4] Lalaloopsy were once rag dolls who magically came to life when their very last stitch was sewn. Each Lalaloopsy doll has a unique personality reflected by the fabrics used to make them. They live happily together in Lalaloopsy Land, a whimsical world full of fun and surprises around every corner. Each Lalaloopsy doll comes with his or her own pet.[5]
Lalaoopsy dolls stand approximately 13 inches. Large dolls include Rosy Bumps 'n' Bruises, Crumbs Sugar Cookie, Dot Starlight, Peanut Big Top and more. Recent additions to the line include Mango Tiki Wiki, Coral Sea Shells and Toffee Cocoa Cuddles. In Fall 2011, MGA released Suzette La Sweet, a Lalaloopsy collector doll who was sewn from pieces of a duchess' dress.
The Lalaloopsy line includes Littles dolls, the younger brothers and sisters of Lalaloopsy dolls. Just like their older siblings, the Littles magically came to life when their very last stich was sewn. The Lalaloopsy Littles have their own unique personalities and pets. There are currently eight Lalaloopsy Littles dolls, including Matey Anchors (Marina Anchors' brother), Bundles Snuggle Stuff (Mittens Fluff 'n' Stuff's sister) and Scribbles Splash (Spot Splatter Splash's sister). Laloopsys were a hit in 2010.
Also in the Lalaloopsy line are Mini Lalaloopsy, Lalaloopsy Micros and Accessories. The Accessories line includes outfits and furniture for the Lalaloopsy dolls and Littles dolls, and Mini Lalaloopsy playsets and vehicles.
Lalaloopsy dolls are sold in store and online at a variety of retailers. On December 7, 2010, Lalaloopsy had the People's Play Award for large dolls.
True Hope[edit]
True Hope is a special edition doll franchise introduced in 2012. In an effort to raise cancer awareness, MGA Entertainment created a line of bald Bratz and Moxie Girlz dolls stating that "courage is always in style." MGA Entertainment plans to donate one dollar from every sale to City of Hope Cancer Foundation.”
Novi Stars[edit]
Main article: Novi Stars
Novi Stars was a brand line which will be released around August 2012; MGA has partnered with Justice Stores to bring out these new characters. The line revolves around alien characters landing on the planet Earth to discover new trends. Each character has a special quality: for instance, Alie Lectric blushes, Ari Roma is scented, Una Verse glitters, and Mae Tallick can talk. The brand was discontinued in 2014.
The line's tagline is What on earth is going on?
Characters:

Alie Lectric (light up) - brainy, organized
Ari Roma (scented) - airy, romantic
Una Verse (water & glitter) - trendy, fashionable
Mae Tallick (talk) - talkative, clumsy
Nita Light (glows) - creative, artistic
Malie Tasker (her 4 arms stretch and glow)
Tula Toned (filled with two-colored goo)
Anne Arctic (her legs are filled with snow)
Ina Ferna (her hair glows)

Project Mc2[edit]
Main article: Project Mc2
Project Mc2 is a doll line introduced in 2015. There is also a live-action series on Netflix produced by AwesomenessTV, a division of DreamWorks Animation.
The line's tagline is Smart is the New Cool
Characters:

McKeyla McAlister
Adrienne Attoms
Bryden Bandweth
Camryn Coyle
Devon D'Marco
Ember Evergreen

Miscellaneous[edit]
MGA Entertainment also owns Little Tikes, a popular infant, pre-school and young child toy line.
Super Click-It[edit]
In 1999, a clone to the Bop It line of games was made by MGA Entertainment under the name Super Click-It, and it was also made under the name Bonk It. It was sold by a retailer in the UK called Marks and Spencer in 2003. The game unit has five actions which are Squish It (a double sided yellow button that is pressed), Zip It (a lever that can be pushed up and down), Twist It (an orange knob that looks similar to the Twist It knob from the Bop It Extreme), Blast It (a green fan that when the command is issued will work either by blowing or using one finger to make it work.) and Crack It (an object that is designed to pull backwards and then to normal position). The game has two game modes which are: One Player with Voice Commands (the voice will say: "One Player, Squish It!" when the player presses the Squish It button to select the game mode), One Player with Sound Commands (The voice will say "One Player" with a Squish It sound effect). There are also two two player game modes which are Two Player Voice Commands and Two Player Sound Commands.
The aim of the game is similar to Bop It where the game gives one command and the player has to obey and perform the action. The game has a maximum score of 100 points and on achieving the maximum score the player is celebrated with a fanfare. In the two player game mode, the game can continue up to 200 points if one player has scored 100 first. In the two player mode, the voice says "Switch" instead of "Pass It". Unlike Bop It, the game gives the player more time to respond to the command. The game doesn't have any screaming sounds when the player performs the wrong action or runs out of time, instead cartoon sound effects are heard such as the wa wa wa wa melody or a slip up sound effect when a cartoon character slips over a banana skin.
Lawsuit[edit]
On July 17, 2008, the U.S. District Court in Riverside ruled against MGA Entertainment and for Mattel Inc. in a battle over the creation rights of the Bratz doll line. The jury in the case determined that Carter Bryant, creator of the Bratz doll line, had violated his exclusivity contract and had designed the dolls while he was still working at Mattel. Mattel was awarded $100 million US in damages, far less than the $1 billion they were seeking.[6]
On December 3, 2008, U.S. District Judge Stephen Larson granted an injunction requested by Mattel, which effectively banned MGA from manufacturing and selling Bratz dolls, though he allowed MGA to continue selling Bratz through the end of the 2008 holiday season.[7] Larson determined that all of MGA's Bratz produced from 2001 through 2008, except for the Kidz and Lil Angelz lines, infringed on Mattel's intellectual property. Larson allowed MGA to continue to manufacture the Kidz and Lil Angelz lines, provided that they not be promoted under the Bratz brand. He also stipulated that MGA must, at their own cost, remove all Bratz merchandise from retailers' shelves, reimburse retailers for said merchandise, and turn all recalled product over to Mattel for disposal. In addition, MGA was to destroy all marketing materials, molds, and other materials that had been used in the manufacture and sale of Bratz.[8] MGA immediately filed for a permanent stay of the injunction and, on February 11, 2009, was granted a stay through at least the end of 2009.
On December 10, 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit granted MGA an immediate stay of the injunction, effectively halting the recall of Bratz product, which was to have begun on January 21, 2010. In their initial ruling, the Court found Larson's previous ruling to be unusually "draconian," questioned why Mattel had simply been handed ownership of the entire franchise rather than be awarded a stake in the ownership of the franchise or a share of the royalties from future Bratz sales, and ordered MGA and Mattel into mediation.

	NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31,
	2017 AND 2016




	(Unaudited)



	 


	 



	NOTE 1. ORGANIZATION, OPERATIONS AND
	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES




	 



	Original Source Entertainment, Inc. (the
	“Company”), was incorporated in the State of Nevada on August 20, 2009 (“Inception”). The Company’s
	intent was to license songs to the television and music industry for use for use in television shows or movies. The Company has
	had limited activity and revenue to date and no longer has any assets or operations since the spin-off of its wholly owned subsidiary
	effective May 13, 2016, as further described below.


	 



	Basis of Presentation



	The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in
	accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and are presented in US dollars. The Company’s
	year-end is December 31.


	 



	Unaudited Interim Financial Information



	The accompanying unaudited interim financial
	statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP for interim financial information, and with the rules
	and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation
	S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements.
	The unaudited interim financial statements furnished reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) which are,
	in the opinion of management, necessary to a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented. Unaudited interim
	results are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full fiscal year. These unaudited interim financial statements should
	be read in conjunction with the financial statements of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2016 and notes thereto contained
	in the information as part of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on April 17, 2017.


	 



	Discontinued Operations



	On February 5, 2014, the board
	of directors of Original Source Entertainment authorized the spin-off of the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Original
	Source Music Inc., to shareholders of record as of February 25, 2014. All of the Company's assets and business operations at
	that time were held in Original Source Music, Inc. The spin-off was done in connection with a change of control of Original
	Source Entertainment. Under the terms of the spin-off, the Company’s common shares, par value $0.001 per share, would be
	distributed on a pro-rata basis to each holder of Original Source Entertainment’s common shares on the record date
	without any consideration or action on the part of such holders, and the holders of Original Source Entertainment’s
	common shares as of the record date would become owners of 100 percent of our common shares.


	 


	On May 13, 2016, the spin-off was completed
	due to the satisfactory resolution of all comments from the Securities and Exchange Commission to the Form 10 and the Form 10’s
	effectiveness.


	 



	Use of Estimates



	The preparation of financial statements
	in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported
	amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and
	the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 


	 



	Income Taxes



	Deferred income tax assets and liabilities
	are recognized based on differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using presently enacted
	tax rates. At each balance sheet date, the Company evaluates the available evidence about future taxable income and other
	possible sources of realization of deferred tax assets, and records a valuation allowance that reduces the deferred tax assets
	to an amount that represents management’s best estimate of the amount of such deferred tax assets that more likely than not
	will be realized.


	 



	Basic and Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per
	Share



	The Company computes earnings (loss) per
	share in accordance with ASC 260-10-45 “Earnings per Share”, which requires presentation of both basic and diluted
	earnings per share on the face of the statement of operations. Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net earnings
	(loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period.  Diluted
	earnings (loss) per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period.  Dilutive earnings
	(loss) per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.


	 






	 

	6






	 




	 


	During the three months ended March 31,
	2017 and 2016, the Company did have potentially dilutive debt instruments outstanding that has been excluded from the earnings
	per share calculation, as such an inclusion would have been anti-dilutive due to losses incurred by the Company in both period
	and, therefore, basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share are equal in both periods.


	 



	Recent Accounting Pronouncements





	We have reviewed all the recently issued,
	but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and we do not believe any of these pronouncements will have a material impact
	on the Company other than those relating to Development Stage Entities as discussed above.


	 



	NOTE 2. GOING CONCERN




	 



	The Company has suffered a loss from operations
	and has negative cash flows from operations, and in all likelihood will be required to make significant future expenditures in
	connection with marketing efforts along with general administrative expenses. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the
	Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.


	 


	The Company may raise additional capital
	through the sale of its equity securities, through an offering of debt securities, or through borrowings from financial institutions
	or related parties. By doing so, the Company hopes to generate sufficient capital to execute its business plan of licensing songs
	to the television and music industry for use for use in television shows or movies on an ongoing basis. Management believes that
	actions presently being taken to obtain additional funding provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern.


	 



	NOTE 3. ADVANCES PAYABLE - RELATED PARTY



	 


	In support of the Company’s efforts
	and cash requirements, it may rely on advances from related parties until such time that the Company can support its operations
	or attains adequate financing through sales of its equity or traditional debt financing. There is no formal written commitment
	for continued support by shareholders.  Amounts represent advances or amounts paid in satisfaction of liabilities. The advances
	are considered temporary in nature and have not been formalized by a promissory note.


	 


	As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016,
	the amount outstanding was $77,046 and $73,758, respectively. The advances are non-interest bearing, due upon demand and unsecured. 


	 



	NOTE 4. SPIN-OFF



	 


	On February 5, 2014, the board
	of directors of Original Source Entertainment authorized the spin-off of the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Original
	Source Music Inc., to shareholders of record as of February 25, 2014. All of the Company's assets and business operations at
	that time were held in Original Source Music, Inc. The spin-off was done in connection with a change of control of Original
	Source Entertainment. Under the terms of the spin-off, the Company’s common shares, par value $0.001 per share, would be
	distributed on a pro-rata basis to each holder of Original Source Entertainment’s common shares on the record date
	without any consideration or action on the part of such holders, and the holders of Original Source Entertainment’s
	common shares as of the record date would become owners of 100 percent of our common shares.


	 


	On May 13, 2016, the spin-off was completed
	due to the satisfactory resolution of all comments from the Securities and Exchange Commission to the Form 10 and the Form 10’s
	effectiveness.


	 


	The prior financial statements have been
	revised to reflect the completed spin-off. 


	 





	NOTE 5. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS



	 


	In accordance with ASC 855-10, “Subsequent
	Events” the Company has analyzed its operations subsequent to March 31, 2017 to the date these financial statements were
	available to be issued. During this period, we did not have any significant subsequent events.


	 


	The Company’s Board of Directors
	and majority stockholder, who is also the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and sole director, authorized, as of April 17,
	2017: (a) an amendment to the Company’s Articles of Incorporation to effect a change of name from “Original Source
	Entertainment, Inc.” to “NeuroOne Medical Technologies Corporation”; (b) an amendment to the Company’s
	Articles of Incorporation to effect an increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock from 45,000,000 to 100,000,000
	and to increase the number of authorized shares of preferred stock from 5,000,000 to 10,000,000; (c) a Certificate of Amendment
	to the Company’s Articles of Incorporation, which makes no material changes to the Company’s existing Articles of Incorporation
	other than incorporating the amendments described in the prior clauses (a) and (b); (d) a change to the Company’s state of
	incorporation from the State of Nevada to the State of Delaware pursuant to a plan of conversion in connection with which the Company
	will adopt a new certificate of incorporation and bylaws under the laws of the State of Delaware; and (e) the adoption of a 2017
	Equity Incentive Plan. The Company is not required to effect any of clauses (a), (b) or (c) above, and may determine to do so only
	if and when a proposed business combination transaction with a third party is consummated, of which we can give no assurance
	of success.

	Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
	Condition and Results of Operations



	 



	Forward-looking Statements



	 


	Statements in this Management’s Discussion
	and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation, as well as in certain other parts of this quarterly report on Form
	10-Q (as well as information included in oral statements or other written statements made or to be made by Original Source) that
	look forward in time, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include statements concerning plans, objectives,
	goals, strategies, future events or performance, expectations, predictions, and assumptions and other statements which are other
	than statements of historical facts. Although Original Source believes such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give
	no assurance that any forward-looking statements will prove to be correct. Such forward-looking statements are subject to, and
	are qualified by, known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results, performance or achievements
	to differ materially from those expressed or implied by those statements. These risks, uncertainties and other factors include,
	but are not limited to Original Source’s ability to estimate the impact of competition and of industry consolidation and
	risks, uncertainties and other factors set forth in Original Source’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
	including without limitation to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.


	 


	Original Source undertakes no obligation
	to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this Form 10-Q.


	 



	General



	We were incorporated under the laws of
	the State of Nevada on August 20, 2009. Our business from inception through to May 13, 2016 was to license songs to the television
	and music industry for use for use in television shows or movies. We have had limited activity and revenue to date. As of May 13,
	2016, we spun-off Original Source Music, our wholly-owned subsidiary which holds all of our operations, to shareholders of record
	as of February 25, 2014. The spin-off was done in connection with a change of control of our company. Under the terms of the spin-off,
	Original Source Music’s common shares, par value $0.001 per share, were distributed on a pro-rata basis to each holder of
	our common shares on the record date without any consideration or action on the part of such holders, and the holders of our common
	shares as of the record date became owners of 100% of Original Source Music’s common shares, subject to applicable FINRA
	filings. Accordingly, we are a blank check registrant as that term is defined in Rule 419(a)(2) of Regulation C of the Securities
	Act of 1933, because we have no specific business plan and purpose.


	 


	We currently have no employees other than
	our sole officer, who is also our sole director.


	 


	We do not have any definitive plans, proposals,
	arrangements or understandings with any representatives of the owners of any operating business or company regarding the possibility
	of an acquisition or merger. However, we are currently in negotiations with NeuroOne, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“NeuroOne”),
	with respect to a potential reorganization pursuant to which, as currently contemplated, we would acquire NeuroOne as our wholly-owned
	subsidiary and the stockholders of NeuroOne would exchange all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of NeuroOne
	currently held by them for shares of the Company’s Common Stock (the “Proposed Transaction”). As the definitive
	agreement and other transaction documents are still being negotiated, and the parties are still performing due diligence, we can
	give no assurance as to the ultimate form or terms of the Proposed Transaction or that the Proposed Transaction will be consummated
	at all.


	 



	Recent Events



	 


	Our Board of Directors and majority stockholder,
	who is also our Chief Executive Officer and sole director, authorized, on April 17, 2017:


	 




	 



	·




	An amendment to our Articles of Incorporation to effect a change of our name from “Original Source Entertainment, Inc.” to “NeuroOne Medical Technologies Corporation.”





	 




	 



	·




	An amendment to our Articles of Incorporation to effect an increase in the number of authorized shares of our common stock from 45,000,000 to 100,000,000 and to increase the number of authorized shares of our preferred stock from 5,000,000 to 10,000,000.





	 






	 

	8






	 




	 




	 



	·




	A Certificate of Amendment to our Articles of Incorporation, which makes no material changes to our existing Articles of Incorporation other than incorporating the amendments described in the prior bullets.





	 




	 



	·




	A change to our state of incorporation from the State of Nevada to the State of Delaware pursuant to a plan of conversion in connection with which the Company will adopt a new certificate of incorporation and bylaws under the laws of the State of Delaware.





	 




	 



	·




	The adoption of a 2017 Equity Incentive Plan.





	 


	We are not required to effect any of the
	above first three corporate actions, and may determine to do so only if and when the Proposed Transaction is consummated, of which
	we can give no assurance of success.


	 



	Critical Accounting Policies



	 


	The following discussion as well as disclosures
	included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q are based upon our unaudited financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance
	with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements and accompanying notes
	have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.


	 


	The preparation of these financial statements
	requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues
	and expenses, and related disclosures of contingencies. Original Source continually evaluates the accounting policies and estimates
	used to prepare the financial statements. Original Source bases its estimates on historical experiences and assumptions believed
	to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates made by management.


	 



	Trends and Uncertainties



	 


	There are no material commitments for capital
	expenditure at this time. There are no trends, events or uncertainties that have had or are reasonably expected to have a material
	impact on our limited operations. There are no known causes for any material changes from period to period in one or more line
	items of Original Source’s financial statements.


	 


	The accompanying financial statements have
	been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As shown in the accompanying financial statements, we
	have incurred losses of $8,754 and $8,959 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and have a working capital
	deficiency which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.


	 


	Management believes the Company will continue
	to incur losses and negative cash flows from operating activities for the foreseeable future and will need additional equity or
	debt financing to sustain its operations.


	 


	Management plans to seek additional debt
	and/or equity financing for the Company, but cannot assure that such financing will be available on acceptable terms.


	 


	The accompanying financial statements
	do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.


	 



	Results of Operations



	 


	During the three months ended March 31,
	2017, we earned revenues of $0. We had general and administrative expenses of $8,754. As a result, we had a net loss of $8,754
	for the three months ended March 31, 2017.


	 


	By comparison, during the three months
	ended March 31, 2016, we earned revenues of $0. We paid general and administrative expenses of $4,386 and had a loss from discontinued
	operations of $4,573. As a result, we had a net loss of $8,959 for the three months ended March 31, 2016.


	 


	The $205 decrease in net loss for the
	three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016 is primarily the result of the decrease in
	loss from discontinued operations of $4,573 offset by an increase in general and administrative expenses of $4,368 primarily from
	professional fees, which consist of fees paid for legal, accounting, and auditing services, were incurred primarily to enable
	us to satisfy the requirements of a reporting company.

	Liquidity and Capital Resources



	 


	At March 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016
	we had a cash balance of $0.


	 


	The accompanying financial statements have
	been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As shown in the accompanying financial statements, Original
	Source has incurred losses of $8,754 and $8,959 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and a working
	capital deficiency which raises substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.


	 


	Management believes the Company will continue
	to incur losses and negative cash flows from operating activities for the foreseeable future, including as a result of the spin-off
	of our operating business as of May 13, 2016, and will need additional equity or debt financing to sustain its operations. Management
	plans to seek additional debt and/or equity financing for the Company, but cannot assure that such financing will be available
	on acceptable terms.


	 


	The Company’s continuation as a going
	concern is dependent upon its ability to ultimately attain profitable operations, generate sufficient cash flow to meet its obligations,
	and obtain additional financing as may be required. Our auditors have included a “going concern” qualification in their
	auditors’ report dated April 17, 2017. Such a “going concern” qualification may make it more difficult for us
	to raise funds when needed. The outcome of this uncertainty cannot be assured.


	 


	The accompanying financial statements do
	not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.


	 



	Operating Activities



	 


	During the three months ended March 31,
	2017, we used $3,288 in operating activities compared to $0 during the three months ended March 31, 2016.


	 


	During the three months ended March 31,
	2017 we incurred a loss of $8,754 which was partially offset for cash flow purposes as we reduced our balance of accounts payable
	and accrued liabilities by $5,466. By comparison, during the three months ended March 31, 2016, we incurred losses of $8,959 which
	was partially offset for cash flow purposes by $4,015 in non-cash expenses and we decreased our balance of accounts payable and
	accrued liabilities by $ 4,686.


	 



	Investing Activities



	 


	During the three month periods ended March
	31, 2017 and 2016, we did not pursue any investing activities.


	 



	Financing Activities



	 


	During the three months ended March
	31, 2017, we received $3,288 by way of advances – related party. By comparison, we received $0 from advances –
	related party during the three months ended March 31, 2016.


	 



	Recently Issued Accounting Standards



	 


	Management does not believe that any other
	recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standard if currently adopted would have a material effect on the accompanying
	financial statements.


	 



	Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

	 


	 


	None.

	Item 4. Controls and Procedures



	 


	During the three months ended March 31,
	2017, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a- 15(f) and 15d-15(f) under
	the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
	reporting.


	 



	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
	Procedures



	 



	Under the
	supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and principal financial officer,
	we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e)
	promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of

	 

	March 31, 2017.
	Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded such controls and procedures
	to be ineffective as of March 31, 2017

	 

	to ensure that information required to be disclosed
	by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the
	time periods specified in the Commission's rules and forms and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer
	in the reports that it files or submits under the Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer's management, including its
	principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
	regarding required disclosure.

	TO SECTION 302 OF THE




	SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002



	 


	I, Amer Samad, certify that:


	 


	         1.
	I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of Original Source Entertainment, Inc.;


	 


	         2.
	Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary
	to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to
	the period covered by this report;


	 


	         3.
	Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all
	material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented
	in this report;


	 


	         4.
	The registrant's other certifying officers and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures
	(as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange
	Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have:


	 


	a)  Designed such
	disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to
	ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others
	within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;


	 


	b)  Designed such
	internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under my supervision,
	to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
	external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;
