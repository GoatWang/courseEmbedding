Top record matches for Stephen Albert Martin






Surname meaning for "Martin"
English, Scottish, Irish, French, Dutch, German, Czech, Slovak, Spanish
(Martín), Italian (Venice), etc.: from a personal name
(Latin Martinus, a derivative of Mars, genitive
Martis, the Roman god of fertility and war, whose name may
derive ultimately from a root mar ‘gleam’). This was borne by a
famous 4th-century saint, Martin of Tours, and consequently became
extremely popular throughout Europe in the Middle Ages. As a North
American surname, this form has absorbed many cognates from other
European forms.
