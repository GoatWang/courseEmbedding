ETF investing with DFA funds | John Hancock Investments 






























Menu
























Welcome to a new dimension in ETF investing






At John Hancock Investments, we believe investors can benefit from a blend of factors working together to drive performance. That’s why we’re bringing our manager-of-managers approach to the ETF market, teaming up with Dimensional Fund Advisors, a company regarded as one of the pioneers in strategic beta investing



Explore the lineup














			Strategic beta: seeking to build a better index 
		




Many traditional indexes and index funds are weighted by market capitalization, a bias that can expose investors to certain risks and potentially reduce returns. Strategic beta strategies such as John Hancock Multifactor ETFs offer a different approach. Each passively managed ETF seeks to improve upon cap-weighted strategies by tracking a custom index that combines active management insight with the discipline of a rules-based approach. The result leverages the goals of both active and passive management.








Learn more










			Multifactor investing: a time-tested strategy built on three decades of academic research
		





Not all investment approaches are created equal. For more than 30 years, Dimensional Fund Advisors has leveraged academic research in their approach to factor-based investing, a style that seeks to identify and isolate those equity characteristics that are true drivers of long-term performance: smaller capitalizations, lower valuations, and higher profitability. Each of our ETFs seeks to track an index that combines multiple factors into one targeted portfolio designed not just to mirror the market, but to outperform it.






For illustrative purposes only.






Discover Dimensional's approach










			Our approach brings nearly 30 years of research and oversight to every portfolio
		




At John Hancock Investments, we build funds based on investor needs, then search the world to find proven portfolio teams with specialized expertise in those strategies. As a manager of managers, we apply vigorous oversight to ensure that they continue to meet our uncompromising standards and serve the best interests of our shareholders. It’s an approach that led us to deepen our relationship with Dimensional Fund Advisors in launching John Hancock Multifactor ETFs. We think it's a better way to invest.
























Our different approach









			ETFs in practice: how blending active and passive strategies can lead to better outcomes
		




Understanding how to use ETFs in a portfolio is an important part of any conversation about asset allocation. Our work with financial advisors reveals three widely used approaches to ETF implementation, each with varying degrees of active and passive management.






Examples are hypothetical, are not actual portfolios, and may not be appropriate for all investors.

John Hancock Multifactor ETFs






Each John Hancock Multifactor ETF seeks to track a custom index built upon decades of academic research into the factors that drive higher expected returns.











			One time-tested approach, multiple ways to invest
		




John Hancock Multifactor ETFs, which seek to track indexes designed by Dimensional Fund Advisors, can help you target investment opportunities across the large- and mid-cap equity markets or in nine individual sectors.





			John Hancock Multifactor
		

















NAV as of 










Market performance is determined using the bid/ask midpoint at 4 P.M., Eastern time, when the NAV is typically calculated; your returns may differ if you traded shares at other times. NAV is calculated by dividing the total value of all the securities in the fund’s portfolio plus cash, interest, and receivables, minus any liabilities, by the number of fund shares outstanding.
 
The past performance shown here reflects reinvested distributions and the beneficial effect of any expense reductions, and does not guarantee future results. Returns for periods shorter than one year are cumulative. Shares will fluctuate in value and, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance cited. Click on the fund name above for its current quarter and most recent month-end performance.

			The benefits of multifactor investing
		




Multifactor investing traces its roots to the academic research of Eugene Fama and Kenneth French, among others. Their premise was simple: No single factor could sufficiently explain the cross-section of expected stock returns. This insight and subsequent academic research helped isolate the factors that have driven stock returns over time. Today, the team at Dimensional Fund Advisors has distilled decades of research into the indexes underlying John Hancock Multifactor ETFs.








"Combining multiple factors better equips a portfolio to smooth out the variability of returns and improve the likelihood of outperformance across different types of markets compared with single-factor approaches."






Andrew G. Arnott
President and CEO at John Hancock Investments









Market: Stocks have historically outperformed bonds over the long term.
Company size: Smaller-capitalization stocks have historically outperformed their larger peers over extended periods.
Relative price: Companies with lower relative prices have historically posted higher average returns.
Profitability: Stocks of more profitable firms have historically generated higher returns than those of less profitable firms.

Eugene Fama and Kenneth French are members of the Board of Directors for and provide consulting services to Dimensional Fund Advisors LP, subadvisor for the John Hancock ETFs.
 
Large company stocks could fall out of favor. The stock prices of midsize and small companies can change more frequently and dramatically than those of large companies, and value stocks may decline in price. A portfolio concentrated in one industry or sector or that holds a limited number of securities may fluctuate more than a diversified portfolio. ETF shares are bought and sold through exchange trading at market price (not NAV), and are not individually redeemed from the fund. Due to various factors, shares may trade at a premium or discount to their NAV in the secondary market, and a fund’s holdings and returns may deviate from those of its index. These variations may be greater when markets are volatile or subject to unusual conditions. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Errors in the construction or calculation of a fund’s index may occur from time to time. Please see the funds’ prospectuses for additional risks.

       The Fund’s holdings are subject to change at any time. Characteristics are expressed as a percentage of net assets except for certain closed-end funds where characteristics are expressed as a percentage of total managed assets.
All Funds (with the exception of the Money Market Fund) exclude cash and cash equivalent securities from Top holdings and Top issuers.





Goal and Strategy
The Fund’s primary objective is to generate a high level of current income consistent with prudent risk. The Fund invests at least 80% of its net assets in income securities, which include a diversified portfolio of corporate and government bonds. In choosing bonds for the portfolio, the Fund’s managers evaluate the full spectrum of bonds in the marketplace and diversifies across a number of industries. It is contemplated that the Fund may invest up to 25% of the value of its total assets in debt securities that have a rating of below-investment grade by Moody's and Standard & Poor's at the time of purchase.

The performance data shown represents past performance, which is not a guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate, so that investors' shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. See performance data current to the most recent month-end, which may be higher or lower than that cited.

Performance figures assume that all distributions are reinvested.

       What You Should Know
       
    





            

The Fund's market price is the last sale price as of the close of the regular market trading session. The Fund's market price as of and after July 1, 2013 reflects the last sale price in the broad market; market price prior to July 1, 2013 reflects the last sale price on the New York Stock Exchange.
The shares of closed-end management investment companies frequently trade at a discount from their NAV. The Fund’s cash available for distribution will vary over time, and there is no guarantee prior distribution levels will be maintained. If, for any calendar year, the total distributions made exceed the amount of the fund's earnings and profits as computed for federal tax purposes, the excess generally will be treated as a return of capital to holders of common shares (up to the amount of each shareholder’s basis in those shares) and thereafter as gain from the sale of common shares. Such return of capital reduces the shareholder’s adjusted basis for common shares, thereby increasing the potential gain or reducing the potential loss of a subsequent sale. Distributions in any year may include a substantial return-of-capital component. An investment in the fund's Common Shares is subject to investment and market risk, including the possible loss of the entire principal amount invested. An investment in common shares represents an indirect investment in the securities owned by the fund, which are generally are traded on a securities exchange or in the over-the-counter markets. These securities will fluctuate in value, and an investor in the fund may lose some or all of his or her investment, even after accounting for any reinvestment of dividends and distributions. Fixed-income investments are subject to interest-rate risk; their value will normally decline as interest rates rise. An issuer of securities held by the fund may default, have its credit rating downgraded, or otherwise perform poorly. The fund utilizes a Credit Facility Agreement (CFA) to increase its assets available for investment. Shareholders bear the fees associated with this “leverage” and may be disadvantaged from the use of leverage. It is important to recognize that use of leverage increases the Advisor’s fee. Leverage creates risks that may adversely affect the return for the holders of common shares, including:

the likelihood of greater volatility of net asset value and market price of common shares
the risk that the cost of utilizing the CFA will increase with rising interest rates
the risk of increased operating costs that can lower fund returns
the risk of a decline in the value of an investment acquired through leverage, while the fund’s obligations under such leverage remain fixed
the risk that the fund will have to sell securities in a volatile market in order to meet asset coverage or other debt compliance requirements

Fund returns will be lower if the cost of the leverage exceeds the income or capital appreciation derived from securities purchased with leverage. If the fund is unable to obtain replacement financing in the event the CFA is terminated, the fund would be required to sell securities at a potentially inopportune time, incurring tax consequences, and its ability to generate income would be adversely affected.
The Fund’s quarterly distributions may be from net investment income, capital gains or return of capital. The distribution rate and income amounts reflect past amounts distributed and may not be indicative of future rates or income amounts. Distribution rates and income amounts can change at any time.
Closed-end fund shares are not redeemable, but instead are traded in the secondary market on an exchange such as the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ. They frequently trade at a discount to net asset value. Specialized funds may carry additional risks.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
