	This presentation includes forward looking statements. Forward-looking statements include statements about our future results of operations and financial position, our business strategy and plans, and our objectives for future operations, among other things. In some cases, you can identify these statements by forward-looking words, such as estimate, expect, anticipate, project, plan, intend, believe, forecast, foresee, likely, may, should, goal, target, might, will, could, predict and continue. Forward-looking statements are only predictions based on our current knowledge, expectations, and projections about future events. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions which include, but are not limited to, those listed under the heading Risk Factors in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Forward-looking statements are based on current plans, estimates and projections and are subject to inherent risks, uncertainties and other factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from the future results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements made in this presentation speak only as of the date hereof. We do not intend to update or revise these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this presentation and do not assume any responsibility to do so. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. We caution you that these forward-looking statements are subject to all of the risks and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control, incident to the exploration, production and development of potash and other fertilizers and by-products. These risks include, but are not limited to, our ability to expand Trio® sales internationally and manage associated risks, our ability to successfully expand by-product and water sales, our ability to comply with debt covenants, changes in the price, demand or supply of potash, langbeinite and chemically similar products; declines or changes in agricultural production or fertilizer application rates; changes in reserve estimates; environmental risks; changes in government regulations, including environmental and mining regulations, the enforcement of those regulations and governmental policy changes; and declines in the use of potash products by agricultural industry participants and oil and gas companies. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties occur, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results and plans could differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. Certain data and other market information used in this presentation are based on independent industry publications, government publications and other published independent sources. Although we believe these third-party sources are reliable as of their respective dates, we have not independently verified the accuracy or completeness of this information. The industry in which we operate is subject to a high degree of uncertainty and risk due to a variety of factors, which could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed in these third-party publications.

	INTREPIDs reserve summary Reserve Summary (1) Intrepids reserves in aggregate contain ~77 million tons of potash and ~57 million tons of langbeinite Long reserve lives provide opportunity for long-term operations 28 Source: Intrepids Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, filed on February 28, 2017 (2) The reserves associated with the Wendover solar evaporation mine reflect the combination of a shallow and a deep aquifer.

	Non-GAAP Reconciliations To supplement the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, the Company uses several non-GAAP financial measures to monitor and evaluate its performance. These non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted net loss, adjusted net loss per diluted share, adjusted EBITDA, and average net realized sales price per ton. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition, because the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures varies among companies, the Company's non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors for analysis of its business. The Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures as one of its tools in comparing performance period over period on a consistent basis and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures are widely used by professional research analysts and others in the valuation, comparison, and investment recommendations of companies in the potash mining industry. Many investors use the published research reports of these professional research analysts and others in making investment decisions. Following is additional information about the Company's non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations of the Company's non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. 34

	Adjusted net loss and adjusted net loss per diluted share are calculated as net loss or loss per diluted share adjusted for certain items that impact the comparability of results from period to period, as set forth in the reconciliation below. The Company considers these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful because they allow for period-to-period comparisons of the Company's operating results excluding items that the Company believes are not indicative of its fundamental ongoing operations. Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted Net Loss per Diluted Share (In thousands) Non-GAAP Reconciliation 35 Note: Intrepid had an effective tax rate of 0% for the periods shown 2016 2017 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Net Loss (18,427) $ (13,398) $ (18,241) $ (16,567) $ (13,678) $ Adjustments Costs associated with abnormal production 650 1,057 - - - Compensating tax adjustment - (1,086) - - - Restructuring expense 400 1,914 - 408 - Debt Restructuring expense - - - 3,072 - Write-off of deferred financing fees 668 784 431 - 518 Make-whole payment - - 806 - 794 Insurance proceeds - (1,211) - - - Total adjustments 1,718 1,458 1,237 3,480 1,312 Adjusted Net Loss (16,709) $ (11,940) $ (17,004) $ (13,087) $ (12,366) $

	Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (or adjusted EBITDA) is calculated as net loss adjusted for certain items that impact the comparability of results from period to period, as set forth in the reconciliation below. The Company considers adjusted EBITDA to be useful because the measure reflects the Company's operating performance before the effects of certain non-cash items and other items that the Company believes are not indicative of its core operations. The Company uses adjusted EBITDA to assess operating performance. Non-GAAP Reconciliation 37 (In thousands) 2016 2017 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Net Loss (18,427) $ (13,398) $ (18,241) $ (16,567) $ (13,678) $ Costs associated with abnormal production 650 1,057 - - - Compensating tax adjustment - (1,086) - - - Restructuring expense 400 1,914 - 408 - Debt Restructuring expense - - - 3,072 - Insurance proceeds - (1,211) - - - Interest expense 2,229 3,000 3,905 2,488 4,421 Income tax expense (benefit) 2 1 1 (1,366) 5 Depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion 14,368 9,841 8,756 9,716 9,323 Total adjustments 17,649 13,516 12,662 14,318 13,749 Adjusted EBITDA (778) $ 118 $ (5,579) $ (2,249) $ 71 $

	Average net realized sales price per ton is calculated as sales, less freight costs, divided by the number of tons sold in the period. The Company considers average net realized sales price per ton to be useful because it shows average per-ton pricing without the effect of certain transportation and delivery costs. When the Company arranges transportation and delivery for a customer, it includes in revenue and in freight costs the costs associated with transportation and delivery. However, many of the Company's customers arrange for and pay their own transportation and delivery costs, in which case these costs are not included in the Company's revenue and freight costs. The Company uses average net realized sales price per ton as a key performance indicator to analyze sales and pricing trends.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

What Makes Us Different
There are wonderful advantages of working with a small, US-based company.
We are fast, flexible and decisive when it comes to pricing. And because we operate with a lean management team, you are never more than one step away from senior management. That means you can count on us to honor our word, regardless of market conditions.
As a small company, your success means the world to us. We expect to earn your business by delivering quality solutions, time after time. You’ll find us to be a loyal and reliable partner who values long-term relationships over individual transactions.





What We Produce
Intrepid operates three solar evaporation mines in Wendover and Moab, Utah and Carlsbad, New Mexico. Solar evaporation ponds provide one of the safest, lowest cost, environmentally friendly production methods for potash and salt. Our southwestern locations have the advantages of proximity to western markets and an arid climate, ensuring minimal weather-related delivery days by truck or rail.
Intrepid also operates an underground mine in Carlsbad, New Mexico for the extraction of langbeinite, the naturally-occurring mineral we sell as Intrepid Trio. Langbeinite, K2Mg2(SO4)3, is a unique geological material found only in a few places in the world. Highly prized as an all-natural fertilizer with international demand, Intrepid’s mine in Carlsbad sits on one of the world’s largest known reserves of langbeinite.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Potash evaporation ponds at the Intrepid mine near Moab, Utah, 2012. Colorado River at right of frame.


Intrepid Potash, Inc. (NYSE: IPI), based in Denver, Colorado, is the largest producer of potassium chloride, also known as muriate of potash, in the United States.[1] It owns three mines, all in the Western U.S., near the cities of Carlsbad, New Mexico, Moab, Utah, and Wendover, Utah.[2]

Mines[edit]
Carlsbad[edit]
There are 3 sites approximately 30 miles (48 km) East of Carlsbad, NM. The East facility, produces sylvite and langbeinite potash, and is capable of fully processing its ore to the storage or shipment stage. The West facility (currently shut down) produces mainly traditional potash, which is shipped by truck to be processed at the North facility for final storage or shipping.



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (June 2008)


Moab[edit]




Intrepid Potash evaporation pond, Moab, 2014. Blue dye is added to speed evaporation.


The Moab or Kane Creek potash mine (38°31′25″N 109°39′15″W﻿ / ﻿38.52361°N 109.65417°W﻿ / 38.52361; -109.65417) is located along the right (northwest) bank of the Colorado River, about 20 miles (30 km) west of Moab, Utah,[3] at the south end of State Route 279 and the Union Pacific Railroad. The location is known as Potash on U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) topographic maps, and is east of Dead Horse Point State Park and Canyonlands National Park.[4] According to USGS reports, the Paradox Basin contains up to 2.0 billion tons (1.8 billion metric tonnes) of potash, with the primary mine being the one at Cane Creek.[5]
The plant was built by the Texas Gulf Sulphur Company in the early 1960s,[6] opening in 1963 as a conventional underground mine.[7] Later that year, an explosion trapped 25 miners,[8] of whom only seven were able to survive, by building a barricade to trap fresh air.[9] In 1970, operations were changed to a system that combines solution mining and solar evaporation. River water is pumped into the mine and dissolves the potash, after which the brine solution is pumped to evaporation ponds.[3] Intrepid bought the mine in 2000[10] from the Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan,[11] which had bought Texas Gulf in 1995.[12]
Wendover[edit]
The Wendover potash mine is located about 120 miles west of Salt Lake City, Utah and has been actively used for potash production for over 65 years. Potash production from natural occurring brines at the Wendover facility dates back to World War I. During the period from 1920 to 1936, a number of unsuccessful attempts were made to commercially produce potash. By 1939, a successful commercial potash operation was achieved and continues today.
This plant siphons off brine from the nearby Bonneville Salt Flats during the winter when the bed is covered in brine. This has led to the disappearance of the flats, that is the thick salt layer that normally covers the area. This is destroying its utility as a popular race bed and surface for setting ground speed records, where long, uniform flat surfaces are required. This has led to an outcry from the fans who use it. In an effort to reverse this loss, Intrepid has voluntarily been pumping processed brine back to the flats. Activists are confident this will reverse the damage, but are wary because the replenishment is voluntary and are worried what may happen if ownership of the mine changes hands, so are working on legislation to make the brine replenishment mandatory.[13]

Potash evaporation ponds at the Intrepid mine near Moab, Utah, 2012. Colorado River at right of frame.


Intrepid Potash, Inc. (NYSE: IPI), based in Denver, Colorado, is the largest producer of potassium chloride, also known as muriate of potash, in the United States.[1] It owns three mines, all in the Western U.S., near the cities of Carlsbad, New Mexico, Moab, Utah, and Wendover, Utah.[2]

Mines[edit]
Carlsbad[edit]
There are 3 sites approximately 30 miles (48 km) East of Carlsbad, NM. The East facility, produces sylvite and langbeinite potash, and is capable of fully processing its ore to the storage or shipment stage. The West facility (currently shut down) produces mainly traditional potash, which is shipped by truck to be processed at the North facility for final storage or shipping.



This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (June 2008)


Moab[edit]




Intrepid Potash evaporation pond, Moab, 2014. Blue dye is added to speed evaporation.


The Moab or Kane Creek potash mine (38°31′25″N 109°39′15″W﻿ / ﻿38.52361°N 109.65417°W﻿ / 38.52361; -109.65417) is located along the right (northwest) bank of the Colorado River, about 20 miles (30 km) west of Moab, Utah,[3] at the south end of State Route 279 and the Union Pacific Railroad. The location is known as Potash on U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) topographic maps, and is east of Dead Horse Point State Park and Canyonlands National Park.[4] According to USGS reports, the Paradox Basin contains up to 2.0 billion tons (1.8 billion metric tonnes) of potash, with the primary mine being the one at Cane Creek.[5]
The plant was built by the Texas Gulf Sulphur Company in the early 1960s,[6] opening in 1963 as a conventional underground mine.[7] Later that year, an explosion trapped 25 miners,[8] of whom only seven were able to survive, by building a barricade to trap fresh air.[9] In 1970, operations were changed to a system that combines solution mining and solar evaporation. River water is pumped into the mine and dissolves the potash, after which the brine solution is pumped to evaporation ponds.[3] Intrepid bought the mine in 2000[10] from the Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan,[11] which had bought Texas Gulf in 1995.[12]
Wendover[edit]
The Wendover potash mine is located about 120 miles west of Salt Lake City, Utah and has been actively used for potash production for over 65 years. Potash production from natural occurring brines at the Wendover facility dates back to World War I. During the period from 1920 to 1936, a number of unsuccessful attempts were made to commercially produce potash. By 1939, a successful commercial potash operation was achieved and continues today.
This plant siphons off brine from the nearby Bonneville Salt Flats during the winter when the bed is covered in brine. This has led to the disappearance of the flats, that is the thick salt layer that normally covers the area. This is destroying its utility as a popular race bed and surface for setting ground speed records, where long, uniform flat surfaces are required. This has led to an outcry from the fans who use it. In an effort to reverse this loss, Intrepid has voluntarily been pumping processed brine back to the flats. Activists are confident this will reverse the damage, but are wary because the replenishment is voluntary and are worried what may happen if ownership of the mine changes hands, so are working on legislation to make the brine replenishment mandatory.[13]

For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares.
