Arcadia Biosciences’ Water Use Efficiency Trait Completes US Food and 
      Drug Administration Early Food Safety Evaluation




-- FDA Accepts Conclusion That Trait Protein Is Safe for Humans 
      and Animals --






July 19, 2017 08:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



DAVIS, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Arcadia Biosciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: RKDA), an agricultural technology 
      company that develops and commercializes plant traits and products that 
      improve farm economics and benefit the environment and human health, 
      announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted 
      an Early Food Safety Evaluation (EFSE) for the company’s water use 
      efficiency (WUE) trait. The EFSE is now applicable to all plant species 
      that feature this trait.
    


      The EFSE concluded that the functional protein for the WUE trait, 
      isopentenyl transferase (IPT), is safe for humans and animals and would 
      not raise food safety concerns if present in the food supply. This 
      approval is an assurance of safety for WUE crops currently under 
      development and being tested in the field and will expedite the 
      regulatory approvals for this trait. Greenhouse and field trials of the 
      WUE trait have been completed in agronomic crops such as rice, wheat, 
      cotton, peanuts and alfalfa, and Arcadia is currently working with 
      collaborators in rice, potato, sugarcane, cotton and multiple tree 
      species.
    

      The irregular availability of suitable water is a leading cause of 
      reduced crop yield globally. Harvest loss due to drought in the United 
      States, as reported to the USDA Risk Management Agency, averaged $4.1 
      billion per year from 2012 through 2016. Arcadia’s WUE trait was 
      developed to help farmers withstand the varying environmental effects of 
      climate change while expanding the range of usable acreage for crop 
      production. In multiple years of field trials, Arcadia’s WUE trait has 
      demonstrated improved crop yields under conditions of episodic water 
      stress and has been shown to help crops recover from severe drought 
      conditions.
    

      “The FDA’s completion of its evaluation of Arcadia’s WUE trait allows us 
      to expedite the development of our drought tolerance portfolio,” said 
      Raj Ketkar, president and CEO of Arcadia Biosciences. “This approval 
      reflects Arcadia’s strong regulatory capabilities and our commitment to 
      helping growers reduce the negative impact of water stress and improve 
      on-farm economics.”
    

      The African Agricultural Technology Foundation (AATF) supported the EFSE 
      study through funds from USAID’s “Feed the Future” initiative. The data 
      provided in support of the EFSE are consistent with international 
      regulatory requirements for genetically modified crops and will provide 
      Arcadia and its global partners with the basis for future regulatory 
      submittals.
    

      Arcadia’s WUE trait technology was jointly discovered by researchers at 
      the University of California, Davis and Technion—Israel Institute of 
      Technology. Arcadia holds an exclusive, global license to the 
      technology, with sublicense rights, for use in all crops.

Company Description (as filed with the SEC)
We, a corporation formed in 2002, are an agricultural biotechnology trait
company engaged in the development of traits that improve food, feed and fiber
crops and enhance the value of the resulting agricultural products. Our
customers include seed companies who incorporate these traits into their elite
varieties to increase the value of a crop for farmers, as well as food and feed
companies who make products that increase the choices and nutritional value of
foods for consumers. We are focused on two distinct areas of the agricultural
supply chain:

 

     1.   Improvement of crop yield by mitigating the impacts of abiotic stresses 
          such as drought, heat, nutrient deficiency, water scarcity, and soil    
          salinity. These stresses are prevalent in most agricultural environments
          with varying degrees of severity and often have material consequences on
          crop production, quality, and farmer incomes.  ... More ...
