The increase in net income for the three months ended March 31, 2016, compared to the same quarter in 2015, was due primarily to recognition of a $680,000 tax benefit related to the partial reversal of the impairment valuation allowance on the Company's deferred tax assets, along with a $76,000 increase in net interest income and a $136,000 increase in non-interest income, which were partially offset by a $291,000 increase in non-interest expenses.  Interest income increased $137,000, or 15.9%, for the three months ended March 31, 2016, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2015, primarily due to a $128,000 increase in interest on loans receivable.  Total interest expense increased $61,000, or 24.7%, for the three months ended March 31, 2016, over the three months ended March 31, 2015, due primarily to an increase in interest expense on deposits of $52,000, or 30.1%.  Non-interest income increased $136,000, or 348.7%, for the three months ended March 31, 2016 over the three months ended March 31, 2015, primarily due to a $109,000 increase in gain on sale of loans.  Non-interest expense increased $291,000, or 49.5%, for the three months ended March 31, 2016 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2015, primarily due to an increase of $186,000, or 56.2%, in salaries, employee benefits and directors fees expense, as the Company increased staffing levels and bonus and incentive compensation.  
The increase in net income for the nine months ended March 31, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015, was due primarily to recognition of the $680,000 tax benefit related to the partial reversal of the impairment valuation allowance on the Company's deferred tax assets, along with a $282,000 increase in net interest income and a $153,000 increase in non-interest income, which were partially offset by a $540,000 increase in non-interest expenses.  Interest income increased $451,000, or 18.0%, for the nine months ended March 31, 2016 over the nine months ended March 31, 2015. This increase was primarily attributable to a $436,000 increase in interest on loans receivable.  Total interest expense increased $169,000, or 23.0%, for the nine months ended March 31, 2016, over the nine months ended March 31, 2015, due primarily to an increase in interest expense on deposits of $132,000, or 25.2%.  Non-interest income increased $153,000, or 106.3%, for the nine months ended March 31, 2016 over the nine months ended March 31, 2015, primarily due to a $134,000 increase in gain on sale of loans.  Non-interest expense increased $540,000, or 31.1%, for the nine months ended March 31, 2016 compared to the nine months ended March 31, 2015, due primarily to an increase of $280,000, or 27.4%, in salaries, employee benefits and directors fees expense, as the Company increased staffing levels and bonus and incentive compensation.  
The Company reported total assets of $119.2 million at March 31, 2016, an increase of $12.4 million, or 11.6% over June 30, 2015.  Total loans increased by 9.1% to $96.9 million, total deposits increased by 16.3% to $79.7 million and stockholders' equity increased by 5.0% to $16.5 million at March 31, 2016 compared to June 30, 2015.

Classified loans totaled $1.7 million at March 31, 2016, compared to $1.9 million at March 31, 2015, and total loans past due greater than 30 days were $13,000 and $88,000 at those respective dates.  The Company had net recoveries totaling $18,000 for the nine months ended March 31, 2016, compared to net recoveries of $27,000 for the nine months ended March 31, 2015.  As a percentage of nonperforming loans, the allowance for loan losses was 165.3% at March 31, 2016, compared to 143.8% at March 31, 2015.

MW Bancorp, Inc. Announces Stock Repurchase Plan

CINCINNATI, Feb. 29, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- MW Bancorp, Inc. (OTCBB: MWBC), the holding company for Watch Hill Bank, headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio, today announced that its Board of Directors has authorized a common stock repurchase plan.  The plan authorizes the repurchase of approximately 10%, or 87,616, of MW Bancorp's current shares outstanding.  MW Bancorp is not obligated to repurchase any particular number of shares.  There is no fixed termination date for the repurchase plan. 
The repurchases may be made from time to time by MW Bancorp in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions as conditions allow.   The timing and amount of any shares repurchased will be determined by MW Bancorp's management based on its evaluation of various factors, including, but not limited to, market conditions and prices, available funds and alternative uses of capital.  Repurchases may also be made under a Rule 10b5-1 plan, which would permit shares to be repurchased when MW Bancorp might otherwise be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws.  All shares repurchased will be at MW Bancorp's sole discretion and the plan may be re-evaluated from time to time.  The Board of Directors, based on such re-evaluations, may suspend, terminate, modify or cancel the plan at any time without notice.
Watch Hill Bank is locally operated and has two full-service offices, located at 3549 Columbia Parkway, Cincinnati, OH 45226 and 2110 Beechmont Avenue, Cincinnati, OH 45230.  Watch Hill Bank serves the needs of individuals and businesses in Southwest, Ohio.  For more information regarding Watch Hill Bank, please call (513) 231-7871 or visit www.watchhillbank.com.
Information contained in this press release may be considered forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and is subject to various risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Such forward-looking statements in this release are inherently subject to many uncertainties arising in the MW Bancorp's operations and business environment.  Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should the underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or expected. Among the key factors that may have a direct bearing on the MW Bancorp's operating results, performance or financial condition are competition, the demand for the our products and services, our ability to maintain current deposit and loan levels at current interest rates, deteriorating credit quality, including changes in the interest rate environment reducing interest margins, changes in prepayment speeds, loan origination and sale volumes, charge-offs and loan loss provisions, our ability to maintain required capital levels and adequate sources of funding and liquidity, our ability to secure confidential information through the use of computer systems and telecommunications networks, and other factors as set forth in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the risk factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2015. MW Bancorp undertakes no duty to update any forward-looking statement to conform the statement to actual results or changes in our expectations, except as required to be reported under the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.

	MW Bancorp, Inc. Reports Results for
	the Three and Nine Months Ended March 31, 2017



	 


	Cincinnati, Ohio – May 15, 2017 – MW Bancorp, Inc.
	(the “Company”) (OTC: MWBC), the parent company of Watch Hill Bank (the “Bank”), today reported net income
	of $1.2 million, or $1.46 per diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Net income increased by $578,000, or 86.4%,
	compared to net income of $669,000, or $0.83 per diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2016.


	 


	The Company reported net income of $1.4 million, or $1.73 per
	diluted share, for the nine months ended March 31, 2017, an increase of $705,000, or 95.4%, compared to net income of $739,000,
	or $0.92 per diluted share, for the nine months ended March 31, 2016.


	 


	The increase in net income for the three months ended March
	31, 2017, compared to the same quarter ended March 31, 2016, was due primarily to recognition of a $1.3 million tax benefit related
	to the reversal of the remaining balance of the impairment valuation allowance on the Company’s deferred tax asset (the Company
	recognized a $680,000 partial reversal of the valuation allowance in the period ended March 31, 2016), along with an increase of
	$146,000 in net interest income, which were partially offset by a decrease of $64,000 in noninterest income, and a $168,000 increase
	in noninterest expense. Interest income increased $134,000, or 13.4%, for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to the
	three months ended March 31, 2016, primarily due to a $154,000 increase in interest on loans, as a result of a $15.5 million, or
	16.0%, increase in the average outstanding balance of loans. Total interest expense decreased $12,000, or 3.9%, for the three months
	ended March 31, 2017, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016, due primarily to a decrease in interest expense on deposits
	of $27,000, or 12.0%. Non-interest income decreased $64,000, or 36.6%, for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the
	three months ended March 31, 2016, primarily due to a $51,000 decrease in gain on sale of loans. Noninterest expense increased
	$168,000, or 19.1%, for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016. This increase
	was primarily due to increases of $157,000, or 30.4%, in salaries, employee benefits and directors’ fees expenses, as the
	Company increased bonus, incentive and stock-based compensation; $13,000, or 20.0%, in occupancy and equipment expense, due primarily
	to costs associated with the Company’s new office location which opened in September 2015; and $22,000, or 61.1%, in data
	processing expense, along with additional costs related to the Company’s overall growth.


	 


	The increase in net income for the nine months ended March 31,
	2017, compared to the same period ended March 31, 2016, was due primarily to recognition of the $1.3 million tax benefit related
	to the reversal of the impairment valuation allowance on the Company’s deferred tax asset, along with increases of $380,000
	in net interest income and $99,000 in noninterest income, which were partially offset by a $418,000 increase in noninterest expense.
	Interest income increased $338,000, or 11.4%, for the nine months ended March 31, 2017, compared to the nine months ended March
	31, 2016, primarily due to a $383,000 increase in interest on loans, as a result of a $12.2 million, or 12.6%, increase in the
	average outstanding balance of loans. Total interest expense decreased $42,000, or 4.6%, for the nine months ended March 31, 2017,
	compared to the nine months ended March 31, 2016, due primarily to a decrease in interest expense on deposits of $67,000, or 10.2%.
	Noninterest income increased $99,000, or 33.3%, for the nine months ended March 31, 2017 over the nine months ended March 31, 2016,
	primarily due to a $124,000 increase in gain on sale of loans. Noninterest expense increased $418,000, or 18.3%, for the nine months
	ended March 31, 2017 compared to the nine months ended March 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to increases of $306,000,
	or 23.5%, in salaries, employee benefits and directors’ fees expenses, as the Company increased bonus, incentive and stock-based
	compensation; $57,000, or 37.0%, in occupancy and equipment expense, due primarily to costs associated with the Company’s
	new office location, which opened in September 2015; and $75,000, or 73.5%, in data processing expense, along with additional costs
	related to the Company’s overall growth.


	 





	 




	 




	 


	The Company reported total assets of $136.4 million at March
	31, 2017, an increase of $17.4 million, or 14.6%, over June 30, 2016. Total loans, including loans held for sale, increased by
	12.6% to $114.6 million; total deposits increased by 15.5% to $89.2 million; and stockholders’ equity increased by 6.6% to
	$17.2 million at March 31, 2017 compared to June 30, 2016.


	 


	Total nonperforming loans were $885,000 and $1.2 million at
	March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2016, respectively. Classified loans totaled $1.2 million at March 31, 2017, compared to $1.5 million
	at June 30, 2016, and total loans past due greater than 30 days were $412,000 and $601,000 at those respective dates. The Company
	had net recoveries totaling $3,000 for the nine months ended March 31, 2017, compared to net recoveries of $18,000 for the nine
	months ended March 31, 2016. As a percentage of nonperforming loans, the allowance for loan losses was 185.1% at March 31, 2017,
	compared to 135.2% at June 30, 2016.


	 


	The Company’s deferred tax asset totaled $2.1 million
	at March 31, 2017. Should the corporate income tax rate be reduced through legislation enacted by the U.S. Government from the
	current 34% level, the Company would be required to adjust the carrying value of the deferred tax asset using the new tax rate,
	which would result in a charge to earnings in the period such legislation is enacted.


	 


	The Company was formed in 2014 to serve as the stock holding
	company for the Bank following its mutual-to-stock conversion, which was completed effective January 29, 2015. The Company issued
	876,163 shares at an offering price of $10.00 per share. Proceeds of the offering, net of offering costs and shares acquired by
	the ESOP, totaled $6.7 million. In March 2017, the Company declared a $0.50 per share special cash dividend on its common stock,
	which was paid on April 28, 2017.


	 



	Information contained in this press release may be considered
	forward-looking in nature as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and is subject to various risks, uncertainties,
	and assumptions. Such forward-looking statements in this release are inherently subject to many uncertainties arising in MW Bancorp's
	operations and business environment. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should the underlying assumptions
	prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or expected. Among the key factors that may
	have a direct bearing on MW Bancorp's operating results, performance or financial condition are competition, the demand for our
	products and services, our ability to maintain current deposit and loan levels at current interest rates, deteriorating credit
	quality, including changes in the interest rate environment reducing interest margins, changes in prepayment speeds, loan origination
	and sale volumes, charge-offs and loan loss provisions, our ability to maintain required capital levels and adequate sources of
	funding and liquidity, our ability to secure confidential information through the use of computer systems and telecommunications
	networks, and other factors as set forth in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including
	the risk factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016. MW Bancorp undertakes no duty to
	update any forward-looking statement to conform the statement to actual results or changes in our expectations, except as required
