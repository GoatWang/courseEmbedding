History of Owens Products  
Owens Classic was created 1965 with the invention of the Classic fifth wheel hitch and the Owens fifth wheel recreational trailer. The business evolved into the manufacturing of a variety of commercial trailers using the same fifth wheel concept. Owens designed the first aluminum running board in the market in 1977, which allowed the fifth wheel customer the ease of unlocking the fifth wheel hitch located in the truck bed.
In 1989, Owens sold the fifth wheel hitch and a few years later also sold its trailer manufacturing plant, enabling the company to concentrate on its core business automotive accessories.
Owens is a dominant force in the automotive aftermarket with product lines of plastic, fiberglass and aluminum running boards, aluminum tool boxes, dog boxes, garage and trailer accessories as well as its custom made products.
During November 2007, Gary Kirtley, II purchased Owens Products and several internal changes were made. The company is now a strong and profitable company continuing to be family owned and operated.
All products that Owens sells are proudly made in the USA.

 Javara PerrilliatSVP, Strategic Supply Management 



 
Our MediChoice® brand contributes to enhanced patient satisfaction, while at the same time, improving outcomes. Since the MediChoice® launch in 2002, O&M has focused on expanding the portfolio as a top-tier brand, offering customers excellent product choice at competitive prices. O&M partners with its customers to lower total cost by offering products with exceptional quality, continuous improvement, and value-added customer service.
In order to source these quality products, O&M works with a wide range of manufacturers around the world. O&M is proud that more than 30% of the MediChoice® portfolio is produced by certified small-, women-, minority- and veteran-owned businesses. The MediChoice® product portfolio reflects Owens & Minor's longstanding commitment to building strong and diverse supply chain relationships.



What Can MediChoice® do for your Hospital?
O&M partners with reliable manufacturers to provide only quality MediChoice® offerings, across a wide spectrum of categories, including patient care, O.R. protection, and labor and delivery. By offering a single brand for thousands of regularly purchased items, MediChoice® can increase efficiency and support product standardization initiatives. With MediChoice®, the savings can be immediate. O&M's competitively priced products save hospitals on the most regularly purchased supplies. With near-perfect fill rates, MediChoice® customers get premium service on common items, while controlling their supply spend.




What do our Customers Think About the MediChoice® Option? Satisfied Customers Speak Out:

“The product quality is the same or better than branded products and price savings are significant.” 
“It's nice to have a partner that I can rely on to bring me savings opportunities with quality products that I can take to Value Analysis with confidence.”
“With MediChoice®, we are able to save supply expense, while at the same time, we are increasing staff satisfaction.” 

We pride ourselves in offering the broadest and deepest selection of branded products available in our industry. We offer these through our uniquely, non-competitive partnerships with leading healthcare products manufacturers and through our own quality, value-priced product line, MediChoice®, as well as through the Medical Action and ArcRoyal brands.

JOIN THE LISTClickFIND A STOREBebop: The Music And Its Playersby Owens, Thomas&quot;When bebop was new,&quot; writes Thomas Owens, &quot;many jazz musicians and most of the jazz audience heard it as radical, chaotic, bewildering music.&quot; For a nation swinging to the smoothly orchestrated sounds of the big bands, this revolutionary movement of the 1940s must have seemed destined for a short life on the musical fringe. But today, Owens writes, bebop is nothing less than &quot;the lingua franca of jazz, serving as the principal musical language of thousands of jazz musicians.&quot;In Bebop, Owens conducts us on an insightful, loving tour through the music, players, and recordings that changed American culture. Combining vivid portraits of bebop's gigantic personalities with deft musical analysis, he ranges from the early classics of modern jazz (starting with the 1943 Onyx Club performances of Dizzy Gillespie, Max Roach, Oscar Pettiford, Don Byas, and George Wallington) through the central role of Charlie Parker, to an instrument-by-instrument look at the key players and their innovations. Illustrating his discussion with numerous musical excerpts, Owens skillfully demonstrates why bebop was so revolutionary, with fascinating glimpses of the tempestuous jazz world: Thelonious Monk, for example, did &quot;everything 'wrong' in the sense of traditional piano technique....Because his right elbow fanned outward away from his body, he often hit the keys at an angle rather than in parallel. Sometimes he hit a single key with more than one finger, and divided single-line melodies between two hands.&quot; In addition to his discussions of individual instruments and players, Owens examines ensembles, with their sometimes volatile collaborations: in the Jazz Messengers, Benny Golson told of how his own mellow saxophone playing would get lost under Art Blakey's furious drumming: &quot;He would do one of those famous four-bar drum rolls going into the next chorus, and I would completely disappear. He would holler over at me, 'Get up out of that hole!'&quot;In this marvelous account, Owens comes right to the present day, with accounts of new musicians ranging from the Marsalis brothers to lesser-known masters like pianist Michel Petrucciani.Bebop is a jazz-lover's dream--a serious yet highly personal look at America's most distinctive music.JazzCondition: --HPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.
