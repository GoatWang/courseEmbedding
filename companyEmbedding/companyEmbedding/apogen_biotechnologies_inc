Exploring the impact of university research on our world.








Startup profile: ApoGen¬†Biotechnologies

December 4, 2014December 22, 2014Kevin Coss



 

ApoGen Biotechnologies Inc. is developing new drug therapies that will make cancer treatments more effective. The company is based on scientific discoveries by the University of Minnesota‚Äôs Reuben Harris, Ph.D., professor of biochemistry, molecular biology and biophysics, and Daniel Harki, Ph.D., assistant professor of medicinal chemistry.

Technology
ApoGen is developing a new class of drugs that will slow the evolution of cancer cells, as well as companion diagnostics to identify the patients likely to get the most benefit from these therapies. ApoGen‚Äôs drugs block the activity of an enzyme called APOBEC, and the companion diagnostic will identify tumors with high levels of this enzyme. This technology is broadly applicable to many cancer types, including breast, lung, ovarian, bladder and head and neck cancers.


Potential impact
Often, cancer therapies become less effective over time as tumor cells become resistant to treatment. Building upon technologies developed at the U of M, ApoGen is developing drugs to block a key enzyme that causes drug resistance. This strategy has the potential to make both current and future treatments more effective.
‚ÄúOne of the main difficulties in treating cancer is that it evolves over time and develops resistance to therapy. ApoGen‚Äôs scientific cofounders discovered a primary cause of drug resistance and are now developing drugs to slow or even stop it. Our mission is to use these discoveries to break drug resistance in cancer.‚Äù ¬†‚Äî John Santini, Ph.D., ApoGen Biotechnologies president and CEO.

Milestones

ApoGen Biotechnologies incorporated in 2014 by cofounders Reuben Harris, Daniel Harki, and John Santini.
ApoGen obtained a worldwide, exclusive license from the University of Minnesota for APOBEC technologies, including drug and diagnostic products.
Two internationally recognized oncologists became the first members of ApoGen‚Äôs Scientific Advisory Board: Dr. Jos√© Baselga, physician-in-chief and chief medical officer of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, and Dr. Douglas Yee, director of the Masonic Cancer Center at the University of Minnesota.


People
John Santini, President and CEO
John Santini received his Ph.D. in chemical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He has 15 years‚Äô experience as a life science executive and entrepreneur, leading venture-backed, early and clinical-stage medical device and pharmaceutical companies. These companies include On Demand Therapeutics, which developed a drug therapy for retinal diseases that cause vision loss, such as wet age-related macular degeneration. He also led the development of wireless, implantable drug delivery devices at MicroCHIPS Inc. Santini has more than 100 patents and patent applications and has been credited as one of Popular Science Magazine‚Äôs ‚ÄúBrilliant Ten‚Äù scientists and one of the Top 100 Young Innovators in the world by MIT‚Äôs Technology Review Magazine.
Reuben Harris and Dan Harki, scientific founders
 
Reuben Harris and Daniel Harki, both Ph.D., are researchers with the University of Minnesota. Harris is a professor of biochemistry, molecular biology and biophysics in the College of Biological Sciences. As an expert on DNA mutation mechanisms, he discovered the role of the enzyme APOBEC in cancer development and has conducted pioneering oncology and virology work related to the enzyme. Harki is an assistant professor of medicinal chemistry in the College of Pharmacy with expertise in synthetic organic and medicinal chemistry, chemical biology and novel bioactive molecules. Using his expertise in drug discovery and development, Harki is developing a treatment that can inhibit APOBEC, making future cancer treatments more effective.

ApoGen Biotechnologies was launched in September 2014 and is located in St. Paul, Minn.

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body‚Äôs own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system‚Äôs power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body‚Äôs own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients‚Äô immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don‚Äôt think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it‚Äôs forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it‚Äôs well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

We cannot take progress for granted

















We cannot take progress for granted

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.¬† To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)¬†¬†¬† Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
¬†Today, America‚Äôs Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time ‚Äì improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.¬† Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices ‚Äì improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)¬†¬†¬† Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America‚Äôs Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year ‚Äì helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine. ¬†That‚Äôs wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds ‚Äì if not thousands ‚Äì of dollars every year.
3)¬†¬†¬† Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved ‚Äì over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.¬† Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).¬† This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection.¬†
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients.
