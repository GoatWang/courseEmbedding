History[edit]
Behind Novo Nordisk lies a story about two Danish firms - Nordisk Insulinlaboratorium and Novo Terapeutisk Laboratorium. Nordisk Insulinlaboratorium was founded by Hans Christian Hagedorn, August Krogh and August Kongsted in 1923 in Copenhagen.
In 1922, August Krogh and his wife Marie Krogh travelled to the US. The couple had heard reports of people with diabetes being treated with insulin – a hormone discovered in 1921 by two Canadians, Frederick Banting and Charles Best. Marie Krogh was a doctor herself and also had type 2 diabetes. The couple returned to Denmark with permission to manufacture and sell insulin in Scandinavia. With the economic help from August Kongsted – the owner of Leo Pharmaceutical Products - Insulin Leo was marketed in 1923.
When Krogh and Hagedorn started manufacturing insulin, they hired Thorvald Pedersen and his brother Harald Pedersen to build the machines for insulin production. However, Thorvald Pedersen was fired from Nordisk and the two brothers decided to try to manufacture insulin themselves. Thorvald and Harald Pedersen managed to produce a stable liquid insulin and marketed Insulin Novo in 1925. The brothers named their firm Novo Terapeutisk Laboratorium. Over the next decades the products were further improved, e.g., with focus on longer effect; nevertheless, there were still challenges to be met, and in the 1970s the new goal was to produce human insulin meaning that Novo would no longer depend on animal pancreases. In 1982, Novo succeeded and launched the world’s first insulin preparation identical to human insulin.
Nordisk marketed a genetically engineered human growth hormone in 1988 and Novo Nordisk is market leading in the world today in this area and introduced the world’s first liquid growth hormone in a pen system in 1999.
In 1989, Novo Industri A/S (Novo Terapeutisk Laboratorium) and Nordisk Gentofte A/S (Nordisk Insulinlaboratorium) merged to become Novo Nordisk A/S, the world's largest producer of insulin with headquarters in Bagsværd, Copenhagen. In 2000 the company demerged into NovoZymes A/S and Novo Nordisk A/S. Research into bleeding disorders lead to the foundation of The Novo Nordisk Haemophilia Foundation in 2005 striving to improve access to care for people with haemophilia and allied bleeding disorders.
In 2015, the company announced it would collaborate with Ablynx, using its nanobody technology to develop at least one new drug candidate.[9]
Jesper Brandgaard is the Executive Vice President and CFO of the global healthcare company Novo Nordisk A/S. Brandgaard has been the Vice Chairman of the board of directors in the Danish company SimCorp[10] since 2007.[11]
Products[edit]
Tresiba – a Diabetes mellitus type 1 and Type 2 diabetes drug. It is a new-generation basal insulin with ultra-long duration of action of more than 42 hours administered through subcutaneous injection. Intended to offer a flexible treatment and a good safety profile. It is approved and launched in the EU and Japan and under regulatory review in the US and other major markets.[1]
Saxenda – a once-daily human GLP-1 analogue. It serves as an agonist, intended for combination with lifestyle changes (including diet), to offer sustainable weight loss for people with severe obesity, including those at particular risk of developing diabetes.[1]
Ryzodeg – a drug for type 1 and 2 diabetes. Ryzodeg is a soluble co-formulation of Tresiba and NovoRapid, and is a rapid-acting mealtime insulin. It is approved to offer patients reduced risk of hypoglycemia and is currently approved in the EU and Japan. US FDA also approved Ryzodeg & Tresiba on 25 September 2015 after reviewing the interim safety data of the ongoing CV outcome trial DEVOTE .[1]
Levemir – long-acting human insulin analogue for maintaining the basal level of insulin. It is an insulin analogue in which a fatty acid (myristic acid) is bound to the lysine amino acid at position B29. It is quickly absorbed after which it binds to albumin in the blood through its fatty acid at position B29. It then slowly dissociates from this complex.
Victoza – a long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, binding to the same receptors as does the endogenous metabolic hormone GLP-1 that stimulates insulin secretion. It is an injectable drug developed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
NovoLog – a fast-acting insulin analog. It is a manufactured form of human insulin; where a single amino acid has been exchanged. This change helps the fast-acting insulin analog be absorbed quickly into the bloodstream. As a result, it starts working in minutes, which allows one to take insulin and eat right away. Fast-acting insulin analogs are considered to act similarly to the way insulin is released in people without diabetes mellitus.
Novolin N – an intermediate-acting insulin given to help control the blood sugar level of people with diabetes.
Novolin R – is primarily used to treat high blood sugar levels in conditions like diabetes mellitus.
NovoLog Mix 70/30 – is a product which contains 30% insulin aspart and 70% insulin aspart protamine. The insulin aspart protamine portion is a crystalline form of insulin aspart, which delays the action of the insulin, giving it a prolonged absorption profile after injection. The combination of the fast-acting form and the long-acting form allows the patient to receive fewer injections over the course of the day.
In addition to the development of diabetes treatment pharmaceuticals, Novo Nordisk has been involved in the production of several lines of insulin pumps/pens for efficient delivery into the body and bloodstream.
NovoEight – is a recombinant antihemophilic factor VIII used for the treatment of and prophylaxis of bleeding patients with haemophilia A.
NovoSeven – is a form of blood factor VII that has been manufactured via recombinant technology.
Collaborative research[edit]
Toxicogenomics[edit]
Novo Nordisk is involved in publicly funded collaborative research projects with other industrial and academic partners. One example in the area of non-clinical safety assessment is the InnoMed PredTox.[12][13] The company is expanding its activities in joint research projects within the framework of the Innovative Medicines Initiative of European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations and the European Commission.[14]
Diabetes[edit]
Novo Nordisk founded the World Diabetes foundation to save the lives of those affected by diabetes in developing countries and supported a UN resolution to fight diabetes, making diabetes the only other disease alongside HIV / AIDS to have a commitment to combat at a UN level.[15]
Diabetes treatments account for 85% of Novo Nordisk’s business. Novo Nordisk works with doctors, nurses, and patients, to develop products for self-managing diabetes conditions. The DAWN (Diabetes Attitudes, Wishes and Needs) 2001 study was a global survey of the psychosocial aspects of living with diabetes. It involved over 5,000 people with diabetes and almost 4,000 care providers.[16] This study was designed to identify barriers to optimal health and quality of life. A follow-up study completed in 2012 involved more than 15,000 people living with, or caring for, those with diabetes. In response to UK findings, a National Action Plan (NAP) was developed, with a multidisciplinary steering committee, to support the delivery of individualized person-centered care in the UK. The NAP seeks to provide a holistic approach to diabetes treatment for patients and their families.[17]
The i3-diabetes programme is a unique collaboration between the King's Health Partners, one of only six Academic Health Sciences Centres (AHSCs) in England, and Novo Nordisk with the aim of co-creatinga new, world-class model of patient-centred, specialist diabetes care that will meet the changing needs of people with diabetes. The programme is a five-year collaboration designed to deliver personalised care that will lead to improved outcomes for people living with diabetes, and more efficient and effective ways of caring for people with diabetes.[18][19]
Diabetes support advocacy[edit]
Novo Nordisk have sponsored the International Diabetes Federation's Unite for Diabetes campaign.[20]
In March 2014, Novo Nordisk announced a partnership program entitled ‘Cities Changing Diabetes,’ which entails combating urban diabetes. Partnership includes University College London (UCL) and supported by Steno Diabetes Center, as well as a range of local partners including healthcare professionals, city authorities, urban planners, businesses, academics and community leaders.[21]
A November 2014 newspaper article suggested that a recent medical research breakthrough at Harvard University (creating insulin-producing cells from embryonic stem cells) could potentially put Novo Nordisk out of business. Dr Alan Moses, the chief medical officer of Novo Nordisk, commented that the biology of diabetes is incredibly complex but also that Novo Nordisk's mission is to alleviate and cure diabetes. If this new medical advance "...meant the dissolution of Novo Nordisk, that'd be fine."[22]
Research and pipeline[edit]
Novo Nordisk was researching pulmonary delivery systems for diabetic medications, and in the early stages of research into autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases, using technologies such as translational immunology and monoclonal antibodies [23] In September 2014 the company announced a decision to discontinue all research in inflammatory disorders, including the discontinuation of R&D in anti-IL-20 for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.[24]
Controversy[edit]
In 2010, Novo Nordisk breached the ABPIs code of conduct by failing to provide information about side-effects of Victoza and by promoting Victoza prior to being granted market authorization.[25]
In 2013 Novo Nordisk had to pay back DKK 3.6 billion to the Danish tax authorities due to transfer mispricing.[26]
In March 2013, a debate emerged in which scientists questioned whether the incretin class of diabetes medications – the class to which Victoza belongs – had an increased risk of side effects in the pancreas such as pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. It was concluded that data currently available did not confirm these concerns.[27]
In October 2013, batches of NovoMix 30 FlexPen and Penfill insulin were recalled in some European countries as their analysis had shown that a small percentage of the products in these batches did not meet the specifications for insulin strength.[28]
Sponsorship[edit]

Novo Nordisk has sponsored sportsmen with diabetes, such as Charlie Kimball in auto racing and Team Novo Nordisk in road cycling.

History[edit]
Behind Novo Nordisk lies a story about two Danish firms - Nordisk Insulinlaboratorium and Novo Terapeutisk Laboratorium. Nordisk Insulinlaboratorium was founded by Hans Christian Hagedorn, August Krogh and August Kongsted in 1923 in Copenhagen.
In 1922, August Krogh and his wife Marie Krogh travelled to the US. The couple had heard reports of people with diabetes being treated with insulin – a hormone discovered in 1921 by two Canadians, Frederick Banting and Charles Best. Marie Krogh was a doctor herself and also had type 2 diabetes. The couple returned to Denmark with permission to manufacture and sell insulin in Scandinavia. With the economic help from August Kongsted – the owner of Leo Pharmaceutical Products - Insulin Leo was marketed in 1923.
When Krogh and Hagedorn started manufacturing insulin, they hired Thorvald Pedersen and his brother Harald Pedersen to build the machines for insulin production. However, Thorvald Pedersen was fired from Nordisk and the two brothers decided to try to manufacture insulin themselves. Thorvald and Harald Pedersen managed to produce a stable liquid insulin and marketed Insulin Novo in 1925. The brothers named their firm Novo Terapeutisk Laboratorium. Over the next decades the products were further improved, e.g., with focus on longer effect; nevertheless, there were still challenges to be met, and in the 1970s the new goal was to produce human insulin meaning that Novo would no longer depend on animal pancreases. In 1982, Novo succeeded and launched the world’s first insulin preparation identical to human insulin.
Nordisk marketed a genetically engineered human growth hormone in 1988 and Novo Nordisk is market leading in the world today in this area and introduced the world’s first liquid growth hormone in a pen system in 1999.
In 1989, Novo Industri A/S (Novo Terapeutisk Laboratorium) and Nordisk Gentofte A/S (Nordisk Insulinlaboratorium) merged to become Novo Nordisk A/S, the world's largest producer of insulin with headquarters in Bagsværd, Copenhagen. In 2000 the company demerged into NovoZymes A/S and Novo Nordisk A/S. Research into bleeding disorders lead to the foundation of The Novo Nordisk Haemophilia Foundation in 2005 striving to improve access to care for people with haemophilia and allied bleeding disorders.
In 2015, the company announced it would collaborate with Ablynx, using its nanobody technology to develop at least one new drug candidate.[9]
Jesper Brandgaard is the Executive Vice President and CFO of the global healthcare company Novo Nordisk A/S. Brandgaard has been the Vice Chairman of the board of directors in the Danish company SimCorp[10] since 2007.[11]
Products[edit]
Tresiba – a Diabetes mellitus type 1 and Type 2 diabetes drug. It is a new-generation basal insulin with ultra-long duration of action of more than 42 hours administered through subcutaneous injection. Intended to offer a flexible treatment and a good safety profile. It is approved and launched in the EU and Japan and under regulatory review in the US and other major markets.[1]
Saxenda – a once-daily human GLP-1 analogue. It serves as an agonist, intended for combination with lifestyle changes (including diet), to offer sustainable weight loss for people with severe obesity, including those at particular risk of developing diabetes.[1]
Ryzodeg – a drug for type 1 and 2 diabetes. Ryzodeg is a soluble co-formulation of Tresiba and NovoRapid, and is a rapid-acting mealtime insulin. It is approved to offer patients reduced risk of hypoglycemia and is currently approved in the EU and Japan. US FDA also approved Ryzodeg & Tresiba on 25 September 2015 after reviewing the interim safety data of the ongoing CV outcome trial DEVOTE .[1]
Levemir – long-acting human insulin analogue for maintaining the basal level of insulin. It is an insulin analogue in which a fatty acid (myristic acid) is bound to the lysine amino acid at position B29. It is quickly absorbed after which it binds to albumin in the blood through its fatty acid at position B29. It then slowly dissociates from this complex.
Victoza – a long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, binding to the same receptors as does the endogenous metabolic hormone GLP-1 that stimulates insulin secretion. It is an injectable drug developed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
NovoLog – a fast-acting insulin analog. It is a manufactured form of human insulin; where a single amino acid has been exchanged. This change helps the fast-acting insulin analog be absorbed quickly into the bloodstream. As a result, it starts working in minutes, which allows one to take insulin and eat right away. Fast-acting insulin analogs are considered to act similarly to the way insulin is released in people without diabetes mellitus.
Novolin N – an intermediate-acting insulin given to help control the blood sugar level of people with diabetes.
Novolin R – is primarily used to treat high blood sugar levels in conditions like diabetes mellitus.
NovoLog Mix 70/30 – is a product which contains 30% insulin aspart and 70% insulin aspart protamine. The insulin aspart protamine portion is a crystalline form of insulin aspart, which delays the action of the insulin, giving it a prolonged absorption profile after injection. The combination of the fast-acting form and the long-acting form allows the patient to receive fewer injections over the course of the day.
In addition to the development of diabetes treatment pharmaceuticals, Novo Nordisk has been involved in the production of several lines of insulin pumps/pens for efficient delivery into the body and bloodstream.
NovoEight – is a recombinant antihemophilic factor VIII used for the treatment of and prophylaxis of bleeding patients with haemophilia A.
NovoSeven – is a form of blood factor VII that has been manufactured via recombinant technology.
Collaborative research[edit]
Toxicogenomics[edit]
Novo Nordisk is involved in publicly funded collaborative research projects with other industrial and academic partners. One example in the area of non-clinical safety assessment is the InnoMed PredTox.[12][13] The company is expanding its activities in joint research projects within the framework of the Innovative Medicines Initiative of European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations and the European Commission.[14]
Diabetes[edit]
Novo Nordisk founded the World Diabetes foundation to save the lives of those affected by diabetes in developing countries and supported a UN resolution to fight diabetes, making diabetes the only other disease alongside HIV / AIDS to have a commitment to combat at a UN level.[15]
Diabetes treatments account for 85% of Novo Nordisk’s business. Novo Nordisk works with doctors, nurses, and patients, to develop products for self-managing diabetes conditions. The DAWN (Diabetes Attitudes, Wishes and Needs) 2001 study was a global survey of the psychosocial aspects of living with diabetes. It involved over 5,000 people with diabetes and almost 4,000 care providers.[16] This study was designed to identify barriers to optimal health and quality of life. A follow-up study completed in 2012 involved more than 15,000 people living with, or caring for, those with diabetes. In response to UK findings, a National Action Plan (NAP) was developed, with a multidisciplinary steering committee, to support the delivery of individualized person-centered care in the UK. The NAP seeks to provide a holistic approach to diabetes treatment for patients and their families.[17]
The i3-diabetes programme is a unique collaboration between the King's Health Partners, one of only six Academic Health Sciences Centres (AHSCs) in England, and Novo Nordisk with the aim of co-creatinga new, world-class model of patient-centred, specialist diabetes care that will meet the changing needs of people with diabetes. The programme is a five-year collaboration designed to deliver personalised care that will lead to improved outcomes for people living with diabetes, and more efficient and effective ways of caring for people with diabetes.[18][19]
Diabetes support advocacy[edit]
Novo Nordisk have sponsored the International Diabetes Federation's Unite for Diabetes campaign.[20]
In March 2014, Novo Nordisk announced a partnership program entitled ‘Cities Changing Diabetes,’ which entails combating urban diabetes. Partnership includes University College London (UCL) and supported by Steno Diabetes Center, as well as a range of local partners including healthcare professionals, city authorities, urban planners, businesses, academics and community leaders.[21]
A November 2014 newspaper article suggested that a recent medical research breakthrough at Harvard University (creating insulin-producing cells from embryonic stem cells) could potentially put Novo Nordisk out of business. Dr Alan Moses, the chief medical officer of Novo Nordisk, commented that the biology of diabetes is incredibly complex but also that Novo Nordisk's mission is to alleviate and cure diabetes. If this new medical advance "...meant the dissolution of Novo Nordisk, that'd be fine."[22]

Novo Nordisk was researching pulmonary delivery systems for diabetic medications, and in the early stages of research into autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases, using technologies such as translational immunology and monoclonal antibodies [23] In September 2014 the company announced a decision to discontinue all research in inflammatory disorders, including the discontinuation of R&D in anti-IL-20 for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.[24]
Controversy[edit]
In 2010, Novo Nordisk breached the ABPIs code of conduct by failing to provide information about side-effects of Victoza and by promoting Victoza prior to being granted market authorization.[25]
In 2013 Novo Nordisk had to pay back DKK 3.6 billion to the Danish tax authorities due to transfer mispricing.[26]
In March 2013, a debate emerged in which scientists questioned whether the incretin class of diabetes medications – the class to which Victoza belongs – had an increased risk of side effects in the pancreas such as pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. It was concluded that data currently available did not confirm these concerns.[27]
In October 2013, batches of NovoMix 30 FlexPen and Penfill insulin were recalled in some European countries as their analysis had shown that a small percentage of the products in these batches did not meet the specifications for insulin strength.[28]
Sponsorship[edit]

History[edit]
Behind Novo Nordisk lies a story about two Danish firms - Nordisk Insulinlaboratorium and Novo Terapeutisk Laboratorium. Nordisk Insulinlaboratorium was founded by Hans Christian Hagedorn, August Krogh and August Kongsted in 1923 in Copenhagen.
In 1922, August Krogh and his wife Marie Krogh travelled to the US. The couple had heard reports of people with diabetes being treated with insulin – a hormone discovered in 1921 by two Canadians, Frederick Banting and Charles Best. Marie Krogh was a doctor herself and also had type 2 diabetes. The couple returned to Denmark with permission to manufacture and sell insulin in Scandinavia. With the economic help from August Kongsted – the owner of Leo Pharmaceutical Products - Insulin Leo was marketed in 1923.
When Krogh and Hagedorn started manufacturing insulin, they hired Thorvald Pedersen and his brother Harald Pedersen to build the machines for insulin production. However, Thorvald Pedersen was fired from Nordisk and the two brothers decided to try to manufacture insulin themselves. Thorvald and Harald Pedersen managed to produce a stable liquid insulin and marketed Insulin Novo in 1925. The brothers named their firm Novo Terapeutisk Laboratorium. Over the next decades the products were further improved, e.g., with focus on longer effect; nevertheless, there were still challenges to be met, and in the 1970s the new goal was to produce human insulin meaning that Novo would no longer depend on animal pancreases. In 1982, Novo succeeded and launched the world’s first insulin preparation identical to human insulin.
Nordisk marketed a genetically engineered human growth hormone in 1988 and Novo Nordisk is market leading in the world today in this area and introduced the world’s first liquid growth hormone in a pen system in 1999.
In 1989, Novo Industri A/S (Novo Terapeutisk Laboratorium) and Nordisk Gentofte A/S (Nordisk Insulinlaboratorium) merged to become Novo Nordisk A/S, the world's largest producer of insulin with headquarters in Bagsværd, Copenhagen. In 2000 the company demerged into NovoZymes A/S and Novo Nordisk A/S. Research into bleeding disorders lead to the foundation of The Novo Nordisk Haemophilia Foundation in 2005 striving to improve access to care for people with haemophilia and allied bleeding disorders.
In 2015, the company announced it would collaborate with Ablynx, using its nanobody technology to develop at least one new drug candidate.[9]
Jesper Brandgaard is the Executive Vice President and CFO of the global healthcare company Novo Nordisk A/S. Brandgaard has been the Vice Chairman of the board of directors in the Danish company SimCorp[10] since 2007.[11]
Products[edit]
Tresiba – a Diabetes mellitus type 1 and Type 2 diabetes drug. It is a new-generation basal insulin with ultra-long duration of action of more than 42 hours administered through subcutaneous injection. Intended to offer a flexible treatment and a good safety profile. It is approved and launched in the EU and Japan and under regulatory review in the US and other major markets.[1]
Saxenda – a once-daily human GLP-1 analogue. It serves as an agonist, intended for combination with lifestyle changes (including diet), to offer sustainable weight loss for people with severe obesity, including those at particular risk of developing diabetes.[1]
Ryzodeg – a drug for type 1 and 2 diabetes. Ryzodeg is a soluble co-formulation of Tresiba and NovoRapid, and is a rapid-acting mealtime insulin. It is approved to offer patients reduced risk of hypoglycemia and is currently approved in the EU and Japan. US FDA also approved Ryzodeg & Tresiba on 25 September 2015 after reviewing the interim safety data of the ongoing CV outcome trial DEVOTE .[1]
Levemir – long-acting human insulin analogue for maintaining the basal level of insulin. It is an insulin analogue in which a fatty acid (myristic acid) is bound to the lysine amino acid at position B29. It is quickly absorbed after which it binds to albumin in the blood through its fatty acid at position B29. It then slowly dissociates from this complex.
Victoza – a long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, binding to the same receptors as does the endogenous metabolic hormone GLP-1 that stimulates insulin secretion. It is an injectable drug developed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
NovoLog – a fast-acting insulin analog. It is a manufactured form of human insulin; where a single amino acid has been exchanged. This change helps the fast-acting insulin analog be absorbed quickly into the bloodstream. As a result, it starts working in minutes, which allows one to take insulin and eat right away. Fast-acting insulin analogs are considered to act similarly to the way insulin is released in people without diabetes mellitus.
Novolin N – an intermediate-acting insulin given to help control the blood sugar level of people with diabetes.
Novolin R – is primarily used to treat high blood sugar levels in conditions like diabetes mellitus.
NovoLog Mix 70/30 – is a product which contains 30% insulin aspart and 70% insulin aspart protamine. The insulin aspart protamine portion is a crystalline form of insulin aspart, which delays the action of the insulin, giving it a prolonged absorption profile after injection. The combination of the fast-acting form and the long-acting form allows the patient to receive fewer injections over the course of the day.
In addition to the development of diabetes treatment pharmaceuticals, Novo Nordisk has been involved in the production of several lines of insulin pumps/pens for efficient delivery into the body and bloodstream.
NovoEight – is a recombinant antihemophilic factor VIII used for the treatment of and prophylaxis of bleeding patients with haemophilia A.
NovoSeven – is a form of blood factor VII that has been manufactured via recombinant technology.
Collaborative research[edit]
Toxicogenomics[edit]
Novo Nordisk is involved in publicly funded collaborative research projects with other industrial and academic partners. One example in the area of non-clinical safety assessment is the InnoMed PredTox.[12][13] The company is expanding its activities in joint research projects within the framework of the Innovative Medicines Initiative of European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations and the European Commission.[14]
Diabetes[edit]
Novo Nordisk founded the World Diabetes foundation to save the lives of those affected by diabetes in developing countries and supported a UN resolution to fight diabetes, making diabetes the only other disease alongside HIV / AIDS to have a commitment to combat at a UN level.[15]
Diabetes treatments account for 85% of Novo Nordisk’s business. Novo Nordisk works with doctors, nurses, and patients, to develop products for self-managing diabetes conditions. The DAWN (Diabetes Attitudes, Wishes and Needs) 2001 study was a global survey of the psychosocial aspects of living with diabetes. It involved over 5,000 people with diabetes and almost 4,000 care providers.[16] This study was designed to identify barriers to optimal health and quality of life. A follow-up study completed in 2012 involved more than 15,000 people living with, or caring for, those with diabetes. In response to UK findings, a National Action Plan (NAP) was developed, with a multidisciplinary steering committee, to support the delivery of individualized person-centered care in the UK. The NAP seeks to provide a holistic approach to diabetes treatment for patients and their families.[17]
The i3-diabetes programme is a unique collaboration between the King's Health Partners, one of only six Academic Health Sciences Centres (AHSCs) in England, and Novo Nordisk with the aim of co-creatinga new, world-class model of patient-centred, specialist diabetes care that will meet the changing needs of people with diabetes. The programme is a five-year collaboration designed to deliver personalised care that will lead to improved outcomes for people living with diabetes, and more efficient and effective ways of caring for people with diabetes.[18][19]
Diabetes support advocacy[edit]
Novo Nordisk have sponsored the International Diabetes Federation's Unite for Diabetes campaign.[20]
In March 2014, Novo Nordisk announced a partnership program entitled ‘Cities Changing Diabetes,’ which entails combating urban diabetes. Partnership includes University College London (UCL) and supported by Steno Diabetes Center, as well as a range of local partners including healthcare professionals, city authorities, urban planners, businesses, academics and community leaders.[21]
A November 2014 newspaper article suggested that a recent medical research breakthrough at Harvard University (creating insulin-producing cells from embryonic stem cells) could potentially put Novo Nordisk out of business. Dr Alan Moses, the chief medical officer of Novo Nordisk, commented that the biology of diabetes is incredibly complex but also that Novo Nordisk's mission is to alleviate and cure diabetes. If this new medical advance "...meant the dissolution of Novo Nordisk, that'd be fine."[22]
Research and pipeline[edit]
Novo Nordisk was researching pulmonary delivery systems for diabetic medications, and in the early stages of research into autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases, using technologies such as translational immunology and monoclonal antibodies [23] In September 2014 the company announced a decision to discontinue all research in inflammatory disorders, including the discontinuation of R&D in anti-IL-20 for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.[24]

In 2013 Novo Nordisk had to pay back DKK 3.6 billion to the Danish tax authorities due to transfer mispricing.[26]
In March 2013, a debate emerged in which scientists questioned whether the incretin class of diabetes medications – the class to which Victoza belongs – had an increased risk of side effects in the pancreas such as pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. It was concluded that data currently available did not confirm these concerns.[27]
In October 2013, batches of NovoMix 30 FlexPen and Penfill insulin were recalled in some European countries as their analysis had shown that a small percentage of the products in these batches did not meet the specifications for insulin strength.[28]

History[edit]
Behind Novo Nordisk lies a story about two Danish firms - Nordisk Insulinlaboratorium and Novo Terapeutisk Laboratorium. Nordisk Insulinlaboratorium was founded by Hans Christian Hagedorn, August Krogh and August Kongsted in 1923 in Copenhagen.
In 1922, August Krogh and his wife Marie Krogh travelled to the US. The couple had heard reports of people with diabetes being treated with insulin – a hormone discovered in 1921 by two Canadians, Frederick Banting and Charles Best. Marie Krogh was a doctor herself and also had type 2 diabetes. The couple returned to Denmark with permission to manufacture and sell insulin in Scandinavia. With the economic help from August Kongsted – the owner of Leo Pharmaceutical Products - Insulin Leo was marketed in 1923.
When Krogh and Hagedorn started manufacturing insulin, they hired Thorvald Pedersen and his brother Harald Pedersen to build the machines for insulin production. However, Thorvald Pedersen was fired from Nordisk and the two brothers decided to try to manufacture insulin themselves. Thorvald and Harald Pedersen managed to produce a stable liquid insulin and marketed Insulin Novo in 1925. The brothers named their firm Novo Terapeutisk Laboratorium. Over the next decades the products were further improved, e.g., with focus on longer effect; nevertheless, there were still challenges to be met, and in the 1970s the new goal was to produce human insulin meaning that Novo would no longer depend on animal pancreases. In 1982, Novo succeeded and launched the world’s first insulin preparation identical to human insulin.
Nordisk marketed a genetically engineered human growth hormone in 1988 and Novo Nordisk is market leading in the world today in this area and introduced the world’s first liquid growth hormone in a pen system in 1999.
In 1989, Novo Industri A/S (Novo Terapeutisk Laboratorium) and Nordisk Gentofte A/S (Nordisk Insulinlaboratorium) merged to become Novo Nordisk A/S, the world's largest producer of insulin with headquarters in Bagsværd, Copenhagen. In 2000 the company demerged into NovoZymes A/S and Novo Nordisk A/S. Research into bleeding disorders lead to the foundation of The Novo Nordisk Haemophilia Foundation in 2005 striving to improve access to care for people with haemophilia and allied bleeding disorders.
In 2015, the company announced it would collaborate with Ablynx, using its nanobody technology to develop at least one new drug candidate.[9]
Jesper Brandgaard is the Executive Vice President and CFO of the global healthcare company Novo Nordisk A/S. Brandgaard has been the Vice Chairman of the board of directors in the Danish company SimCorp[10] since 2007.[11]
Products[edit]
Tresiba – a Diabetes mellitus type 1 and Type 2 diabetes drug. It is a new-generation basal insulin with ultra-long duration of action of more than 42 hours administered through subcutaneous injection. Intended to offer a flexible treatment and a good safety profile. It is approved and launched in the EU and Japan and under regulatory review in the US and other major markets.[1]
Saxenda – a once-daily human GLP-1 analogue. It serves as an agonist, intended for combination with lifestyle changes (including diet), to offer sustainable weight loss for people with severe obesity, including those at particular risk of developing diabetes.[1]
Ryzodeg – a drug for type 1 and 2 diabetes. Ryzodeg is a soluble co-formulation of Tresiba and NovoRapid, and is a rapid-acting mealtime insulin. It is approved to offer patients reduced risk of hypoglycemia and is currently approved in the EU and Japan. US FDA also approved Ryzodeg & Tresiba on 25 September 2015 after reviewing the interim safety data of the ongoing CV outcome trial DEVOTE .[1]
Levemir – long-acting human insulin analogue for maintaining the basal level of insulin. It is an insulin analogue in which a fatty acid (myristic acid) is bound to the lysine amino acid at position B29. It is quickly absorbed after which it binds to albumin in the blood through its fatty acid at position B29. It then slowly dissociates from this complex.
Victoza – a long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, binding to the same receptors as does the endogenous metabolic hormone GLP-1 that stimulates insulin secretion. It is an injectable drug developed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
NovoLog – a fast-acting insulin analog. It is a manufactured form of human insulin; where a single amino acid has been exchanged. This change helps the fast-acting insulin analog be absorbed quickly into the bloodstream. As a result, it starts working in minutes, which allows one to take insulin and eat right away. Fast-acting insulin analogs are considered to act similarly to the way insulin is released in people without diabetes mellitus.
Novolin N – an intermediate-acting insulin given to help control the blood sugar level of people with diabetes.
Novolin R – is primarily used to treat high blood sugar levels in conditions like diabetes mellitus.
NovoLog Mix 70/30 – is a product which contains 30% insulin aspart and 70% insulin aspart protamine. The insulin aspart protamine portion is a crystalline form of insulin aspart, which delays the action of the insulin, giving it a prolonged absorption profile after injection. The combination of the fast-acting form and the long-acting form allows the patient to receive fewer injections over the course of the day.
In addition to the development of diabetes treatment pharmaceuticals, Novo Nordisk has been involved in the production of several lines of insulin pumps/pens for efficient delivery into the body and bloodstream.
NovoEight – is a recombinant antihemophilic factor VIII used for the treatment of and prophylaxis of bleeding patients with haemophilia A.
NovoSeven – is a form of blood factor VII that has been manufactured via recombinant technology.
Collaborative research[edit]
Toxicogenomics[edit]
Novo Nordisk is involved in publicly funded collaborative research projects with other industrial and academic partners. One example in the area of non-clinical safety assessment is the InnoMed PredTox.[12][13] The company is expanding its activities in joint research projects within the framework of the Innovative Medicines Initiative of European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations and the European Commission.[14]
Diabetes[edit]
Novo Nordisk founded the World Diabetes foundation to save the lives of those affected by diabetes in developing countries and supported a UN resolution to fight diabetes, making diabetes the only other disease alongside HIV / AIDS to have a commitment to combat at a UN level.[15]
Diabetes treatments account for 85% of Novo Nordisk’s business. Novo Nordisk works with doctors, nurses, and patients, to develop products for self-managing diabetes conditions. The DAWN (Diabetes Attitudes, Wishes and Needs) 2001 study was a global survey of the psychosocial aspects of living with diabetes. It involved over 5,000 people with diabetes and almost 4,000 care providers.[16] This study was designed to identify barriers to optimal health and quality of life. A follow-up study completed in 2012 involved more than 15,000 people living with, or caring for, those with diabetes. In response to UK findings, a National Action Plan (NAP) was developed, with a multidisciplinary steering committee, to support the delivery of individualized person-centered care in the UK. The NAP seeks to provide a holistic approach to diabetes treatment for patients and their families.[17]
The i3-diabetes programme is a unique collaboration between the King's Health Partners, one of only six Academic Health Sciences Centres (AHSCs) in England, and Novo Nordisk with the aim of co-creatinga new, world-class model of patient-centred, specialist diabetes care that will meet the changing needs of people with diabetes. The programme is a five-year collaboration designed to deliver personalised care that will lead to improved outcomes for people living with diabetes, and more efficient and effective ways of caring for people with diabetes.[18][19]
Diabetes support advocacy[edit]
Novo Nordisk have sponsored the International Diabetes Federation's Unite for Diabetes campaign.[20]
In March 2014, Novo Nordisk announced a partnership program entitled ‘Cities Changing Diabetes,’ which entails combating urban diabetes. Partnership includes University College London (UCL) and supported by Steno Diabetes Center, as well as a range of local partners including healthcare professionals, city authorities, urban planners, businesses, academics and community leaders.[21]
A November 2014 newspaper article suggested that a recent medical research breakthrough at Harvard University (creating insulin-producing cells from embryonic stem cells) could potentially put Novo Nordisk out of business. Dr Alan Moses, the chief medical officer of Novo Nordisk, commented that the biology of diabetes is incredibly complex but also that Novo Nordisk's mission is to alleviate and cure diabetes. If this new medical advance "...meant the dissolution of Novo Nordisk, that'd be fine."[22]
Research and pipeline[edit]
Novo Nordisk was researching pulmonary delivery systems for diabetic medications, and in the early stages of research into autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases, using technologies such as translational immunology and monoclonal antibodies [23] In September 2014 the company announced a decision to discontinue all research in inflammatory disorders, including the discontinuation of R&D in anti-IL-20 for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.[24]
Controversy[edit]
In 2010, Novo Nordisk breached the ABPIs code of conduct by failing to provide information about side-effects of Victoza and by promoting Victoza prior to being granted market authorization.[25]
In 2013 Novo Nordisk had to pay back DKK 3.6 billion to the Danish tax authorities due to transfer mispricing.[26]
In March 2013, a debate emerged in which scientists questioned whether the incretin class of diabetes medications – the class to which Victoza belongs – had an increased risk of side effects in the pancreas such as pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. It was concluded that data currently available did not confirm these concerns.[27]
In October 2013, batches of NovoMix 30 FlexPen and Penfill insulin were recalled in some European countries as their analysis had shown that a small percentage of the products in these batches did not meet the specifications for insulin strength.[28]
Sponsorship[edit]

History[edit]
Behind Novo Nordisk lies a story about two Danish firms - Nordisk Insulinlaboratorium and Novo Terapeutisk Laboratorium. Nordisk Insulinlaboratorium was founded by Hans Christian Hagedorn, August Krogh and August Kongsted in 1923 in Copenhagen.
In 1922, August Krogh and his wife Marie Krogh travelled to the US. The couple had heard reports of people with diabetes being treated with insulin – a hormone discovered in 1921 by two Canadians, Frederick Banting and Charles Best. Marie Krogh was a doctor herself and also had type 2 diabetes. The couple returned to Denmark with permission to manufacture and sell insulin in Scandinavia. With the economic help from August Kongsted – the owner of Leo Pharmaceutical Products - Insulin Leo was marketed in 1923.
When Krogh and Hagedorn started manufacturing insulin, they hired Thorvald Pedersen and his brother Harald Pedersen to build the machines for insulin production. However, Thorvald Pedersen was fired from Nordisk and the two brothers decided to try to manufacture insulin themselves. Thorvald and Harald Pedersen managed to produce a stable liquid insulin and marketed Insulin Novo in 1925. The brothers named their firm Novo Terapeutisk Laboratorium. Over the next decades the products were further improved, e.g., with focus on longer effect; nevertheless, there were still challenges to be met, and in the 1970s the new goal was to produce human insulin meaning that Novo would no longer depend on animal pancreases. In 1982, Novo succeeded and launched the world’s first insulin preparation identical to human insulin.
Nordisk marketed a genetically engineered human growth hormone in 1988 and Novo Nordisk is market leading in the world today in this area and introduced the world’s first liquid growth hormone in a pen system in 1999.
In 1989, Novo Industri A/S (Novo Terapeutisk Laboratorium) and Nordisk Gentofte A/S (Nordisk Insulinlaboratorium) merged to become Novo Nordisk A/S, the world's largest producer of insulin with headquarters in Bagsværd, Copenhagen. In 2000 the company demerged into NovoZymes A/S and Novo Nordisk A/S. Research into bleeding disorders lead to the foundation of The Novo Nordisk Haemophilia Foundation in 2005 striving to improve access to care for people with haemophilia and allied bleeding disorders.
In 2015, the company announced it would collaborate with Ablynx, using its nanobody technology to develop at least one new drug candidate.[9]
Jesper Brandgaard is the Executive Vice President and CFO of the global healthcare company Novo Nordisk A/S. Brandgaard has been the Vice Chairman of the board of directors in the Danish company SimCorp[10] since 2007.[11]
Products[edit]
Tresiba – a Diabetes mellitus type 1 and Type 2 diabetes drug. It is a new-generation basal insulin with ultra-long duration of action of more than 42 hours administered through subcutaneous injection. Intended to offer a flexible treatment and a good safety profile. It is approved and launched in the EU and Japan and under regulatory review in the US and other major markets.[1]
Saxenda – a once-daily human GLP-1 analogue. It serves as an agonist, intended for combination with lifestyle changes (including diet), to offer sustainable weight loss for people with severe obesity, including those at particular risk of developing diabetes.[1]
Ryzodeg – a drug for type 1 and 2 diabetes. Ryzodeg is a soluble co-formulation of Tresiba and NovoRapid, and is a rapid-acting mealtime insulin. It is approved to offer patients reduced risk of hypoglycemia and is currently approved in the EU and Japan. US FDA also approved Ryzodeg & Tresiba on 25 September 2015 after reviewing the interim safety data of the ongoing CV outcome trial DEVOTE .[1]
Levemir – long-acting human insulin analogue for maintaining the basal level of insulin. It is an insulin analogue in which a fatty acid (myristic acid) is bound to the lysine amino acid at position B29. It is quickly absorbed after which it binds to albumin in the blood through its fatty acid at position B29. It then slowly dissociates from this complex.
Victoza – a long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, binding to the same receptors as does the endogenous metabolic hormone GLP-1 that stimulates insulin secretion. It is an injectable drug developed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
NovoLog – a fast-acting insulin analog. It is a manufactured form of human insulin; where a single amino acid has been exchanged. This change helps the fast-acting insulin analog be absorbed quickly into the bloodstream. As a result, it starts working in minutes, which allows one to take insulin and eat right away. Fast-acting insulin analogs are considered to act similarly to the way insulin is released in people without diabetes mellitus.
Novolin N – an intermediate-acting insulin given to help control the blood sugar level of people with diabetes.
Novolin R – is primarily used to treat high blood sugar levels in conditions like diabetes mellitus.
NovoLog Mix 70/30 – is a product which contains 30% insulin aspart and 70% insulin aspart protamine. The insulin aspart protamine portion is a crystalline form of insulin aspart, which delays the action of the insulin, giving it a prolonged absorption profile after injection. The combination of the fast-acting form and the long-acting form allows the patient to receive fewer injections over the course of the day.
In addition to the development of diabetes treatment pharmaceuticals, Novo Nordisk has been involved in the production of several lines of insulin pumps/pens for efficient delivery into the body and bloodstream.
NovoEight – is a recombinant antihemophilic factor VIII used for the treatment of and prophylaxis of bleeding patients with haemophilia A.
NovoSeven – is a form of blood factor VII that has been manufactured via recombinant technology.
Collaborative research[edit]
Toxicogenomics[edit]
Novo Nordisk is involved in publicly funded collaborative research projects with other industrial and academic partners. One example in the area of non-clinical safety assessment is the InnoMed PredTox.[12][13] The company is expanding its activities in joint research projects within the framework of the Innovative Medicines Initiative of European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations and the European Commission.[14]
Diabetes[edit]
Novo Nordisk founded the World Diabetes foundation to save the lives of those affected by diabetes in developing countries and supported a UN resolution to fight diabetes, making diabetes the only other disease alongside HIV / AIDS to have a commitment to combat at a UN level.[15]
Diabetes treatments account for 85% of Novo Nordisk’s business. Novo Nordisk works with doctors, nurses, and patients, to develop products for self-managing diabetes conditions. The DAWN (Diabetes Attitudes, Wishes and Needs) 2001 study was a global survey of the psychosocial aspects of living with diabetes. It involved over 5,000 people with diabetes and almost 4,000 care providers.[16] This study was designed to identify barriers to optimal health and quality of life. A follow-up study completed in 2012 involved more than 15,000 people living with, or caring for, those with diabetes. In response to UK findings, a National Action Plan (NAP) was developed, with a multidisciplinary steering committee, to support the delivery of individualized person-centered care in the UK. The NAP seeks to provide a holistic approach to diabetes treatment for patients and their families.[17]
The i3-diabetes programme is a unique collaboration between the King's Health Partners, one of only six Academic Health Sciences Centres (AHSCs) in England, and Novo Nordisk with the aim of co-creatinga new, world-class model of patient-centred, specialist diabetes care that will meet the changing needs of people with diabetes. The programme is a five-year collaboration designed to deliver personalised care that will lead to improved outcomes for people living with diabetes, and more efficient and effective ways of caring for people with diabetes.[18][19]
Diabetes support advocacy[edit]
Novo Nordisk have sponsored the International Diabetes Federation's Unite for Diabetes campaign.[20]
In March 2014, Novo Nordisk announced a partnership program entitled ‘Cities Changing Diabetes,’ which entails combating urban diabetes. Partnership includes University College London (UCL) and supported by Steno Diabetes Center, as well as a range of local partners including healthcare professionals, city authorities, urban planners, businesses, academics and community leaders.[21]
A November 2014 newspaper article suggested that a recent medical research breakthrough at Harvard University (creating insulin-producing cells from embryonic stem cells) could potentially put Novo Nordisk out of business. Dr Alan Moses, the chief medical officer of Novo Nordisk, commented that the biology of diabetes is incredibly complex but also that Novo Nordisk's mission is to alleviate and cure diabetes. If this new medical advance "...meant the dissolution of Novo Nordisk, that'd be fine."[22]
Research and pipeline[edit]
Novo Nordisk was researching pulmonary delivery systems for diabetic medications, and in the early stages of research into autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases, using technologies such as translational immunology and monoclonal antibodies [23] In September 2014 the company announced a decision to discontinue all research in inflammatory disorders, including the discontinuation of R&D in anti-IL-20 for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.[24]
Controversy[edit]
In 2010, Novo Nordisk breached the ABPIs code of conduct by failing to provide information about side-effects of Victoza and by promoting Victoza prior to being granted market authorization.[25]
In 2013 Novo Nordisk had to pay back DKK 3.6 billion to the Danish tax authorities due to transfer mispricing.[26]
In March 2013, a debate emerged in which scientists questioned whether the incretin class of diabetes medications – the class to which Victoza belongs – had an increased risk of side effects in the pancreas such as pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. It was concluded that data currently available did not confirm these concerns.[27]
In October 2013, batches of NovoMix 30 FlexPen and Penfill insulin were recalled in some European countries as their analysis had shown that a small percentage of the products in these batches did not meet the specifications for insulin strength.[28]
Sponsorship[edit]

Novo Nordisk has sponsored sportsmen with diabetes, such as Charlie Kimball in auto racing and Team Novo Nordisk in road cycling.

PLAINSBORO, N.J., Nov. 21, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Novo Nordisk, a world leader in diabetes care, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the New Drug Application for Xultophy® 100/3.6 (insulin degludec 100 units/mL and liraglutide 3.6 mg/mL injection). Xultophy® 100/3.6 is a once-daily, combination of Tresiba® (insulin degludec injection) and Victoza® (liraglutide) injection indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on less than 50 units of basal insulin daily or less than or equal to 1.8 mg of liraglutide daily.1 Xultophy® 100/3.6 enters into a new class of diabetes treatments that combine a basal insulin and a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) in a single, once-daily injection.
"Novo Nordisk is committed to discovering and developing new medicines, like Xultophy® 100/3.6, that may make a difference in the way some adults with type 2 diabetes manage their diabetes and achieve their treatment goals," said Jakob Riis, executive vice president and head of North America Operations, Novo Nordisk A/S. "Combining Tresiba® and Victoza® into a single injection will offer patients a new option that may help control their blood sugar. We look forward to making Xultophy® 100/3.6 available to adults with type 2 diabetes in the first half of 2017."                                    
The approval of Xultophy® 100/3.6 is based on efficacy and safety data from the DUAL™ (Dual Action of Liraglutide and Insulin Degludec in Type 2 Diabetes) clinical development program. In three DUAL™ trials involving 1,393 adults with type 2 diabetes, patients who were inadequately controlled on liraglutide or basal insulin therapy and switched to Xultophy® 100/3.6 achieved reductions in A1C.2,3 For adults uncontrolled on basal insulin, Xultophy® 100/3.6 demonstrated significant reductions in A1C from baseline of 1.67% and 1.94%.2,4 The most common adverse events seen during the DUAL™ clinical development program included nasopharyngitis, headache, nausea, diarrhea, increased lipase, and upper respiratory tract infection.2,4
Please see next page for Important Safety Information.
Novo Nordisk expects to launch Xultophy® 100/3.6 (insulin degludec and liraglutide injection) in the U.S. in the first half of 2017. Novo Nordisk will work diligently to secure access for Xultophy® 100/3.6 on health plans nationwide and is committed to ensuring that Xultophy® 100/3.6 is accessible and affordable for all appropriate patients. Novo Nordisk will also offer a savings card that will allow eligible patients with commercial insurance to reduce their co-pay.
"I am excited for this new class of type 2 diabetes medication that can offer patients another treatment option to help them reach their goals," said Professor John Buse, M.D., University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, NC, and principal investigator for DUAL™ II. According to Buse, in the clinical development program, Xultophy® 100/3.6 showed improved glycemic control in patients who were uncontrolled on either liraglutide or basal insulin therapy.
Xultophy® 100/3.6 is administered as a once-daily injection from a prefilled pen and can be taken with or without food. Each Xultophy® 100/3.6 dosage unit contains one unit of insulin degludec and 0.036 mg of liraglutide.1 The starting dose of Xultophy® 100/3.6 is 16 units (16 units insulin degludec and 0.58 mg liraglutide).1 The maximum dose of 50 units of Xultophy® 100/3.6 corresponds to 50 units of insulin degludec and 1.8 mg of liraglutide.1

Novo Nordisk is initiating a recall of insulin cartridge holders used in a small number of NovoPen Echo® batches because they may crack or break if exposed to certain chemicals, like certain cleaning agents.  NovoPen Echo® is used for insulin treatment by people with diabetes. Using a device with a cracked/broken cartridge holder may result in the device delivering a reduced dose of insulin which could potentially lead to high blood sugar. Novo Nordisk believes the risk of experiencing high blood sugar when using a device with an affected cartridge holder is low. The warning signs of high blood sugar (also known as hyperglycemia) typically appear gradually and might include flushed, dry skin; feeling sleepy or tired; dry mouth, fruity (acetone) breath; urinating more often, feeling thirsty; losing your appetite, feeling or being sick (nausea or vomiting). Patients using an affected pen may want to check their blood sugar level more frequently until receiving a new cartridge holder.  Patients should contact their health care provider if they believe they’re experiencing hyperglycemia.The affected batches were distributed between 8/1/2016 – 6/22/2017 to distributors, sales representatives and replacement programs for further distribution to pharmacies, healthcare providers and patients nationwide.Novo Nordisk is notifying distributors, pharmacies, healthcare professionals and patients by mail and is arranging for product replacement.  Replacement cartridge holders will be provided for NovoPen Echo® from the following batches:U.S. batch numbersEVG1221EVG1226FVG7149FVG7458FVG8134FVG8135If patients are in possession of a NovoPen Echo® device with a batch number which is not mentioned above, there is no reason for concern and they can be confident that the pen will work as intended.Novo Nordisk has received numerous complaints of damaged cartridge holders and has received some reports of adverse events to date.Novo Nordisk has corrected this problem and has determined no other component of the pen is affected.Novo Nordisk is committed to delivering high-quality products and sincerely apologizes to patients and health care professionals.  We are working closely with the U.S Food and Drug Administration to ensure patient safety and further minimize disruption.In the United States, people with diabetes using a NovoPen Echo® from one of the affected batches listed above are instructed to call Novo Nordisk at 1-855-419-8827 between 8 am and 6 pm EDT to get a replacement cartridge holder.  For questions specific to the recall, please call 1-855-419-8827.  If you have any other general questions or concerns, please contact Novo Nordisk Customer Care at 1-800-727-6500, Monday-Friday, 8:30 am – 6 pm EDT.Adverse reactions or quality problems experienced with the use of this product may be reported to the FDA's MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program either online, by regular mail or by fax.Complete and submit the report Online: www.fda.gov/medwatch/report.htmRegular Mail or Fax: Download form www.fda.gov/MedWatch/getforms.htm orcall 1-800-332-1088 to request a reporting form, then complete and return to the address on the pre-addressed form, or submit by fax to 1-800-FDA-0178.About Novo NordiskNovo Nordisk is a global healthcare company with more than 90 years of innovation and leadership in diabetes care.

History[edit]
Behind Novo Nordisk lies a story about two Danish firms - Nordisk Insulinlaboratorium and Novo Terapeutisk Laboratorium. Nordisk Insulinlaboratorium was founded by Hans Christian Hagedorn, August Krogh and August Kongsted in 1923 in Copenhagen.
In 1922, August Krogh and his wife Marie Krogh travelled to the US. The couple had heard reports of people with diabetes being treated with insulin – a hormone discovered in 1921 by two Canadians, Frederick Banting and Charles Best. Marie Krogh was a doctor herself and also had type 2 diabetes. The couple returned to Denmark with permission to manufacture and sell insulin in Scandinavia. With the economic help from August Kongsted – the owner of Leo Pharmaceutical Products - Insulin Leo was marketed in 1923.
When Krogh and Hagedorn started manufacturing insulin, they hired Thorvald Pedersen and his brother Harald Pedersen to build the machines for insulin production. However, Thorvald Pedersen was fired from Nordisk and the two brothers decided to try to manufacture insulin themselves. Thorvald and Harald Pedersen managed to produce a stable liquid insulin and marketed Insulin Novo in 1925. The brothers named their firm Novo Terapeutisk Laboratorium. Over the next decades the products were further improved, e.g., with focus on longer effect; nevertheless, there were still challenges to be met, and in the 1970s the new goal was to produce human insulin meaning that Novo would no longer depend on animal pancreases. In 1982, Novo succeeded and launched the world’s first insulin preparation identical to human insulin.
Nordisk marketed a genetically engineered human growth hormone in 1988 and Novo Nordisk is market leading in the world today in this area and introduced the world’s first liquid growth hormone in a pen system in 1999.
In 1989, Novo Industri A/S (Novo Terapeutisk Laboratorium) and Nordisk Gentofte A/S (Nordisk Insulinlaboratorium) merged to become Novo Nordisk A/S, the world's largest producer of insulin with headquarters in Bagsværd, Copenhagen. In 2000 the company demerged into NovoZymes A/S and Novo Nordisk A/S. Research into bleeding disorders lead to the foundation of The Novo Nordisk Haemophilia Foundation in 2005 striving to improve access to care for people with haemophilia and allied bleeding disorders.
In 2015, the company announced it would collaborate with Ablynx, using its nanobody technology to develop at least one new drug candidate.[9]
Jesper Brandgaard is the Executive Vice President and CFO of the global healthcare company Novo Nordisk A/S. Brandgaard has been the Vice Chairman of the board of directors in the Danish company SimCorp[10] since 2007.[11]
Products[edit]
Tresiba – a Diabetes mellitus type 1 and Type 2 diabetes drug. It is a new-generation basal insulin with ultra-long duration of action of more than 42 hours administered through subcutaneous injection. Intended to offer a flexible treatment and a good safety profile. It is approved and launched in the EU and Japan and under regulatory review in the US and other major markets.[1]
Saxenda – a once-daily human GLP-1 analogue. It serves as an agonist, intended for combination with lifestyle changes (including diet), to offer sustainable weight loss for people with severe obesity, including those at particular risk of developing diabetes.[1]
Ryzodeg – a drug for type 1 and 2 diabetes. Ryzodeg is a soluble co-formulation of Tresiba and NovoRapid, and is a rapid-acting mealtime insulin. It is approved to offer patients reduced risk of hypoglycemia and is currently approved in the EU and Japan. US FDA also approved Ryzodeg & Tresiba on 25 September 2015 after reviewing the interim safety data of the ongoing CV outcome trial DEVOTE .[1]
Levemir – long-acting human insulin analogue for maintaining the basal level of insulin. It is an insulin analogue in which a fatty acid (myristic acid) is bound to the lysine amino acid at position B29. It is quickly absorbed after which it binds to albumin in the blood through its fatty acid at position B29. It then slowly dissociates from this complex.
Victoza – a long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, binding to the same receptors as does the endogenous metabolic hormone GLP-1 that stimulates insulin secretion. It is an injectable drug developed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
NovoLog – a fast-acting insulin analog. It is a manufactured form of human insulin; where a single amino acid has been exchanged. This change helps the fast-acting insulin analog be absorbed quickly into the bloodstream. As a result, it starts working in minutes, which allows one to take insulin and eat right away. Fast-acting insulin analogs are considered to act similarly to the way insulin is released in people without diabetes mellitus.
Novolin N – an intermediate-acting insulin given to help control the blood sugar level of people with diabetes.
Novolin R – is primarily used to treat high blood sugar levels in conditions like diabetes mellitus.
NovoLog Mix 70/30 – is a product which contains 30% insulin aspart and 70% insulin aspart protamine. The insulin aspart protamine portion is a crystalline form of insulin aspart, which delays the action of the insulin, giving it a prolonged absorption profile after injection. The combination of the fast-acting form and the long-acting form allows the patient to receive fewer injections over the course of the day.
In addition to the development of diabetes treatment pharmaceuticals, Novo Nordisk has been involved in the production of several lines of insulin pumps/pens for efficient delivery into the body and bloodstream.
NovoEight – is a recombinant antihemophilic factor VIII used for the treatment of and prophylaxis of bleeding patients with haemophilia A.
NovoSeven – is a form of blood factor VII that has been manufactured via recombinant technology.
Collaborative research[edit]
Toxicogenomics[edit]
Novo Nordisk is involved in publicly funded collaborative research projects with other industrial and academic partners. One example in the area of non-clinical safety assessment is the InnoMed PredTox.[12][13] The company is expanding its activities in joint research projects within the framework of the Innovative Medicines Initiative of European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations and the European Commission.[14]
Diabetes[edit]
Novo Nordisk founded the World Diabetes foundation to save the lives of those affected by diabetes in developing countries and supported a UN resolution to fight diabetes, making diabetes the only other disease alongside HIV / AIDS to have a commitment to combat at a UN level.[15]
Diabetes treatments account for 85% of Novo Nordisk’s business. Novo Nordisk works with doctors, nurses, and patients, to develop products for self-managing diabetes conditions. The DAWN (Diabetes Attitudes, Wishes and Needs) 2001 study was a global survey of the psychosocial aspects of living with diabetes. It involved over 5,000 people with diabetes and almost 4,000 care providers.[16] This study was designed to identify barriers to optimal health and quality of life. A follow-up study completed in 2012 involved more than 15,000 people living with, or caring for, those with diabetes. In response to UK findings, a National Action Plan (NAP) was developed, with a multidisciplinary steering committee, to support the delivery of individualized person-centered care in the UK. The NAP seeks to provide a holistic approach to diabetes treatment for patients and their families.[17]
The i3-diabetes programme is a unique collaboration between the King's Health Partners, one of only six Academic Health Sciences Centres (AHSCs) in England, and Novo Nordisk with the aim of co-creatinga new, world-class model of patient-centred, specialist diabetes care that will meet the changing needs of people with diabetes. The programme is a five-year collaboration designed to deliver personalised care that will lead to improved outcomes for people living with diabetes, and more efficient and effective ways of caring for people with diabetes.[18][19]
Diabetes support advocacy[edit]
Novo Nordisk have sponsored the International Diabetes Federation's Unite for Diabetes campaign.[20]
In March 2014, Novo Nordisk announced a partnership program entitled ‘Cities Changing Diabetes,’ which entails combating urban diabetes. Partnership includes University College London (UCL) and supported by Steno Diabetes Center, as well as a range of local partners including healthcare professionals, city authorities, urban planners, businesses, academics and community leaders.[21]
A November 2014 newspaper article suggested that a recent medical research breakthrough at Harvard University (creating insulin-producing cells from embryonic stem cells) could potentially put Novo Nordisk out of business. Dr Alan Moses, the chief medical officer of Novo Nordisk, commented that the biology of diabetes is incredibly complex but also that Novo Nordisk's mission is to alleviate and cure diabetes. If this new medical advance "...meant the dissolution of Novo Nordisk, that'd be fine."[22]
Research and pipeline[edit]
Novo Nordisk was researching pulmonary delivery systems for diabetic medications, and in the early stages of research into autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases, using technologies such as translational immunology and monoclonal antibodies [23] In September 2014 the company announced a decision to discontinue all research in inflammatory disorders, including the discontinuation of R&D in anti-IL-20 for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.[24]
Controversy[edit]
In 2010, Novo Nordisk breached the ABPIs code of conduct by failing to provide information about side-effects of Victoza and by promoting Victoza prior to being granted market authorization.[25]
In 2013 Novo Nordisk had to pay back DKK 3.6 billion to the Danish tax authorities due to transfer mispricing.[26]
In March 2013, a debate emerged in which scientists questioned whether the incretin class of diabetes medications – the class to which Victoza belongs – had an increased risk of side effects in the pancreas such as pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. It was concluded that data currently available did not confirm these concerns.[27]
In October 2013, batches of NovoMix 30 FlexPen and Penfill insulin were recalled in some European countries as their analysis had shown that a small percentage of the products in these batches did not meet the specifications for insulin strength.[28]
Sponsorship[edit]




Charlie Kimball at the 2015 Indianapolis 500


Novo Nordisk has sponsored sportsmen with diabetes, such as Charlie Kimball in auto racing and Team Novo Nordisk in road cycling.

History[edit]
Behind Novo Nordisk lies a story about two Danish firms - Nordisk Insulinlaboratorium and Novo Terapeutisk Laboratorium. Nordisk Insulinlaboratorium was founded by Hans Christian Hagedorn, August Krogh and August Kongsted in 1923 in Copenhagen.
In 1922, August Krogh and his wife Marie Krogh travelled to the US. The couple had heard reports of people with diabetes being treated with insulin – a hormone discovered in 1921 by two Canadians, Frederick Banting and Charles Best. Marie Krogh was a doctor herself and also had type 2 diabetes. The couple returned to Denmark with permission to manufacture and sell insulin in Scandinavia. With the economic help from August Kongsted – the owner of Leo Pharmaceutical Products - Insulin Leo was marketed in 1923.
When Krogh and Hagedorn started manufacturing insulin, they hired Thorvald Pedersen and his brother Harald Pedersen to build the machines for insulin production. However, Thorvald Pedersen was fired from Nordisk and the two brothers decided to try to manufacture insulin themselves. Thorvald and Harald Pedersen managed to produce a stable liquid insulin and marketed Insulin Novo in 1925. The brothers named their firm Novo Terapeutisk Laboratorium. Over the next decades the products were further improved, e.g., with focus on longer effect; nevertheless, there were still challenges to be met, and in the 1970s the new goal was to produce human insulin meaning that Novo would no longer depend on animal pancreases. In 1982, Novo succeeded and launched the world’s first insulin preparation identical to human insulin.
Nordisk marketed a genetically engineered human growth hormone in 1988 and Novo Nordisk is market leading in the world today in this area and introduced the world’s first liquid growth hormone in a pen system in 1999.
In 1989, Novo Industri A/S (Novo Terapeutisk Laboratorium) and Nordisk Gentofte A/S (Nordisk Insulinlaboratorium) merged to become Novo Nordisk A/S, the world's largest producer of insulin with headquarters in Bagsværd, Copenhagen. In 2000 the company demerged into NovoZymes A/S and Novo Nordisk A/S. Research into bleeding disorders lead to the foundation of The Novo Nordisk Haemophilia Foundation in 2005 striving to improve access to care for people with haemophilia and allied bleeding disorders.
In 2015, the company announced it would collaborate with Ablynx, using its nanobody technology to develop at least one new drug candidate.[9]
Jesper Brandgaard is the Executive Vice President and CFO of the global healthcare company Novo Nordisk A/S. Brandgaard has been the Vice Chairman of the board of directors in the Danish company SimCorp[10] since 2007.[11]
Products[edit]
Tresiba – a Diabetes mellitus type 1 and Type 2 diabetes drug. It is a new-generation basal insulin with ultra-long duration of action of more than 42 hours administered through subcutaneous injection. Intended to offer a flexible treatment and a good safety profile. It is approved and launched in the EU and Japan and under regulatory review in the US and other major markets.[1]
Saxenda – a once-daily human GLP-1 analogue. It serves as an agonist, intended for combination with lifestyle changes (including diet), to offer sustainable weight loss for people with severe obesity, including those at particular risk of developing diabetes.[1]
Ryzodeg – a drug for type 1 and 2 diabetes. Ryzodeg is a soluble co-formulation of Tresiba and NovoRapid, and is a rapid-acting mealtime insulin. It is approved to offer patients reduced risk of hypoglycemia and is currently approved in the EU and Japan. US FDA also approved Ryzodeg & Tresiba on 25 September 2015 after reviewing the interim safety data of the ongoing CV outcome trial DEVOTE .[1]
Levemir – long-acting human insulin analogue for maintaining the basal level of insulin. It is an insulin analogue in which a fatty acid (myristic acid) is bound to the lysine amino acid at position B29. It is quickly absorbed after which it binds to albumin in the blood through its fatty acid at position B29. It then slowly dissociates from this complex.
Victoza – a long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, binding to the same receptors as does the endogenous metabolic hormone GLP-1 that stimulates insulin secretion. It is an injectable drug developed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
NovoLog – a fast-acting insulin analog. It is a manufactured form of human insulin; where a single amino acid has been exchanged. This change helps the fast-acting insulin analog be absorbed quickly into the bloodstream. As a result, it starts working in minutes, which allows one to take insulin and eat right away. Fast-acting insulin analogs are considered to act similarly to the way insulin is released in people without diabetes mellitus.
Novolin N – an intermediate-acting insulin given to help control the blood sugar level of people with diabetes.
Novolin R – is primarily used to treat high blood sugar levels in conditions like diabetes mellitus.
NovoLog Mix 70/30 – is a product which contains 30% insulin aspart and 70% insulin aspart protamine. The insulin aspart protamine portion is a crystalline form of insulin aspart, which delays the action of the insulin, giving it a prolonged absorption profile after injection. The combination of the fast-acting form and the long-acting form allows the patient to receive fewer injections over the course of the day.
In addition to the development of diabetes treatment pharmaceuticals, Novo Nordisk has been involved in the production of several lines of insulin pumps/pens for efficient delivery into the body and bloodstream.
NovoEight – is a recombinant antihemophilic factor VIII used for the treatment of and prophylaxis of bleeding patients with haemophilia A.
NovoSeven – is a form of blood factor VII that has been manufactured via recombinant technology.
Collaborative research[edit]
Toxicogenomics[edit]
Novo Nordisk is involved in publicly funded collaborative research projects with other industrial and academic partners. One example in the area of non-clinical safety assessment is the InnoMed PredTox.[12][13] The company is expanding its activities in joint research projects within the framework of the Innovative Medicines Initiative of European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations and the European Commission.[14]
Diabetes[edit]
Novo Nordisk founded the World Diabetes foundation to save the lives of those affected by diabetes in developing countries and supported a UN resolution to fight diabetes, making diabetes the only other disease alongside HIV / AIDS to have a commitment to combat at a UN level.[15]
Diabetes treatments account for 85% of Novo Nordisk’s business. Novo Nordisk works with doctors, nurses, and patients, to develop products for self-managing diabetes conditions. The DAWN (Diabetes Attitudes, Wishes and Needs) 2001 study was a global survey of the psychosocial aspects of living with diabetes. It involved over 5,000 people with diabetes and almost 4,000 care providers.[16] This study was designed to identify barriers to optimal health and quality of life. A follow-up study completed in 2012 involved more than 15,000 people living with, or caring for, those with diabetes. In response to UK findings, a National Action Plan (NAP) was developed, with a multidisciplinary steering committee, to support the delivery of individualized person-centered care in the UK. The NAP seeks to provide a holistic approach to diabetes treatment for patients and their families.[17]
The i3-diabetes programme is a unique collaboration between the King's Health Partners, one of only six Academic Health Sciences Centres (AHSCs) in England, and Novo Nordisk with the aim of co-creatinga new, world-class model of patient-centred, specialist diabetes care that will meet the changing needs of people with diabetes. The programme is a five-year collaboration designed to deliver personalised care that will lead to improved outcomes for people living with diabetes, and more efficient and effective ways of caring for people with diabetes.[18][19]
Diabetes support advocacy[edit]
Novo Nordisk have sponsored the International Diabetes Federation's Unite for Diabetes campaign.[20]
In March 2014, Novo Nordisk announced a partnership program entitled ‘Cities Changing Diabetes,’ which entails combating urban diabetes. Partnership includes University College London (UCL) and supported by Steno Diabetes Center, as well as a range of local partners including healthcare professionals, city authorities, urban planners, businesses, academics and community leaders.[21]
A November 2014 newspaper article suggested that a recent medical research breakthrough at Harvard University (creating insulin-producing cells from embryonic stem cells) could potentially put Novo Nordisk out of business. Dr Alan Moses, the chief medical officer of Novo Nordisk, commented that the biology of diabetes is incredibly complex but also that Novo Nordisk's mission is to alleviate and cure diabetes. If this new medical advance "...meant the dissolution of Novo Nordisk, that'd be fine."[22]
Research and pipeline[edit]
Novo Nordisk was researching pulmonary delivery systems for diabetic medications, and in the early stages of research into autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases, using technologies such as translational immunology and monoclonal antibodies [23] In September 2014 the company announced a decision to discontinue all research in inflammatory disorders, including the discontinuation of R&D in anti-IL-20 for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.[24]
Controversy[edit]
In 2010, Novo Nordisk breached the ABPIs code of conduct by failing to provide information about side-effects of Victoza and by promoting Victoza prior to being granted market authorization.[25]
In 2013 Novo Nordisk had to pay back DKK 3.6 billion to the Danish tax authorities due to transfer mispricing.[26]
In March 2013, a debate emerged in which scientists questioned whether the incretin class of diabetes medications – the class to which Victoza belongs – had an increased risk of side effects in the pancreas such as pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. It was concluded that data currently available did not confirm these concerns.[27]
In October 2013, batches of NovoMix 30 FlexPen and Penfill insulin were recalled in some European countries as their analysis had shown that a small percentage of the products in these batches did not meet the specifications for insulin strength.[28]
Sponsorship[edit]




Charlie Kimball at the 2015 Indianapolis 500


Novo Nordisk has sponsored sportsmen with diabetes, such as Charlie Kimball in auto racing and Team Novo Nordisk in road cycling.

History[edit]
Behind Novo Nordisk lies a story about two Danish firms - Nordisk Insulinlaboratorium and Novo Terapeutisk Laboratorium. Nordisk Insulinlaboratorium was founded by Hans Christian Hagedorn, August Krogh and August Kongsted in 1923 in Copenhagen.
In 1922, August Krogh and his wife Marie Krogh travelled to the US. The couple had heard reports of people with diabetes being treated with insulin – a hormone discovered in 1921 by two Canadians, Frederick Banting and Charles Best. Marie Krogh was a doctor herself and also had type 2 diabetes. The couple returned to Denmark with permission to manufacture and sell insulin in Scandinavia. With the economic help from August Kongsted – the owner of Leo Pharmaceutical Products - Insulin Leo was marketed in 1923.
When Krogh and Hagedorn started manufacturing insulin, they hired Thorvald Pedersen and his brother Harald Pedersen to build the machines for insulin production. However, Thorvald Pedersen was fired from Nordisk and the two brothers decided to try to manufacture insulin themselves. Thorvald and Harald Pedersen managed to produce a stable liquid insulin and marketed Insulin Novo in 1925. The brothers named their firm Novo Terapeutisk Laboratorium. Over the next decades the products were further improved, e.g., with focus on longer effect; nevertheless, there were still challenges to be met, and in the 1970s the new goal was to produce human insulin meaning that Novo would no longer depend on animal pancreases. In 1982, Novo succeeded and launched the world’s first insulin preparation identical to human insulin.
Nordisk marketed a genetically engineered human growth hormone in 1988 and Novo Nordisk is market leading in the world today in this area and introduced the world’s first liquid growth hormone in a pen system in 1999.
In 1989, Novo Industri A/S (Novo Terapeutisk Laboratorium) and Nordisk Gentofte A/S (Nordisk Insulinlaboratorium) merged to become Novo Nordisk A/S, the world's largest producer of insulin with headquarters in Bagsværd, Copenhagen. In 2000 the company demerged into NovoZymes A/S and Novo Nordisk A/S. Research into bleeding disorders lead to the foundation of The Novo Nordisk Haemophilia Foundation in 2005 striving to improve access to care for people with haemophilia and allied bleeding disorders.
In 2015, the company announced it would collaborate with Ablynx, using its nanobody technology to develop at least one new drug candidate.[9]
Jesper Brandgaard is the Executive Vice President and CFO of the global healthcare company Novo Nordisk A/S. Brandgaard has been the Vice Chairman of the board of directors in the Danish company SimCorp[10] since 2007.[11]
Products[edit]
Tresiba – a Diabetes mellitus type 1 and Type 2 diabetes drug. It is a new-generation basal insulin with ultra-long duration of action of more than 42 hours administered through subcutaneous injection. Intended to offer a flexible treatment and a good safety profile. It is approved and launched in the EU and Japan and under regulatory review in the US and other major markets.[1]
Saxenda – a once-daily human GLP-1 analogue. It serves as an agonist, intended for combination with lifestyle changes (including diet), to offer sustainable weight loss for people with severe obesity, including those at particular risk of developing diabetes.[1]
Ryzodeg – a drug for type 1 and 2 diabetes. Ryzodeg is a soluble co-formulation of Tresiba and NovoRapid, and is a rapid-acting mealtime insulin. It is approved to offer patients reduced risk of hypoglycemia and is currently approved in the EU and Japan. US FDA also approved Ryzodeg & Tresiba on 25 September 2015 after reviewing the interim safety data of the ongoing CV outcome trial DEVOTE .[1]
Levemir – long-acting human insulin analogue for maintaining the basal level of insulin. It is an insulin analogue in which a fatty acid (myristic acid) is bound to the lysine amino acid at position B29. It is quickly absorbed after which it binds to albumin in the blood through its fatty acid at position B29. It then slowly dissociates from this complex.
Victoza – a long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, binding to the same receptors as does the endogenous metabolic hormone GLP-1 that stimulates insulin secretion. It is an injectable drug developed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
NovoLog – a fast-acting insulin analog. It is a manufactured form of human insulin; where a single amino acid has been exchanged. This change helps the fast-acting insulin analog be absorbed quickly into the bloodstream. As a result, it starts working in minutes, which allows one to take insulin and eat right away. Fast-acting insulin analogs are considered to act similarly to the way insulin is released in people without diabetes mellitus.
Novolin N – an intermediate-acting insulin given to help control the blood sugar level of people with diabetes.
Novolin R – is primarily used to treat high blood sugar levels in conditions like diabetes mellitus.
NovoLog Mix 70/30 – is a product which contains 30% insulin aspart and 70% insulin aspart protamine. The insulin aspart protamine portion is a crystalline form of insulin aspart, which delays the action of the insulin, giving it a prolonged absorption profile after injection. The combination of the fast-acting form and the long-acting form allows the patient to receive fewer injections over the course of the day.
In addition to the development of diabetes treatment pharmaceuticals, Novo Nordisk has been involved in the production of several lines of insulin pumps/pens for efficient delivery into the body and bloodstream.
NovoEight – is a recombinant antihemophilic factor VIII used for the treatment of and prophylaxis of bleeding patients with haemophilia A.
NovoSeven – is a form of blood factor VII that has been manufactured via recombinant technology.
Collaborative research[edit]
Toxicogenomics[edit]
Novo Nordisk is involved in publicly funded collaborative research projects with other industrial and academic partners. One example in the area of non-clinical safety assessment is the InnoMed PredTox.[12][13] The company is expanding its activities in joint research projects within the framework of the Innovative Medicines Initiative of European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations and the European Commission.[14]
Diabetes[edit]
Novo Nordisk founded the World Diabetes foundation to save the lives of those affected by diabetes in developing countries and supported a UN resolution to fight diabetes, making diabetes the only other disease alongside HIV / AIDS to have a commitment to combat at a UN level.[15]
Diabetes treatments account for 85% of Novo Nordisk’s business. Novo Nordisk works with doctors, nurses, and patients, to develop products for self-managing diabetes conditions. The DAWN (Diabetes Attitudes, Wishes and Needs) 2001 study was a global survey of the psychosocial aspects of living with diabetes. It involved over 5,000 people with diabetes and almost 4,000 care providers.[16] This study was designed to identify barriers to optimal health and quality of life. A follow-up study completed in 2012 involved more than 15,000 people living with, or caring for, those with diabetes. In response to UK findings, a National Action Plan (NAP) was developed, with a multidisciplinary steering committee, to support the delivery of individualized person-centered care in the UK. The NAP seeks to provide a holistic approach to diabetes treatment for patients and their families.[17]
The i3-diabetes programme is a unique collaboration between the King's Health Partners, one of only six Academic Health Sciences Centres (AHSCs) in England, and Novo Nordisk with the aim of co-creatinga new, world-class model of patient-centred, specialist diabetes care that will meet the changing needs of people with diabetes. The programme is a five-year collaboration designed to deliver personalised care that will lead to improved outcomes for people living with diabetes, and more efficient and effective ways of caring for people with diabetes.[18][19]
Diabetes support advocacy[edit]
Novo Nordisk have sponsored the International Diabetes Federation's Unite for Diabetes campaign.[20]
In March 2014, Novo Nordisk announced a partnership program entitled ‘Cities Changing Diabetes,’ which entails combating urban diabetes. Partnership includes University College London (UCL) and supported by Steno Diabetes Center, as well as a range of local partners including healthcare professionals, city authorities, urban planners, businesses, academics and community leaders.[21]
A November 2014 newspaper article suggested that a recent medical research breakthrough at Harvard University (creating insulin-producing cells from embryonic stem cells) could potentially put Novo Nordisk out of business. Dr Alan Moses, the chief medical officer of Novo Nordisk, commented that the biology of diabetes is incredibly complex but also that Novo Nordisk's mission is to alleviate and cure diabetes. If this new medical advance "...meant the dissolution of Novo Nordisk, that'd be fine."[22]
Research and pipeline[edit]
Novo Nordisk was researching pulmonary delivery systems for diabetic medications, and in the early stages of research into autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases, using technologies such as translational immunology and monoclonal antibodies [23] In September 2014 the company announced a decision to discontinue all research in inflammatory disorders, including the discontinuation of R&D in anti-IL-20 for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.[24]
Controversy[edit]
In 2010, Novo Nordisk breached the ABPIs code of conduct by failing to provide information about side-effects of Victoza and by promoting Victoza prior to being granted market authorization.[25]
In 2013 Novo Nordisk had to pay back DKK 3.6 billion to the Danish tax authorities due to transfer mispricing.[26]
In March 2013, a debate emerged in which scientists questioned whether the incretin class of diabetes medications – the class to which Victoza belongs – had an increased risk of side effects in the pancreas such as pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. It was concluded that data currently available did not confirm these concerns.[27]
In October 2013, batches of NovoMix 30 FlexPen and Penfill insulin were recalled in some European countries as their analysis had shown that a small percentage of the products in these batches did not meet the specifications for insulin strength.[28]
Sponsorship[edit]

Novo Nordisk has sponsored sportsmen with diabetes, such as Charlie Kimball in auto racing and Team Novo Nordisk in road cycling.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.
