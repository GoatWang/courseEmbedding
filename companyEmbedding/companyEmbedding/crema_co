As consumers have developed a greater appreciation for specialty coffee on the whole, coffee in the office workplace has become an important amenity for employees, as well as an important signifier of a progressive business culture. Even the Wall Street Journal has taken notice of the growing trend among corporations installing barista-staffed, in-office mini cafes in addition to break rooms.
For the more traditional, DIY office coffee arrangements, the process of ordering beans through catering or office supply distributors is not unlike the sort of online coffee subscription services that have proliferated in recent years through third parties or directly through roasting companies — although the pitch from coffee-focused services is, of course, better coffee.
Yet, to this point, standalone subscription services have tended to aim directly toward consumers, and few have made concerted, innovative efforts in the office segment. Meanwhile, office managers often remain in the precarious position of choosing the all-important coffee on behalf of the office, which can be a roll of the dice when aiming to please a motley team.

Online multiroaster subscription company Crema.co has announced the rollout of a new feature aimed at solving and streamlining the coffee dilemma in the up-to-date office: Slack integration.
“The Crema bot not only keeps your Slack team in the loop about events such as a new coffee delivery or upcoming shipment, but it also enables everyone in the team to rate each coffee and vote on what to get next, right from Slack,” Crema.co CEO Tyler Tate stated in a recent press release.
Slack is leading cloud-based team communication tool that functions essentially as a feature-rich chatting app, allowing for conversations to live in indexed, searchable channels where employees can interact, upload files, and connect and organize other apps. More than 900 third-party apps and services now integrate with Slack, and as of today, Crema.co is one of them.
As workers click yay or nay via the Crema.co Slack app to rate coffees as they’re consumed, the subscription service’s learning algorithm adapts subsequent recommendations to zero in on collective tastes. Team members also cast votes towards the next purchase in Slack, which is surely a step up from a convoluted email chain or a show of hands in a conference room or however else office coffee choices are made.
The Crema Slack app doesn’t handle personal, individual accounts — only office accounts — so individuals won’t find their virtual workplaces cluttered or distracted by personal coffee-ordering opportunities. Individual accounts are still dealt with in the usual way, through Crema.co’s phone/tablet app or website, where offices without Slack integration can also set up accounts.
Crema.co CEO Tyler Tate.
Options currently available through Crema.co’s service, which launched less than two years ago, include coffees from 20 different high-end roasters from across the United States. The company also donates $1 for every purchased 5-pound bag to nonprofit Food 4 Farmers, which works to improve food security in Latin American coffee-growing regions.
“The top question we’ve been hearing over and over is: ‘Could you deliver to my office too?'” Tate said. “We’re now answering that question in a big way.”

Frequently Asked Questions




The Coffee

Are the coffees roasted fresh? Who roasts them?
The beauty of Crema.co: coffees are always roasted to order by some of the best micro-roasters around the country, meaning they arrive at your doorstep just a few days after being roasted.
Is the coffee ground already, or whole bean?
Whole bean.
What coffee machines will this coffee work with?
Pretty much all of them, whether that’s a french press, aeropress, espresso, pour over, or Mr. Coffee. (We don’t do capsules or pods, though, so no Nespresso or Keurig machines.)
What size are the bags of coffee?
12oz. The same size you typically find in stores.
Are your coffees certified Fair Trade or organic? 
Some certainly are. But Crema.co goes a step further: every one of our coffees are single origin, or from just one country. We work with roasters who work directly with coffee farmers (Direct Trade) and we spend way too much time researching the impact of your purchases on the farmers we are so proud to promote. By buying coffees through Crema.co, you are part of the solution to ensure coffee growers are able to flourish.



The Subscription

Is Crema.co a monthly coffee subscription?
Only if you want. We’re a monthly, 5-day, 2-week, choose-your-own-frequency kind of coffee subscription, and you can change the frequency at any time.
Can the subscription be paused?
You bet. You can easily pause your Brewlist at any time, for as long as you want.
How much does shipping cost?
Shipping is always free within the United States.
Do you ship internationally?
Not just yet—stay tuned.
How much does each coffee cost?
Usually, coffees range from $15-19. Each roaster sets the price per coffee, so they vary a bit.
Are my credit card and personal information safe?
We use industry-standard Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption technology to safeguard your data, and your credit card and billing address information is securely transmitted to Stripe, the leading payment processor, and are never stored, collected or even processed by our servers. You can find further details in our Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy



Gifts

Can I choose the timing for the gift to be given?
Yep. You get to pick the day you want the recipient to be notified of your gift to them.
Do I pick the coffees, or does the recipient get to choose?
Your loved one chooses. That’s not to say you can’t make suggestions...
When will they get their first box?
Once they receive your gift, they’ll get to pick out coffees and activate their subscription. The first coffee will ship out a day or two after they activate, fresh from the roaster.
Will they get a gift certificate in the mail?
No. They will get a snazzy email from us sharing your personalized message and clueing them in to the magical gift they just received. No snail mail necessary.
Will anything be shipped to me?
Nope. All digital, baby!
Will my credit card keep getting charged after the gift is used up?
Now why would we do that? Seriously though, once the gift is used up, it’s gone!

Brew Perfect French Press Coffee with this Recipe - Crema.co



































































Brew List

Your Brew List is always just a click away. Got it.






















How to Brew
French Press
Coffee





The French Press is the perfect low-maintenance brew method for lazy Saturday mornings. Done right, it produces a creamy-bodied coffee. Follow this guide to brew the perfect French Press.

27g (5 Tbsp) coffee  &bullet;  400g (1.75 cups) water  &bullet;  4 minutes














Recipe Instructions
This recipe is for the 4-cup (17-oz) French Press coffee maker (also known as a "press pot"), which makes 2 small mugs of coffee. Double everything and follow the same process for the 8-cup (34-oz) version.


What you'll need

4-cup French Press
27g (5 Tbsp) coffee, coarsely ground
400g (1.75 cups) water, just off boil
Chopstick or spoon for stirring
Kitchen timer



Equipment we used

Bodum 170z French Press
Baratza Virtuoso Grinder
Hario V60 Gooseneck Kettle
Jennings CJ4000 Scale
OXO Digital Timer




French Press Coffee Ratio
Whatever size of French Press you use, a good rule of thumb is to follow a 1:15 ratio of coffee to water. So for every 1 gram of coffee, add 15 grams of water, which converts to about 3 tablespoon of coffee for every 1 cup of water. Experiment from there to find the ratio that works for your taste.


Step 1: Prepare
Preheat your press with hot water, including the plunger, then pour hot water into your cup. Meanwhile, measure 5 tablespoons or 27 grams of coffee and grind. It should have the consistency of kosher salt.







Step 2: Add coffee
Tip your coffee into the press and give it a gentle shake to level the grounds.







Step 3: Add water
Starting the timer, add water in a circular motion, wetting all the grounds, until the press is half full. Pause and enjoy the bloom.







Step 4: Stir
30 seconds in, give the grounds a gentle stir with a chopstick or spoon.







Step 5: Add more water
Evenly pour water to the top of the press and add the lid, gently resting the plunger on the grounds. (If you're using a kitchen scale, it should come to around 400g of water altogether.)







Step 6: Plunge
Wait until your timer reads 4:00, then slowly push the plunger all the way down.







Step 7: Pour
Immediately decant the coffee to prevent over-extraction.







Step 8: Enjoy
Enjoy with friends, by yourself, or with the dog.

Tips for French Press perfection
Following the steps above should produce a delicious cup of coffee. However, the French Press can leave a bitter taste in your mouth if not brewed appropriately. Here's a few tips to avoid bitterness:

It all starts with good coffee. Buy quality whole bean coffee and grind it just before use.
Bitterness is usually a result of over-extraction. Leaving the coffee in contact with the grounds after it’s done brewing will result in over-extraction, so we recommend you decant the coffee immediately.
Uneven grinding can also contribute to bitterness: tiny pieces of ground coffee (called ‘fines’) extract faster than larger pieces. Consider using a burr grinder, if you aren’t already, or changing the burrs on your grinder if they're getting old.
Boiling-hot water can scorch the coffee and cause bitterness. The ideal temperature is around 200°, which you can achieve by bringing the water to a boil and then letting it sit one minute.

Old coffee stuck in the filter will impart unpleasant bitterness; we recommend thoroughly cleaning your French Press after each use.

Bold Bean Coffee

Bold Bean Coffee has been making history ever since Jay Burnett launched the roasting company in 2007 in Jacksonville, Florida: from opening their first retail shop in 2011, expanding to three cafes and a roastery, to winning best coffee shop in Jacksonville for several years running.
These days Jay’s son, Zack Burnett (an avid surfer who calls the beach his “third place”), drives the vision of Bold Bean, buying their green coffee (including an increasing number of direct trade relationships) and overseeing daily operations, with Jay still active behind the scenes, and head roaster Kyle Graf (pictured) presiding over a San Franciscan SF-75 roaster.
For Zack, coffee is a tool for promoting the wellbeing of others:

“I enjoy every day that we can positively affect people’s lives through the product we make and the interactions we have. These effects can stretch through the entire chain of coffee from producer to consumer. Not many jobs provide people with this opportunity, so for me, that’s pretty special.”

How to Brew
Hario V60
Coffee





Simple and elegant, the Hario V60 puts you in complete control of the brewing process, makes cleanup a breeze, and can easily be tossed into your overnight bag. Follow this guide to brew the perfect pour over.

25g (4 Tbsp) coffee  &bullet;  375g (1.5 cups) water  &bullet;  2.5 - 3 minutes














Hario V60 Instructions
While we're using the Hario V60 in this guide, the same recipe also applies to other pour-over drippers such as the Bee House Dripper, Kalita Wave, Bonmac dripper, and others.


What you'll need

Hario V60
1 paper filter
25g (4 Tbsp) coffee, medium grind
375g (1.5 cups) water, just off boil
Kitchen scale



Equipment we used

Hario V60 01 Ceramic Dripper
Hario V60 01 Coffee Filters
Baratza Virtuoso Grinder
Hario V60 Gooseneck Kettle
Jennings CJ4000 Scale




Hario V60 coffee-to-water ratio
We recommend starting with a 1:15 coffee-to-water ratio when brewing pour over coffee. So for every 1 gram of coffee, add 15 grams of water. Experiment from there to find the perfect ratio for you.


Step 1: Rinse filter
Insert filter and rinse with hot water to remove paper residue and pre-heat vessels. Discard water.







Step 2: Add coffee
Add 25 grams (about 4 tablespoons) of medium-ground coffee.







Step 3: Initial pour
Submerge the coffee in 75 grams of water, then pause for 30 seconds to let it bloom.







Step 4: Add more water
Gradually pour the remaining water in circular motions until all 375 grams have been added.







Step 5: Remove dripper
Once the coffee has finished brewing — ideally around 2:30 to 3:00 — discard the grounds.







Step 6: Enjoy
Enjoy a delicious cup of coffee.

Hario V60 Brewing Tips

Timing is important. Brewing too quickly won't fully extract the coffee grounds, making the coffee taste weak. Brewing too slowly will cause over-extraction and taste bitter. The 2:30 - 3:00 mark is just right.
To troubleshoot brew times under 2:30, try a finer grind size and pour more slowly.
To troubleshoot brew times over 3:00, try a courser grind and pour more rapidly. You can also try one circular stir around the edge to dislodge any blockages.

The ideal water temperature is around 200°, which you can achieve by bringing the water to a boil and then letting it sit for one minute. Boiling-hot water can scorch the coffee, while tepid water will under-extract.

Coffee Producing Countries





Americas




Brazil
You may be sipping your brew in the peace and safety of your own home, but the coffee world has not always been drama-free. For example, coffee came to Brazil via espionage and intrigue. 
Prior to the 1600’s, coffee cultivation was a closely guarded treasure, and the few countries possessing coffee plants were determined that other countries would not join their ranks. But as coffee became a popular beverage in Europe, the stage was set for profit, and Portugal wanted a piece of the action. Enter Francisco de Mello Palheta, Lt. Col. in the Brazilian army. In 1727, he was dispatched by his government to negotiate a border struggle with French Guiana, but his secret mission was to acquire coffee seedlings for Brazil. Story has it that upon seeing how heavily guarded the coffee plantations were, he abandoned the direct approach and instead set out to endear himself to the wife of the governor. Apparently he was successful with more than border negotiations, as she presented him with a bouquet containing cuttings from coffee plants on the eve of his departure.
He planted these in Brazil’s state of Pará, and in a relatively short time, coffee cultivation had spread spread throughout the country--so much so that by the mid 1800s, Brazil took the lead as a coffee producing country, and at its peak during the 1920s, supplied almost 80% of the world’s coffee. Although this number has dropped as other countries’ exports have grown, Brazil still supplies 30-40% of the world’s coffee. 
In Brazil, cutting-edge coffee research drives heavy production, and most coffee plantations are huge—some covering 10,000 square miles. The country’s coffee-growing terrain lends itself to mechanization, which is not the best news for specialty coffee, as mechanization of picking and processing tends to reduce the quality of the end product. Also, because much of Brazil’s coffee is grown at lower altitudes and in non-volcanic soil, these differences come out in the cup as a lack of flavor and intensity. That said, there are some stellar Brazilian offerings reaching the specialty coffee market, which we seek out for Crema.co. A great cup of coffee from Brazil carries a distinctive profile: soft, low in acidity, nutty, with bittersweet chocolate notes and distinct fruit. 


Brazil Coffee




Colombia
“100% Colombian coffee, the richest in the world.” Remember the smiling and moustachioed Juan Valdez and his mule?  At the risk of bursting a few coffee bubbles, ol’ Juan was not a real person. He was actually the clever brain-child of Colombia’s Federación Nacional de Cafeteros (FNC). More on Juan and the FNC later, but first, a bit about how coffee cultivation came to Colombia…
Stories vary, but in most cases, Catholic priests get the credit for introducing coffee seeds to Colombia ca. 1723. One tale has it that a certain Father Romero imposed upon parishioners the penance of planting coffee seeds in their backyards, and soon coffee was growing in a lot of places! What we do know for sure is that the country is rich in all the elements that make it prime coffee-growing territory: volcanic soils, lush climate, and altitude. By the 1870’s, large plantations of coffee began to change commerce in Colombia, and in 1879, the far-sighted Coffee Act (Law 29) began sponsoring coffee cultivation. Within 40 years, coffee production went from 107,000 bags a year to more than 2.4 million, making Colombia second only to Brazil as coffee exporter to the world.
Back to the FNC. Created in 1927 as a private non-profit organization designed to defend the interests of coffee producers, the FNC has been key not only in export-related fields, but also in infrastructure. Juan Valdez and his mule came along as an advertising campaign launched in the 1950’s. Hugely influential, the FNC has become a somewhat unwieldy and sometimes difficult bureaucratic entity that tends to favor coffee quantity over quality yet still has impacted the lives of many subsistence farmers positively over the years. But of course, the specialty coffee world is concerned with quality, and for us, traceability is huge. In Colombia, knowing exactly where a coffee comes from can be challenging and is made more difficult by the official Colombian grading designations. “Supremo” and “Excelso” refer not to quality but size, and sorting for size often obscures the origin of the coffees. Crema.co roasters tend to work directly with larger farmers or farm collectives, as well as with specific importers dedicated to finding and preserving quality microlots.
As a country, Colombia is no stranger to warfare: most recently FARC, a guerilla organization, has run counter to the government for 52 conflict-filled years (a recent peace treaty has yet to be ratified). But long before that, ancient cultures rose to power, flourished, then faded. Now gods and mythical animals hang out in the mountains, stone monuments to a civilization that faded circa 1320 A.D. 


Colombia Coffee




Costa Rica
Dig into Costa Rica’s past, and the sheer weight of history weaves magic over this land of mountains, valleys, coastland, verdant jungles, and often-active volcanoes. Ten thousand years and more ago, hunter-gatherers came into the area, and little by little, they began to settle, building great stone cities, creating mysterious granite spheres, crafting gold and pottery. 
The Spanish, relatively latecomers, arrived in 1502, and coffee didn’t take root in Costa Rica until the 1700s. But once it found the fertile soil, perfect elevation, and microclimates that National Geographic calls the finest coffee-growing region of the world, coffee cultivation began to shape the country. Circa 1800, the Costa Rican government began offering free land to coffee farmers, and by 1829, coffee revenues surpassed other crops. At first, beans were exported via Panama to Chile and re-labeled “Café Chileno de Valparaíso.” But England soon became the largest pre-WWII importer of Costa Rican beans, and Costa Rican coffee came into its own.  
Wealthy coffee barons rose to power mid 1800s and into the 1900s, but ultimately a more democratic form of government brought about modernization, railroads, and education for both sexes. In 1982, the Costa Rican government ruled that all coffee grown in the country must be of the Arabica variety. Though yields can be considerably less than Robusta varieties, this law has has made Costa Rica famous for coffee quality. The country is currently the 13th largest coffee producer in the world, and it is not coffee barons who turn out approximately 1.5 million bags of coffee a year--it is small farmers with an average of 5 hectares (12 acres) of land apiece, and hearts to coax the very best out of their holdings. As a result, traceability is usually readily available: most Costa Rican coffees are identified by the farm (finca) on which they are grown, the member cooperative, or beneficio where they were processed. 
The “Ticos” take pride in their land and their coffee. They have a phrase, Pura Vida, which encapsulates the optimism of the people. This multipurpose phrase is translated “pure life,” and carries with it an underlying thankfulness, along with the understanding that no matter what the situation, somewhere someone is experiencing something worse, so maybe the situation isn’t so terrible after all! In essence, no matter how much or little you have, life is short and we’re here together so—pura vida!


Costa Rica Coffee




El Salvador
Coffee looks so peaceful in the cup. Fragrant. Evocative. But its journey there has often been anything but. This is especially true of coffee from El Salvador. “El grano de oro,”--the “grain of gold”-- came to El Salvador near the end of the 1700’s, and at first was only consumed in country, a drink for the ones who grew it. But before long, the government started giving tax breaks and military exemption for coffee workers, and eliminated export duties. With these incentives, coffee soon surpassed indigo as the nation’s leading export crop. Obviously, this was good news for coffee drinkers the world over, but it set the stage for coffee barons, a class of wealthy landowning elitists who rose to power on the labor of the less priviliged.
Thus for nearly 200 years, the El Salvadorian coffee scene has been one of conflict, hardship, and economic depression. By the 1970s, the country had become the 4th largest coffee exporter on the globe, but laborers still suffered under almost non-existent wages, few rights, little recognition. Time and again, the country was ripped by civil war as plantation owners and workers clashed.
Interestingly, though coffee cultivation led to the amassing of wealth for the few, it also ultimately provided the golden ticket to reform. Fair Trade cooperatives and human rights activists began to bring change, and by the 1990s, over 78% of coffee farms were in the hands of small coffee producers. Through these cooperatives, members obtain help in production, sales, and exporting, as well as better prices for their coffee beans. Furthermore, the years of conflict inadvertently preserved the more traditional coffee cultivars, preventing replacement by higher yielding, less flavorful sun-grown hybrids.
El Salvador’s ocean-influenced climate and mild topography tends to produce softer, less acidic coffees than neighboring countries, but some very complex, deep offerings reminiscent of the finest Central American coffees are finding their way onto cupping tables. Most El Salvadorian coffee is shade grown. In addition, some farmers are cultivating a pacamara hybrid (often marketed under the name Tizapa)--large-beaned and fascinating in that it surpasses both parent varieties in cup quality.


El Salvador Coffee




Guatemala
The Guatemalan coffee grading system defines the Strictly Hard Bean (SHB) grade to include “coffee beans grown at elevations higher than 4,500 feet (1350 meters) above sea level, while the Hard Bean (HB) grade includes coffee beans grown between 4,000 feet and 5,000 feet (1300-1500 meters) above sea level.” The higher the elevation, the slower the growth and ripening, thus the denser the bean, rendering it of higher quality.


Guatemala Coffee




Honduras
Honduran growers are justifiably proud of their coffee. It was coffee that saved the nation from bankruptcy in 2009 after a political coup. In 2011, Honduras was named the largest coffee producer in Central America, 7th in the world for coffee exports in 2012, and the second-largest exporter of Arabica beans. Considering that coffee was slow to start up in this land of jungle and mountain, even more impressive.
Europeans brought coffee plants to the country in the late 1700s; the stage was set for the industry to blossom, but bananas got in the way. Yes. Strange as it seems to coffee lovers, bananas held sway as principal export crop for almost two centuries after the arrival of the first coffee plants. Over the years, various presidents attempted to promote coffee as a commodity. However, large corporations controlled the banana industry, and coffee production was mostly the realm of individual farmers. It wasn’t until the mid-1900’s that coffee cultivation became widespread in Honduras. Widespread, yes, but prices for coffee were so low that growers would often smuggle their beans across the border into Guatemala to sell at a better price. In addition, lack of infrastructure has meant that many farmers continue to process and dry their coffee themselves and mix these small lots together to sell to exporters. It sounds neighborly, but the results can be disappointing flavor-wise. 
In 1998, just as a number of coffee farmers and exporters were finding their way into the American specialty coffee market, Honduras was devastated first by hurricane Mitch, and then by the storms and floods of 1999, devastating 80% of the nation’s agriculture. Since then, new export taxes, incentives for coffee farmers, and improved roads and infrastructures have been changing the coffee industry. Cooperatives, support from the Instituto Hondureño del Café (IHCAFE), "protected origin denomination," and notoriety gained by Cup of Excellence winning coffees: all are helping to awaken the world to the excellent coffees coming out of Honduras.
Yes, Honduras has battled hardship, disasters, and violence, but coffee is helping to make a difference. In fact, there is an active program for young gang members who are caught in a round of violence and poverty. In this coffee vs. gangs program, they learn how to grow coffee, manage a farm, and carry on exporting business. The next generation of coffee growers is taking shape through family farms and programs such as this. No wonder Hondurans are proud of their coffee.


Honduras Coffee




Mexico
Coffee trees love the temperate zone, so it was only logical that some beans journeyed to Mexico from the Antilles in the closing years of the 1700s. Stories vary, but Juan Antonio García is credited with bringing coffee cultivation to the country through the port of Veracruz, while an Italian by the name of Geronimo Manchinelli helped establish coffee in the Chiapas region near the border of Guatemala.
Early on, wealthy settlers purchased large tracts of land for coffee plantations. Great news for coffee but bad for the indigenous people, many of whom ultimately ended up working on the plantations. Mexico began sharing its coffee with the world, especially to consumers in Europe, in the late 1870s. Roughly 50 years passed, along with a few laws, and in 1914, land was redistributed back to the people, who in turn used their acquired coffee-growing expertise on their own small farms. Again, good news for coffee.
INMECAFE (Instituto Mexicano del Cafe’) came on the scene in 1973 to provide technical and financial assistance to growers and to facilitate the International Coffee Agreement . With these aids, coffee production in Mexico exploded, in some rural areas increasing by nearly 900%. But then oil prices plummeted, the country began defaulting on its loans, and INMECAFE came to a grinding halt. Farmers could get no credit. Predatory coffee brokers--”coyotes”--bought coffee beans from farmers for pennies and resold at profit. Soon growers could no longer afford fertilizers, pest protection, or resources for farm management, and production dropped. Some smallholders stopped harvesting their coffee completely. Ultimately, this crisis birthed cooperatives with collective power to purchase and maintain mills, lobby for rights, and develop direct trade relationships with buyers.
These days, Mexico is the one of the largest producers of coffee in the world, and the largest coffee trade partner with the U.S. Yet of the 12 states that grow coffee, most aren’t even known by name. This is due in part to the fact that only about 10-15% of Mexico’s coffee is considered specialty grade. But with the advent of the Cup of Excellence competition, coffee farmers are taking more interest in the quality of their coffee, not just the quantity. Coffee aficionados project that we’ll be tasting a new generation of flavors in the future, and learning some new names from the Mexican coffee scene. 


Mexico Coffee




Nicaragua
It is said that in Nicaragua, everyone is considered a poet until proven otherwise. Certainly this land with its misty jungles, cloud-covered volcanoes, its mountain lakes and streams inspires poetry. But it also gives rise to great coffee. In fact, coffee is the main export from Nicaragua; 53% of the country’s agricultural jobs are in coffee production, and more than 45,000 families depend solely upon coffee for their main income. Yet it has only been cultivated here for a relatively short 200 years.
10,000 years before Columbus landed in 1492, people lived in what is now the nation of Nicaragua, creating cities, trade routes, civilizations. A mere 500 years ago, conquistadores founded their own cities, and 275 years later, coffee arrived on the scene courtesy of Catholic missionaries. Grown at first more as a curiosity than a possible cash crop, by 1870, coffee had become Nicaragua’s principal export, and for the next 100 years, coffee cultivation boomed, helped by government incentive programs and coffee cooperatives. 
But in 1979, the country became a battleground between communists and contras, and the coffee industry was caught in the crossfire. Coffee transports and workers were attacked. Mills sabotaged. Then hurricane Mitch hit in 1998, devastating agriculture. Coffee prices plummeted between 1999-2003, and to top it off, drought hit the nation. Thankfully, Nicaragua is emerging from these dark times. Democratic elections are bringing stability,  and some great things are happening in the coffee sector.
These days, most coffee is grown in three regions: Jinotega, Matagalpa, and Segovia, Predominately shade-grown, it carries a fragrant, complex profile with medium body and acidity, and hints of nut and vanilla along with citrus top notes. Many Nicaraguan farmers have never actually cupped their own coffees, but this is changing. In pursuit of a more excellent product, farmers are setting up tasting labs on site as well as improving cultivation and processing practices. 
Despite the hardships they have faced, the Nicaraguan people are “muy sympatico”--very pleasant, and they genuinely care about the quality of the coffees they grow, not just individually but for Nicaragua as a whole. As one co-op leader expressed, “...producing quality coffee, just like working to improve people’s quality of life, is the responsibilidad de Todos (responsibility of everyone).” Smallholders and their co-ops are working together to show the world that coffee from Nicaragua is something special, and they take this cooperation seriously.


Nicaragua Coffee




Panama
You might say that love brought the first coffee plants to Panama. When a retired English sea captain married a Panamanian lady circa 1800, he brought coffee seedlings with him. Before long, other colonists planted Arabica varieties in the volcanic highlands of Panama, and coffee cultivation took firm root. Many of these first coffee farmers were engineers and managers from Europe who had relocated during the construction of the Panama canal. Their extensive knowledge of agriculture and experience dealing with commerce helped establish coffee farming in Panama on a more scientific level than was the norm.
This narrow country, bordered on the north by Nicaragua and on the south by Costa Rica, is home to the highest inactive volcanoes in Central America. The altitude and the influence of both Atlantic and Pacific Oceans create microclimates which, combined with rich volcanic soils, make for perfect coffee growing conditions. Because of this, coffee seeds from all over the world have been brought here for cultivation and observation. Among these is “Geisha” (Gesha) coffee, an Ethiopian strain of Arabica with a very distinctive taste profile--floral, fruity, and highly sought after. 
Biodiversity is valued highly in Panama. Much of its coffee is grown beneath the canopy of native rainforest. Water sources and animal habitat are protected as farmers combine their traditional growing and milling practices with innovative technologies in cultivation and processing. 
Many of the seasonal workers who help with coffee harvest are of the Ngäbes (Ngobes) people who originally occupied Panama before the coming of Columbus. Since no machines can be used to harvest the ripened cherries, these skilled workers are integral to the success of the Panamanian coffee industry. They alternate between their ancestral holdings in the comarca area and the coffee farms of Costa Rica and Panama, bringing with them their culture, their art, and the expertise so key to specialty coffee production.
Panamanian growers are well-versed in coffee quality, cupping and grading their beans with confidence, and able to recommend profiles to buyers and price their coffees correctly. Growers here also have the advantage of functional infrastructure. With the Panama Canal and accessible ports, shipping is easy, and within the country, travel to farms is for the most part accomplished on excellent roads. The Best of Panama competitions and subsequent coffee auctions are drawing increased attention from international specialty coffee buyers as they come to taste and to acquire the distinctive coffees of the Panamanian highlands.


Panama Coffee




Peru
Peru is a land of mist-drenched mountains, ancient Incan ruins, and giant mysterious patterns on the plains. For thousands of years, the Moche, Nazca, and Inca people were engineers, builders, skilled metal workers, weavers, and warriors. Stories of their silver and gold eventually brought the conquistadores looking for treasure, and in due process of time, the first coffee seeds arrived.
Story has it that Dutch immigrants arriving in the northern port of Pacasmayo ca. 1740 brought with them coffee seeds/seedlings, and planted them in the Chinchao district of Huánuco province of northern Peru. It was a fortuitous event for both the country and eventually the world, because nutrient-rich soils, abundant rainfall, and ideal elevation welcomed that first coffee endeavor, and before long, cultivation spread north and south wherever conditions were favorable.
Peru had its first coffee shop as early as 1771, but it wasn’t until 1895 that it began exporting the magic bean. Here on the lush slopes of the Andes, many of the older farms and smallholders continue to cultivate the original varieties brought by the early settlers. Most farmers are of Incan descent, with Spanish as their second language. Except for the areas closer to the Pacific coast, farms tend to be hours from the nearest electricity and indoor plumbing. Winding one-track roads clinging to mountainsides, rendered perilous by rain and mud, make travel by vehicle challenging, and most farmers don’t own a vehicle anyway. 
This lack of infrastructure translates into transporting cherries to the nearest mill--often hours away--or using hand pulpers and on-site wood fermentation tanks. Farmers transport their beans to market by foot, horseback, or mule to the nearest town--anywhere from 30 minutes to a full day’s journey from the farm. For these remote areas, coffee is sold on Saturdays, after which farmers buy supplies and head back up the foot trails to their farms. Unfortunately, prices at these markets can be disappointingly low, a situation made worse in the 1970s by guerrilla activity of The Shining Path communist group which often destroyed crops and drove farmers from their lands. 
These days, about a fourth of the 100,000 small producers belong to cooperatives, which among other benefits, enables them to earn Fair Trade certification and more equal pay for their coffee. Much of Peru’s coffee is shade-grown, often organically (though most farmers can’t afford to become certified). Though in the past producers have been disconnected from the end product, many are increasingly understanding the connection between their efforts and the beverage in the cup. As this happens, their vision for quality continues to grow.

Coffee Subscription Review: Crema.co

 by  KCcoffeegeek |

Writer, consultant and coffee goddess, Emily McIntyre, was one of the first people to really help me out when I first started KCcoffeegeek.com. At the time she was working for one of my favorite coffee roasters in Portland, OR and Emily helped pave the way for me to work with a bunch of other roasters out there. Since then she and her husband have started Catalyst Coffee Consulting and she is also the director of operations for the relatively new coffee subscription service, Crema.co. Emily recently asked me to check out Crema.co and see what I think and what I found is well worth sharing with readers!
TLDR Version: Crema.co is one of the best laid-out, easy to use and functional websites I’ve seen. The shipping was great and the selection of roasters and coffees is awesome. Couldn’t ask for anything more and it’s an A+. Crema.co sets a high bar for coffee subscriptions!
It seems like these days you can’t throw a rock without hitting a coffee subscription service! Almost every roaster has some subscription option, and there is certainly no shortage of subscriptions that handle multiple roasters, too. So what, if anything, makes Crema.co stand apart from the others? Let’s find out!
Crema.co was founded by Tyler Tate, who imagined a coffee marketplace that facilitated getting great coffee into drinkers’ hands but would also tell the important story behind every coffee and farmer. With help from software engineer, Bryan Rahbein and my friend, Emily, they turned Crema.co into a Kickstarter campaign, raising over $25,000 in April 2015. After a private beta to test things out, Crema.co officially launched in December of 2015.
In full disclosure, Emily gave me a $20 credit so I could try out Crema.co without any out-of-pocket expenses, so armed with my 20 bucks I headed for the Internet! Actually, the “you have a gift” email from Emily that alerted me to the fact that I had a credit at Crema.co was the only hiccup in the whole process. I use Gmail and the email went directly into my “Promotions” tab. I don’t know why, but I almost never check my Social and Promotions tabs in Gmail (don’t even get me started about the Spam, Junk and Clutter folders on Outlook, which I have to use for work!) and so my only concern would be people missing a gift from Crema.co’s website because of this.
The Crema website has a nice, clean, modern look that will look very familiar to anyone who peruses coffee websites once in a while. The top menu is well-organized and simple, allowing you to link to coffees, roasters, or give a gift. In the upper right corner you have your login and your Brewlist, which is Crema’s way of organizing your coffees, sort of like your playlist for bean juice. If it matters, I did all my playing around on the website on a fully updated Apple Mac Mini using Safari as my browser.

Once I log in, the site takes me automatically to the page that would open if you clicked the “Coffees” link in the top menu bar. I’m able to explore coffees by roast level (light, medium, dark), geography and even certification (USDA Organic, Fair Trade Certified, Direct Trade) and, of course, the original links I mentioned that allow me to go to roasters and coffees are still live at the top of the page. The coffee selections are nicely laid out in a grid and the whole site is beautifully responsive, so as I make my browser window bigger or smaller, the photos and layout change accordingly, too. Awesome, really! Each coffee in the grid has a photo of the farmers or the farm, a clearly marked name, a few flavor descriptors, the price and size of the bag you’d get, an “add to brewlist button” and a very clear logo in the corner of who the coffee roaster is. I couldn’t ask for a cleaner interface or a better layout for this part of the site!


There are even little touches like on the above page, when I hover my mouse pointer over a coffee, the selection background darkens, and the roast level pops up under the roaster logo, just so you know which coffee you’re hovering over. The screenshot below shows what I mean, where the first coffee on the left of the screen is the one my mouse is hovering over in the photo.

Finally, on this page, coffees that have particular certifications also have special icons (two-way arrows for direct trade, USDA Organic logo for organic, and what looks like a little human for Fair Trade) so you know what, if any, certifications the coffee carries. Anything that has already been added to my Brewlist is also indicated clearly as such.

The Roasters link at the top menu bar takes you to a page of logos of all the current roasters on Crema.co. The current roaster list is awesome… Bold Bean (you know I love those guys!), Nossa Familia (whose coffee I just reviewed yesterday), Toby’s Estate, Paradise Coffee Roasters, One Village Coffee, Villa Myriam, Onyx Coffee Lab (you know I love those guys, too!) and James Coffee Co.

Clicking on a roaster opens the link to the roaster’s page within Crema.co and it is so well thought out I can hardly stand it! For an information addict like me, this is perfection! You have a nice photo of the roaster’s place, the logo, links to their website, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and any other social media outlets, location on Earth, contact info. Oh my! There is some back story on the roaster and then a quick scroll down shows you all the coffees currently available from that roaster. Want something from Onyx, but you’re not sure what all they have available through Crema right now? This is your first stop!

Now, let’s talk about this Brewlist! At least on my Mac and using Safari, when I find a coffee that looks interesting and click the “add to Brewlist” button for that coffee, a little animation shows the coffee being dragged and dropped into the little Brewlist icon in the upper right corner. Clicking the Brewlist icon causes the site to shift to the left while a sidebar opens up on the right side of the screen, revealing my current list.

There is sooooo much I like about the Brewlist view above, too. As you can see, I don’t have enough credit to get my next coffee, so my list is in suspension and I can add my preferred payment method right from here. As you would expect, I also received an email from Crema.co telling me this was happening, which is a nice reminder. You can see my list, when each coffee in the list is scheduled to ship and, also very nicely, at the bottom you see “Ship Every…” with a drop down menu for 5 days, Week, 10 days, 2 Weeks, 3 Weeks, Month. There is also a “pause” button there in the event that you want to pause your shipments. Let’s say you’ll be in Bora Bora for a couple weeks, just pause it and leave, when you’re in the airport to fly home on your private jet, just open the site, unpause and the shipments will pick up where they left off. Sweet!
In case you were wondering, yes, you can drag and drop each selection in your Brewlist to easily rearrange it, so if I decide I want James Coffee’s Honduras next instead of the Nicaragua Santa Lucila, I can just drag it to the top of the list. I can also remove coffees from my list with the click of the “remove” link. Everything you need is right there.
I get occasional emails from Crema when new coffees and/or roasters are added, and I also get alerts via email when a coffee is sold out. These are automatically removed from my Brewlist, so I don’t have to manage anything along those lines, it’s all done by Crema. Even the emails are well thought out and the subject line has most of the info you need so if you’re the kind of person who reads a subject line and then deletes an email before you even open it, you can be “that guy” and not lose any sleep over it! LOL
Adding shipping info, credit card information, claiming a gift, etc are all clear and easy to do. I cannot overemphasize how well designed and implemented Crema’s interface is. Emily’s storytelling for each coffee and farmer is wonderful and the only challenge to any of this is figuring out which coffees you want next!
The shipping is prompt and fast and the boxes are a nice presentation, even, too. I truly liked everything about my Crema.co experience.
Without overstating one bit, Crema.co sets the benchmark for what a multiroaster subscription service should look like, what information the website should have and the functionality of using it all online. They have set the bar very high and I love it!

Disappointed with the house blend purveyed by national coffee chains? You're not alone. In fact, 76 million Americans sip specialty coffee every day, a number that's grown 250% among 18-39 year-olds over the last eight years, according to the National Coffee Association.Coffee is moving upmarket. And artisanal roasters are leading the way.Here's the problem: supermarket shelves are still stocked with commodity coffee. In fact, five conglomerates control nearly 80% of the $15.6 billion home coffee market in the U.S., highlighting the disconnect between what people want and what they're being offered through traditional retailers.But imagine if there was one place you could go to discover the best coffees from the country's top artisanal roasters. Well, now there is.SolutionCrema.co makes it easy for coffee drinkers to subscribe to roasted-to-order beans from top specialty roasters, whether that's Ritual in San Francisco, Toby's Estate in New York, or 19 of our other roaster partners across the U.S. Here's how it works:Pick out several coffees you'd like to try and add them to your Brew List, a playlist for coffee. Set a delivery frequency (such as every week or every month), and get the next coffee on your list each time.As you rate the coffees you receive, we learn the characteristics present in the coffees you like, and provide personalized recommendations based on your taste profile.Along the way, you'll experience the stories of the coffee growers behind the beans—see photographs of the farmers, read about the cooperative, learn about the region. Most of our coffees are single-origin, meaning they come from a specific country, region, and often even a single farm. We seek out roasters who have direct trade relationships with the farmers themselves, encouraging transparency and fair prices.Give BackTrue to our ethos of supporting coffee drinkers, roasters, and farmers in their endeavor to live well, we've partnered with Food4Farmers, an organization addressing seasonal hunger and malnutrition in coffee-producing communities. For each purchase on Crema.co, $0.10 (for 12oz bags) to $1.00 (for 5lb) goes to food security projects for the 670 families who make up the SOPPEXCCA coffee co-operative in Jinotega, Nicaragua.Other HighlightsNo inventory. Each coffee is drop-shipped from the roaster directly to the customer.Co-branded packaging. The roaster's bag of coffee is shipped in a our box.Streamlined roaster logistics. We notify roasters of new orders once per day, generate a pre-paid postage label and pack list for each order, handle shipment tracking and customer notifications, and automate weekly payouts to roasters and accompanying account statements.Customer Testimonials“I just wanted to express my love for Crema and thank you for creating it! I have used coffee subscription companies and get bored using them because of the lack of variety and quality. Crema has been amazing since it ships directly from the seller and I get to experience new types of coffee and roasters from all over the country. I'm trying to get a shipment from each roaster (eventually) and have especially loved the coffee from Bold Bean that I've received. And the best part of course is knowing the back story and where the coffee has been grown! For someone who is addicted to the coffee experience, this is incredible.” – Rebecca Burwell, Brooklyn“Crema.co replaced my coffee buying completely — I get an excellent bag of coffee in the mail every week. I also really appreciate the focus they place on the growers.” – Rian van der Merwe, Portland“Crema.co has a roster of micro-roasters from across the U.S. who each offer single-origin coffees from around the world. I was impressed the moment I got onto the website.” – Bushra Burney, San FranciscoMedia MentionsTeam StoryCoffee spans the world and touches millions of lives.At Crema.co, we firmly believe that coffee is a community, not a commodity, and we're on a mission to support every coffee drinker, roaster, and farmer in their endeavor to live well.Once upon a time as a college student, Crema.co co-founder Tyler Tate spent a summer working with coffee farmers in Costa Rica, and was struck by the dedication and care they devoted to their art. For the next decade that spark smoldered while Tyler worked around the world as a designer and developer with tech startups like Nutshell CRM and Twigkit. In the spring of 2015, he ran a successful Kickstarter campaign to build the coffee marketplace of the future, and officially launched Crema.co in December 2015 after a 3-month private beta.Coffee entrepreneur and storyteller Emily McIntyre joined as co-founder during the beta period, bringing her broad connections with the specialty coffee industry and her experience as a coffee journalist and marketer to the Crema.co story.Founded in Seattle, we relocated to the San Francisco Bay Area in October 2016, and graduated from the 500 Startups accelerator in February 2017 following a 4-month program. In the weeks to come, we're poised to roll out the biggest new offering since we launched: coffee for teams.Meet the FoundersTyler TateCEODesign, code, coffee.

Previously GM Barracuda.Q&A with the FounderCan you give me a brief background on the company?I (Tyler) started working on Crema at the beginning of 2015. One of the first things I did was launch a Kickstarter campaign to test the waters, and we raised around $25,000 during the one-month campaign ending in April 2015. We then started building out our platform, soft-launched a private beta in August 2015, and then publicly launched in December 2015. It was while I was reaching out to coffee influencers during those early days that I met Emily, and she joined Crema as a cofounder after we’d already been working together for a number of months.How has the company progressed since then?In lots of ways! More coffees, more roasters, better systems, and a great team of folks who make this all run smoothly. In 2016 we rolled out several new features like ratings, a “Brew Log” that learns your taste preferences, and a recommendation engine, not to mention participating in 500 Startups over the winter. So far this year we’ve partnered with Food 4 Farmers, a nonprofit that works in Nicaragua to mitigate seasonal hunger for coffee farmers. And we’re just about to launch office coffee! We are stoked to sell the same delicious coffees in 5-pound increments for teams around the country, and will be offering a Slack integration that allows teammates to upvote coffees, leave feedback, and even communicate with each other about coffee right in their normal workflow.What has happened since you joined 500 Startups?We had our demo day last  week (2/15) and were apart of the accelerator from 10/16-1/17. We were able to accelerate growth with 500 – before we joined, we had mostly organic sales. Since 500, we have improved with distribution and expertise help from 500’s network. We also started paid customer  acquisition that we honed in on with experiments through various channels and by improving onboarding on our site with the various taste tests and introductory sampler set options.Digging into your financials, could you explain why there was no revenue for several months (May 2015 - July 2015) following your Kickstarter ending in April 2015?In April 2015 we collected Kickstarter payments and hired our first engineer. In August we actually launched our private beta, invited our Kickstarter supporters, and started generating revenue.Why are there still Kickstarter-related “cost of goods sold” entries after the campaign?The primary reward we gave to our Kickstarter backers was credits toward the purchase of future coffees. Kickstarter credits started being redeemed after our private launch in August 2015 and tapered off through 2016. Today, about 90-95% of the outstanding Kickstarter credits have been redeemed.Side by Side Term SheetA Side by Side offering refers to a deal that is raising capital under two offering types. If you plan on investing less than US $20,000.00, you will automatically invest under the Regulation CF offering type. If you invest more than US $20,000.00, you must be an accredited investor and invest under the Regulation D offering type.Terms & DescriptionRegulation D - Rule 506(c)Regulation CFInvestor TypesAccredited OnlyAccredited and Non-accreditedRound descriptionSeedSeedRound sizeUS $750,000US $750,000Amount raisedUS $0US $21,300Minimum investment$20,000US $500Security typeCrowd NoteCrowd NoteConversion discount20.0%20.0%Valuation capUS $4,000,000US $4,000,000Interest rate5.0%5.0%Closing TermsThe Company is making concurrent offerings under both Regulation CF and Regulation D (the "Combined Offerings"). Unless the Company raises at least the Target Amount of $25,000 under the Regulation CF offering and a total of $300,000 under the Combined Offerings (the “Closing Amount”) by August 2, 2017, no securities will be sold in this offering, investment commitments will be cancelled, and committed funds will be returned.The Company is making concurrent offerings under both Regulation CF and Regulation D (the "Combined Offerings").

From the $9.00 platform fee, Crema.co then covers the direct costs associated with the order—Shipping: $4.31, Mailer: $0.77, Stripe: $0.82, Food4Farmers Donation: $0.10—leaving $3.00 in gross profit for a gross margin of 33%. We expect our margin to improve further as we achieve economies of scale in the future.In June 2017 we intend to launch a new service delivering larger 5lb bags to 10-200 person offices. The unit economics for these orders have not fully solidified, but we anticipate pricing around $100 per 5lb bag, of which we intend to take a $40 platform fee and make $20 in gross profit. However, these numbers are provisional and subject to change.Financial StatementsOur financial statements can be found in Exhibit B to the Form C of which this Offering Memorandum forms a part. The financial statements were reviewed by Artesian CPA, LLC.Financial ConditionResults of OperationsThe company’s net revenues were $47,877 for the year ended December 31, 2016, an 85 % increase compared with $6,740 for the year ended December 31. 2015, primarily due to an increase in subscribers. The company’s revenues were primarily derived from platform fees collected on customer orders.Cost of revenue primarily consists of postage, credit card process fees, and packaging materials. Cost of revenues in 2016 was $32,361, a 79% increase from 2015 when cost of revenues was $6,578, primarily due to an increase in customer orders. Gross profit (revenues less the cost of producing those revenues) in 2016 was $15,516, an increase of 99% over 2015.The company’s operating expenses consist of payroll, marketing and advertising, general and administrative costs, and online infrastructure. Operating expenses in 2016 amounted to $156,872, a 9% increase from $142,230 in 2015. The primary reason for this minor increase was additional spending on advertising.As a result of the foregoing factors, the company’s net losses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $141,356, a minor decrease from the company’s losses of $142,068 in 2015.Liquidity and Capital Resources; Future TrendsTo date, the company has not made any profits and is still a “development stage company.” While some financial resources have come from operations, these only provide a fraction of the money needed to operate the company, and profits are not likely for some time. The company has recorded net losses from the time of inception up to December 31, 2016 in the total amount of $283,424.The company was initially capitalized by equity investments from its shareholders in the amount and loans from the issuance of notes. The principal amount of notes outstanding as of December 31, 2016 was $325,000.The company has not committed to make any capital expenditures, and in the event it does not raise sufficient funds from this offering, it will defer the capital expenditures it has planned.The company had approximately $4,800 cash on hand as of March 31, 2017. Currently, we estimate our burn rate (net cash out) to be on average $20,000 per month.IndebtednessThe company does not have any significant debts.Recent Offerings of SecuritiesThe company has not issued any securities since inception other than common stock issued to the founders.ValuationThe company determined the valuation cap, discount, and interest rate of the Crowd Notes in this offering internally based on its own assessment of the company's current and future value, as well as relative risk for investors investing in similarly situated companies. The Crowd Notes may convert to equity securities of the company in the future if the company engages in future equity financings. At that time, the valuation of the company will be determined through negotiations with prospective investors. Those prospective investors may determine the value of the company through one or multiple methods which include:Liquidation Value — The amount for which the assets of the company can be sold, minus the liabilities owed ;Book Value — This is based on analysis of the company’s financial statements, usually looking at the company’s balance sheet; andEarnings Approach — This is based on what the prospective investor will pay (the present value) for what the prospective investor expects to obtain in the future.Market LandscapeThe U.S. coffee market was $75 billion in 2016, according to the Specialty Coffee Association of America. Crema.co is targeting the $15.6 billion home and $3.1 billion office segments, with a particular focus on the specialty subcomponent of each, estimated to be $4.4 billion and $627 million, respectively, for a total addressable market of $5.0 billion in the U.S.Premiumization TrendMuch like craft beer before it, the last few years have seen a gentrification of coffee. It's even been given a name: third-wave coffee, distinguishing it from the stuff out of a tin can (first wave) and the ubiquity of national chains (second wave). Fanatical attention to quality, a cultivation of connoisseurship, and an emphasis on traceability and sustainability are central values to the third wave movement, and it's millennial coffee drinkers and artisanal roasters who are the driving forces behind this premiumization. “The latest data shows a market shift toward high-quality, premium beverages, with younger demographics driving this change,” the National Coffee Association (NCA) wrote in a recent blog post.The shift has been a dramatic one. “Between 2008 and 2016,” the NCA found, “past-day consumption of gourmet coffee beverages soared from 13% to 36% among 18-24 year olds, and from 19% to 41% for those 25-39.”Market Response & ConsolidationIn response to coffee's shift upmarket, craft roasters have received renewed attention—for instance San Francisco's Blue Bottle Coffee attracted over $120 million in venture capital according to Crunchbase—and large coffee companies have either launched new initiatives or made acquisitions to enter this growing segment. Howard Schultz announced late last year, for instance, that he was stepping down as Starbucks CEO to focus on opening more Starbucks Reserve stores, which he described as “a new, premium retail coffee format... [offering] customers the finest assortment of exclusive, micro-lot coffees sourced from around the world.”Other coffee giants have made acquisitions to ensure their seat at the third-wave table. JAB Holdings, a private equity firm which has rapidly consolidated the world's largest coffee empire, acquired Stumptown Coffee Roasters (Portland) and Intelligentsia Coffee (Chicago), two third-wave darlings, in late 2015 through Peet's Coffee and Tea, a JAB subsidiary. The rational given by Dave Burwick, Peet's CEO, is telling: “As the super premium coffee category further explodes and fragments due to more consumers (18–34-year-olds) demanding variety and highly specialized coffee experiences, it’s important that we offer differentiated craft coffee brands with unique propositions and appeal.”In response to these acquisitions, Ross Colbert, a beverage strategist at Rabobank International, told the Wall Street Journal “we can expect further consolidation among top-tier craft roasters... In coffee, (like beer) small is beautiful.”Crema's ApproachOur approach embodies the values of the third-wave movement: discovery of artisan roasters, appreciation of quality and subtlety, and commitment to sustainability, all underpinned with authentic storytelling. Our insight is that the way to succeed with the modern coffee drinker is not to take one product and make it ubiquitous, but rather provide a platform through which many curated products from craft brands can be savored, and become a trusted ally in the coffee drinker's own journey of connoisseurship.Risks and DisclosuresWe are selling convertible notes that will convert into shares or result in payment in limited circumstances. These notes do not have a maturity date and only convert or result in payment in limited circumstances.  If there is a merger, buyout or other corporate transaction that occurs before a qualified equity financing, investors will receive a payment of the greater of two times their purchase price or the amount of preferred shares they would have been able to purchase using the valuation cap.  If there is a qualified equity financing (an initial public offering registered under the Securities Act or a financing using preferred shares), the notes will convert into a yet to-be-determined class of preferred stock. The notes will convert at a discount of 20%, or based on a valuation cap meaning investors would be rewarded for taking on early risk compared to later investors. But you won’t know how much your investment is worth until that happens. The outside investors at the time of conversion, if any, might value the company at an amount well below the $4 million valuation cap, so you should not view the $4 million as being an indication of the company’s value. Further the interest on the notes is accrued interest, therefore you will not receive interest payments on these notes.  If you choose to invest, you should be prepared that your notes will never convert and will have no value. We have not assessed the tax implications of using the Crowd Note. The Crowd Note is a type of debt security that does not include a set maturity date [and is not interest bearing]. As such, there has been inconsistent treatment under state and federal tax law as to whether the Crowd Note can be considered a debt of the company, or the issuance of equity. Investors should consult their tax advisers.Any valuation at this stage is difficult to assess. Unlike listed companies that are valued publicly through market-driven stock prices, the valuation of private companies, especially startups, is difficult to assess and you may risk overpaying for your investment. In addition, there may be additional classes of equity with rights that are superior to the class of equity being sold.The Crowd Note contains dispute resolution provisions which limit your ability to bring class action lawsuits or seek remedy on a class basis. By purchasing a Crowd Note this offering, you agree to be bound by the dispute resolution provisions found in Section 6 of the Crowd Note.  Those provisions apply to claims regarding this offering, the Crowd Notes and possibly the securities into which the Crowd Note are convertible. Under those provisions, disputes under the Crowd Note will be resolved in arbitration conducted in Delaware.  Further, those provisions may limit your ability to bring class action lawsuits or similarly seek remedy on a class basis. You may have limited rights. The company has not yet authorized Preferred Stock, and there is no way to know what voting rights those securities will have.  In addition, as an investor in the Regulation CF offering you will be considered a non-Major Investor under the terms of the notes offered, and therefore, you have more limited information rights and you will not have the right to automatically participate in future offerings, and therefore not have the same anti-dilution protections as Major Investors.You will be bound by an investment management agreement, which limits your voting rights. As a result of purchasing the notes, all non-Major Investors (including all investors investing under Regulation CF) will be bound by an Investment management agreement. This agreement will limit your voting rights and at a later time may require you to convert your future preferred shares into common shares without your consent. Non-Major Investors will be bound by this agreement, unless Non-Major Investors holding a majority of the principal amount outstanding of the Crowd Notes or majority of the shares of the preferred equity the notes will convert into, vote to terminate the agreement.The reviewing CPA has issued included a “going concern” note in the reviewed financials. We may not have enough funds to sustain the business until it becomes profitable. Even if we raise funds through a crowdfunding round, we may not accurately anticipate how quickly we may use the funds and if it is sufficient to bring the business to profitability.You can’t easily resell the securities. There are restrictions on how you can resell your securities for the next year. More importantly, there is no market for these securities, and there might never be one. It’s unlikely that the company will ever go public or get acquired by a bigger company. That means the money you paid for these securities could be tied up for a long time.This is an early stage company. It has limited history, clients, and revenues. If you are investing in this company, it’s because you think this is a good idea, that the founders can execute it better than their competition, that they can price products right and sell it to enough people that the company will succeed. You are taking all these things on faith, because it’s impossible to know what will happen. We are dependent upon additional capital resources for the continuation of our principal operations and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including failing to secure funding to reach a stage when we profitably operate the business.The company has realized significant operating losses to date and expects to incur losses in the future. The company has operated at a loss since inception, and these losses are likely to continue. Our net loss for 2016 was $ 141,356 and the net loss for 2015 was $ 142,068. Until the company achieves profitability, it will have to seek other sources of capital in order to continue operations.We have a small management team. We depend on the skills and experience of our co-founders and management who are both integral to the business. If the company is not able to call upon them for any reason, its operations and development could be harmed.The online coffee market is a crowded place. There is a lot of activity in the online coffee sales space—many different coffee roasters or ‘coffee curators’ are selling coffee subscriptions similar to ours. The market has not yet seen significant consolidation and no leaders have emerged so far. We believe that our offering and business strategy will help us capture a significant portion of the marketplace, but there is no guarantee this will happen. It is possible that one or more of our competitors will be more successful, which could negatively impact our potential for growth and ability to turn a profit.Some of our competitors have significantly more resources than we do. Some of our competitors are clearly established large coffee companies such as Starbucks and Blue Bottle. These big companies have significantly more resources at their disposal than we do and there is a chance that they will be able to squeeze out smaller companies like ours from the online coffee marketplace.The market trends we are anticipating in the specialty coffee industry may not happen. There is no guarantee that predictions on growth in the gourmet subcomponent of the coffee market outpacing the growth of the market as a whole, particularly among millennials, will continue. While we have seen significant growth in specialty coffee consumption in the past few years, you cannot be sure that these trends will continue or that we will be able to capture a larger percentage of the market. General Risks and DisclosuresStart-up investing is risky.  Investing in startups is very risky, highly speculative, and should not be made by anyone who cannot afford to lose their entire investment. Unlike an investment in a mature business where there is a track record of revenue and income, the success of a startup or early-stage venture often relies on the development of a new product or service that may or may not find a market. Before investing, you should carefully consider the specific risks and disclosures related to both this offering type and the company which can be found in this company profile and the documents in the data room below.Your shares are not easily transferable.  You should not plan on being able to readily transfer and/or resell your security. Currently there is no market or liquidity for these shares and the company does not have any plans to list these shares on an exchange or other secondary market. At some point the company may choose to do so, but until then you should plan to hold your investment for a significant period of time before a “liquidation event” occurs. A “liquidation event” is when the company either lists their shares on an exchange, is acquired, or goes bankrupt.The Company may not pay dividends for the foreseeable future.  Unless otherwise specified in the offering documents and subject to state law, you are not entitled to receive any dividends on your interest in the Company. Accordingly, any potential investor who anticipates the need for current dividends or income from an investment should not purchase any of the securities offered on the Site.Valuation and capitalization.  Unlike listed companies that are valued publicly through market-driven stock prices, the valuation of private companies, especially startups, is difficult to assess and you may risk overpaying for your investment.  In addition, there may be additional classes of equity with rights that are superior to the class of equity being sold.You may only receive limited disclosure.  While the company must disclose certain information, since the company is at an early-stage they may only be able to provide limited information about its business plan and operations because it does not have fully developed operations or a long history.  The company may also only obligated to file information periodically regarding its business, including financial statements.  A publicly listed company, in contrast, is required to file annual and quarterly reports and promptly disclose certain events — through continuing disclosure that you can use to evaluate the status of your investment.Investment in personnel.  An early-stage investment is also an investment in the entrepreneur or management of the company.  Being able to execute on the business plan is often an important factor in whether the business is viable and successful.  You should be aware that a portion of your investment may fund the compensation of the company’s employees, including its management.  You should carefully review any disclosure regarding the company’s use of proceeds.Possibility of fraud.  In light of the relative ease with which early-stage companies can raise funds, it may be the case that certain opportunities turn out to be money-losing fraudulent schemes.  As with other investments, there is no guarantee that investments will be immune from fraud.Lack of professional guidance.  Many successful companies partially attribute their early success to the guidance of professional early-stage investors (e.g., angel investors and venture capital firms).  These investors often negotiate for seats on the company’s board of directors and play an important role through their resources, contacts and experience in assisting early-stage companies in executing on their business plans.  An early-stage company may not have the benefit of such professional investors.Crema.co's Form CThe Form C is a document the company must file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which includes basic information about the company and its offering and is a condition to making a Reg CF offering available to investors.

Prior capital raising options limited private companies to raising money only from accredited investors, historically the wealthiest ~2% of Americans. Like a Kickstarter campaign, Reg CF allows companies to raise funds online from their early adopters and the crowd.
