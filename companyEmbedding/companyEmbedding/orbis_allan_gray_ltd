                                                            Suitable for you if:
                                                        


You want to invest in listed shares for long-term capital growth
You are comfortable with significant stock market movement
You accept the possibility of losing capital
You have at least five years to invest, but preferably longer





                                                                        View risk and performance


Why is this important?




                                                                        View detailed information

Can you tolerate significant ups and downs?
You must be prepared to wait out years in which you may experience performance that may be significantly better, or significantly worse, than in a balanced fund. It is important that you are able to remain invested after a drop, to give your investment time to recover.  
Look at the long-term return 








Returns go up and down, but you can benefit if you have enough time to wait
If you have the time and the patience to leave your money invested despite dramatic and long-lasting ups and downs, the Equity Fund has the potential to deliver higher long-term return.
To really understand how much an investment has grown over time, it’s important to look at return after inflation.


Your investment doesn’t grow until it beats inflation
Your investment must at least keep up with the rising cost of living (inflation) to maintain the same buying power. Your investment only grows if its performance is higher than inflation.

Your one-year returns may test you
Over any year you may experience good performance, or things may go the other way and your investment could lose value. It’s important to prepare yourself for the ups and downs you could experience while you are invested.
Look at the long-term return.








Returns go up and down, but you can benefit over the long term
Our Balanced Fund aims to deliver steady growth over time. You can benefit if you are able to wait out the short-term ups and downs.
To fully understand how much an investment has grown over time, it’s important to look at return the after inflation.

Benefit from less significant ups and downs than the Balanced Fund
The Stable Fund aims to protect your investment over any two years. Over a year you may still experience ups and downs, but these are likely to be less significant than what you might experience in the Balanced unit trust.
Look at the long-term return. 








You must be comfortable with lower return over time
If you are investing for the long term, you must be comfortable with lower return than you might earn in a Balanced Fund.

Your one-year returns are stable
The Money Market Fund is suitable for investment of a year or less. The ups and downs are far less significant than a balanced fund. You can access your money when you need to, without worrying about whether your investment has lost value.
Look at the long-term return.To give an indication of the ups and downs you may experience in a balanced unit trust, we show the average return of similar unit trusts.








The Money Market Fund is not suitable for long-term investing
The Money Market Fund aims to deliver higher return than bank deposits. But if you are investing for the long term, you must be comfortable with significantly lower return than you might earn in a Balanced Fund.
 To understand how much an investment has grown over time, it’s important to look at return after inflation.


Your return may be lower than inflation
Your investment must at least keep up with the rising cost of living (inflation) to maintain the same buying power and only grows if its performance is higher than inflation.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.

No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year
