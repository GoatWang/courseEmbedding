Early life[edit]
Matthews was born in Newport, South Wales, at the then Lydia Beynon Maternity Hospital. Matthews returned as an adult to include the manor house that housed the hospital within the Celtic Manor Resort. He grew up in the town of Newbridge, Caerphilly. He studied at Swansea University and received a bachelor's degree in electronics in 1969.[9]
Career[edit]
After an apprenticeship at British Telecom's research lab at Martlesham Heath, Matthews left Britain and joined MicroSystems International, a chipmaking operation affiliated with Northern Telecom (which became Nortel Networks) in Ottawa, Canada.[10]
Mitel[edit]
Matthews' first enterprise was started in collaboration with fellow Briton and Microsystems employee Michael Cowpland in 1972.[10] To raise seed money for future enterprises they had planned, the pair intended to import and sell electric lawnmowers built in the UK. Conventionally and as well accounts by Terry Matthews the name Mitel is thought to be a contraction of "Mike and Terry's Lawnmowers".[9] However Cowpland is quoted as saying that it stands for "Mike and Terry ELectronics". This first endeavour was a fiasco; the shipping company carrying the first batch lost the container.[11] When the lawnmowers finally arrived, the ground was covered with snow in the Canadian winter and no one would buy them. Matthews later said "That taught me a key lesson — the importance of timing. The shipping company lost the lawnmowers! By the time they showed up no-one wanted them, as you can't cut grass when it's covered with snow."[10]
Mitel became a technology consultancy company run from home to the various companies around Ottawa's emerging high-tech district. Mitel's clients included the National Research Council, the Communications Research Centre, and a handful of pioneering start-ups including SHL Systemhouse which was later purchased by EDS and now is part of HP and Quasar Systems (now Cognos).
Obtaining funding from a $4,000 bank loan and as well from their own savings and a group of angel investors (notably Kent Plumley)[9][12] the two developed a telephony DTMF tone receiver based on Cowpland's Ph.D. thesis. This was a major advance in the technology since they were able to sell receivers at a fraction of the cost of competing versions, while gaining returns of 1000%. Additionally, Mitel later became a chip manufacturer with the acquisition of the Silek foundry in Bromont, Quebec.
Later the pair realized that the then new technology of microprocessors and other semiconductor devices would make a similar change in the market for small PBXs. The SX200 PBX launched to immense success, being cheaper to purchase, quicker to install and far more functional. Mitel became one of the more successful manufacturers of small PBX systems and telecom semiconductors in the world, floating on the New York Stock Exchange in 1981.
In 1985, British Telecom bought a controlling interest in Mitel. Cowpland would later form the company that became Corel and Matthews later founded Newbridge Networks.
Newbridge Networks[edit]
In 1986, Matthews drove Newbridge to become a leader in the worldwide data networking industry, manufacturing data communications products, especially ATM devices and routers. In 2000 the company employed more than 6,500 employees with recorded FY 1999 revenue of $1.8 billion. Later in 2000, Newbridge was acquired by Alcatel[13] for $7.1 billion. Matthews' personal stake in Newbridge was valued at over a billion dollars, and as a result of the transaction he became the largest single shareholder in Alcatel.
Return to Mitel[edit]
In 2000, he reacquired the Mitel PBX business and company name, taking it private. He has invested heavily ($600 million by 2006) in Mitel to turn it into a broadband communications company. The company has made significant investments in enterprise Voice over IP telephony technology. Mitel's manufacturing business was spun off as BreconRidge. The company acquired Intertel in April 2007.[14] Mitel went public again in 2010.[15] Mitel announced the purchase of Aastra Technologies in November 2013.[16] Mitel announced the purchase of Mavenir Systems in March 2015.[17] Mitel announced the purchase of Polycom in April 2016[18], however, the deal fell through and Polycom instead merged with private equity firm Siris Capital Group.[19]

Additionally, Matthews serves on the board of directors for a number of high tech companies and chairs Solace Systems, [21] and CounterPath Corporation.[22]
Wales[edit]
Matthews spends a considerable amount of time in his native Wales, working on such ventures as the Celtic Manor Resort, a leisure complex in Newport, near the south Wales coast, chosen to host the 2010 Ryder Cup golf tournament and the 2014 NATO summit.[23][24] The Celtic Manor hosted the ISPS Handa Wales Open for 15 years. The original Celtic Manor Hotel was formerly a maternity hospital and is Matthews' birthplace.[6][25]
Matthews bought Celtic Manor in 1980, ploughing £100m into the project. Firstly the 19th century Manor House was renovated, while in 1991 plans were unveiled to develop two new golf courses and a convention centre between the manor and the River Usk. Matthews had become friends with golf course architect, the late Robert Trent Jones Snr, whose family roots were in Aberystwyth. Work began on the 'Roman Road' course in 1992, named after the main route connecting the former Roman fortress of Caerleon with the town of Caerwent, which crosses the land. In 1994 the 4,000-yard 'Coldra Woods' golf course was started, as well as the £10m golf clubhouse hotel.[26]
Celtic Manor was Hotel of the Year in 2002, and won two European Design Awards in 2001 - one for the interior designers, Goff Associates, and one for its spa from the International Spa Association. Matthews commented that: "I think the resort can act as a magnet to draw new investment into Wales from across the UK and overseas. I did my best to put up a building that you can see from the West End of London and I didn't come far short of it!".[26]
In September 2014, Matthews was appointed chairman of the Swansea Bay City Region Board.[27][28][29][30][31] The Swansea Bay City Region Board is backing a Swansea Tidal Lagoon project.[32]
In January 2016, he purchased the Hilton Hotel in Newport.
Philanthropy[edit]
Matthews founded the Wesley Clover Foundation, a not-for-profit, philanthropic corporation that supports entrepreneurship, healthcare, education, and community initiatives. The foundation leased the properties formerly known as the Nepean National Equestrian Park and the Ottawa Municipal Campground to create Wesley Clover Parks.[33][34] Matthews hosts an annual gala, Lumière, that has raised over $1 Million for charity.[35]
Honours[edit]
In 1994, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE).
In 1998, he was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering.[4]
In June 2001, he was conferred the honour of Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in the Queen's Birthday Honours. He was knighted by HM The Queen at an investiture in Buckingham Palace.
Matthews has received honorary doctorates from the University of Wales (Glamorgan and Swansea), and Carleton University.[36] In 2006 he was awarded an Honorary Degree (Doctor of Engineering) from the University of Bath.
In 2011, he was appointed Patron of the Cancer Stem Cell Research Institute at Cardiff University.[37]

Early life[edit]
Matthews was born in Newport, South Wales, at the then Lydia Beynon Maternity Hospital. Matthews returned as an adult to include the manor house that housed the hospital within the Celtic Manor Resort. He grew up in the town of Newbridge, Caerphilly. He studied at Swansea University and received a bachelor's degree in electronics in 1969.[9]
Career[edit]
After an apprenticeship at British Telecom's research lab at Martlesham Heath, Matthews left Britain and joined MicroSystems International, a chipmaking operation affiliated with Northern Telecom (which became Nortel Networks) in Ottawa, Canada.[10]
Mitel[edit]
Matthews' first enterprise was started in collaboration with fellow Briton and Microsystems employee Michael Cowpland in 1972.[10] To raise seed money for future enterprises they had planned, the pair intended to import and sell electric lawnmowers built in the UK. Conventionally and as well accounts by Terry Matthews the name Mitel is thought to be a contraction of "Mike and Terry's Lawnmowers".[9] However Cowpland is quoted as saying that it stands for "Mike and Terry ELectronics". This first endeavour was a fiasco; the shipping company carrying the first batch lost the container.[11] When the lawnmowers finally arrived, the ground was covered with snow in the Canadian winter and no one would buy them. Matthews later said "That taught me a key lesson — the importance of timing. The shipping company lost the lawnmowers! By the time they showed up no-one wanted them, as you can't cut grass when it's covered with snow."[10]
Mitel became a technology consultancy company run from home to the various companies around Ottawa's emerging high-tech district. Mitel's clients included the National Research Council, the Communications Research Centre, and a handful of pioneering start-ups including SHL Systemhouse which was later purchased by EDS and now is part of HP and Quasar Systems (now Cognos).
Obtaining funding from a $4,000 bank loan and as well from their own savings and a group of angel investors (notably Kent Plumley)[9][12] the two developed a telephony DTMF tone receiver based on Cowpland's Ph.D. thesis. This was a major advance in the technology since they were able to sell receivers at a fraction of the cost of competing versions, while gaining returns of 1000%. Additionally, Mitel later became a chip manufacturer with the acquisition of the Silek foundry in Bromont, Quebec.
Later the pair realized that the then new technology of microprocessors and other semiconductor devices would make a similar change in the market for small PBXs. The SX200 PBX launched to immense success, being cheaper to purchase, quicker to install and far more functional. Mitel became one of the more successful manufacturers of small PBX systems and telecom semiconductors in the world, floating on the New York Stock Exchange in 1981.
In 1985, British Telecom bought a controlling interest in Mitel. Cowpland would later form the company that became Corel and Matthews later founded Newbridge Networks.
Newbridge Networks[edit]
In 1986, Matthews drove Newbridge to become a leader in the worldwide data networking industry, manufacturing data communications products, especially ATM devices and routers. In 2000 the company employed more than 6,500 employees with recorded FY 1999 revenue of $1.8 billion. Later in 2000, Newbridge was acquired by Alcatel[13] for $7.1 billion. Matthews' personal stake in Newbridge was valued at over a billion dollars, and as a result of the transaction he became the largest single shareholder in Alcatel.
Return to Mitel[edit]
In 2000, he reacquired the Mitel PBX business and company name, taking it private. He has invested heavily ($600 million by 2006) in Mitel to turn it into a broadband communications company. The company has made significant investments in enterprise Voice over IP telephony technology. Mitel's manufacturing business was spun off as BreconRidge. The company acquired Intertel in April 2007.[14] Mitel went public again in 2010.[15] Mitel announced the purchase of Aastra Technologies in November 2013.[16] Mitel announced the purchase of Mavenir Systems in March 2015.[17] Mitel announced the purchase of Polycom in April 2016[18], however, the deal fell through and Polycom instead merged with private equity firm Siris Capital Group.[19]
Other businesses[edit]

The company has subsequently been wound up and liquidated.
Alacrity Incubator and Accelerator Program - Matthews founded Alacrity in 2009 along with his son, Owen Matthews, and Simon Gibson. Alacrity is a non-profit organization aimed at connecting established Western Canadian companies with venture capitalists and investment firms.[20]

Additionally, Matthews serves on the board of directors for a number of high tech companies and chairs Solace Systems, [21] and CounterPath Corporation.[22]
Wales[edit]
Matthews spends a considerable amount of time in his native Wales, working on such ventures as the Celtic Manor Resort, a leisure complex in Newport, near the south Wales coast, chosen to host the 2010 Ryder Cup golf tournament and the 2014 NATO summit.[23][24] The Celtic Manor hosted the ISPS Handa Wales Open for 15 years. The original Celtic Manor Hotel was formerly a maternity hospital and is Matthews' birthplace.[6][25]
Matthews bought Celtic Manor in 1980, ploughing £100m into the project. Firstly the 19th century Manor House was renovated, while in 1991 plans were unveiled to develop two new golf courses and a convention centre between the manor and the River Usk. Matthews had become friends with golf course architect, the late Robert Trent Jones Snr, whose family roots were in Aberystwyth. Work began on the 'Roman Road' course in 1992, named after the main route connecting the former Roman fortress of Caerleon with the town of Caerwent, which crosses the land. In 1994 the 4,000-yard 'Coldra Woods' golf course was started, as well as the £10m golf clubhouse hotel.[26]
Celtic Manor was Hotel of the Year in 2002, and won two European Design Awards in 2001 - one for the interior designers, Goff Associates, and one for its spa from the International Spa Association. Matthews commented that: "I think the resort can act as a magnet to draw new investment into Wales from across the UK and overseas. I did my best to put up a building that you can see from the West End of London and I didn't come far short of it!".[26]
In September 2014, Matthews was appointed chairman of the Swansea Bay City Region Board.[27][28][29][30][31] The Swansea Bay City Region Board is backing a Swansea Tidal Lagoon project.[32]
In January 2016, he purchased the Hilton Hotel in Newport.
Philanthropy[edit]
Matthews founded the Wesley Clover Foundation, a not-for-profit, philanthropic corporation that supports entrepreneurship, healthcare, education, and community initiatives. The foundation leased the properties formerly known as the Nepean National Equestrian Park and the Ottawa Municipal Campground to create Wesley Clover Parks.[33][34] Matthews hosts an annual gala, Lumière, that has raised over $1 Million for charity.[35]
Honours[edit]
In 1994, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE).
In 1998, he was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering.[4]
In June 2001, he was conferred the honour of Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in the Queen's Birthday Honours. He was knighted by HM The Queen at an investiture in Buckingham Palace.
Matthews has received honorary doctorates from the University of Wales (Glamorgan and Swansea), and Carleton University.[36] In 2006 he was awarded an Honorary Degree (Doctor of Engineering) from the University of Bath.
In 2011, he was appointed Patron of the Cancer Stem Cell Research Institute at Cardiff University.[37]

Wales[edit]
Matthews spends a considerable amount of time in his native Wales, working on such ventures as the Celtic Manor Resort, a leisure complex in Newport, near the south Wales coast, chosen to host the 2010 Ryder Cup golf tournament and the 2014 NATO summit.[23][24] The Celtic Manor hosted the ISPS Handa Wales Open for 15 years. The original Celtic Manor Hotel was formerly a maternity hospital and is Matthews' birthplace.[6][25]
Matthews bought Celtic Manor in 1980, ploughing £100m into the project. Firstly the 19th century Manor House was renovated, while in 1991 plans were unveiled to develop two new golf courses and a convention centre between the manor and the River Usk. Matthews had become friends with golf course architect, the late Robert Trent Jones Snr, whose family roots were in Aberystwyth. Work began on the 'Roman Road' course in 1992, named after the main route connecting the former Roman fortress of Caerleon with the town of Caerwent, which crosses the land. In 1994 the 4,000-yard 'Coldra Woods' golf course was started, as well as the £10m golf clubhouse hotel.[26]
Celtic Manor was Hotel of the Year in 2002, and won two European Design Awards in 2001 - one for the interior designers, Goff Associates, and one for its spa from the International Spa Association. Matthews commented that: "I think the resort can act as a magnet to draw new investment into Wales from across the UK and overseas. I did my best to put up a building that you can see from the West End of London and I didn't come far short of it!".[26]
In September 2014, Matthews was appointed chairman of the Swansea Bay City Region Board.[27][28][29][30][31] The Swansea Bay City Region Board is backing a Swansea Tidal Lagoon project.[32]
In January 2016, he purchased the Hilton Hotel in Newport.
Philanthropy[edit]
Matthews founded the Wesley Clover Foundation, a not-for-profit, philanthropic corporation that supports entrepreneurship, healthcare, education, and community initiatives. The foundation leased the properties formerly known as the Nepean National Equestrian Park and the Ottawa Municipal Campground to create Wesley Clover Parks.[33][34] Matthews hosts an annual gala, Lumière, that has raised over $1 Million for charity.[35]
Honours[edit]
In 1994, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE).
In 1998, he was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering.[4]
In June 2001, he was conferred the honour of Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in the Queen's Birthday Honours. He was knighted by HM The Queen at an investiture in Buckingham Palace.
Matthews has received honorary doctorates from the University of Wales (Glamorgan and Swansea), and Carleton University.[36] In 2006 he was awarded an Honorary Degree (Doctor of Engineering) from the University of Bath.
In 2011, he was appointed Patron of the Cancer Stem Cell Research Institute at Cardiff University.[37]
Personal life[edit]
His daughter, Karen, is executive director at Wesley Clover Parks. His youngest son, Trevor is an actor, founder and CEO of Brookstreet Pictures.

Early life[edit]
Matthews was born in Newport, South Wales, at the then Lydia Beynon Maternity Hospital. Matthews returned as an adult to include the manor house that housed the hospital within the Celtic Manor Resort. He grew up in the town of Newbridge, Caerphilly. He studied at Swansea University and received a bachelor's degree in electronics in 1969.[9]
Career[edit]
After an apprenticeship at British Telecom's research lab at Martlesham Heath, Matthews left Britain and joined MicroSystems International, a chipmaking operation affiliated with Northern Telecom (which became Nortel Networks) in Ottawa, Canada.[10]
Mitel[edit]
Matthews' first enterprise was started in collaboration with fellow Briton and Microsystems employee Michael Cowpland in 1972.[10] To raise seed money for future enterprises they had planned, the pair intended to import and sell electric lawnmowers built in the UK. Conventionally and as well accounts by Terry Matthews the name Mitel is thought to be a contraction of "Mike and Terry's Lawnmowers".[9] However Cowpland is quoted as saying that it stands for "Mike and Terry ELectronics". This first endeavour was a fiasco; the shipping company carrying the first batch lost the container.[11] When the lawnmowers finally arrived, the ground was covered with snow in the Canadian winter and no one would buy them. Matthews later said "That taught me a key lesson — the importance of timing. The shipping company lost the lawnmowers! By the time they showed up no-one wanted them, as you can't cut grass when it's covered with snow."[10]
Mitel became a technology consultancy company run from home to the various companies around Ottawa's emerging high-tech district. Mitel's clients included the National Research Council, the Communications Research Centre, and a handful of pioneering start-ups including SHL Systemhouse which was later purchased by EDS and now is part of HP and Quasar Systems (now Cognos).
Obtaining funding from a $4,000 bank loan and as well from their own savings and a group of angel investors (notably Kent Plumley)[9][12] the two developed a telephony DTMF tone receiver based on Cowpland's Ph.D. thesis. This was a major advance in the technology since they were able to sell receivers at a fraction of the cost of competing versions, while gaining returns of 1000%. Additionally, Mitel later became a chip manufacturer with the acquisition of the Silek foundry in Bromont, Quebec.
Later the pair realized that the then new technology of microprocessors and other semiconductor devices would make a similar change in the market for small PBXs. The SX200 PBX launched to immense success, being cheaper to purchase, quicker to install and far more functional. Mitel became one of the more successful manufacturers of small PBX systems and telecom semiconductors in the world, floating on the New York Stock Exchange in 1981.
In 1985, British Telecom bought a controlling interest in Mitel. Cowpland would later form the company that became Corel and Matthews later founded Newbridge Networks.
Newbridge Networks[edit]
In 1986, Matthews drove Newbridge to become a leader in the worldwide data networking industry, manufacturing data communications products, especially ATM devices and routers. In 2000 the company employed more than 6,500 employees with recorded FY 1999 revenue of $1.8 billion. Later in 2000, Newbridge was acquired by Alcatel[13] for $7.1 billion. Matthews' personal stake in Newbridge was valued at over a billion dollars, and as a result of the transaction he became the largest single shareholder in Alcatel.
Return to Mitel[edit]
In 2000, he reacquired the Mitel PBX business and company name, taking it private. He has invested heavily ($600 million by 2006) in Mitel to turn it into a broadband communications company. The company has made significant investments in enterprise Voice over IP telephony technology. Mitel's manufacturing business was spun off as BreconRidge. The company acquired Intertel in April 2007.[14] Mitel went public again in 2010.[15] Mitel announced the purchase of Aastra Technologies in November 2013.[16] Mitel announced the purchase of Mavenir Systems in March 2015.[17] Mitel announced the purchase of Polycom in April 2016[18], however, the deal fell through and Polycom instead merged with private equity firm Siris Capital Group.[19]

After an apprenticeship at British Telecom's research lab at Martlesham Heath, Matthews left Britain and joined MicroSystems International, a chipmaking operation affiliated with Northern Telecom (which became Nortel Networks) in Ottawa, Canada.[10]
Mitel[edit]
Matthews' first enterprise was started in collaboration with fellow Briton and Microsystems employee Michael Cowpland in 1972.[10] To raise seed money for future enterprises they had planned, the pair intended to import and sell electric lawnmowers built in the UK. Conventionally and as well accounts by Terry Matthews the name Mitel is thought to be a contraction of "Mike and Terry's Lawnmowers".[9] However Cowpland is quoted as saying that it stands for "Mike and Terry ELectronics". This first endeavour was a fiasco; the shipping company carrying the first batch lost the container.[11] When the lawnmowers finally arrived, the ground was covered with snow in the Canadian winter and no one would buy them. Matthews later said "That taught me a key lesson — the importance of timing. The shipping company lost the lawnmowers! By the time they showed up no-one wanted them, as you can't cut grass when it's covered with snow."[10]
Mitel became a technology consultancy company run from home to the various companies around Ottawa's emerging high-tech district. Mitel's clients included the National Research Council, the Communications Research Centre, and a handful of pioneering start-ups including SHL Systemhouse which was later purchased by EDS and now is part of HP and Quasar Systems (now Cognos).
Obtaining funding from a $4,000 bank loan and as well from their own savings and a group of angel investors (notably Kent Plumley)[9][12] the two developed a telephony DTMF tone receiver based on Cowpland's Ph.D. thesis. This was a major advance in the technology since they were able to sell receivers at a fraction of the cost of competing versions, while gaining returns of 1000%. Additionally, Mitel later became a chip manufacturer with the acquisition of the Silek foundry in Bromont, Quebec.
Later the pair realized that the then new technology of microprocessors and other semiconductor devices would make a similar change in the market for small PBXs. The SX200 PBX launched to immense success, being cheaper to purchase, quicker to install and far more functional. Mitel became one of the more successful manufacturers of small PBX systems and telecom semiconductors in the world, floating on the New York Stock Exchange in 1981.
In 1985, British Telecom bought a controlling interest in Mitel. Cowpland would later form the company that became Corel and Matthews later founded Newbridge Networks.
Newbridge Networks[edit]
In 1986, Matthews drove Newbridge to become a leader in the worldwide data networking industry, manufacturing data communications products, especially ATM devices and routers. In 2000 the company employed more than 6,500 employees with recorded FY 1999 revenue of $1.8 billion. Later in 2000, Newbridge was acquired by Alcatel[13] for $7.1 billion. Matthews' personal stake in Newbridge was valued at over a billion dollars, and as a result of the transaction he became the largest single shareholder in Alcatel.
Return to Mitel[edit]
In 2000, he reacquired the Mitel PBX business and company name, taking it private. He has invested heavily ($600 million by 2006) in Mitel to turn it into a broadband communications company. The company has made significant investments in enterprise Voice over IP telephony technology. Mitel's manufacturing business was spun off as BreconRidge. The company acquired Intertel in April 2007.[14] Mitel went public again in 2010.[15] Mitel announced the purchase of Aastra Technologies in November 2013.[16] Mitel announced the purchase of Mavenir Systems in March 2015.[17] Mitel announced the purchase of Polycom in April 2016[18], however, the deal fell through and Polycom instead merged with private equity firm Siris Capital Group.[19]

Additionally, Matthews serves on the board of directors for a number of high tech companies and chairs Solace Systems, [21] and CounterPath Corporation.[22]
Wales[edit]
Matthews spends a considerable amount of time in his native Wales, working on such ventures as the Celtic Manor Resort, a leisure complex in Newport, near the south Wales coast, chosen to host the 2010 Ryder Cup golf tournament and the 2014 NATO summit.[23][24] The Celtic Manor hosted the ISPS Handa Wales Open for 15 years. The original Celtic Manor Hotel was formerly a maternity hospital and is Matthews' birthplace.[6][25]
Matthews bought Celtic Manor in 1980, ploughing £100m into the project. Firstly the 19th century Manor House was renovated, while in 1991 plans were unveiled to develop two new golf courses and a convention centre between the manor and the River Usk. Matthews had become friends with golf course architect, the late Robert Trent Jones Snr, whose family roots were in Aberystwyth. Work began on the 'Roman Road' course in 1992, named after the main route connecting the former Roman fortress of Caerleon with the town of Caerwent, which crosses the land. In 1994 the 4,000-yard 'Coldra Woods' golf course was started, as well as the £10m golf clubhouse hotel.[26]
Celtic Manor was Hotel of the Year in 2002, and won two European Design Awards in 2001 - one for the interior designers, Goff Associates, and one for its spa from the International Spa Association. Matthews commented that: "I think the resort can act as a magnet to draw new investment into Wales from across the UK and overseas. I did my best to put up a building that you can see from the West End of London and I didn't come far short of it!".[26]
In September 2014, Matthews was appointed chairman of the Swansea Bay City Region Board.[27][28][29][30][31] The Swansea Bay City Region Board is backing a Swansea Tidal Lagoon project.[32]
In January 2016, he purchased the Hilton Hotel in Newport.
Philanthropy[edit]
Matthews founded the Wesley Clover Foundation, a not-for-profit, philanthropic corporation that supports entrepreneurship, healthcare, education, and community initiatives. The foundation leased the properties formerly known as the Nepean National Equestrian Park and the Ottawa Municipal Campground to create Wesley Clover Parks.[33][34] Matthews hosts an annual gala, Lumière, that has raised over $1 Million for charity.[35]
Honours[edit]
In 1994, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE).
In 1998, he was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering.[4]
In June 2001, he was conferred the honour of Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in the Queen's Birthday Honours. He was knighted by HM The Queen at an investiture in Buckingham Palace.
Matthews has received honorary doctorates from the University of Wales (Glamorgan and Swansea), and Carleton University.[36] In 2006 he was awarded an Honorary Degree (Doctor of Engineering) from the University of Bath.
In 2011, he was appointed Patron of the Cancer Stem Cell Research Institute at Cardiff University.[37]

Early life[edit]
Matthews was born in Newport, South Wales, at the then Lydia Beynon Maternity Hospital. Matthews returned as an adult to include the manor house that housed the hospital within the Celtic Manor Resort. He grew up in the town of Newbridge, Caerphilly. He studied at Swansea University and received a bachelor's degree in electronics in 1969.[9]
Career[edit]
After an apprenticeship at British Telecom's research lab at Martlesham Heath, Matthews left Britain and joined MicroSystems International, a chipmaking operation affiliated with Northern Telecom (which became Nortel Networks) in Ottawa, Canada.[10]

Early life[edit]
Matthews was born in Newport, South Wales, at the then Lydia Beynon Maternity Hospital. Matthews returned as an adult to include the manor house that housed the hospital within the Celtic Manor Resort. He grew up in the town of Newbridge, Caerphilly. He studied at Swansea University and received a bachelor's degree in electronics in 1969.[9]
Career[edit]
After an apprenticeship at British Telecom's research lab at Martlesham Heath, Matthews left Britain and joined MicroSystems International, a chipmaking operation affiliated with Northern Telecom (which became Nortel Networks) in Ottawa, Canada.[10]
Mitel[edit]
Matthews' first enterprise was started in collaboration with fellow Briton and Microsystems employee Michael Cowpland in 1972.[10] To raise seed money for future enterprises they had planned, the pair intended to import and sell electric lawnmowers built in the UK. Conventionally and as well accounts by Terry Matthews the name Mitel is thought to be a contraction of "Mike and Terry's Lawnmowers".[9] However Cowpland is quoted as saying that it stands for "Mike and Terry ELectronics". This first endeavour was a fiasco; the shipping company carrying the first batch lost the container.[11] When the lawnmowers finally arrived, the ground was covered with snow in the Canadian winter and no one would buy them. Matthews later said "That taught me a key lesson — the importance of timing. The shipping company lost the lawnmowers! By the time they showed up no-one wanted them, as you can't cut grass when it's covered with snow."[10]
Mitel became a technology consultancy company run from home to the various companies around Ottawa's emerging high-tech district. Mitel's clients included the National Research Council, the Communications Research Centre, and a handful of pioneering start-ups including SHL Systemhouse which was later purchased by EDS and now is part of HP and Quasar Systems (now Cognos).
Obtaining funding from a $4,000 bank loan and as well from their own savings and a group of angel investors (notably Kent Plumley)[9][12] the two developed a telephony DTMF tone receiver based on Cowpland's Ph.D. thesis. This was a major advance in the technology since they were able to sell receivers at a fraction of the cost of competing versions, while gaining returns of 1000%. Additionally, Mitel later became a chip manufacturer with the acquisition of the Silek foundry in Bromont, Quebec.
Later the pair realized that the then new technology of microprocessors and other semiconductor devices would make a similar change in the market for small PBXs. The SX200 PBX launched to immense success, being cheaper to purchase, quicker to install and far more functional. Mitel became one of the more successful manufacturers of small PBX systems and telecom semiconductors in the world, floating on the New York Stock Exchange in 1981.
In 1985, British Telecom bought a controlling interest in Mitel. Cowpland would later form the company that became Corel and Matthews later founded Newbridge Networks.
Newbridge Networks[edit]
In 1986, Matthews drove Newbridge to become a leader in the worldwide data networking industry, manufacturing data communications products, especially ATM devices and routers. In 2000 the company employed more than 6,500 employees with recorded FY 1999 revenue of $1.8 billion. Later in 2000, Newbridge was acquired by Alcatel[13] for $7.1 billion. Matthews' personal stake in Newbridge was valued at over a billion dollars, and as a result of the transaction he became the largest single shareholder in Alcatel.
Return to Mitel[edit]
In 2000, he reacquired the Mitel PBX business and company name, taking it private. He has invested heavily ($600 million by 2006) in Mitel to turn it into a broadband communications company. The company has made significant investments in enterprise Voice over IP telephony technology. Mitel's manufacturing business was spun off as BreconRidge. The company acquired Intertel in April 2007.[14] Mitel went public again in 2010.[15] Mitel announced the purchase of Aastra Technologies in November 2013.[16] Mitel announced the purchase of Mavenir Systems in March 2015.[17] Mitel announced the purchase of Polycom in April 2016[18], however, the deal fell through and Polycom instead merged with private equity firm Siris Capital Group.[19]

Additionally, Matthews serves on the board of directors for a number of high tech companies and chairs Solace Systems, [21] and CounterPath Corporation.[22]
Wales[edit]
Matthews spends a considerable amount of time in his native Wales, working on such ventures as the Celtic Manor Resort, a leisure complex in Newport, near the south Wales coast, chosen to host the 2010 Ryder Cup golf tournament and the 2014 NATO summit.[23][24] The Celtic Manor hosted the ISPS Handa Wales Open for 15 years. The original Celtic Manor Hotel was formerly a maternity hospital and is Matthews' birthplace.[6][25]
Matthews bought Celtic Manor in 1980, ploughing £100m into the project. Firstly the 19th century Manor House was renovated, while in 1991 plans were unveiled to develop two new golf courses and a convention centre between the manor and the River Usk. Matthews had become friends with golf course architect, the late Robert Trent Jones Snr, whose family roots were in Aberystwyth. Work began on the 'Roman Road' course in 1992, named after the main route connecting the former Roman fortress of Caerleon with the town of Caerwent, which crosses the land. In 1994 the 4,000-yard 'Coldra Woods' golf course was started, as well as the £10m golf clubhouse hotel.[26]
Celtic Manor was Hotel of the Year in 2002, and won two European Design Awards in 2001 - one for the interior designers, Goff Associates, and one for its spa from the International Spa Association. Matthews commented that: "I think the resort can act as a magnet to draw new investment into Wales from across the UK and overseas. I did my best to put up a building that you can see from the West End of London and I didn't come far short of it!".[26]
In September 2014, Matthews was appointed chairman of the Swansea Bay City Region Board.[27][28][29][30][31] The Swansea Bay City Region Board is backing a Swansea Tidal Lagoon project.[32]
In January 2016, he purchased the Hilton Hotel in Newport.
Philanthropy[edit]
Matthews founded the Wesley Clover Foundation, a not-for-profit, philanthropic corporation that supports entrepreneurship, healthcare, education, and community initiatives. The foundation leased the properties formerly known as the Nepean National Equestrian Park and the Ottawa Municipal Campground to create Wesley Clover Parks.[33][34] Matthews hosts an annual gala, Lumière, that has raised over $1 Million for charity.[35]
Honours[edit]
In 1994, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE).
In 1998, he was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering.[4]
In June 2001, he was conferred the honour of Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in the Queen's Birthday Honours. He was knighted by HM The Queen at an investiture in Buckingham Palace.
Matthews has received honorary doctorates from the University of Wales (Glamorgan and Swansea), and Carleton University.[36] In 2006 he was awarded an Honorary Degree (Doctor of Engineering) from the University of Bath.
In 2011, he was appointed Patron of the Cancer Stem Cell Research Institute at Cardiff University.[37]

Terence H. MatthewsTerrence H. Matthews, businessman (b at Newbridge, Wales). Matthews began his career in telecommunications at the age of 16 at British Telecom Research Labs in his native Wales. While working there he continued to study and received Higher National Certificates in electrical and mechanical engineering. He also received an honours degree in electronics from University College of Wales, Swansea. Upon graduation, he left Wales for Canada, where he worked as an engineer at Microsystems International Ltd, a subsidiary of Northern Telecom. Ultimately he was promoted to manager of telecommunications product marketing.  Matthews was a cofounder of Mitel Corporation in 1975. In his first 10 years at Mitel, he directed marketing, sales and product management, developing the company to become a world leader of integrated circuits and electronic private switchboards. British Telecom bought controlling interest of Mitel in 1985, and in March 1986 Matthews left the company to found NEWBRIDGE NETWORKS CORPORATION.  As founder and chairman of Newbridge, Matthews provided the vision and leadership to recognize and capitalize on an expanding TDM market growth opportunity. Sales grew from $1 million in 1987 to $800 million in 1995.  Matthews is a fellow of both the Institution of Electrical Engineers and the University of Wales. He has received a doctor of technology degree from the University of Glamorgan, Wales, and a Doctor of Engineering degree from Carleton University. In May 1994, he was appointed an officer of the Order of the British Empire.  Matthews is also chairman of a number of high-technology companies including CrossKeys, West End Systems, TimeStep, Televittese, Castleton Systems, StarVision Multimedia Corporation and Tundra Semiconductor. He is also chairman of the UK company Celtic Inns.

Home > Employee Stock Ownership Plan


Markertek is an ESOP Company
Employee Owned, Managed and Operated.You're Dealing with Actual Owners!
At Markertek, we have always done things differently than the rest of the industry! That is why we decided in 2016 to make our employees actual equity stake owners in 100% of the company.We believe our employees should share in the success of our company in a tangible manner. This is the ultimate way to reward employees for their contributions to our ongoing success and growth. That’s why we created an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (“ESOP”). Participating in the ESOP program means employees are actual part owners of the company and benefit financially from a job well done. In this way, there is direct incentive for employees to work hard and take pride in what they do. It is also why we lead the broadcasting industry with the most energetic and knowledgeable employee-owners under the sun!Markertek Employees Share in the Success and Vision of the Company.
