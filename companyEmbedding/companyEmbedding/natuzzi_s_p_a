Open Art

From the union between Natuzzi and the world of art comes Natuzzi Open Art.
The endeavour has evolved out of the extraordinary passion of Pasquale Natuzzi for beauty in one of its most noble forms: art. The idea for Natuzzi Open Art took seed in 2007 through collaboration with Arnaldo Pomodoro for the Salone Del Mobile furniture fair in Milan. The project became official in April 2009, the goal being to bring art into Natuzzi stores and make it accessible, or ‘open’, to everyone. Natuzzi Open Art envisages the collaboration with contemporary artists of all backgrounds to create site-specific works of art brought to life inside Natuzzi's flagship stores around the world. The first collaboration was with sculptor Giacomo Benevelli, followed by partnerships with Nicola De Verme and Gianni Basso. The latest project, in December 2015, saw French artist Adrien Missika create an art installation at the Natuzzi Store in Miami.

          MORE DETAILS        











            2007          

ASTA CIELARE BY ARNALDO POMODORO
From the prestigious Collezione Pasquale Natuzzi, “Asta cielare”, by Arnaldo Pomodoro, master Italian sculptor and goldsmith. The sculpture, set into the ground, is an imposing 5.2 metre work in bronze, created in a cascade of colours, playing with light and shadow, in harmony with the tones and clean lines of the Collezione Pasquale Natuzzi. Immanent within the space, the sculpture by Arnaldo Pomodoro also stands in stark relief against its surroundings. 








            2009          

MATER NATURA BY GIACOMO BENEVELLI
A collection of accessories, sculptures in marble and bronze, on the theme of materiality and nature, by Giacomo Benevelli—one of the greatest exponents of contemporary abstract sculpture—born of his desire to enrich the potential of the accessory beyond mere functionality and good design, conferring upon it artistic value. Many of the works have been integrated into the Natuzzi collection. 








            2010          

SECRETELY BY NICOLA DEL VERME
The range of accessories designed by eclectic stylist and visionary, Nicola Del Verme, was conceived as the perfect synthesis between two seemingly disparate worlds, like those of interior design and fashion. Pieces of rigorous design that span artistically neighboring worlds such as sculpture and photography. In Secretly lies the force and value of a recollection, one dear and intimate, one that evokes the sweet scent of a memory or the dark anxiety of a secret. 








            2012          

FORMAE AQUAE BY GIANNI BASSO
A selection of stunning photographs by Gianni Basso, international design and lifestyle photographer, on the theme of water. With technical determination and poetic intuition, the artist has captured the characteristics of water in opposites, through color, shape and graphic gesture. A neverending quest for the exquisite, it is this constant tension with beauty that has united the worlds of Natuzzi and Basso, who together have explored new artistic perspectives. 








            2013          

THE SHAPE OF ENERGY BY FABRIZIO PLESSI
A work of explosive impact created by Fabrizio Plessi, in celebration of the dynamism, change and energy that has always driven Pasquale Natuzzi and his company. The primordial, hypnotic beauty of lava—the principle element of the artist’s work—appears to flow between the artwork and pieces of furniture. 








            2015          

ADRIEN MISSIKA
On the occasion of the grand opening of the Natuzzi flagship store in Miami on Wednesday, 2 December 2015, a site-specific installation by Adrien Missika (Paris, 1981) will be presented. Adrien Missika – French born artist, living between Berlin and Mexico City – has been invited by curator Myriam Ben Salah in recognition of his ability to translate his personal experience of an environment into art that can involve various media, from sculpture to photography, from installations to videos. The project will allow Missika to come into direct contact with Apulia - historically, a land of contamination – and with the company in all those aspects related to the design and the production, but also to the research on materials and the technological experimentation.

History[edit]
Pasquale Natuzzi was very young when he started his career. The son of a cabinet-maker, in 1959 at 19 years of age he opened a workshop in Taranto with three collaborators, producing sofas and armchairs for the local market. In 1962 he moved to Matera where he began to gain commercial experience. In 1967, still in Matera, Pasquale Natuzzi returned to the production of sofas and armchairs, this time on an industrial scale. In 1972 he founded Natuzzi Salotti S.r.l. One year later, following a fire that completely destroyed the Matera factory, Pasquale Natuzzi decided to relocate production to Santeramo in Colle (Bari – Italy), which is the modern-day headquarter of the Group.
Somewhere about the middle of the 1970s, Natuzzi took part for the first time in a furniture fair in Bari. Here started first contacts with customers from the Middle East: Saudi Arabia, Israel, Jordan. In 1976 Natuzzi exported 60% of the turnover in those countries, while 40% was realized in Italy.
The beginning of the 1980s was the turning point in Natuzzi Group's growth. During a trip to the United States, Pasquale Natuzzi spotted an opportunity to carry out a radical change of direction: "democratizing" the leather sofa, once a product for an elite niche. The first sofa sold at $999 in the United States was a Natuzzi, at Macy's.
Following the success in the United States, in 1985 Natuzzi Upholstery Inc. was established. Based in New York, the company was especially designed for the needs of its North American clients.[clarification needed] In 1998, further confirmation of the Group's strong ties with the American market was given by the inauguration in High Point, North Carolina, of a futuristic-looking building, designed by the architect Mario Bellini, housing the offices of Natuzzi Americas, with a showroom measuring 8,000 square metres.
With North American expansion continuing, the Group then went on to strengthen its presence in Italy and throughout Europe. The 1990s saw the opening in Taranto, on Pasquale Natuzzi's initiative, of the first shop in the franchising chain Divani & Divani by Natuzzi. There are 274 Natuzzi stores worldwide (mainly in Italy, Greece, Spain, Portugal, France, Switzerland, China, and Australia), and 335 Natuzzi Galleries, mainly in the United States and Northern Europe.
Today Pasquale Natuzzi personally oversees strategic activities relating to strengthening the brand with investments in product innovation and research, marketing, communication and staff training, working alongside the Group's managers to define future strategies.[citation needed]
Natuzzi products[edit]

History[edit]
Pasquale Natuzzi was very young when he started his career. The son of a cabinet-maker, in 1959 at 19 years of age he opened a workshop in Taranto with three collaborators, producing sofas and armchairs for the local market. In 1962 he moved to Matera where he began to gain commercial experience. In 1967, still in Matera, Pasquale Natuzzi returned to the production of sofas and armchairs, this time on an industrial scale. In 1972 he founded Natuzzi Salotti S.r.l. One year later, following a fire that completely destroyed the Matera factory, Pasquale Natuzzi decided to relocate production to Santeramo in Colle (Bari – Italy), which is the modern-day headquarter of the Group.
Somewhere about the middle of the 1970s, Natuzzi took part for the first time in a furniture fair in Bari. Here started first contacts with customers from the Middle East: Saudi Arabia, Israel, Jordan. In 1976 Natuzzi exported 60% of the turnover in those countries, while 40% was realized in Italy.
The beginning of the 1980s was the turning point in Natuzzi Group's growth. During a trip to the United States, Pasquale Natuzzi spotted an opportunity to carry out a radical change of direction: "democratizing" the leather sofa, once a product for an elite niche. The first sofa sold at $999 in the United States was a Natuzzi, at Macy's.
Following the success in the United States, in 1985 Natuzzi Upholstery Inc. was established. Based in New York, the company was especially designed for the needs of its North American clients.[clarification needed] In 1998, further confirmation of the Group's strong ties with the American market was given by the inauguration in High Point, North Carolina, of a futuristic-looking building, designed by the architect Mario Bellini, housing the offices of Natuzzi Americas, with a showroom measuring 8,000 square metres.
With North American expansion continuing, the Group then went on to strengthen its presence in Italy and throughout Europe. The 1990s saw the opening in Taranto, on Pasquale Natuzzi's initiative, of the first shop in the franchising chain Divani & Divani by Natuzzi. There are 274 Natuzzi stores worldwide (mainly in Italy, Greece, Spain, Portugal, France, Switzerland, China, and Australia), and 335 Natuzzi Galleries, mainly in the United States and Northern Europe.
Today Pasquale Natuzzi personally oversees strategic activities relating to strengthening the brand with investments in product innovation and research, marketing, communication and staff training, working alongside the Group's managers to define future strategies.[citation needed]
