Private Vista Story
Family Time

Arnie and Louise are conservative by nature and love to save. So they never really saw vacations as an element of a meaningful lifetime gifting program. But through our planning and analysis, we connected their love of children and grandchildren with their desire to see their family enjoy an annual gift.
So we asked, why not gift a family vacation?
Now, part of Arnie and Louise’s financial plan includes annual gifts that fund family vacations that enrich their lives with priceless memories. Just don’t forget the camera.

Private Vista Story
Lost & Found

When her husband passed unexpectedly, Judith was at a loss. How will she fill the gap in her life and in her financial affairs?
Judith never handled the household finances. Her holdings were spread wide and far, and the only clues were in boxes of paperwork in the basement. We went through the boxes, and took Judith through our planning process.
In the end, Judith’s estate and retirement plans as well as her daily finances were put in good order. With that all “set”, Judith can determine “ready” and “go” for herself.

Sam and Tanya are physicians and first generation immigrants. They work hard and save. Their idea of financial planning was to balance their checkbook and walk the results to their advisor’s office.
When they came to us, they had accumulated significant assets, but never considered how those assets might enrich their lives. Upon our analysis, they were shocked to find they could retire immediately if they wanted to. Without delay, Tanya asked, “If this is the case, can I stop clipping coupons in the Sunday paper every week?”
Of course, it’s up to you—just don’t run with the scissors.

Private Vista Story
Business Sense

Todd built a successful compliance business. Along the way, he started selling safety products to the same clients. The compliance division, while profitable, brought high liability and long hours. The products division had low liability and reasonable hours.
After reviewing his resources and exploring his vision for the life he wanted, Todd’s Private Vista became clear: Collect the fees from the compliance business and close it down, continue selling the products, and spend the extra well-earned time in the North Woods with the grandchildren.
No more wishing for time, it’s time for fishing.

Private Vista Story
Uncharted Waters

Roxanne was 52-years-old and scared. Divorcing her husband of 20 years and the father of her two teenage daughters was not in her life plan. But here she was staring at the proposed division of assets, liabilities, income and expenses—all numbers on a piece of paper. Up to now, Roxanne hadn’t handled her finances and was worried about her future.
We listened, we understood, we educated; and then, we analyzed the numbers and showed Roxanne a comprehensive, financial plan, which provided options for her future. Her waters were charted again and she was ready to confidently set sail.
Roxanne untied the knot, but she didn’t get tangled up in the process.

William spent a year commuting from his home and family in one city to work in another, often staying for several days. William was missing his family grow up, so he came to us with a question: Can I afford to relocate my family near my work where the cost of living is higher?
As a senior executive, William’s compensation package was complicated. We analyzed the financial impact of the move, both short term and long term, and came to William with this answer: Money is no issue, it’s your move.

The Ascent.

Our Process


Many of our clients come to us for specific financial questions, and then, as our relationship grows, we tackle broader financial issues, such as developing a plan for achieving bigger life goals.
We call this the path to finding your Private Vista. It emerges through four phases.






01
It’s About You.
We learn about your financial resources, and review your investment statements, tax returns, insurance policies and copies of estate documents. We assess current commitments and work through personal expenses and cash flow. We discuss your views and explore your passions and goals. We begin exploring what a life fulfilled looks like to you.


02
What’s Important to You.
Once we’ve collected the data and begun to understand your story, we analyze and summarize the documents as they impact your plan. We model your current financial status, develop ideas and concepts and test them in order to provide preliminary recommendations.


03
What’s Possible for You.
Our presentation of your plan will be like a personal journey, where you see an inventory of your financial resources connected to your life goals. You will be able to make decisions on our recommendations based on feedback from our scenario-based planning tools. By the end of the presentation you will have an action plan for achieving your broader vision for a life well lived.


04
How it Becomes Reality for You.
As the plan is implemented, we communicate as often as needed to review investment strategy and deal with any issues as they come up. We also schedule an annual meeting to confirm that your financial resources continue to align with the life you imagined from your Private Vista.





 


Make Plans.

Your Life Enriched


What’s your specific question?

When can I retire?
How do I handle my finances after a divorce or a death of a spouse?
How should I invest my assets?
Should I sell my business now?

Like many financial advisors, we have extensive financial planning, money management and investment strategy experience to apply to a broad range of financial issues.
But as our client relationship grows, you’ll find that beyond your original issue, we can also help you with the bigger issue of imagining the life you want. Then, based on your current and future goals, we apply the right set of comprehensive services to align your financial resources with the life you imagined.






Your PrivateVista.

Financial Planning


 
Our comprehensive and integrated approach to the services we provide is what sets us apart. Every client gets a view of how all these areas affect each other under the same microscope at one time, not use them as they may become of interest over time. We view all the issues as one integrated plan at the same time. That’s how we ensure you that you will find your private vista.

Investment Management


 
At Private Vista we believe that diversification, asset allocation, discipline and patience are effective strategies to minimize risk and provide opportunities to grow your assets. We provide fee-based services and are under no obligation to push proprietary products, which means that our only incentive is to serve your best interests.
Our experienced financial professionals collaborate with you to construct a portfolio that strives to find the efficient frontier—the asset mix that provides the highest return for your personal level of risk. A comprehensive process of due diligence, consistent monitoring and periodic rebalancing ensures that your portfolio continues to meet the objectives of your financial plan over time.






 


Women Connected.

Embrace Your Financial Independence



­Welcome to Project Venus℠  where women are connected, supported and inspired to enrich their lives through financial planning, education and partnership.
At some point in their lives, nine out of ten women will be solely responsible for their finances. Are you prepared to make financial decisions that will enrich your life?  If you’re In Transition due to divorce or becoming widowed, or currently Out of Touch with your financial planning, we can help you address your fears, find your vision, gain confidence and add clarity.
Achieve your life vision
Unlike a typical financial program that solely focuses on income, budgets and investments, Project Venus℠ also helps you explore your life passions and goals so that you can make the right financial decisions for you and your loved ones.
Through workshops, educational and social events, newsletters and private consultation, we help you focus on your vision for the future and then work with you to design a financial plan to get you there. We call it the path to your Private Vista. It’s much easier to go down the path when you’re connected with a community of like-minded women.
To learn more about upcoming events, or to sign up for our Project Venus™ newsletter, contact Nicole Romito at 312-831-4378 or nromito@myprivatevista.com. Or Mary Beth McLean at 630-835-0105 or mbmclean@myprivatevista.com 






In Transition.

Life changes, and so can you


We don’t need to tell you that life transitions are difficult. We work with many women who are divorced or widowed, and suddenly have to take care of their financial affairs. We hear them ask questions like, Should I keep the house? How do I know if my divorce settlement or my current financial situation will allow me to maintain my lifestyle without running out of money? Do I need to go back to work? In a welcoming environment we’ll help you learn about your finances, refocus on your future and even connect you with others facing similar issues.












Out of Touch.

Little time or confidence to plan


Perhaps your partner takes care of the finances. Or maybe you’re single or the family breadwinner and don’t have the time or confidence to start planning your future. We know for some women, the thought of money overwhelms or scares them. We all deal with different life experiences, emotions and ideas around how to best manage the money. In a welcoming environment, we’ll help you learn about your finances, focus on your future and even connect you with others facing similar issues.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.

CHICAGO, Oct. 20, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Two wealth management firms - - Financial Strategy Network (FSN) in Chicago and WNA Wealth Advisors in Hinsdale - - have merged into Private Vista, LLC, a new forward-thinking, independent wealth management company, announced Bob Westrick, a Private Vista partner. Chicago-based Private Vista is one of the first wealth management firms to offer its clients a unique process for integrating its financial planning and investment management services with a client's personal plan for living a more enriched and fulfilling life.


With combined assets of $1.2 billion under management in its Chicago and Hinsdale offices and nearly 1,000 clients in 38 states, Private Vista is a growing force as an independent wealth management firm in the Chicago area, and will rank among the top Chicago area independent wealth management firms on several industry lists, according to Westrick.
"We have set our sights on not only becoming one of the top wealth management firms in the Chicago area, but also emerging as an innovative company that truly makes a difference in our clients' lives," said Westrick, a former guest financial expert on WGN-Radio.
Private Vista's approach to wealth management differs from other, more traditional firms, added Westrick. "We have broadened our focus beyond financial outcomes as a key measure of success to include a client's quality of life. Private Vista's personalized planning process and tools will help each client identify and attain his or her life hopes, dreams and ambitions.
"Clients traditionally ask: 'When can I retire?' Or, 'Do I have the right investment strategy?' But, they rarely think of those decisions in the context of how they want to live their lives," he continued. "We help them make that connection, which often leads to profound changes in the financial and life decisions our clients make."
About FSN, WNA Wealth Advisors and Private Vista, LLCFSN was founded in Chicago in 1992. Now, as Private Vista, its corporate offices remain at 1 N. LaSalle St., 33rd floor, in Chicago's Loop and its clients now have the option to meet with its advisors in Chicago or Hinsdale.
WNA Wealth Advisors has served hundreds of clients around the U.S. since its incorporation in 1993. Now, as Private Vista, its offices remain at 120 E. Ogden Ave., Suite 130, Hinsdale.
Together as Private Vista, the two firms have 30 wealth management professionals and staff who offer clients a wide range of financial services as well as an insightful journey into what makes their lives meaningful.

Our Vision

 


A New Vision Comes into Focus.

Our Vision


On one level, Private Vista is the merger of two successful financial services firms with promising futures: Financial Strategy Network (FSN) in Chicago and WNA Wealth Advisors in Hinsdale, Illinois.
On a deeper level, it’s a union of two similar visions for addressing a void in the wealth management industry. Together, we have evolved our financial planning and investment management services. We provide a unique path for viewing current and future financial resources, not only as a way to provide food on the table and a roof overhead, but also as means for enriching lives. Then, together, we are able to provide deeper and broader resources for devising and implementing the strategies and plans to help you reach the vision of your life enriched—your Private Vista. Enjoy the view!







...here are some answers

FAQ



What do you mean by Wealth Management Evolved℠?
Wealth management traditionally focuses on managing financial issues based on client questions, “How much money can I make and how much do I need?”
We base our wealth management services on our questions, “What fulfills your life now and how do you envision your life in the future?”
Our evolution is in the process through which our clients inventory, prioritize and articulate their goals so that for the first time, their financial decisions are motivated by their life direction, not the other way around.
Your Private Vista, then, is your view of the life you want to live and the financial decisions you’ll make to clear that path.
How do you help me inventory, prioritize and articulate my life goals?
From all our years of asking questions about life aspirations, passions, talents and purpose, we have mapped out an insightful journey of self-discovery for our clients. In fact, many of our clients think of this as sort of a personal life planning retreat. We find our clients are often considering how they might enrich their current and future lives for the first time.
The result of this personal journey is a view of resources, both financial and life, and goals for how to invest them. This is what we call a Private Vista, and it informs the financial planning and wealth management process.
What is a Registered Investment Advisory Firm?
Private Vista is an Registered Investment Advisory Firm, meaning that we’re registered with and regulated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). We are deemed a fiduciary by law. We also file an annual report to the SEC and states where we operate. The report includes our services, our clients, and how we’re compensated. This report is available upon request or at the SEC’s website.
What is a fiduciary?
A fiduciary advisor role is generally relationship driven with fees for compensation, while a non-fiduciary advisor role is often transaction driven with commissions as compensation.
A fiduciary must act in utmost good faith, and place clients’ best interests above all else. Private Vista is an independent firm that holds itself to a fiduciary standard. This distinguishes us from non-fiduciary advisors who might be employed by companies that sell financial products like a brokerage firm or insurance company.


How does Private Vista get compensated?
Financial Planning: Our planning is fee-based. Because transparency is imperative, we meet with clients initially at no cost to determine the right work scope and a commensurate fixed fee. Once clients agree to move forward, most of them revisit their plan annually at a reduced planning fee.
Investment Management: Management fees are distinct from planning fees. They are based on a fixed percentage of assets under management, which declines as assets increase. This fee is charged quarterly on the total assets Private Vista manages for a client. A current fee schedule is available upon request.
What do the certification initials after a professional’s name really mean?
In general, they mean that our professionals have put the time and study into learning theory and best practices for financial planning, wealth management, portfolio management, retirement income and a host of other services we offer.
Together, they mean that we offer a comprehensive range of experience and expertise to each Private Vista client to leverage as needed.
Finally, they mean that we have a solid foundation in our field from which to focus our innovations on adding real value to our clients’ experience.
Here are the specific certifications a variety of our professional have earned:
CFP®, Certified Financial Planner™
CPA, Certified Public Accountant
JD, Juris Doctor
MBA, Masters in Business Administration
CIMA®, Certified Investment Management Analyst®
ChFC®, Chartered Financial Consultant®
CPC, Certified Pension Consultant
RICP®, Retirement Income Certified Professional®
CLU®, Chartered Life Underwriter®
