Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration.

Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.

Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.

Zacks Rank:



 




Style Scores:



NA Value | NA Growth | NA Momentum | NA VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score
A


VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

All shares of our common stock offered by this prospectus are being 
registered for the account of the selling stockholders. We will not 
receive any of the proceeds from the sale of these shares.


There is significant competition in the Direct Response industry from both 
small and large companies since there are really no barriers to entry.  As 
a result, there are literally hundreds of direct response companies that 
operate in the US and off a wide variety of products across all categories 
of consumer goods. 

The Company will have to rely on the skills of its management to pick 
products which produce successful direct response marketing campaigns 
and ultimately profits to the Company.


Company Description
The Company is a development stage company that is in the process of 
implementing its business plan, but has had no revenues to date.  We are 
not a blank check Company and have no plans or intention to engage in a 
merger or acquisition with an unidentified company, companies, entity or 
person,


 nor do we nor any of our affiliates intend for the Company, once 
it is publicly traded, to be used as a vehicle for some other private 
company to become a publicly traded company. 

Insynergy Products, Inc. (formerly Insynergy, Inc.) (the "Company") was 
incorporated in the State of Nevada on January 26, 2010 to engage in Direct 
Response retail marketing and sale of  consumer products through Television 
and the Internet, followed up for successful products with more traditional 
distribution and sale of such products through traditional retail outlets, 
once a brand for the product has been established. 

Our current headquarters are located at 4705 Laurel Canyon Blvd., Suite 205, 
Studio City, CA 91607. Our website is located at www.insynergyproducts.com. 
Our telephone number is (818)760-1644.
