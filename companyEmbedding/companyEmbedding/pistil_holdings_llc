Real Estate Agent reviews in Gold River

        Real People ~ Real Reviews ~ Real Results      




Provider name locked. and team are consummate professionals, very knowledgable and friendly, flexible, and were willing to go the extra mile for us. That aspect is what makes all the difference. Many people do their job, only few go above and beyond. Provider name locked. does.
From the beginning of the process- viewing homes,  responsiveness,  making superb referrals of attorney and lender, and communication throughout was perfect. Her assistant Provider name locked. is also great. Provider name locked. has excellent organizational skills, that really help considering all the details and paperwork involved. I recommend Provider name locked. without reservation
 

            - SHELLEY B.          




Dawn and Provider name locked. are the best out there.  They helped me find my boutique in Fishers.  With the real estate so popular in the area, they were able to get us right in to see the space and even neg. the deal for us.  Talk about prompt service and women who really care about their clients.  I highly recommend their service if you are looking for a new place!
 

            - Tonya S.          




My experience with Provider name locked. 's real estate service always go very well for me. I have contacted her multiple times to support my real estate needs.
