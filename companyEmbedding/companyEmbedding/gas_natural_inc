Gas Natural Inc. Reports 2017 First Quarter Results






Business Wire




May 10, 2017 6:30 AM EDT













 


















































  Gas Natural Inc. (NYSE MKT:EGAS) (the "Company"), a holding company operating local natural gas utilities serving approximately 70,000 customers in four states, reported financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2017.   First Quarter 2017 Summary    Net income per share improved to $0.32 from $0.26 in the prior-year quarter   Full service distribution throughput increased 13%, aided by the addition of approximately 300 new customers in the quarter   Merger approval process with regulators remains on plan for second half 2017 closing    Mr. Gregory J. Osborne, Gas Natural's President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "We continue to focus on providing excellent service to our customers in all of our utility jurisdictions, resulting in growth in full service distribution and gross margin. Additionally, our ongoing focus on cost discipline has contributed to improved earnings."  He added, "The regulatory approval process for our announced merger with First Reserve continues on plan. We expect completion of the transaction in the second half of 2017."                                       First Quarter 2017 Operations Review                Three Months Ended     (in thousands)         March 31,             2017       2016     Revenue by segment:                       Natural Gas         $   35,919       $   35,064     Marketing & Production             3,940           3,243     Consolidated         $   39,859       $   38,307                              Revenue for the first quarter of 2017 increased approximately 4% over the prior-year quarter. Both of the Company's operating segments contributed to the increase. The Natural Gas segment grew due to: 1) customer growth, primarily in Maine and Montana; 2) colder weather in certain of the Company's markets, including Montana and Maine; 3) generally higher natural gas prices; and 4) the inclusion of cancellation fee revenue for a terminated long-term customer contract in Maine. The Marketing & Production segment recognized higher revenue due to increased volumes sold as a result of colder weather in its relevant markets.                            Changes in Gross Margin (in thousands)          Three Months Ended             March 31, 2017     2016 Gross Margin         $   14,745         Utilities sold           (17   )     Weather and other volume changes           479       New utility customers           249       Other changes             164         Natural Gas change             875         Lost marketing customer and pricing           (85   )     Pricing and production volume             29         Marketing & Production change             (56   )     Consolidated gross margin change             819         2017 Gross Margin         $   15,564                            Gross margin for the first quarter of 2017 increased 6% compared with the prior-year quarter. The increase was primarily due to several factors: 1) higher volume due to increased usage and colder weather in the Company's Montana and Maine markets, partially offset by warmer weather in its North Carolina and Ohio markets; 2) higher volume driven by customer growth; and 3) cancellation fee revenue with no associated cost, resulting from the termination of a long-term customer contract in Maine. Customer count grew by approximately 300 in the first quarter, compared with the end of 2016.                                                 Three Months Ended     (in thousands)         March 31,             2017       2016     Operating income by segment:                           Natural Gas         $   6,096         $   5,517       Marketing & Production           49           83       Corporate & Other             (218   )           (103   )     Consolidated         $   5,927           $   5,497                                     Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA*         $   8,432         $   7,668                                    *See the attached tables for important disclosures regarding the Company's use of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-recurring expenses and discontinued operations ("Adjusted EBITDA") as well as reconciliations of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") net income to non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA for the 2017 and 2016 first quarters.  For the first quarter of 2017, operating income was $0.4 million higher than the prior-year quarter due to higher gross margin partially offset by higher operating expenses.

CLEVELAND, June 21, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Gas Natural Inc. (NYSE MKT: EGAS) (the "Company"), a holding company operating local natural gas utilities serving approximately 68,000 customers in four states, announced that it has filed its definitive proxy materials with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") in connection with the Company's 2016 Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held on July 27, 2016.  Gas Natural shareholders of record at the close of business on May 27, 2016 are entitled to vote at the 2016 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. 


The Gas Natural Board of Directors strongly recommends that shareholders vote on the GREEN proxy card "FOR" all six of Gas Natural's qualified and experienced director nominees:  Michael B. Bender, James P. Carney, Richard K. Greaves, Robert B. Johnston, Gregory J. Osborne and Michael R. Winter.
In conjunction with the filing and mailing of its definitive proxy statement, Gas Natural is mailing a letter to shareholders detailing the significant progress and accomplishments under the leadership of the Gas Natural Board and management team over the past two years.  The letter also addresses Richard M. Osborne's committee, which has not provided an alternative strategic plan to drive additional value for Gas Natural shareholders, and is only suggesting different director nominees.
Gas Natural's definitive proxy materials, letter to shareholders and other materials regarding the Board's recommendation for the 2016 Annual Meeting of Shareholders can be found at http://proxy.egas.net.
The full text of the letter follows:
June 21, 2016
Dear Fellow Shareholder, 
Your Board of Directors and management team are transforming Gas Natural.  We have been – and will continue to be – the agents of change for your Company.  Within the last two years, we have overhauled management and the Board of Directors and brought greater sophistication and experience to Gas Natural.  

We are taking decisive actions to become a premier natural gas utility in the regions in which we operate and are restoring relationships with our stakeholders that were lost under the watch of the previous management team and board.  
We disposed of resource-demanding, low return operations.  
We made significant progress, ridding the Company of transactions, contracts and entanglements with companies related to the former Chairman and CEO, Richard M. Osborne, that raised the concern of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio ("PUCO").   
And, we gained shareholder support, with our largest shareholder being represented on our Board.  
At our 2016 Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held on July 27, 2016, you face an important decision regarding the future of Gas Natural and your investment.  You are being asked to elect the directors who you believe are the most qualified to complete the transformation of Gas Natural.  Your current Board is the change that Gas Natural has needed in a time of significant regulatory and shareholder scrutiny.  We have led this transformation to an inflection point and have the knowledge and expertise to drive our strategy forward to deliver superior value.  
We strongly recommend that you elect our highly qualified leaders by voting FOR ALL of your Board's experienced nominees – Michael B. Bender, James P. Carney, Richard K. Greaves, Robert B. Johnston, Gregory J. Osborne and Michael R. Winter.  
To elect Gas Natural's Board of Director nominees, we encourage you to vote TODAY by signing and dating the enclosed GREEN proxy card and returning it in the postage-paid envelope provided. Remember, if you hold your shares at a bank or broker you can vote your shares by telephone or via the internet.  
As you may recall, Richard M. Osborne, Gas Natural's former Chairman and CEO, was removed in 2014 amidst regulatory inquiries, derivative lawsuits and an unprecedented investigation in Ohio.  In retaliation, he brought several lawsuits against the Company and started a business that competes with our Ohio utilities.  Now he has formed "The Committee to Re-Energize Gas Natural" and has nominated six of his own director candidates for election to your Board.  Please DO NOT return or vote any WHITE proxy card sent to you by Richard M. Osborne and his so-called "committee."  
When Richard M. Osborne was dismissed from Gas Natural, our regulatory relations were at an all-time low.  Under Richard M. Osborne's leadership, two consecutive regulatory audits in Ohio (covering periods from 2009 through mid-2012) resulted in significant losses for the Ohio utilities and directives by the PUCO to end related party transactions.  Ultimately, Richard M. Osborne refused to follow the direction of the regulators and in November 2013 the PUCO ordered an investigative audit into the management practices under Richard M. Osborne.  
We are successfully transforming Gas Natural to drive greater earnings power and growth
Since Richard M. Osborne's dismissal in May 2014, we began the long process of repairing relationships with our regulators, restoring morale throughout our organization, improving corporate governance, right-sizing the organization, redirecting capital investment to improve the opportunity for higher returns and strengthening our relationship with our lenders.  
As evidence of the progress we are making with our regulators, the PUCO recently approved a stipulated settlement between our Ohio utilities and the PUCO staff regarding the investigative audit.  The audit was completed in January 2015 by Rehmann Corporate Investigative Services.  The order specifically states: 
"The findings of Rehmann were noteworthy in part, because all of the issues identified with respect to the operations and management of the Companies, took place during the time Richard Osborne was CEO and chairman of the board of directors of the companies." (emphasis added)  
Since Richard M. Osborne's removal, with strong leadership and positive direction for the Company, we have:
Strengthened our financial structure.  We recently requested regulatory approvals for a complete refinancing of our debt that simplifies our balance sheet, provides greater financial flexibility and will further facilitate growth.
Improved internal controls and procedures.  We retained an independent audit firm to assist in the establishment of processes, procedures and documentation for effective processing of transactional data, informed decision-making, required checks and balances, and sound corporate governance.  This included changes in personnel.
Eliminated related-party transactions.  We unwound prior relationships with Richard M. Osborne's companies, other than those to which we are contractually obligated or are necessary to serve customers, and we established additional practices for engaging with independent third parties.
Disposed of resource-consuming assets and directed resources toward core earning assets.  We sold non-core assets and operations in Wyoming, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and Ohio and generated nearly $20 million in cash from the divestiture.  
Grew our customer base.  During the two year period ended March 31, 2016, we realized customer growth of 31% and 26% in our emerging markets of Maine and North Carolina, respectively, in addition to moderate growth in our more mature markets of Ohio and Montana.  
These accomplishments are a product of our tireless efforts to fix the damage caused to your company under Richard M. Osborne.
We are poised to realize the benefits of our Strategic Plan
We made tough business decisions to establish a solid foundation for stronger earnings power and improved returns.  We have achieved this goal while building a healthy work environment for our employees and providing our customers with safe, reliable, competitively-priced natural gas service.  
The foundation of our Company is stronger as a result of the following:

Reduced headcount by over 25% to improve efficiency and morale; 
Re-prioritized investments and borrowed capital to advance our growth plan; and 
Aligned the dividend with current earnings and capital needs to execute our growth plan; lowered the payout ratio to be commensurate with peers by reducing the dividend to an annual rate of $0.30 per share from $0.54 per share.  
We have a growth plan that includes increasing our customer base and expanding throughput with capital investments aimed at higher returns, as well as finding strategic smaller, incremental acquisitions or larger, transformative acquisitions to supplement that organic growth.  
Our goal is to achieve returns on equity significantly above the roughly 5% we have averaged over the last five years and, ultimately, to surpass the level of our past dividend.  
Your Board is highly qualified and independent, with the experience necessary to drive lasting shareholder value
Over the last two years since the ouster of Richard M. Osborne, we have measurably strengthened your Board and improved corporate governance.  

The Board is now comprised of six highly experienced and qualified directors, four of whom were newly elected to the Board since Richard M. Osborne departed, replacing the directors that were on the Board when he was Chairman. 
Five of the six directors are independent, contributing to strong corporate governance.  
Two of the directors represent our largest shareholder, with almost 10% of our outstanding shares, and we believe their interests are aligned with yours.  
The board adopted a new code of conduct, a new policy on insider trading and also adopted a nepotism and personal relationships policy on September 9, 2015.
Our directors are actively engaged in overseeing management as we execute our plans and strategies for creating long-term value for all our shareholders.
WE WANT YOU TO KNOW THE FACTS
Richard M. Osborne's platform is based on misrepresentations and distorted analysis  
IN FACT, during Richard M. Osborne's tenure, the PUCO initiated an investigation into the management practices at our Ohio utilities, primarily due to significant concerns over related party transactions between our Ohio utilities and Richard M. Osborne's companies, as well as what the PUCO described as flawed, unreasonable, and imprudent purchasing practices and designs.  

Richard M. Osborne has criticized us for customer refunds in 2015:  IN FACT, the refunds were required by the PUCO for the 2013-2014 Gas Cost Recovery audit period, when Richard M. Osborne was Chairman and CEO. 
During Richard M. Osborne's tenure, significant amounts of cash were deployed that have not delivered returns for our Company.  For example, from 2009 through 2013, his last five years leading Gas Natural, capital expenditures were nearly double the earnings of the Company. 
IN FACT, under Richard M. Osborne, our outstanding common stock increased more than two fold, from 4.4 million shares at the end of 2009 to 10.5 million shares four years later.  
IN FACT, these share issuances more than doubled the total annual dividend payment from $2.4 million in 2009 to $5.2 million in 2013.  Continuing to pay that level of dividend was disproportionate to our earnings and unsustainable, leading us to the difficult decision of reducing it.  
Richard M. Osborne's slate of directors possesses questionable business experience or lacks relevant utility experience and commitment to shareholder interests
Several of Richard M. Osborne's companies are undergoing bankruptcy proceedings, including John D. Oil and Gas Company, Great Plains Exploration, LLC, and Oz Gas, Ltd.  IN FACT, Richard M. Osborne currently has multiple actions pending before the bankruptcy court against him or his companies.  
IN FACT, the November 2013 PUCO order initiating the investigative audit, noted that during Richard M. Osborne's tenure as Chairman and CEO of Gas Natural: 

"The evidence shows that there is a severe organizational dysfunction within the companies and between the regulated companies and their non-regulated affiliates."  
"Senior management lacked basic utility experience." 
The recommendation for an audit "comes following a series of extremely frustrating audits of the companies, rife with self-dealing that demonstrates a remarkable lack of control."  
IN FACT, on June 15, 2016, an order was issued by the PUCO calling for the investigation and audit of all pipeline companies owned or controlled by Richard M. Osborne and under the jurisdiction of the PUCO.  While Richard M. Osborne's Ohio pipeline companies are under further regulatory scrutiny by the PUCO, he is asking you to vote for him to lead Gas Natural.  
Richard M. Osborne's interests do not appear to be aligned with the majority of our shareholders, as evidenced by his significant divestiture of Gas Natural shares.  During the period from January 31, 2010 through April 15, 2016, Richard M. Osborne sold nearly 2.5 million shares of Gas Natural stock.  He now owns fewer than 5,000 shares.   
One of Richard M. Osborne's board nominees, Darryl L. Knight, was hired by Richard M. Osborne and served as the general manager of our North Carolina utility from October 2012 until September 2014.  That utility was cited with a disallowance in excess of $2.4 million by the North Carolina Utility Commission regarding gas cost procurement practices under the management of Darryl L. Knight.  
None of Richard M. Osborne's remaining four nominees has any experience in the highly regulated utility industry.  
Protect your investment; please vote the GREEN proxy card TODAY
Discard Richard M. Osborne's WHITE proxy card.  We believe Richard M. Osborne and his nominees lack the experience to properly lead, manage and govern public utilities, and they own less than 0.1% of our outstanding shares.  Furthermore, Richard M. Osborne's history demonstrates his disregard for our regulators, lack of understanding of utility operations and furtherance of his own self-serving interests.  
Your vote matters and we believe your current Board is the most qualified to provide you the best future returns on your investment.  On behalf of the Board of Directors, thank you for your continued support.  
Sincerely, 
Michael R. Winter Chairman of the Board
YOUR VOTE IS IMPORTANT, NO MATTER HOW MANY OR FEW SHARES YOU OWN
Please follow the easy instructions on the enclosed GREEN proxy card.
If you have any questions or need assistance in voting your shares, please contact:

CLEVELAND, Dec. 28, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Gas Natural Inc. (NYSE MKT: EGAS) ("Gas Natural" or the "Company"), a holding company operating local natural gas utilities serving approximately 68,600 customers in four states, today announced that, based on votes cast at the Company's special meeting of shareholders held earlier today, Gas Natural's shareholders voted to approve the Company's previously announced plan to merge with FR Bison Merger Sub, Inc., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of First Reserve Energy Infrastructure Fund II, L.P ("First Reserve"), a leading global private equity and infrastructure investment firm exclusively focused on energy.  Over 73.0% percent of the outstanding shares voted, with 98.2% percent approving the proposed merger. 








"We are pleased with the result of the vote as it overwhelmingly demonstrates the strong support for the transaction by our shareholders," said Gregory J. Osborne, Gas Natural's President and Chief Executive Officer.  "We have achieved a major milestone toward completing the merger with First Reserve.  With shareholder support, we can move forward and seek regulatory approvals.  The result of the vote demonstrates shareholder confidence in the strength of the franchise to serve our customers' needs and to grow the business.  I would like to thank Gas Natural Inc. shareholders and employees for their support throughout the process."
Under the terms of the merger agreement with First Reserve, Gas Natural shareholders will receive $13.10 for each share of Gas Natural common stock that they own. 
Gas Natural and First Reserve continue to expect to complete the transaction in the second half of 2017, subject to the satisfaction of the remaining customary closing conditions, including the approval of the Maine Public Utilities Commission, the Montana Public Service Commission, the North Carolina Utilities Commission and the Public Utility Commission of Ohio.
About Gas Natural Inc.

About First Reserve First Reserve is a leading global private equity and infrastructure investment firm exclusively focused on energy. With over 30 years of industry insight, investment expertise and operational excellence, First Reserve has cultivated an enduring network of global relationships and raised approximately USD $31 billion of aggregate capital since inception.  Putting these to work, First Reserve has completed approximately 600 transactions (including platform investments and add-on acquisitions), creating several notable energy companies throughout First Reserve's history.  Its portfolio companies operate on six continents, spanning the energy spectrum from upstream oil and gas to midstream and downstream, including resources, equipment and services and infrastructure.  For more information, please visit www.firstreserve.com.

Reports 2017 First Quarter ResultsBusiness WireMay 10, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareCLEVELAND--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Gas Natural Inc. (NYSE MKT:EGAS) (the “Company”), a holding company operating local natural gas utilities serving approximately 70,000 customers in four states, reported financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2017.First Quarter 2017 Summary Net income per share improved to $0.32 from $0.26 in the prior-year quarter  Full service distribution throughput increased 13%, aided by the addition of approximately 300 new customers in the quarter  Merger approval process with regulators remains on plan for second half 2017 closing Mr. Gregory J. Osborne, Gas Natural’s President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “We continue to focus on providing excellent service to our customers in all of our utility jurisdictions, resulting in growth in full service distribution and gross margin. Additionally, our ongoing focus on cost discipline has contributed to improved earnings.”He added, “The regulatory approval process for our announced merger with First Reserve continues on plan. We expect completion of the transaction in the second half of 2017.”                                   First Quarter 2017 Operations Review                Three Months Ended     (in thousands)         March 31,             2017       2016     Revenue by segment:                       Natural Gas         $   35,919       $   35,064     Marketing & Production             3,940           3,243     Consolidated         $   39,859       $   38,307                          Revenue for the first quarter of 2017 increased approximately 4% over the prior-year quarter. Both of the Company’s operating segments contributed to the increase. The Natural Gas segment grew due to: 1) customer growth, primarily in Maine and Montana; 2) colder weather in certain of the Company’s markets, including Montana and Maine; 3) generally higher natural gas prices; and 4) the inclusion of cancellation fee revenue for a terminated long-term customer contract in Maine. The Marketing & Production segment recognized higher revenue due to increased volumes sold as a result of colder weather in its relevant markets.                         Changes in Gross Margin(in thousands)           Three MonthsEnded              March 31, 2017     2016 Gross Margin         $   14,745         Utilities sold           (17   )     Weather and other volume changes           479       New utility customers           249       Other changes             164         Natural Gas change             875         Lost marketing customer and pricing           (85   )     Pricing and production volume             29         Marketing & Production change             (56   )     Consolidated gross margin change             819         2017 Gross Margin         $   15,564                        Gross margin for the first quarter of 2017 increased 6% compared with the prior-year quarter. The increase was primarily due to several factors: 1) higher volume due to increased usage and colder weather in the Company’s Montana and Maine markets, partially offset by warmer weather in its North Carolina and Ohio markets; 2) higher volume driven by customer growth; and 3) cancellation fee revenue with no associated cost, resulting from the termination of a long-term customer contract in Maine. Customer count grew by approximately 300 in the first quarter, compared with the end of 2016.                                              Three Months Ended     (in thousands)         March 31,             2017       2016     Operating income by segment:                           Natural Gas         $   6,096         $   5,517       Marketing & Production           49           83       Corporate & Other             (218   )           (103   )     Consolidated         $   5,927           $   5,497                                     Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA*         $   8,432         $   7,668                                *See the attached tables for important disclosures regarding the Company’s use of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-recurring expenses and discontinued operations (“Adjusted EBITDA”) as well as reconciliations of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (”GAAP”) net income to non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA for the 2017 and 2016 first quarters.For the first quarter of 2017, operating income was $0.4 million higher than the prior-year quarter due to higher gross margin partially offset by higher operating expenses.Within the Natural Gas segment, gross margin grew $0.9 million and operating expenses increased $0.3 million, contributing to a $0.6 million increase in operating income for the segment. The increase in operating expenses is primarily due to IT-related support costs, partially offset by cost reductions associated with lower legal and professional services as well as lower personnel related costs pertaining to this segment. The higher operating loss within the Corporate and Other segment was primarily due to higher legal and professional costs associated with the Company’s pending merger.Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, was up approximately $0.8 million primarily due to higher operating income as well as higher non-cash costs. The Company believes that, when used in conjunction with measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure, helps in the understanding of its financial performance.Balance Sheet and Cash ManagementCash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2017 grew to $7.7 million from $6.5 million at December 31, 2016.Cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter of 2017 was $10.9 million compared with $9.4 million in 2016 first quarter, with the increase primarily due to higher net income and lower working capital requirements.Capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2017 were $2.0 million compared with $2.3 million in the prior-year quarter. Capital expenditures in the 2016 first quarter included approximately $0.5 million for the portion of the Company’s ERP system that was not financed under a lease agreement. The Company has budgeted $10 million for capital expenditures in 2017, with the majority focused on growth of its Natural Gas Operations segment, including construction activities to support expansion, maintenance and enhancements of its gas pipeline systems.Read MoreCash used in financing activities was $8.4 million in the 2017 first quarter compared with $5.9 million in last year’s quarter. Debt repayment was the primary use of cash in both periods.About Gas Natural Inc.Gas Natural Inc., a holding company, distributes and sells natural gas to residential, commercial, and industrial customers.

Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA are not calculated through the application of GAAP and are not the required form of disclosure by the Securities and Exchange Commission. As such, these measures should not be considered as a substitute for the GAAP measure of net income and, therefore, should not be used in isolation of, but in conjunction with, the GAAP measure.
