"Low Vol, High Div" is the New Black











How Can Investors Potentially Generate Income and Grow Their Assets?
"Low Vol, High Div" Strategies Are the New Black for Many Savvy Investors








September 9, 2016
The summer of the surprise Brexit vote is over and the fall of an equally unexpected U.S. election is upon us. Many equity markets are at all-time highs, several bond markets are mired at historical lows, and global expectations for economic growth are tepid at best.
What should spenders do, investors near or in retirement? They want income today and probably a little more growth for tomorrow, especially as they are living longer. What should younger savers do? They want to build assets more than ever due to concerns about social security benefits and traditional pension plans being a thing of the past for most.  The key for investment managers and financial advisors is to keep both groups in the markets over the short term, while trying to limit their potential downside. Both groups are justly wary of big risks in the wake of the Financial Crisis.
What will happen when interest rates rise? How will investors prepare?
This creates the backdrop for a perennial problem facing U.S. investors: how can they generate income, while still continuing to harness opportunities to grow their hard-earned assets to meet their life goals and objectives?
QS Investors, a Legg Mason affiliate based in New York, has a strategy: “low vol, high div.”
Low volatility and high dividend strategies are emerging as potentially attractive substitutes for the classic utility stocks of yore. They can offer relatively low risk positions that can be less exposed to U.S. equity market swings, yet seek to pay regular dividends to support income objectives.
“In this unpredictable climate, there are woefully few attractive, dependable, low-risk options for investors seeking solid income,” observed QS Investors President James H. Norman. “Our parents’ and grandparents’ generations could steadily plow their savings into utility stocks. They were viewed as safe, typically paid regular dividends, and appreciated in value nicely with the market. Sadly, with deregulation of their industries, those popular options have become more treacherous making it important to find another path through a mine field. Yet investors still need income somewhere, without taking undue risks.”
“We believe that high yield, managed volatility strategies can be a core holding of income-oriented portfolios,” Mr. Norman said. “They can also receive meaningful allocations in conservative and aggressive portfolios with long investment horizons.”
As Chief Investment Officer of QS Investors Rosemary Macedo notes, living longer with more years in our retirement amplifies the impact of our investment choices. And the safety net of social security shows signs of fraying, making the prudent person wary of reliance. Clearly, the stakes are higher than ever for both retirees and those who hope to retire one day.
To achieve high growth, investors must take on risk. But simply ratcheting up equity allocations exposes investors not just to more market volatility, but also to more panic risk – the instinctive reaction to flee the market after a large loss, right at the time investors should consider holding strong.
How to provide the growth investors need, generate income without precluding growth, and do so with enough relative stability to keep clients invested through down markets so that they participate in up markets?
The old strategy: the utility of utilities.
For decades, utility stocks were the standard answer to this perennial challenge.  It was for good reason that advisors traditionally put ‘widows and orphans’ and other conservative investors’ savings into utility stocks:  they produced income plus modest real principal growth with the relative stability that came with regulated industries.  These included electric, gas and water utilities, as well as telephones in the days of the AT&T monopoly.
Although US Government and AAA Corporate Bonds also offered income and nominal safety, the higher risk of utility stocks compared with bonds was deemed to be worth bearing, since bonds could not match utilities’ principal growth potential and inflation management. 
But utilities were not immune to the reality that industries and markets can experience significant disruption. In this case, de-regulation opened the door to changes that fundamentally altered the nature of utility stocks.  Seeking a better return on investment, utility companies’ management took advantage of deregulation by “diworsifying” into unrelated businesses; examples include Southern California Gas with Thrifty Drug Stores and Arizona Public Service with Mera Bank. 
While not all diversification turned out badly, the utilities sector was no longer a pure play on a regulated industry, but rather a mix of the regulated (transmission) and the unregulated (generators), of the diversified and the not.  This invited market speculation as some utilities pursued returns more aggressively, including, according to Fortune magazine, "America's Most Innovative Company", i.e., Enron.  
The new strategy for investors: form follows function – defensive yield.
Nowadays, investors have to be more enterprising to get income plus growth with relative stability.  The attributes investors liked in regulated utilities still exist, though not all utilities have these characteristics today, and not all stocks with these characteristics are utilities.  We can systematically seek out the stocks with lower volatility and higher dividend yield in any market sector, and with them build a broader, more diversified portfolio that explicitly focuses on the tried and true benefits of lower volatility and higher dividend stocks.
The combination of lower volatility and higher dividend yield can be far more powerful than either attribute alone, and produces a distinct investment strategy, much as blue and yellow produce the distinct color green.  By combining these characteristics, we can mitigate or even avoid the pitfalls of each when used individually.  For example, emphasizing high dividend yields effectively excludes any low volatility stocks that are fundamentally expensive. 
Retirees should consider this kind of strategy, as they are living longer, are less likely to have a pension, and bond yields are at secular lows.
So should savers of any age, who can benefit from the higher total returns associated with higher yield stocks, as well as from the compounding benefits of lower volatility.

		    	Frequently asked
		    	
		    	questions






		    	What is a breakpoint?
		    	
		    	
		    




Mutual funds often offer discounts on front-end sales charges for larger investments. The investment levels at which the discounts become available are called breakpoints.
 





		    	How do I determine sales charge?
		    	
		    	
		    




There are two kinds of sales charges (loads): front-end loads and back-end loads. A front-end load is a fee paid to purchase an investment, and a back-end load is a fee paid to sell an investment. Front-end load mutual funds are referred to as A shares; back-end load mutual funds are referred to as B shares. The exact sales fee can be found in the fund’s prospectus. 
 





		    	What is the maximum contribution to an IRA?
		    	
		    	
		    




For 2016 and 2017, your total contributions to all of your traditional and Roth IRAs cannot be more than $5,500 ($6,500 if you’re age 50 or older), or your taxable compensation for the year, if your compensation was less than this dollar limit.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION: All investments involve risk, including loss of principal. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Please see each product’s web page for specific details regarding investment objective, risks, performance and other important information. Review this information carefully before you make any investment decision.
Carefully consider a fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses before investing. Please view the prospectus or summary prospectus for this and other information. Read it carefully.
FINANCIAL ADVISORS: Please note that not all share classes may be available for sale at your firm. Please call the Legg Mason Sales Desk 1-800-822-5544 or your Legg Mason Sales contact for more information.
IMPORTANT INFORMATION: An investor should consider the Program's investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses before investing. The Program Disclosure Statement, which contains more information, should be read carefully before investing. If an investor and/or an investor's beneficiary are not Colorado taxpayers, they should consider before investing whether their home states offer 529 plans that provide state tax and other benefits only available to state taxpayers investing in such plans.
Blended Benchmark performance is shown for illustrative purposes only. The benchmark for each Investment Option is a hypothetical blend of unmanaged indices for the underlying asset classes corresponding to the Investment Option's target allocations within each asset class.  Investors cannot invest directly in an index, and unmanaged index returns do not reflect any fees, expenses or sales charges.  An Investment Option's benchmark may change over time to reflect changes in an asset class benchmark, the Investment Option's underlying funds and/or the Investment Option's target allocations to such funds. When an Investment Option's benchmark changes, the benchmark’s new composition is utilized to calculate benchmark performance for periods from and after such change.  Benchmark performance for periods prior to the change is not recalculated or restated based on the benchmark’s new composition.
Investments in the Scholars Choice College Savings Program are not insured by the FDIC or any other government agency and are not deposits or other obligations of any depository institution. Investments are not guaranteed by the State of Colorado, CollegeInvest, QS Investors, LLC, Legg Mason Investor Services, LLC, or Legg Mason, Inc. or its affiliates and are subject to investment risks, including loss of principal amount invested.

Any such taxpayer should seek advice based on the taxpayer's particular circumstances from an independent tax advisor.

SUB-ADVISER        


Formed in 1999 within a large asset management firm, QS Investors, LLC is a New York-based investment firm providing asset management and advisory services to a diverse array of institutional clients.QS Investors delivers disciplined and systematic solutions that address clients’ complex investment challenges. The team has developed approaches to integrating quantitative and behavioral investment insights and dynamically weighting opportunities in response to changing conditions in the economy and the market. QS Investors offers a broad spectrum of strategies which includes actively managed U.S. and global equities, liquid alternatives, and customized solutions.QS Investors is a wholly-owned affiliate of Legg Mason, Inc.













30-DAY SEC YIELD

The 30-Day SEC Yield is computed in accordance with a standardized method prescribed by rules of the SEC. The 30-day SEC Yield is computed by dividing the fund's investment income per share earned during a particular 30-day base period by the maximum offering price per share on the last day of the base period, and then annualizing the result. The 30-day SEC Yield is calculated at each month end and updated within the first ten business days of the following month. These yields reflect the reimbursements or waivers of certain expense. Had fees not been waived and/or expenses reimbursed, the yields would have been lower. 

12-MONTH DISTRIBUTION YIELD

The 12-Month distribution yield is calculated by taking the sum of all distributions occurring over the previous twelve calendar months and dividing the result by the Fund's Net Asset Value (NAV) as of the date of the previous month-end. The distribution yield represents a 12-month historical distribution and does not represent the total return of the Fund and is not necessarily an indication of future distributions or yield. For Funds that have been in operation for less than one year, an annualized distribution yield is calculated by annualizing the Fund's historical distributions to date and dividing the result by the Fund's Net Asset Value (NAV) as of the date of the previous month-end. The annualized distribution yield represents an estimated 12-month distribution from the Fund based on the limited distribution history of the Fund to date and does not represent the total return of the Fund and is not necessarily an indication of future distributions or yield. Past performance does not guarantee future results. 

FUND PERFORMANCE

*Expense ratios are as-of the most recent prospectus. Contractual arrangements have been made with the fund’s investment manager, Transamerica Asset Management, Inc. (“TAM”), through March 1, 2017.  **Reflects average annual returns. Returns for funds that are less than one year old are not annualized.  ****Prior to May 1, 2015, this fund had a different name, sub-adviser and investment strategy.
The performance data presented here represents past performance; Past performance is not indicative of future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. The investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Performance may not be available for all periods indicated. Net Asset Value (NAV) returns include reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, but do not reflect any sales charges. If a sales charge had been deducted, the results would have been lower. Public Offering Price (POP) returns include reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, and reflect the maximum sales charge. Maximum sales charge for Class A shares is 4.75%. Purchases of Class C Shares are subject to a 1.00% contingent deferred sales charge if redeemed during the first 12 months of purchase. There are no sales charges on Class I. Class I shares are currently primarily offered for investment to institutional investors including, but not limited to, fee-based programs, pension plans, and certain endowment plans and foundations. Performance figures reflect any fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements by the Investment Manager. Without such waivers and/or reimbursements, the performance would be lower. Future waivers and/or reimbursements are at the discretion of the Investment Manager. 1 Year returns reflect total return.  

RISK MEASURES

Risk measures are in comparison to a blended benchmark made up of 40% iBoxx $ Liquid High Yield Index, 30% S&P 500®, and 30% Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond. Standard Deviation is a statistical measurement that helps to gauge the fund's historical volatility. Historical Beta illustrates a fund’s sensitivity to price movements in relation to a benchmark index. Alpha is a coefficient measuring the portion of a fund’s return arising from specific (non-market) risk. Tracking Error is the difference between the price behavior of a fund and the price behavior of a benchmark. R-Squared is a statistical measure that represents the percentage of a fund’s movements that can be explained by movements in a benchmark index. Sharpe Ratio is a risk-adjusted measure calculated by using standard deviation and excess return to determine reward per unit of risk. Information Ratio is a ratio of portfolio returns above those of a benchmark compared to the volatility of those returns.U.S. allocations may include U.S. territories and possessions.The Net Other Assets (Liabilities) category may include, but is not limited to, repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements, security lending collateral, forward foreign currency contracts, and cash collateral. 



The iBoxx $ Liquid High Yield Index and Transamerica Dynamic Income Blended Benchmark (40% iBoxx $ Liquid High Yield Index, 30% S&P 500®, and 30% Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond) are unmanaged indices used as a general measure of market performance. It is not possible to invest directly into an index. Calculations assume dividends and capital gains are reinvested and do not include any managerial expenses.Asset Allocation, like many investment strategies, offers no guarantee of positive returns, and mutual funds are subject to market risk, including loss of principal. ETFs generally present the same risks as an investment in a conventional fund that has the same investment objectives, strategies, and policies. The market price of an ETF’s share may be above or below the shares’ net asset value; and an active trading market for an ETF’s share may not develop or be maintained. Foreign and emerging market investments involve risks not associated with U.S. markets, such as currency fluctuation, adverse social and political developments and the relatively small size and lesser liquidity of the markets. Fixed income investing is subject to credit risk and interest rate risk. Investments in high-yield bonds (junk bonds) may be subject to greater volatility and risks as the income derived from these securities is not guaranteed and may be unpredictable and the value of these securities tends to decline when the interest rate increases.Shares may be sold (or “redeemed”) on any day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Proceeds from the redemption of shares will usually be sent to the redeeming shareholder within three business days after receipt in good order of a request for redemption. However, Transamerica Funds has the right to take up to seven days to pay redemption proceeds, and may postpone payment under certain circumstances, as authorized by law.Due to rounding, not all of the percentages will equal 100%.Mutual funds are subject to market risk, including the loss of principal. Past performance is not indicative of future results.Shares of the funds may only be sold by offering the funds’ prospectus. You should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the funds carefully before investing. The prospectus contains this and additional important information regarding the fund. To obtain the prospectus and/or summary prospectus, please contact your financial professional or click here. The prospectus should be read carefully before investing.Transamerica Funds are advised by Transamerica Asset Management, Inc. and distributed by Transamerica Capital, Inc.Not insured by FDIC or any federal government agency. May lose value. Not a deposit of or guaranteed by any bank, bank affiliate, or credit union.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

30-DAY SEC YIELD

The 30-Day SEC Yield is computed in accordance with a standardized method prescribed by rules of the SEC. The 30-day SEC Yield is computed by dividing the fund's investment income per share earned during a particular 30-day base period by the maximum offering price per share on the last day of the base period, and then annualizing the result. The 30-day SEC Yield is calculated at each month end and updated within the first ten business days of the following month. These yields reflect the reimbursements or waivers of certain expense. Had fees not been waived and/or expenses reimbursed, the yields would have been lower. 

12-MONTH DISTRIBUTION YIELD

The 12-Month distribution yield is calculated by taking the sum of all distributions occurring over the previous twelve calendar months and dividing the result by the Fund's Net Asset Value (NAV) as of the date of the previous month-end. The distribution yield represents a 12-month historical distribution and does not represent the total return of the Fund and is not necessarily an indication of future distributions or yield. For Funds that have been in operation for less than one year, an annualized distribution yield is calculated by annualizing the Fund's historical distributions to date and dividing the result by the Fund's Net Asset Value (NAV) as of the date of the previous month-end. The annualized distribution yield represents an estimated 12-month distribution from the Fund based on the limited distribution history of the Fund to date and does not represent the total return of the Fund and is not necessarily an indication of future distributions or yield. Past performance does not guarantee future results. 

FUND PERFORMANCE

*Expense ratios are as-of the most recent prospectus. Contractual arrangements have been made with the fund’s investment manager, Transamerica Asset Management, Inc. (“TAM”), through March 1, 2017.  **Reflects average annual returns. Returns for funds that are less than one year old are not annualized.  ****Prior to May 1, 2015, this fund had a different name, sub-adviser and investment strategy.
The performance data presented here represents past performance; Past performance is not indicative of future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. The investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Performance may not be available for all periods indicated. Net Asset Value (NAV) returns include reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, but do not reflect any sales charges. If a sales charge had been deducted, the results would have been lower. Public Offering Price (POP) returns include reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, and reflect the maximum sales charge. Maximum sales charge for Class A shares is 4.75%. Purchases of Class C Shares are subject to a 1.00% contingent deferred sales charge if redeemed during the first 12 months of purchase. There are no sales charges on Class I. Class I shares are currently primarily offered for investment to institutional investors including, but not limited to, fee-based programs, pension plans, and certain endowment plans and foundations. Performance figures reflect any fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements by the Investment Manager. Without such waivers and/or reimbursements, the performance would be lower. Future waivers and/or reimbursements are at the discretion of the Investment Manager. 1 Year returns reflect total return.  

RISK MEASURES

Risk measures are in comparison to a blended benchmark made up of 40% iBoxx $ Liquid High Yield Index, 30% S&P 500®, and 30% Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond. Standard Deviation is a statistical measurement that helps to gauge the fund's historical volatility. Historical Beta illustrates a fund’s sensitivity to price movements in relation to a benchmark index. Alpha is a coefficient measuring the portion of a fund’s return arising from specific (non-market) risk. Tracking Error is the difference between the price behavior of a fund and the price behavior of a benchmark. R-Squared is a statistical measure that represents the percentage of a fund’s movements that can be explained by movements in a benchmark index. Sharpe Ratio is a risk-adjusted measure calculated by using standard deviation and excess return to determine reward per unit of risk. Information Ratio is a ratio of portfolio returns above those of a benchmark compared to the volatility of those returns.U.S. allocations may include U.S. territories and possessions.The Net Other Assets (Liabilities) category may include, but is not limited to, repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements, security lending collateral, forward foreign currency contracts, and cash collateral. 



The iBoxx $ Liquid High Yield Index and Transamerica Dynamic Income Blended Benchmark (40% iBoxx $ Liquid High Yield Index, 30% S&P 500®, and 30% Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond) are unmanaged indices used as a general measure of market performance. It is not possible to invest directly into an index. Calculations assume dividends and capital gains are reinvested and do not include any managerial expenses.Asset Allocation, like many investment strategies, offers no guarantee of positive returns, and mutual funds are subject to market risk, including loss of principal. ETFs generally present the same risks as an investment in a conventional fund that has the same investment objectives, strategies, and policies. The market price of an ETF’s share may be above or below the shares’ net asset value; and an active trading market for an ETF’s share may not develop or be maintained. Foreign and emerging market investments involve risks not associated with U.S. markets, such as currency fluctuation, adverse social and political developments and the relatively small size and lesser liquidity of the markets. Fixed income investing is subject to credit risk and interest rate risk. Investments in high-yield bonds (junk bonds) may be subject to greater volatility and risks as the income derived from these securities is not guaranteed and may be unpredictable and the value of these securities tends to decline when the interest rate increases.Shares may be sold (or “redeemed”) on any day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Proceeds from the redemption of shares will usually be sent to the redeeming shareholder within three business days after receipt in good order of a request for redemption. However, Transamerica Funds has the right to take up to seven days to pay redemption proceeds, and may postpone payment under certain circumstances, as authorized by law.Due to rounding, not all of the percentages will equal 100%.Mutual funds are subject to market risk, including the loss of principal. Past performance is not indicative of future results.Shares of the funds may only be sold by offering the funds’ prospectus. You should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the funds carefully before investing. The prospectus contains this and additional important information regarding the fund. To obtain the prospectus and/or summary prospectus, please contact your financial professional or click here. The prospectus should be read carefully before investing.Transamerica Funds are advised by Transamerica Asset Management, Inc. and distributed by Transamerica Capital, Inc.Not insured by FDIC or any federal government agency. May lose value. Not a deposit of or guaranteed by any bank, bank affiliate, or credit union.
