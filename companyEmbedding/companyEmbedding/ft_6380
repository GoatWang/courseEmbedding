No auxiliary grounding rod is needed, and there is no need to disconnect the ground wire from the grounding rod. The compact, low-profile sensor can be used to clamp ground wires with ease, and also provide AC current measurement functionality andcan measure currents ranging from leakage current on the order of several mA to load currents of up to 60 a. OverviewEarth resistance measurement for multi-grounded systemsMeasure leak current with absolute certainty with highly sensitive 0.01 mA resolution (at 20.00 mA range)Measure load current up to 60.0 A rangeClamp at the narrowest pointData transfer to Android ™ phones using Bluetooth ®wireless technologyReal time data transfer, automatic report generation on Android ™ phone SpecificationMeasurement PrincipleInstrument has two cores for voltage and current measurement of the injection. From the defined voltage and measured the total circuit current, the loop resistance is calculatedNote: For multiple grounded systems only. In a multi-grounded system, the larger the number of grounding poles, the more accurate the measured value.

Composite Score:





                        Zoro, Inc has received 4.32 out of 5 stars based on 37 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

    Hioki FT6380 Details
    


Hioki FT6380 Clamp On Earth Tester The Hioki FT6380 Clamp On Earth Tester available for multiple grounding use. This product was developed specifically to meet the needs of customers in North America, Europe, and Asia, where there is high demand for multiple grounding measurements. 
Thanks to the small size of the clamp sensor, the FT6380 delivers a new level of convenience especially when used in confined locations. At the same time, the size of the grip used to open the sensor, allowing the new meters to be operated with only half the force required for similar products offered by other companies. 
Advanced Features: 
    Compact clamp-on sensor for ultimate convenience in confined locations
      To date, grounding resistance testers from other manufacturers have been characterized by their heavy weight and large jaws, which complicate use of the instruments due to the difficulty of attaching them to ground wires. Responding to resulting demand for more compact sensors, HIOKI engineered a low-profile sensor just 20 mm wide for both instruments so that they can be used to measure ground wires that have been installed in cramped spaces. The sensor is 50 percent smaller by volume than sensors on existing competing products.
      Larger sensor grip for improved workability
      HIOKI has enlarged the clamp sensor's grip so that it can be opened with just two fingers, enabling it to be operated with only half the force of existing competing products.
      Low power consumption for extended use
      The FT6380 uses approximately half the power of competing products, maximizing work efficiency because they can be continuously used for longer periods of time.
 Onboard storage for 2,000 data points
      The FT6380 can store 2,000 data points (each including a grounding resistance value and a current value) in the field.

Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo

BBB Rating System Overview














Customer Review Rating:









                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

                        Zoro, Inc has received 4.32 out of 5 stars based on 37 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

The FT6380 measures grounding resistance simply by clamping to multiple-grounded ground wires. No auxiliary grounding rod is needed, and there is no need to disconnect the ground wire from the grounding rod. The compact, low-profile sensor can be used to clamp ground wires with ease, and also provide AC current measurement functionality and can measure currents ranging from leakage current on the order of several mA to load currents of up to 60 A.

CAT IV 600V
Key Features
•	Earth resistance measurement for multi-grounded systems
•	Measure leak current with absolute certainty with highly sensitive 0.01 mA resolution (at 20.00 mA range)
•	Measure load current up to 60.0 A range
•	Clamp at the narrowest point

Measurement principleInstrument has two cores for voltage injection and current measurement.  From the defined voltage and measured current, the total circuit loop resistance is calculatedNote: For multi grounded systems only. In a multi-grounded system, the larger the number of grounding poles, the more accurate the measured value.
Earthing resistance0.20 Ω (0.01 Ω resolution) to 1600 Ω (20 Ω resolution), 10 ranges, Zero suppression: Less than 0.02 Ω, Accuracy: ±1.5 % rdg. ±0.02 Ω
AC Current measurement20.00 mA (0.01 mA resolution) to 60.0 A (0.1 A resolution), 5 ranges, Zero suppression: Less than 0.05 mA, Accuracy: ±2.0 % rdg. ±0.05 mA (30 Hz to 400 Hz, True RMS), Crest factor 5.0 or less (for the 60 A range, 1.7 or less)
Max. allowable input100 A AC continuous, AC 200 A for 2 minutes or shorter (at 50/60 Hz, requires derating at frequency)
