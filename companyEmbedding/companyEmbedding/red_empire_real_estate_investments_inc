NEW YORK, May 15, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- The Empire State Building (ESB) today announced that seven students from the New York City Department of Youth and Community Development's (DYCD) Ladders for Leaders program will join the Empire State Building Observatory staff this summer. The students will serve as front-line hosts and cashiers at the "World's Most Famous Building." The Ladders for Leaders is a nationally recognized program that offers high school and college students the opportunity to participate in paid professional summer internships with leading corporations, non-profit organizations, and government agencies in New York City.








The Empire State Building will provide employee training via a two-day orientation with a strong focus on customer service.  Each student will also shadow current employees before assuming full responsibility in his or her role at the Empire State Building's Observatories. 
"Our partnership with Ladders to Leaders has not only helped our recruiting efforts but has also given the Empire State Building additional opportunities to give back to our community," said Jean-Yves Ghazi, Senior Vice President of the Observatory. 
"I am thrilled that our Ladders for Leaders participants will get the opportunity to work this summer at New York City's most iconic skyscraper, the Empire State Building," said DYCD Commissioner Bill Chong. "This internship will not only help enhance our young people's skills in hospitality and customer service but will also open up doors for them to interact with people from all over the world. DYCD is proud to work with Empire State Realty Trust and the Mayor's Fund to ensure NYC youth are exposed to unique jobs that help build the necessary skills to succeed." 
"The Mayor's Fund is excited to count Empire State Realty Trust among our dedicated group of Ladders for Leaders employers this summer," said Darren Bloch, Executive Director of the Mayor's Fund to Advance NYC. "The partnership will provide an invaluable experience, at an iconic New York City location, for these young adults – while giving the organization valuable seasonal support from these up-and-coming students. We are proud to have such strong partners that believe in building our future workforce."
