Reviews - What do our customers think?
superb resource!!  Mar 5, 2007
Excellent one volume bible dictionary.  Treats a tremendouse amount of topics from books of the bible to people, places and things in the bible, and more.  Probably the best one volume bible dictionary available.  Very up to date research backs the articles, pespectives range from moderate to conservative.   Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible  Nov 9, 2006
I purchased it for an incarcerated felon at the Christian Prison in Richmond, TX. The Chuck Colson Prison Fellowship Ministries 18 month pre-pelease program of "Inner-Change Freedom Initiative (IFI)" is conducted at the Carol Vance (Jester 3) Unit of TDCJ. I mentor ex-offenders prior to release and 6 months after. He says: "I use it daily". Great but...  Oct 21, 2006
This is indeed a great resource, but I find the print a bit to small. The print should have been a bit bigger. I use this volume alongside my New Internation Bible Dictionary and Wycliffe Bible Dictionary. They are all good.But I value the most recent scholarship in Eerdmans. A great buy! excellent resource  Aug 13, 2006
This book is an essential resource for the serious Bible student as well as for the casual reader. I purchased this book as well as the Commentary on the Bible by the same author, after countless times of looking up words found in the Bible, but not in the dictionary! This book is comprehensive and clear as to the meaning of words and phrases, descriptions of people, places, events, including explanations of concepts and words NOT found in the Bible, such as "Trinity." It also contains photographs, maps, practices and customs, and so much more. This book is a must-have and should be part of eveyone's Bible library. Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible  Feb 28, 2006
very informational, and consists of great details and defintions. very edcational for a source of the Bible Write your own review about Eerdmans Dictionary Of The Bible
