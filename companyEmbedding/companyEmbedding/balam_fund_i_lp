THE ROHATYN GROUP AND CITI VENTURE CAPITAL INTERNATIONAL (CVCI) TO COMBINE TO
CREATE PREMIER EMERGING MARKETS ASSET MANAGEMENT FIRM WITH OVER $7B TOTAL AUM
 
Exclusively Focused In Emerging Markets, TRG Will Have $6B In Private Equity, 
$1.3B in Liquid Market Investments, With 18 Offices on Five Continents
_______________________________________________________________________
 
New York, September 3, 2013 – The Rohatyn Group (“TRG”), an independent investment firm focused on emerging markets, and Citi Venture Capital International (“CVCI”), an emerging market  global private equity investment firm, today announced that the firms will combine to create a premier emerging markets asset management firm that will operate as TRG.  The transformative transaction expands and enhances TRG’s emerging markets investment capabilities and global reach, giving TRG a global footprint of 18 offices worldwide with more than $7 billion in total assets under management, approximately $6 billion of which is in private equity and approximately $1.3 billion of which is in liquid market strategies. TRG’s funds will include private equity, real estate, infrastructure, renewable energy, hedge funds, fixed income, and inflation-linked bonds.
 
The combination with CVCI continues TRG’s strategic growth strategy in critical emerging markets, notably Asia and Latin America.  In 2012, TRG acquired a 60 percent stake in CapAsia, a Singapore-based mid-market infrastructure private equity firm focused exclusively on non-BRIC Emerging Asia.  In 2011, TRG acquired 50 percent of ARCH Capital, a Hong Kong-headquartered Asian focused private equity real estate firm.  In 2013, TRG partnered with BK Renewables Ltd. to jointly manage the Balam Fund, I, L.P. to make private equity investments in Mexico in the renewable power generation and energy efficiency industries.
 
Nicolas Rohatyn, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer of TRG, said, “The addition of CVCI to TRG is truly transformative.  CVCI has a track record of success and will be a great complement to TRG’s existing platform, including our distinctive hedge fund and fixed income emerging market offerings.  We welcome the CVCI team to TRG and look forward to what we can achieve together.”
 
Jamie Forese, Co-President of Citi and Chief Executive Officer of Citi’s Institutional Clients Group, said, “We are pleased to have found in TRG a partner that shares CVCI’s commitment and expertise in emerging markets investment management and believe they will be a terrific steward of our clients’ assets in the CVCI funds.”
 
Mr. Rohatyn added, “To be truly excellent in investment management in emerging markets today one has to have several attributes: focus, of course; scale which allows for a broad on-the-ground presence essential to private investing; macro capabilities which allow for intelligent country selection and risk management; a diverse set of investment capabilities that will address the needs of investors in different asset classes, and an institutional-quality business platform that is up to the standards of the most demanding global clients. The combination of CVCI’s broad private equity capabilities, TRG’s private investing expertise in sectors and regions of significance in emerging markets, and our proven macro investing capabilities, will make TRG one of a very few independent asset managers to whom investors can turn for broad discussion about investing across this asset class.”
 
CVCI’s Chief Investment Officer Marc Desaedeleer will be appointed to the TRG Executive Committee.  Mr. Desaedeleer and four CVCI partners - Enrique Bascur, Bob Khanna, Sunil Nair, and Ji Min (who is rejoining the firm) will also join the TRG management committee overseeing its private investing business, chaired by TRG’s Miguel Gutierrez. 
 
Mr. Desaedeleer said, “We are very pleased to pair with TRG to create a leading emerging market investment manager that is exceptionally positioned to identify the best opportunities for investors.  TRG’s global infrastructure and investment expertise will enable the CVCI team to embark on a new phase of growth, benefitting from increased resources and substantial opportunities for advancement and development as part of a focused Emerging Markets asset manager with unique private equity, hedge fund and fixed income products in this attractive space.”
 
Founded in 2001 and part of Citi’s alternative asset management platform Citi Capital Advisors, CVCI operates exclusively in emerging markets with a local presence in Singapore, Hong Kong, Mumbai, New Delhi, London, New York and Santiago and implements a unified investment and organizational strategy. CVCI currently oversees five funds as well as various select investments, with approximately $4.3 billion in equity investments and committed capital.
 
The transaction, terms of which were not disclosed, is expected to close in the fourth quarter 2013 in accordance with customary closing conditions.

Founded in 2003, The Rohatyn Group is a leading emerging markets asset management firm headquartered in New York, with offices around the globe including, Singapore, Hong Kong, London, Buenos Aires, Lima, Montevideo, Mexico City, and São Paulo.www.rohatyngroup.com

Equity Participation in Fund Investing in Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Projects in Mexico		Contributing to Reduction in Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Mexico


Area: Latin America and the CaribbeanInfrastructuresEnvironmentEquity Participations 


NR/2013-39
	July 16, 2013

The Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC; Governor: Hiroshi Okuda) signed on July 15 the agreements for equity participation in the Balam Fund I, L.P. (the "Fund"), a private equity fund jointly managed by The Rohatyn Group, a private investment firm, incorporated in the U.S. and BK Partners, an investment advisory and private equity firm incorporated in Spain, which will make investments in Mexico in the renewable power generation and energy efficiency industries. 
		 
The purpose of JBIC's participation in the Fund is to provide financial support to renewable energy and energy efficiency businesses in Mexico under GREEN operations.*1 In addition to JBIC, Fondo Nacional de Infraestructura (FONADIN) and the Inter-American Development Bank also participate in the Fund by the equity investment and the senior loan respectively. The Fund will be launched with an aggregate amount of approximately 87.5 million U.S. dollars with initial commitment from JBIC of up to 20 million U.S. dollars. As the total commitment amount of the Fund increases, JBIC plans to increase commitment amount up to 40 million U.S. dollars at a maximum. Eventually the total commitment amount of the Fund is expected to increase up to 200 million U.S. dollars. 
		 
During COP16 held in Mexico in December 2010, the Mexican government not only announced internationally its policy of reducing Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions in the country, indicating its intention to actively tackle climate change, but also took the lead as chair of the COP to build a consensus among the participant countries. JBIC's participation in the Fund will contribute to reduction of GHG emissions in Mexico and thus enhance such efforts of the government. It is expected that the Fund would provide any information of its portfolio investments to the Japanese companies which have broad interests in the renewable power generation and energy efficiency businesses in Mexico, which could expand business opportunities of Japanese companies in the country.
		 
As a public financial institution, JBIC continues to support environmental preservation in Mexico under GREEN operations by drawing on its various financial facilities and schemes, including its function of equity participation in private equity funds and thereby contributes to deepening and strengthening the economic relationship between Japan and Mexico.
