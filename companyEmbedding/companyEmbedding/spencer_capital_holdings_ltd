Spencer Capital Holdings Acquires SouthWest Dealer Services | Business Wire


























































Spencer Capital Holdings Acquires SouthWest Dealer Services




Deal Expected to Fuel Expansion of Leading Full-Service F&I Provider 
      in the US






March 18, 2015 09:03 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Spencer Capital Holdings, Ltd. (“Spencer Capital”), a value-oriented 
      global holdings company, has acquired SouthWest Dealer Services 
      (“SWDS”), a leading independent full-service provider of finance and 
      insurance (“F&I”) products and services to auto dealers in the United 
      States. SWDS has more than 250 employees that currently serve over 550 
      active dealers across 14 states in the south-western and mid-western US. 
      Financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed.
    


      SWDS is an independent full-service F&I distribution platform, founded 
      in 1988 by Steve Alderson. The firm’s approach utilizes local sales 
      forces whereby dealers have a hands-on experience with SWDS 
      representatives in their individual markets. SWDS currently operates 
      eight strategic locations, situated within the dealer markets they serve.
    

      The acquisition of SWDS is immediately accretive to Spencer Capital and 
      is complementary to its existing portfolio of companies. The financial 
      and operational support of Spencer Capital will provide SWDS with the 
      opportunity to grow its presence and expand its client capabilities, 
      while maintaining its autonomy. Dealers are expected to significantly 
      benefit due to increased and efficient access to products and services 
      across the Spencer platform, notably from Spencer Re, a reinsurance 
      firm, and USA Risk, an independent captive insurance provider.
    

      “We’ve known the team at SouthWest Dealer Services for years and they 
      have an outstanding reputation in the industry, which we experienced 
      firsthand through Spencer Re,” said Ken Shubin Stein, Chairman of 
      Spencer Capital. “The partnership is both a natural and strategic fit as 
      there are multiple growth channels for us moving forward. We’re excited 
      to invest alongside the management team to build out a ‘coast to coast’ 
      footprint for SWDS, which will both complement and fuel the development 
      of Spencer’s existing global platform of leading and value-driven 
      insurance and financial services companies.”
    

      Commenting on the transaction, Steve Alderson, Founder of SWDS, said, 
      “Partnering with Spencer Capital is a best of both worlds situation. 
      We’re looking to capitalize on the wave of industry consolidation and 
      expand geographically through strategic acquisitions, while maintaining 
      the level of local support that our dealers are accustomed to. SWDS has 
      been approached by many capital sources over the years, but until we met 
      the team at Spencer Capital, we hadn’t found a truly strategic partner 
      that mirrored the image of what we are trying to create.”
    

      SWDS will keep its name and continue to operate as it has effectively 
      done for more than 25 years. There will be no personnel changes as a 
      result of this transaction.

Spencer Capital Holdings to Acquire USA Risk Group




USA Risk will add to Spencer Capital’s insurance offering, 
      diversifying its product base






February 02, 2015 10:11 AM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Spencer Capital Holdings, Ltd. (“Spencer Capital”), a value-oriented 
      global investment firm, has agreed to acquire USA Risk Group (“USA 
      Risk”), the largest independent captive insurance manager in the world. 
      The transaction is subject to customary closing requirements and 
      regulatory approval, and is expected to close during the first quarter 
      of 2015. USA Risk currently serves over 300 clients, holding $9 billion 
      assets under management. Financial terms of the transaction were not 
      disclosed.
    


      USA Risk is an independent captive insurance manager founded in 1981 by 
      H. Lincoln Miller, Jr., a leader in helping to enact legislation 
      enabling Vermont to become the pre-eminent captive domicile within the 
      United States. USA Risk has since established member companies in 10 
      additional, strategic locations, servicing 20 captive domiciles, inside 
      and outside the U.S. market. USA Risk currently has 70 employees on and 
      offshore.
    

      The acquisition of USA Risk is immediately accretive to Spencer Capital 
      and is complementary to its existing portfolio of companies. The 
      financial and operational support of Spencer Capital will provide USA 
      Risk with the opportunity to grow and expand its client capabilities 
      while maintaining its longstanding autonomy. Spencer Re, a reinsurance 
      subsidiary of Spencer Capital Holdings, and USA Risk are expected to be 
      mutual beneficiaries from cross-selling opportunities.
    

      “USA Risk’s unparalleled reputation and leadership position in the 
      captive industry is a welcomed addition to Spencer Capital Holdings as 
      we seek to assemble a robust platform of leading and value-driven 
      companies in the insurance and financial services industries,” said Ken 
      Shubin Stein, Chairman of Spencer Capital.
    

      Commenting on the transaction, H. Lincoln Miller, Jr., Group Chairman of 
      USA Risk, said, “We have been approached by many suitors over the years, 
      but until we met the team at Spencer Capital, we did not view a 
      transaction as being in the best interests of our customers and 
      employees. Ken Shubin Stein and his team embody the same ethos we instil 
      in our employees and we share the same long-term interests for growing 
      USA Risk. This also allows us to maintain our long-held philosophy of 
      independence from conflicts of broker-owned managers.”
    

      After the transaction closing, USA Risk will keep its name and continue 
      to operate as it has effectively done for over 30 years. Miller, 
      currently Group Chairman of USA Risk, will join the board of directors 
      of Spencer Capital and Gary Osborne, currently President of USA Risk, 
      will join the board of directors of Spencer Re.

New York, March 18, 2015 – Spencer Capital Holdings, Ltd. (“Spencer Capital”), a value-oriented global holdings company, has acquired SouthWest Dealer Services (“SWDS”), a leading independent full-service provider of finance and insurance (“F&I”) products and services to auto dealers in the United States. SWDS has more than 250 employees that currently serve over 550 active dealers across 14 states in the south-western and mid-western US. Financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed.
SWDS is an independent full-service F&I distribution platform, founded in 1988 by Steve Alderson. The firm’s approach utilizes local sales forces whereby dealers have a hands-on experience with SWDS representatives in their individual markets. SWDS currently operates eight strategic locations, situated within the dealer markets they serve.
The acquisition of SWDS is immediately accretive to Spencer Capital and is complementary to its existing portfolio of companies. The financial and operational support of Spencer Capital will provide SWDS with the opportunity to grow its presence and expand its client capabilities, while maintaining its autonomy. Dealers are expected to significantly benefit due to increased and efficient access to products and services across the Spencer platform, notably from Spencer Re, a reinsurance firm, and USA Risk, an independent captive insurance provider.
“We’ve known the team at SouthWest Dealer Services for years and they have an outstanding reputation in the industry, which we experienced firsthand through Spencer Re,” said Ken Shubin Stein, Chairman of Spencer Capital. “The partnership is both a natural and strategic fit as there are multiple growth channels for us moving forward. We’re excited to invest alongside the management team to build out a ‘coast to coast’ footprint for SWDS, which will both complement and fuel the development of Spencer’s existing global platform of leading and value-driven insurance and financial services companies.”
Commenting on the transaction, Steve Alderson, Founder of SWDS, said,
“Partnering with Spencer Capital is a best of both worlds situation. We’re looking to capitalize on the wave of industry consolidation and expand geographically through strategic acquisitions, while maintaining the level of local support that our dealers are accustomed to. SWDS has been approached by many capital sources over the years, but until we met the team at Spencer Capital, we hadn’t found a truly strategic partner that mirrored the image of what we are trying to create.”
SWDS will keep its name and continue to operate as it has effectively done for more than 25 years. There will be no personnel changes as a result of this transaction.
Spencer Capital Holdings, Ltd.
Spencer Capital Holdings, a global holding company, owns Spencer Re, a reinsurance firm focused on the American auto dealership industry, USA Risk Group, the largest independent captive insurance manager in the world, and is affiliated with Spencer Capital Management, a value-oriented investment management firm. Spencer Capital Management provides support to philanthropic endeavours including, Crutches 4 Kids, a non-profit organization devoted to helping children with physical disabilities walk. Spencer Capital Holdings was founded in 2011 by Chairman Dr. Ken Shubin Stein.
SouthWest Dealer Services
SouthWest Dealer Services is a leading independent full-service provider of finance and insurance (“F&I”) products and services to automotive dealers in the United States. The company has eight franchise-type offices across the US in Arizona, California, Colorado, Kansas, and Washington.
