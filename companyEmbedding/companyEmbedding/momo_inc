History[edit]
Founding and incorporation[edit]
Tang Yan, Zhang Sichuan, Lei Xiaoliang, Yong Li, and Li Zhiwei co-founded Beijing Momo Technology Co., Ltd., better known as Beijing Momo, in July 2011.[5] Prior to founding Beijing Momo, Tang Yan worked as editor and then editor-in-chief at NetEase, Inc.. In October 2014, Tang was named by Fortune Magazine as one of its “40 Under 40,” a list of the most powerful business elites under the age of 40.[5] The other co-founders all have prior experience with major Chinese Internet companies. In order to facilitate foreign investments, Beijing Momo’s co-founders, in November 2011, incorporated a holding company, Momo Technology Company Limited, registered the British Virgin Islands. In July 2014, Momo Technology Company Limited was renamed Momo Inc. and redomiciled to the Cayman Islands.[5] In December 2011, Momo Inc. established Momo Technology HK Company Limited (Momo HK) as a wholly owned subsidiary in Hong Kong. In March 2012, Momo HK established Beijing Momo Information Technology Co., Ltd.(Beijing Momo IT), a wholly owned People’s Republic of China subsidiary. In May 2013, Beijing Momo established Chengdu Momo Technology Co., Ltd.(Chengdu Momo), as a wholly owned subsidiary.[5] Momo Inc. recently formed a Delaware subsidiary, which is currently market research on the U.S. market.[5]
Growth[edit]
In December 2011, Momo announced reaching half a million users.[7] Three months later, the number of Momo users reached 2 million.[8] Momo reached 10 million users on its first anniversary in August 2012.[9] In October 2012, Momo surpassed 15 million users. In 2014, App Annie reported that Momo was the number 2 non-game app of 2013 in terms of revenue.[10] In February 2014, TechNode reported that Momo had announced reaching 100 million registered users. Momo executives also claimed they had reached 40 million monthly active users (MAU).[11] According to Momo Inc., in June 2014, total registered users and MAU reached 148 million and 52.4 million respectively.[12] China Internet Watch reported more conservative estimates. In the months of August and September 2014, Momo had 51.279 and 52.101 million MAU. While Momo’s MAU grew, Wechat and QQ both lost MAU within the same time frame.[13] Momo Inc.’s prospectus reported 60.2 million MAU in September 2014.[5] Despite consistent growth in revenue, Momo Inc. continues to record net losses.[5]
Financing[edit]
Momo Inc. reportedly raised USD 2.5 million in Series A financing. Angel investor, PurpleSky Capital (ZiHui ChuangTou), and Matrix Hong Kong led this round of financing.[14] However, Momo Inc.'s Form F-1 filed with the SEC reports that USD 5 million was raised in this round of financing.[5] Momo Inc. completed its Series B financing in October 2012. This round of financing was led by two institution investors and received $100 million valuation. China Renaissance Partners acted as the exclusive financial advisor.[15] There was much speculation as to whether or not Chinese e-commerce giant, Alibaba Group, was involved in this round of financing.[16] Momo Inc.’s registration statement verifies this claim.[5] In total, Momo Inc. raised approximately USD 40 million.[16] In October 2013, raised USD 45 million in Series C financing. Matrix Hong Kong, Gothic Partners, L.P., PJF Acorn I Trust, Gansett Partners, L.L.C., PH momo investment Ltd., Tenzing Holding 2011 Ltd., Alibaba Investment Limited, and DST Team Fund Limited were all issued and sold Series C preferred shares.[5] In May 2014, Momo Inc. raised USD 211.8 million in Series D financing. Momo Inc. sold Series D preferred shares to Sequoia Capital China Investment Holdco II, Ltd., Sequoia Capital China GF Holdco III-A, Ltd., SC China Growth III Co-Investment 2014-A, L.P., Rich Moon Limited, and Tiger Global Eight Holdings.
Product and services[edit]
Momo Inc.’s mobile application is available on Android, iOS, and Windows platforms. It enables users to establish and expand their social relationships based on similar locations and interests.[17] Some features of the application include subsections like: Nearby Users, Groups, Message Board, Topics, and Nearby Events. Users can send multi-media instant messages as well as play single and multi-player games within the app’s platform.[5] Users also make a Facebook-like profile and are encouraged to include as much information as possible. Momo execs claim that this allows their software to create more accurate matches with nearby strangers. Momo prides itself on sifting through the clutter of mobile Internet users to find personalized matches for its users.[18] Momo offers users paid membership subscriptions.[19] A membership will cost around USD 2 a month, or less if a user commits to a longer term of use. Benefits of a paid membership includes: VIP logos, advanced search options, discounts in the emoticon store, higher limits on maximum users in a group, and the ability to see a list of recent visitors to a user’s profile page.[5] As of September 30, 2014, there was 2.3 million paid subscriptions.[5] Like many other instant messaging services, Momo Inc. has integrated mobile games into their platform to monetize off their large user base. Third parties develop games, and revenues from in-game purchases are shared between Momo Inc. and the developers.
In August 2014, Momo Inc. launched Dao Dian Tong, a marketing tool for local merchants. Through Dao Dian Tong, local businesses and merchants can construct profile pages that allow Momo users to find them with the Momo’s LBS. Members can see the businesses just as they would see other Momo users.[5] Momo Inc. plans to further monetize user traffic by referring users from the Momo platform to e-commerce companies. Alibaba was specifically mentioned in Momo’s Form F-1.[5]
Corporate affairs and cultures[edit]
Anti-plagiarism[edit]
In December 2012, Momo made an official announcement to accuse Sina Corp of copycatting straight from all the features of Momo Group. However, Sina Corp did not give its formal response.
Statement made by NetEase[edit]
On December 10, 2014, Momo's founder and CEO Tang Yan's former employer NetEase released a statement, accusing that Tang Yan has professional ethic issues, business ethics issues, and has been detained due to personal affairs by the local police in 2007.[20]
Public opinions[edit]
Hook-ups and homeless dogs[edit]
On April 27, 2012, Mike Sui, a mixed-race comedian and performer in China, first posted his "12 Beijingers"[21] viral video which attracted nearly 5.17 million hits. In this video, one character mentions Momo, for the first time calling it a magical tool to get laid (Chinese: 约炮神器; pinyin: yuē pào shén qì ).[22] Momo Inc. has spent millions of dollars to reverse the image of Momo as a one-night stand app.[5] Momo, through its Weibo account, continues to engage the online community through various campaigns. Momo’s latest online campaign focused on supporting the homeless cats and dogs of China.[23]
A new way to build a relationship[edit]
Although Momo is widely considered as adult social application, there are couples claiming that meetings on Momo resulted in marriage.[24][25] Momo now focuses on building all types of relationships, and no longer propagates itself as exclusively a monogamous relationship building applications.

Third parties develop games, and revenues from in-game purchases are shared between Momo Inc. and the developers.
In August 2014, Momo Inc. launched Dao Dian Tong, a marketing tool for local merchants. Through Dao Dian Tong, local businesses and merchants can construct profile pages that allow Momo users to find them with the Momo’s LBS. Members can see the businesses just as they would see other Momo users.[5] Momo Inc. plans to further monetize user traffic by referring users from the Momo platform to e-commerce companies. Alibaba was specifically mentioned in Momo’s Form F-1.[5]
Corporate affairs and cultures[edit]
Anti-plagiarism[edit]
In December 2012, Momo made an official announcement to accuse Sina Corp of copycatting straight from all the features of Momo Group. However, Sina Corp did not give its formal response.
Statement made by NetEase[edit]
On December 10, 2014, Momo's founder and CEO Tang Yan's former employer NetEase released a statement, accusing that Tang Yan has professional ethic issues, business ethics issues, and has been detained due to personal affairs by the local police in 2007.[20]
Public opinions[edit]
Hook-ups and homeless dogs[edit]
On April 27, 2012, Mike Sui, a mixed-race comedian and performer in China, first posted his "12 Beijingers"[21] viral video which attracted nearly 5.17 million hits. In this video, one character mentions Momo, for the first time calling it a magical tool to get laid (Chinese: 约炮神器; pinyin: yuē pào shén qì ).[22] Momo Inc. has spent millions of dollars to reverse the image of Momo as a one-night stand app.[5] Momo, through its Weibo account, continues to engage the online community through various campaigns. Momo’s latest online campaign focused on supporting the homeless cats and dogs of China.[23]
A new way to build a relationship[edit]
Although Momo is widely considered as adult social application, there are couples claiming that meetings on Momo resulted in marriage.[24][25] Momo now focuses on building all types of relationships, and no longer propagates itself as exclusively a monogamous relationship building applications.

History[edit]
Founding and incorporation[edit]
Tang Yan, Zhang Sichuan, Lei Xiaoliang, Yong Li, and Li Zhiwei co-founded Beijing Momo Technology Co., Ltd., better known as Beijing Momo, in July 2011.[5] Prior to founding Beijing Momo, Tang Yan worked as editor and then editor-in-chief at NetEase, Inc.. In October 2014, Tang was named by Fortune Magazine as one of its “40 Under 40,” a list of the most powerful business elites under the age of 40.[5] The other co-founders all have prior experience with major Chinese Internet companies. In order to facilitate foreign investments, Beijing Momo’s co-founders, in November 2011, incorporated a holding company, Momo Technology Company Limited, registered the British Virgin Islands. In July 2014, Momo Technology Company Limited was renamed Momo Inc. and redomiciled to the Cayman Islands.[5] In December 2011, Momo Inc. established Momo Technology HK Company Limited (Momo HK) as a wholly owned subsidiary in Hong Kong. In March 2012, Momo HK established Beijing Momo Information Technology Co., Ltd.(Beijing Momo IT), a wholly owned People’s Republic of China subsidiary. In May 2013, Beijing Momo established Chengdu Momo Technology Co., Ltd.(Chengdu Momo), as a wholly owned subsidiary.[5] Momo Inc. recently formed a Delaware subsidiary, which is currently market research on the U.S. market.[5]
Growth[edit]
In December 2011, Momo announced reaching half a million users.[7] Three months later, the number of Momo users reached 2 million.[8] Momo reached 10 million users on its first anniversary in August 2012.[9] In October 2012, Momo surpassed 15 million users. In 2014, App Annie reported that Momo was the number 2 non-game app of 2013 in terms of revenue.[10] In February 2014, TechNode reported that Momo had announced reaching 100 million registered users. Momo executives also claimed they had reached 40 million monthly active users (MAU).[11] According to Momo Inc., in June 2014, total registered users and MAU reached 148 million and 52.4 million respectively.[12] China Internet Watch reported more conservative estimates. In the months of August and September 2014, Momo had 51.279 and 52.101 million MAU. While Momo’s MAU grew, Wechat and QQ both lost MAU within the same time frame.[13] Momo Inc.’s prospectus reported 60.2 million MAU in September 2014.[5] Despite consistent growth in revenue, Momo Inc. continues to record net losses.[5]
Financing[edit]
Momo Inc. reportedly raised USD 2.5 million in Series A financing. Angel investor, PurpleSky Capital (ZiHui ChuangTou), and Matrix Hong Kong led this round of financing.[14] However, Momo Inc.'s Form F-1 filed with the SEC reports that USD 5 million was raised in this round of financing.[5] Momo Inc. completed its Series B financing in October 2012. This round of financing was led by two institution investors and received $100 million valuation. China Renaissance Partners acted as the exclusive financial advisor.[15] There was much speculation as to whether or not Chinese e-commerce giant, Alibaba Group, was involved in this round of financing.[16] Momo Inc.’s registration statement verifies this claim.[5] In total, Momo Inc. raised approximately USD 40 million.[16] In October 2013, raised USD 45 million in Series C financing. Matrix Hong Kong, Gothic Partners, L.P., PJF Acorn I Trust, Gansett Partners, L.L.C., PH momo investment Ltd., Tenzing Holding 2011 Ltd., Alibaba Investment Limited, and DST Team Fund Limited were all issued and sold Series C preferred shares.[5] In May 2014, Momo Inc. raised USD 211.8 million in Series D financing. Momo Inc. sold Series D preferred shares to Sequoia Capital China Investment Holdco II, Ltd., Sequoia Capital China GF Holdco III-A, Ltd., SC China Growth III Co-Investment 2014-A, L.P., Rich Moon Limited, and Tiger Global Eight Holdings.
Product and services[edit]
Momo Inc.’s mobile application is available on Android, iOS, and Windows platforms. It enables users to establish and expand their social relationships based on similar locations and interests.[17] Some features of the application include subsections like: Nearby Users, Groups, Message Board, Topics, and Nearby Events. Users can send multi-media instant messages as well as play single and multi-player games within the app’s platform.[5] Users also make a Facebook-like profile and are encouraged to include as much information as possible. Momo execs claim that this allows their software to create more accurate matches with nearby strangers. Momo prides itself on sifting through the clutter of mobile Internet users to find personalized matches for its users.[18] Momo offers users paid membership subscriptions.[19] A membership will cost around USD 2 a month, or less if a user commits to a longer term of use. Benefits of a paid membership includes: VIP logos, advanced search options, discounts in the emoticon store, higher limits on maximum users in a group, and the ability to see a list of recent visitors to a user’s profile page.[5] As of September 30, 2014, there was 2.3 million paid subscriptions.[5] Like many other instant messaging services, Momo Inc. has integrated mobile games into their platform to monetize off their large user base.

History[edit]
Founding and incorporation[edit]
Tang Yan, Zhang Sichuan, Lei Xiaoliang, Yong Li, and Li Zhiwei co-founded Beijing Momo Technology Co., Ltd., better known as Beijing Momo, in July 2011.[5] Prior to founding Beijing Momo, Tang Yan worked as editor and then editor-in-chief at NetEase, Inc.. In October 2014, Tang was named by Fortune Magazine as one of its “40 Under 40,” a list of the most powerful business elites under the age of 40.[5] The other co-founders all have prior experience with major Chinese Internet companies. In order to facilitate foreign investments, Beijing Momo’s co-founders, in November 2011, incorporated a holding company, Momo Technology Company Limited, registered the British Virgin Islands. In July 2014, Momo Technology Company Limited was renamed Momo Inc. and redomiciled to the Cayman Islands.[5] In December 2011, Momo Inc. established Momo Technology HK Company Limited (Momo HK) as a wholly owned subsidiary in Hong Kong. In March 2012, Momo HK established Beijing Momo Information Technology Co., Ltd.(Beijing Momo IT), a wholly owned People’s Republic of China subsidiary. In May 2013, Beijing Momo established Chengdu Momo Technology Co., Ltd.(Chengdu Momo), as a wholly owned subsidiary.[5] Momo Inc. recently formed a Delaware subsidiary, which is currently market research on the U.S. market.[5]
Growth[edit]
In December 2011, Momo announced reaching half a million users.[7] Three months later, the number of Momo users reached 2 million.[8] Momo reached 10 million users on its first anniversary in August 2012.[9] In October 2012, Momo surpassed 15 million users. In 2014, App Annie reported that Momo was the number 2 non-game app of 2013 in terms of revenue.[10] In February 2014, TechNode reported that Momo had announced reaching 100 million registered users. Momo executives also claimed they had reached 40 million monthly active users (MAU).[11] According to Momo Inc., in June 2014, total registered users and MAU reached 148 million and 52.4 million respectively.[12] China Internet Watch reported more conservative estimates. In the months of August and September 2014, Momo had 51.279 and 52.101 million MAU. While Momo’s MAU grew, Wechat and QQ both lost MAU within the same time frame.[13] Momo Inc.’s prospectus reported 60.2 million MAU in September 2014.[5] Despite consistent growth in revenue, Momo Inc. continues to record net losses.[5]
Financing[edit]
Momo Inc. reportedly raised USD 2.5 million in Series A financing. Angel investor, PurpleSky Capital (ZiHui ChuangTou), and Matrix Hong Kong led this round of financing.[14] However, Momo Inc.'s Form F-1 filed with the SEC reports that USD 5 million was raised in this round of financing.[5] Momo Inc. completed its Series B financing in October 2012. This round of financing was led by two institution investors and received $100 million valuation. China Renaissance Partners acted as the exclusive financial advisor.[15] There was much speculation as to whether or not Chinese e-commerce giant, Alibaba Group, was involved in this round of financing.[16] Momo Inc.’s registration statement verifies this claim.[5] In total, Momo Inc. raised approximately USD 40 million.[16] In October 2013, raised USD 45 million in Series C financing. Matrix Hong Kong, Gothic Partners, L.P., PJF Acorn I Trust, Gansett Partners, L.L.C., PH momo investment Ltd., Tenzing Holding 2011 Ltd., Alibaba Investment Limited, and DST Team Fund Limited were all issued and sold Series C preferred shares.[5] In May 2014, Momo Inc. raised USD 211.8 million in Series D financing. Momo Inc. sold Series D preferred shares to Sequoia Capital China Investment Holdco II, Ltd., Sequoia Capital China GF Holdco III-A, Ltd., SC China Growth III Co-Investment 2014-A, L.P., Rich Moon Limited, and Tiger Global Eight Holdings.
Product and services[edit]
Momo Inc.’s mobile application is available on Android, iOS, and Windows platforms. It enables users to establish and expand their social relationships based on similar locations and interests.[17] Some features of the application include subsections like: Nearby Users, Groups, Message Board, Topics, and Nearby Events. Users can send multi-media instant messages as well as play single and multi-player games within the app’s platform.[5] Users also make a Facebook-like profile and are encouraged to include as much information as possible. Momo execs claim that this allows their software to create more accurate matches with nearby strangers. Momo prides itself on sifting through the clutter of mobile Internet users to find personalized matches for its users.[18] Momo offers users paid membership subscriptions.[19] A membership will cost around USD 2 a month, or less if a user commits to a longer term of use. Benefits of a paid membership includes: VIP logos, advanced search options, discounts in the emoticon store, higher limits on maximum users in a group, and the ability to see a list of recent visitors to a user’s profile page.[5] As of September 30, 2014, there was 2.3 million paid subscriptions.[5] Like many other instant messaging services, Momo Inc. has integrated mobile games into their platform to monetize off their large user base. Third parties develop games, and revenues from in-game purchases are shared between Momo Inc. and the developers.
In August 2014, Momo Inc. launched Dao Dian Tong, a marketing tool for local merchants. Through Dao Dian Tong, local businesses and merchants can construct profile pages that allow Momo users to find them with the Momo’s LBS. Members can see the businesses just as they would see other Momo users.[5] Momo Inc. plans to further monetize user traffic by referring users from the Momo platform to e-commerce companies. Alibaba was specifically mentioned in Momo’s Form F-1.[5]
Corporate affairs and cultures[edit]
Anti-plagiarism[edit]
In December 2012, Momo made an official announcement to accuse Sina Corp of copycatting straight from all the features of Momo Group. However, Sina Corp did not give its formal response.
Statement made by NetEase[edit]
On December 10, 2014, Momo's founder and CEO Tang Yan's former employer NetEase released a statement, accusing that Tang Yan has professional ethic issues, business ethics issues, and has been detained due to personal affairs by the local police in 2007.[20]
Public opinions[edit]
Hook-ups and homeless dogs[edit]
On April 27, 2012, Mike Sui, a mixed-race comedian and performer in China, first posted his "12 Beijingers"[21] viral video which attracted nearly 5.17 million hits. In this video, one character mentions Momo, for the first time calling it a magical tool to get laid (Chinese: 约炮神器; pinyin: yuē pào shén qì ).[22] Momo Inc. has spent millions of dollars to reverse the image of Momo as a one-night stand app.[5] Momo, through its Weibo account, continues to engage the online community through various campaigns. Momo’s latest online campaign focused on supporting the homeless cats and dogs of China.[23]
A new way to build a relationship[edit]
Although Momo is widely considered as adult social application, there are couples claiming that meetings on Momo resulted in marriage.[24][25] Momo now focuses on building all types of relationships, and no longer propagates itself as exclusively a monogamous relationship building applications.

The Company's Momo platform includes its Momo mobile application and a range of related features, functionalities, tools and services that it provides to users, customers and platform partners. Momo users can maintain their relationships through its private and group communication tools, content creation and sharing functions, as well as the offline social activities promoted on its platform. It also offers live music and entertainment broadcasts on its Momo platform. The Momo mobile application, which is available on android, iPhone operating system (iOS) and Windows platforms, enables users to establish social relationships based on locations and interests. Momo offers a personal way for users to discover people nearby, and the Company facilitates the connecting, communicating, interacting, and content sharing with others. Momo features various location and interest-based features, such as Nearby functions and other functions.Nearby FunctionsNearby People function allows users to find out the distance from each other in real time and is the primary tool through, which users can establish and expand their social relationships. Nearby People is organized under its default tab and presents a curated list of nearby users with their profile pictures, relative distances and the time they last checked-in on Momo. The list of nearby people is by default ordered by proximity to the application users. All users can customize the list by viewing nearby people by gender and a specific period of time within which the nearby people last checked in. Users can initiate contact with nearby users by sending greeting messages and selecting to follow their accounts in order to receive notifications on their status updates. Its application also allows users to block other users and report inappropriate behaviors. Its members can further filter the list of nearby users by age group, occupation, horoscope and whether the nearby person has linked his or her Momo account with other social network applications. It provides a suite of push notifications, which include status updates, greetings from nearby users, chat messages and location of Momo friends. Its application will also notify users when their Momo friends come within close proximity. It also keeps users up-to-date on the latest postings in their groups, as well as groups that their Momo friends have joined.The User Profile function allows users to share basic personal information and interests and encourage interactions. After downloading and installing the application, each user is asked to fill out a profile featuring pictures and detailed personal information, such as name, age, horoscope, occupation, employer, school, relationship status, date of registration with Momo, groups and topics joined, interests, accounts at other social network applications, frequent places of appearance and a personal note. Members can also post a voice recording as part of their profile. The profile page also contains a link to a chronologically arranged display of status updates, blogs and pictures posted by the user, allowing the user to share his or her experience and interest. The Company has developed a system whereby each user is assigned one of six scores based primarily on his or her behavioral patterns, profile credibility and degree of engagement. Each user can monitor the score on his or her profile page.The Message Board function contains a stream of feeds, including status updates, micro-blogs, photos, videos, music and commentaries posted by nearby users, facilitating connections between people in the same neighborhoods. The order of feeds is defined by its algorithm, which is based on both physical proximity and compatibility of user profiles. For each feed they create, users can control whether the feed may be viewed by all Momo users, only their friends or only themselves. Users can comment on or like the postings made by others, which are arranged by proximity. Message Board can also be linked to users' WeChat, Weibo and QQ accounts, such that users can simultaneously share their Message Board updates with their friends on those accounts. The Message Board is grouped under its Nearby default tab together with its other functions Nearby People and Groups. Its application allows users to create and participate in location-based groups across points of interest, including residential complexes, educational institutions and commercial buildings. Location-based groups are generally established around a certain topic of interest.Each group is given a shared Momo discussion page, on which group members can discuss their common interests, post their photos and exchange messages. Its users can create groups by first selecting a specific location around which the group is centered, which must be associated with a specific residential complex, educational institution or commercial building, and second, selecting a topic of interest for the group. The Company limits the size of each group to 100 users in order to foster a closer, engaged and interactive community. The limitation for the size of a particular group is determined by whether the group's creator is a member and the activity level of the group, such as the frequency of messaging among users. Its application displays nearby groups created by users as ranked by proximity. A user must apply to join a nearby group, and membership admission is determined by the creator and managers of the group. In addition to its default distance-based listing of nearby groups, users are also able to search for groups using keywords. The Company also displays who among the people that a user has followed are members of a particular group. Users can propose and organize offline events for the location-based groups. A separate page is created for an event containing information about the activity, such as type, venue and time, based on which group members can decide whether to join the event and confirm attendance. A list of confirmed attendees will be shown on the activity page as well. The Company has established groups for its mobile games players called Player Unions.Other FunctionsThe Friends' Message Board contains feeds from users' friends on their contact lists, aimed at facilitating interaction and relationships between users and their friends. The Company's Topics is a feature aimed at enabling users to discover other users with common interests. Its Topics present themes of interest to all users. Users who have joined a certain Topic, such as Fitness or Pets, can post threads and interact with other users by replying to the threads. Users can view other users who have joined the same Topic, in the order of proximity. The Company also recommends Topics and threads to users based on their profiles.

Momo Inc. - A Risky Investment For Reasons You Might Not Expect - Momo (NASDAQ:MOMO) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Momo Inc. - A Risky Investment For Reasons You Might Not ExpectJan.21.15 | About: Momo (MOMO) China Stock Research Long-term horizon, value, research analyst, ChinaChina Stock ResearchSummaryThe app could run afoul of China's Internet police.Allegations against the founder are troubling indicator of corporate governance.Looks like a high-risk investment with little clarity on future prospects.Momo (MOMO, profile) was the last China stock to IPO in the US in 2014, and was initially greeted by great expectations, based on the potential of its location-based app technology. After taking a closer look at the company, its financials, and considering the current environment in China, it seems like a stock that should be off limits to all except those with a high risk tolerance.
When the company first launched its app in 2011, the main feature was finding other users in the nearby vicinity. Indeed, search results were organized by distance (closest shown first), something which led to many Chinese netizens joking that it was basically an app to find a date, the kind which don't require flowers.
After relatively humorous beginnings, the app has matured; perhaps rolling out something as edgy as radar map for local area singles was a clever way to get a user base quickly. The company added more features for members (enhanced profiles, custom emoticons, etc.) which have helped Momo begin to monetize its user base, which it claimed was over 180 million strong at the end of FY2014.
But there is a decidedly different side to the story that could be a business risk that many investors may not be considering.
What does Momo really do?
Something people outside of China might not know is that the culture is rather conservative (example: the term "boyfriend" basically means "fiancée who hasn't proposed yet, but will"; casual dating doesn't really exist like it does in the West). This could be a problem for Momo, which has a somewhat colorful reputation as China's Tinder. This may seem absurd (why would the government care?), but China's defense of morals and culture have snared more than a few victims in the past. One handy example is Sina Corp. (SINA, profile), which had two Internet content licenses revoked in 2014. A more recent head-scratching event showcasing the moral police on patrol is a domestic drama that was temporarily suspended and then later censored to remove actresses' plunging necklines in early 2015.

Authorities in China began its "Clean the Web" campaign in April 2014, and it although there haven't been any high-profile targets as of late, that does not by any means indicate that the campaign is over. Indeed, judging by earlier moves by the Xi administration to incorporate a sense of morality in China's art (even banning weird architecture), guessing what may happen next seems almost impossible.
Achieving a comfort level with Momo's app requires acknowledging that the app operates in a relatively uncharted territory in China, and with it comes legitimate risks. The company can maintain that its app is only for meeting new friends and acquaintances, but as Sina learned last April, it may ultimately be responsible for its members who use the app outside of the intended scope. And the app seems to be on authorities' radar, judging by a 2014 editorial in Xinhua. Caveat emptor indeed.
Financials
Momo is a young company, and its financial results do not provide much basis for analysis (two full years of annual data and seven quarters, during most of which, there was no revenue). The company's product (the app) is still very new, and although there has been progress on the monetization front, there is little information available to measure how the business performs in different conditions (i.e. multiple operating cycles).
Another area where Momo falls short is providing operating metrics for time series analysis. Operating metrics are important non-financial indicators that can gauge how the business is performing in ways that a P&L can't. The company does provide some data, in the form of MAU, DAU, and paying member data, however it was less than two years' worth (one of which includes zero revenue, so analyzing the financial impact of half of the data isn't meaningful.)
As an illustration of how important operating data can be to framing financial results, the company reported a huge run-up in Sales and marketing spending right before its Q4 IPO, spending more than the previous four quarters' of revenue. Momo also reported to have over 180 million registered users by the end of Q3. Well, investors have little to go on to gauge if the ramp-up in marketing spending will help drive revenue, or if was instead a way to "pad the stats" before the IPO. Either scenario is possible, and without some time series analysis to estimate the lag effect of marketing spending and revenue, guesswork is required.

Legal trouble ahead? So what?
Right before Momo IPOed, NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES) unleashed some very troubling allegations against the co-founder and CEO Yan Tang, accusing Mr. Tang of violating his employment agreement with NetEase affiliate Wangzhiyi. Specifically, the complaint noted that Momo was founded in July 2011, and launched its first app in August 2011, a period during which Mr. Tang was still an employee of a NetEase affiliate.
Although the complaint seemed like little more than a competitive barb (it included a request for an apology, but did reserve the right for more legal action), this should be something on shareholder's radar. The reason this seemingly harmless issue warrants attention is because if true, one could conclude that Mr. Tang places little import on legally binding documents like his employment contract. The counterpoint that he was probably on "garden leave" is valid, but the issue may shed some light on corporate governance practices at Momo.
It seems pertinent to note that Momo uses a VIE structure, something which separates shareholders from the actual assets that drive the business. The VIE is owned by the co-founders of the company, and is responsible for 100% of the revenue that Momo generates. There is only a series of contractual arrangements tying operating assets to shareholders' claims, and as such, shareholders are placing a significant degree of trust in Momo's executives to act in their best interests. If the NetEase allegations turn out to be true, it could seriously call into question Momo's corporate governance.
Alibaba backing it doesn't really matter
It's not news that e-commerce powerhouse Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) invested in Momo in a pre-IPO funding round. There seems to be a general sentiment that this means that Momo has received a blessing from Alibaba, therefore making it a safe bet for the long run.
Ignoring the absurdity of coattails investing (making an investment on the premise that another investor has performed adequate due diligence), taking a step back shows that this might not be a sound investment strategy. Although following in Alibaba's footsteps would have worked out when the company took a stake in AutoNavi before eventually buying outright (buying in around $15 in May 2013, holding out for $21 a year later), the same can't be said for Youku Tudou (YOKU, profile) or Weibo.com (NASDAQ:WB) investors. Both stocks are considerably closer to their 52-week lows than their highs; it would seem that an investment from Alibaba is no silver bullet.

The Takeaway
Momo looks like a high risk investment, partially due to the limited operating history, but also due to the unique characteristics of regulating the Chinese internet. From our perspective, the latter is the biggest risk to investors, and something which can't really be hedged (one top news story away from being a major problem).
The company could eventually prove that all of the above-mentioned potential issues are inconsequential, however we think that until there is more clarity, putting money to work in this stock is highly speculative and should be avoided.

YesThis review was helpful for 0 user!5 of 5Momo's On a BuickGreat wheels! Everyone says the look better than factory wheels! The chrome wheels on a 2006 Buick Lucerne I bought for my wife were peeling and corroding. Even though the car only has 17,000 miles and is a little old lady's car, the wheels looked bad and could cause tire leaks. I researched many wheels online, and looked locally, but I kept coming back to CARiD. They seemed very professional, and I called a few times before ordering to ask questions, and they were very helpful. I opted to get the Momo's in a package with Michelin Defender tires. I was very impressed with how they came packaged and arrived with no damage. I had my dealer mount them with no problems. The ride and handling are fantastic now.  Momo wheels are a quality product, and I recommend them to anyone. I will definitely check CARiD the next time I need anything for any of my vehicles.DPosted by Daniel (Parkersburg, WV) / November 22, 20142006 Buick LucerneWas this review helpful for you? YesThis review was helpful for 0 user!5 of 5Great WheelsTook nearly a month to get them.  Would have been great if they'd mentioned that it could take that long before I ordered them.  They look amazing on the truck, maroon '07 Avalanche.  Really happy with the wheels.  I'm the original owner.  The original, aftermarket, wheels had a vibration that I couldn't completely cure.  These fit perfect and provide a smooth ride.  Very happy.GPosted by Gerald (Crowley, LA) / July 8, 20142007 Chevy AvalancheWas this review helpful for you? YesThis review was helpful for 0 user!5 of 5Very Pleased!Bought a set of MOMO NEXTs for a 2011 Optima SX. The Kia OEM wheels are 7.5 inches wide with a 46 mm offset but besides different wheels, I wanted to change the look a little bit. The MOMOs are 8 inches wide with a 40 mm offset so my tires seem a little wider and the wheels are pushed a little more to the outside, a little more flush with the fender. CARiD said they would fit and they did - perfectly. The build quality of the MOMO wheels is also very good. Love the wheels and they look great on my car. Very pleased!

YesThis review was helpful for 0 user!5 of 5MOMO Drone 17"After looking at hundreds of rims I decided to go with the MOMO Drones 17" for my 2013 Hyundai Santa Fe sport. Shipping was very slow. Rims took 2 1/2 weeks to arrive. I had the rims installed at Costco which only took 50 minutes to install including programming the TPMS which I also purchased from CARiD.com.  I was not sure about the look of the rims at first thinking of all of the other rims I had to choose from. I am very happy with my choice, they look great. The sporty design of the rims flows very well with the mid sized SUV. The rims do not look cheap.They are very well made. I am very satisfied.

Custom Wheels 101

Mike Grady

													If you're considering upgrading your car or truck with larger diameter wheels, you've come to the right place. When doing research for your purchase you may encounter terms that you may not be familiar with like offset, centerbore and bolt pattern. These are wheel dimensions and this article was prepared to explain the various dimensions and how they are measured. To get the proper wheel for your car or truck, the wheel must have the right combination of these dimensions. Just as the sleeve length on a shirt or the inseam on a pair of pants has to be right for them to fit your body, your wheels have to be the right size for them to fit properly on your car or truck.
												

DIAMETER
													Diameter is the most familiar wheel dimension: When someone says they have 20" rims, they're referring to the wheel diameter. Diameter is the distance between the bead seating areas (where the tire seals to the rim) at the opposite sides of the rim when viewed from the side, not including the wheel flanges. The wheel diameter determines how much of the wheel that you see when you look at a car or truck; the larger the diameter the more wheel that is visible...

Aftermarket wheels are a brilliant upgrade that not only adds to the look and feel of any vehicle, but also delivers a smoother ride and improved handling, which is definitely more enjoyable. When you are about to invest in custom wheels, you want to get the best bang for the buck. Know that we go that extra mile to ensure that all of the rims we've selected for you are produced from the richest alloys and steel. Each wheel is expertly designed and thoughtfully manufactured using the latest in technology to guarantee OEM precision. Stronger, shinier, and way hotter - the right rims always make a huge difference.
A custom wheel may seem simple, yet the production process that stands behind it is by no means an easy thing to do. Manufacturing of a rim starts by melting the material (magnesium or aluminum alloys, or steel) at an extremely high temperature. The raw material is poured in a pre-formed cast. The designers let the metal cool down, and then they trim off any excess material. After the sample is shaped, it is inspected for the imperfections and defects to guarantee the highest quality of the final product. In case there are any flaws, they are either cured at this stage or the wheel is modified altogether. Surely, rims are not made in the same way, so when a new design is created from scratch, each manufacturer may use a variation of the above process.
To make a custom wheel stronger, the ready product is brought into an oven to be heat-treated. After a rim is cooled, it is inspected once again. This time, the sample is examined for leaks and impact reaction. If a prototype complies with all the quality standards and requirements, and features a perfect fit for a certain vehicle, the ready sample is kept for future forgings and casts. The wheels that are made for distribution simply copy the technique used for the prototype. After the ready custom wheels are sprayed with primer, they are carefully scanned for any blemishes or shortcomings. At the end of the manufacturing process, the final finish is applied to the rims. Whatever finish you choose, be it chrome-plating, black-powder coating, or custom color, it is applied at this point.
There is no compromise when it comes to design, efficiency, and fit of the aftermarket wheels we've handpicked for you. Our aim is to provide you with the most extensive selection of top-quality car rims. We offer the latest trends and elegant classics. Chrome rims and black wheels, two-tone, brushed, machined, silver, polished, custom painted, and so much more! On our digital shelves, you'll find the largest selection of finishes and sizes. You can go after the luxurious and tasteful 22 inch wheels or opt for something bigger, for example monstrous 26" rims. The goal of our assortment is to satisfy even the most discerning aficionados. We do our best to deliver the quality you need and the choices you want.
We want to make it easy for you to get the paramount products, which is why we cover all the bases. For those who drool over an aggressively-designed and sporty image, we bring robust Kinesis and Fesler rims, offered in sizes ranging from 18 inches to 24" wheels in diameter. And if you long for elegance and opulence, we store stellar rims delivered by Giovanna, Lexani, and Asanti, available in sizes such as 28 inches, 22 and all the way down to 20 inch wheels. We've also lined up the largest selection of car and truck wheels to satisfy your tastes. You get more styles, more sizes, and more finishes than ever before. And don't forget, our team of experts is always ready to guide you through the selection process and assist you in choosing the perfect wheel and tire package.

I spent a lot of time looking for a good quality wheel at a reasonable price. They're reps are responsive and knowledgeable and take the time to make sure you get exactly what you want, as fast as possible.   Only negative I found, is they were out of stock (guess everyone else loves this wheel too), so I had to wait for the manufacture to make them and ship to me. My rep from CAriD called me to offer other options, but I was set on these wheels. It was worth the wait, which was half the time he quoted me. I highly recommend CARiD to anyone who is looking for wheels and tires.RPosted by Rod (Vancouver, WA) / June 21, 20172008 Chevy TahoeWas this review helpful for you?

They were in perfect condition, but shipping was very poor. My shipment was moved back several days and cost about a extra week to come in. When I called the employee on the phone was very helping and polite, but I still didn't have my rims when they were supposed to be here. Also, when the rims came in, they did not contain the wheel locks and lug nuts that I purchased with the rims. They did not come in until a week later and I no longer needed them because I paid for lugs and locks at the tire place which cost me $70. Very disappointed with that due to such a high dollar purchase. Other than the shipping, still a great product and company.

Custom Wheels 101

Mike Grady

													If you're considering upgrading your car or truck with larger diameter wheels, you've come to the right place. When doing research for your purchase you may encounter terms that you may not be familiar with like offset, centerbore and bolt pattern. These are wheel dimensions and this article was prepared to explain the various dimensions and how they are measured. To get the proper wheel for your car or truck, the wheel must have the right combination of these dimensions. Just as the sleeve length on a shirt or the inseam on a pair of pants has to be right for them to fit your body, your wheels have to be the right size for them to fit properly on your car or truck.
												

DIAMETER
													Diameter is the most familiar wheel dimension: When someone says they have 20" rims, they're referring to the wheel diameter. Diameter is the distance between the bead seating areas (where the tire seals to the rim) at the opposite sides of the rim when viewed from the side, not including the wheel flanges. The wheel diameter determines how much of the wheel that you see when you look at a car or truck; the larger the diameter the more wheel that is visible...

Aftermarket wheels are a brilliant upgrade that not only adds to the look and feel of any vehicle, but also delivers a smoother ride and improved handling, which is definitely more enjoyable. When you are about to invest in custom wheels, you want to get the best bang for the buck. Know that we go that extra mile to ensure that all of the rims we've selected for you are produced from the richest alloys and steel. Each wheel is expertly designed and thoughtfully manufactured using the latest in technology to guarantee OEM precision. Stronger, shinier, and way hotter - the right rims always make a huge difference.
A custom wheel may seem simple, yet the production process that stands behind it is by no means an easy thing to do. Manufacturing of a rim starts by melting the material (magnesium or aluminum alloys, or steel) at an extremely high temperature. The raw material is poured in a pre-formed cast. The designers let the metal cool down, and then they trim off any excess material. After the sample is shaped, it is inspected for the imperfections and defects to guarantee the highest quality of the final product. In case there are any flaws, they are either cured at this stage or the wheel is modified altogether. Surely, rims are not made in the same way, so when a new design is created from scratch, each manufacturer may use a variation of the above process.
To make a custom wheel stronger, the ready product is brought into an oven to be heat-treated. After a rim is cooled, it is inspected once again. This time, the sample is examined for leaks and impact reaction. If a prototype complies with all the quality standards and requirements, and features a perfect fit for a certain vehicle, the ready sample is kept for future forgings and casts. The wheels that are made for distribution simply copy the technique used for the prototype. After the ready custom wheels are sprayed with primer, they are carefully scanned for any blemishes or shortcomings. At the end of the manufacturing process, the final finish is applied to the rims. Whatever finish you choose, be it chrome-plating, black-powder coating, or custom color, it is applied at this point.
There is no compromise when it comes to design, efficiency, and fit of the aftermarket wheels we've handpicked for you. Our aim is to provide you with the most extensive selection of top-quality car rims. We offer the latest trends and elegant classics. Chrome rims and black wheels, two-tone, brushed, machined, silver, polished, custom painted, and so much more! On our digital shelves, you'll find the largest selection of finishes and sizes. You can go after the luxurious and tasteful 22 inch wheels or opt for something bigger, for example monstrous 26" rims. The goal of our assortment is to satisfy even the most discerning aficionados. We do our best to deliver the quality you need and the choices you want.
We want to make it easy for you to get the paramount products, which is why we cover all the bases. For those who drool over an aggressively-designed and sporty image, we bring robust Kinesis and Fesler rims, offered in sizes ranging from 18 inches to 24" wheels in diameter.

We've also lined up the largest selection of car and truck wheels to satisfy your tastes. You get more styles, more sizes, and more finishes than ever before. And don't forget, our team of experts is always ready to guide you through the selection process and assist you in choosing the perfect wheel and tire package.

I spent a lot of time looking for a good quality wheel at a reasonable price. They're reps are responsive and knowledgeable and take the time to make sure you get exactly what you want, as fast as possible.   Only negative I found, is they were out of stock (guess everyone else loves this wheel too), so I had to wait for the manufacture to make them and ship to me. My rep from CAriD called me to offer other options, but I was set on these wheels. It was worth the wait, which was half the time he quoted me. I highly recommend CARiD to anyone who is looking for wheels and tires.RPosted by Rod (Vancouver, WA) / June 21, 20172008 Chevy TahoeWas this review helpful for you?

They were in perfect condition, but shipping was very poor. My shipment was moved back several days and cost about a extra week to come in. When I called the employee on the phone was very helping and polite, but I still didn't have my rims when they were supposed to be here. Also, when the rims came in, they did not contain the wheel locks and lug nuts that I purchased with the rims. They did not come in until a week later and I no longer needed them because I paid for lugs and locks at the tire place which cost me $70. Very disappointed with that due to such a high dollar purchase. Other than the shipping, still a great product and company.

Manufacturing of a rim starts by melting the material (magnesium or aluminum alloys, or steel) at an extremely high temperature. The raw material is poured in a pre-formed cast. The designers let the metal cool down, and then they trim off any excess material. After the sample is shaped, it is inspected for the imperfections and defects to guarantee the highest quality of the final product. In case there are any flaws, they are either cured at this stage or the wheel is modified altogether. Surely, rims are not made in the same way, so when a new design is created from scratch, each manufacturer may use a variation of the above process.
To make a custom wheel stronger, the ready product is brought into an oven to be heat-treated. After a rim is cooled, it is inspected once again. This time, the sample is examined for leaks and impact reaction. If a prototype complies with all the quality standards and requirements, and features a perfect fit for a certain vehicle, the ready sample is kept for future forgings and casts. The wheels that are made for distribution simply copy the technique used for the prototype. After the ready custom wheels are sprayed with primer, they are carefully scanned for any blemishes or shortcomings. At the end of the manufacturing process, the final finish is applied to the rims. Whatever finish you choose, be it chrome-plating, black-powder coating, or custom color, it is applied at this point.
There is no compromise when it comes to design, efficiency, and fit of the aftermarket wheels we've handpicked for you. Our aim is to provide you with the most extensive selection of top-quality car rims. We offer the latest trends and elegant classics.

I spent a lot of time looking for a good quality wheel at a reasonable price. They're reps are responsive and knowledgeable and take the time to make sure you get exactly what you want, as fast as possible.   Only negative I found, is they were out of stock (guess everyone else loves this wheel too), so I had to wait for the manufacture to make them and ship to me. My rep from CAriD called me to offer other options, but I was set on these wheels. It was worth the wait, which was half the time he quoted me. I highly recommend CARiD to anyone who is looking for wheels and tires.RPosted by Rod (Vancouver, WA) / June 21, 20172008 Chevy TahoeWas this review helpful for you?

They were in perfect condition, but shipping was very poor. My shipment was moved back several days and cost about a extra week to come in. When I called the employee on the phone was very helping and polite, but I still didn't have my rims when they were supposed to be here. Also, when the rims came in, they did not contain the wheel locks and lug nuts that I purchased with the rims. They did not come in until a week later and I no longer needed them because I paid for lugs and locks at the tire place which cost me $70. Very disappointed with that due to such a high dollar purchase. Other than the shipping, still a great product and company.

Unfortunately so do thieves, and in addition to those that might want a free set of wheels and tires for their own car, there are many more who want to flip them so they can put cash in their pockets. The value of today’s rims and tires and the ease with which they can be stolen – all it takes is a jack and a cordless impact wrench and a set can be removed in just minutes – make them a tempting target. Wheel locks are an affordable and effective theft deterrent.A stolen set of wheels and tires may leave you stranded at a most inopportune time and place. Your vehicle could also be damaged during the theft - the thieves only want your wheels and tires, they don’t care about your car. And unless your auto insurance policy specifically covers aftermarket custom parts, you may find yourself out several thousand dollars and be faced with having to come up with another set of wheels and tires out of pocket. Wheel locks are cheap compared with the cost of a set of wheels and tires. Our wheel locks are easy to use and function just like regular lug nuts. Each set has a unique, computer-generated pattern that will only accept the supplied key tool that is necessary for removal and installation.The high quality steel and hardening process used in the construction of our wheel locks ensures the ultimate in security, and the triple chrome plating provides long lasting luster. But don’t let your wheel lock be the only shiny lug on each wheel. The average chrome-plated lug nut is subjected to corrosion and discoloration from the elements. Plus the surface of the lug nuts can be further marred by lug wrenches and impact guns every time they’re removed and installed. Don’t let wheel lugs like that detract from the appearance of your wheels. Like our wheel locks, our lug nuts are also triple chrome plated to resist corrosion and provide long-lasting shine that won’t rust, chip, or peel. And if chrome’s not your thing we also have lug nuts that come anodized in a variety of colors.
The easiest way to upgrade the security and appearance of your wheels and tires is with a wheel installation kit. The kit includes one lock for each of the four wheels, the wheel key, and lug nuts. Kits are available for vehicles with 4, 5, 6, and 8 lug wheels. We offer wheel locks and lug nuts in every style including cone seat, bulge cone seat, radius/ball seat, and shank style. We also have spline drive lug nuts engineered to fit the smaller recesses in many wheels, open-ended lug nuts designed for racing vehicles with longer wheel studs, and to handle the high shock loads encountered in racing, high-strength wheel studs in a range of lengths made from heat-treated chrome moly. And of course, we also offer a large selection of lug bolts and bolt-style locks for vehicles so equipped.Featured BrandsMcGardDormanSparcoSkunk2GReddyMr. GasketCrownBaerGoodmarkAlloy USAProject MuWhite KnightGorilla AutomotiveWest CoastWheel MateWagnerRaybestosProject KicsH&RBlox RacingMetal LugzEuclidEMPIOERARPGuides & Articles Custom WheelsApril 18, 2016Factory Wheels | Glossary Of TermsWhether you are looking for a single wheel cover because one went AWOL, or an entire set of factory wheels to enhance the looks and value of your vehicle, you may be...
