Dali Systems Co.  $3.57 million  Fundraising. Albert S Lee  Submitted Jul 27  SEC Form

			in Private Financing News 












Share with your friendsYour NameYour EmailRecipient EmailEnter a MessageI read this article and found it very interesting, thought it might be interesting for you. The article is called Dali Systems Co.  $3.57 million  Fundraising. Albert S Lee  Submitted Jul 27  SEC Form and is was published by Octafinance.com at http://www.octafinance.com/dali-systems-co-3-57-million-fundraising-albert-s-lee-submitted-jul-27-sec-form/119057/.CaptchaSubmit
Dali Systems Co.  Financing
Dali Systems Co. Ltd., Corporation just  had published form D  about $3.57 million equity financing. This is a new filing. Dali Systems Co.  was able to  fundraise $500,000 so far. That is 14.00% of the  financing offer. The total  financing amount was $3.57 million.  The offering form was filed on 2015-07-27. The reason for the financing was: unspecified.  The fundraising still has about $3.07 million more and is not closed yet. We have to wait more to see if the offering will be fully taken.
 Dali Systems Co.  is based in Cayman Islands. The  company’s business is Telecommunications. The  form was  submitted by Albert S Lee President.  The company was incorporated more than five years ago. The filler’s address is: M&C Corp Svs Ltd, Po Box 309, Ugland House South Church Street, Grand Cayman, E9, Cayman Islands, Ky1-1104.  Albert S. Lee is the related person in the form and it has address: C/O Dali Syst, Mc Corp Svs, Po Box 309, Ugland House, South Church Street, Grand Cayman, E9, Cayman Islands, Ky1-1104. Link to Dali Systems Co.  Filing: 000146624815000001.
Analysis of Dali Systems Co.  Offering
On average,  startups in the Telecommunications sector, sell 85.70% of the total offering  amount. Dali Systems Co.  sold 14.00% of the offering.  The fundraising is still open. The average  financing size for companies in the Telecommunications industry is $125,000. The total amount raised is 300.00% bigger than the average for companies in the Telecommunications sector. The minimum investment for this  fundraising  was set at $0. If you know more about the reasons for the  fundraising, please comment below.
What is Form D? What It Is Used For
Form D disclosures could be used to track and understand better your competitors. The information in Form D is usually highly confidential for ventures and startups and they don’t like revealing it. This is because it reveals amount raised or planned to be raised as well as reasons for the financing. This could help competitors. Entrepreneurs usually want to keep their financing a ‘secret’ so they can stay in stealth mode for longer.
Why Fundraising Reporting Is Good For Dali Systems Co.  Also
The Form D signed by Albert S Lee might help Dali Systems Co. Ltd.’s sector. First, it helps potential customers feel more safe to deal with a firm that is well financed. The odds are higher that it will stay in the business. Second, this could attract other investors such as venture-capital firms, funds and angels. Third, positive PR effects could even bring leasing firms and venture lenders.

It’s to no surprise that in-Building Wireless is often considered as the “fourth” utility followed by water, electricity and heating/air-conditioning. To satisfy the “always connected” lifestyle of mobile subscribers, mobile operators, building owners and integrators must deliver the quality of service (QoS) and quality of experience (QoE) mobile users expert anywhere, at any time. Learn MorePublic Safety CoverageIn the event of a crisis, public safety personnel and first responders require reliable emergency responder radio coverage. Being able to communicate with their public safety two-way radio systems in-buildings is crucial for the first responders to respond and execute time-sensitive and mission-critical tasks to protect the public. Learn More  Digital Distributed Antenna System (DAS)Dali’s RF Router platform can serve as an end-to-end all digital Distributed Antenna System (DAS).
