Insurance sounds boring and dreary to most people. Not for us at Murphy, John R, however. While it is a serious business, we do not see insurance as boring - it is after all the business of keeping people in their homes, from going out of business and getting back on the road – essentially helping people lead normal lives and recover from disaster. This is interesting stuff! We are partnered with the right insurance carrier/s, people we have been doing business with for years. This enables us to comparison shop and gets you (our client) the best deal available. And the best deal is not always about price – but, hey – price is a big factor and we will never stop fighting to get you the best price. We help our clients with all kinds of insurance, but here are the main insurance types our agency focuses on -

Auto insurance – do you know what coverage you have? Most of our clients gloss over when we start talking liability, collision, comprehensive insurance coverages. And why do the limits have to be different based on your specific needs? Rest assured, we understand what is needed to operate a vehicle in and around Chesterfield, MO and will handle all the details for you.
Business Insurance – own or operate a business? Do you need insurance before you can execute on a job/contract? Not sure what type of insurance you need? Do you just need the minimum or are you thinking about future exposure to lawsuits and injury claims? Our commercial insurance agents are standing by to help you get the right policy to help your business succeed.
Homeowners insurance – who knows where the value lies in an insurance policy when it comes to something as local-specific as insurance for a structure, building, home in a specific location – your local insurance agent – that’s who! Let us showcase our knowledge of the area in and around Chesterfield, MO. You will be confident that you found the best local partner for your insurance needs.

Stick with basic plans that cover as much as you need without any additional costs.

For example, if the annual cost of your auto insurance is 10 percent or more of the total value of your car, drop all but the most essential coverage. This is especially applicable if the car you drive is older and could be replaced with savings. Otherwise, you are paying for insurance that will never actually benefit you in the event of a serious crash.If I have insurance can I still shop around for a better rate?Yes. Even after you've chosen a plan and started paying into it, consider looking around again when it comes time to renew the policy. Consider using an independent agent when searching for a new insurance policy. While traditional agents can still find a good deal, independent agents can choose from a variety of providers and tailor your coverage to your specific needs. The Internet has also made comparison shopping easy. Potential customers can often get free quotes online very quickly.How do I file a life insurance claim?Send your insurer a claim form for each beneficiary in the plan, as well as a certified copy of the policyholder's death certificate. With the proper information, life insurance claims are generally straightforward. Problems may arise if the policyholder has died within two years of opening the policy. In this case, an attorney may be needed to settle the claim.How do I file a homeowners insurance claim?In the case of damage, take pictures of the affected area as soon as any safety or health emergencies are resolved. Take note of what happened and all the relevant circumstances and report to your insurer as soon as possible.

If any of your possessions were damaged, use an inventory of your important assets and make note of this in the claim. Once an adjuster has made their own report, review it for accuracy.How do I file an auto insurance claim?If you're involved in an accident, you need to call the police right away and have them document the situation. You can file a claim upon obtaining the police report.

It's also a good idea, if possible, to take your own notes to record: what happened before the accident, the date and time, traffic signs in the area and road conditions. Also get the other driver's name, address, license plate number, and insurance information. Even photos taken with a cell phone camera can help the claims process. Once you have this documentation, call your insurance company right away.How soon should  I file an insurance claim?Filing an insurance claim can be stressful and confusing, but you need to begin the process as soon as possible to make certain you can recover your losses. In the case of emergencies, you should always call 911 first.What is a claims examiner?Claims examiners are typically involved in health and life insurance, and review medical records to determine the proper payout for major medical procedures.What is an adjuster?A claims adjuster or claims examiner is an employee of an insurance company, and the person responsible for evaluating claims and determining if the company will reimburse the policyholder at the amount provided. An adjuster inspects claims related to property damage, as in the case of auto or home insurance policies.What is umbrella insurance?Umbrella insurance is extra coverage from liability for other insurance policies, usually home or auto insurance.

I recently made my first claim ever. I had some difficulty getting my documents through at first, but my broker intervened. I had no other issues and have certainly not experienced what others have reportedly gone through. Above all, my premium stayed competitive at renewal!!Also, I wanted to add that the claims person was discourteous until she realized that I was not calling from a personal injury firm.LIFE143 - Health , Life and Long Term Care InsuranceQuinlan T. ratedLife143 was fantastic! We had been trying for weeks to enroll outside of the open enrollment period, and were staring down the barrel of a huge fee for not finding a way to reinstate our policy...Tamir navigated an insane mountain of bureaucracy to find us an affordable plan, and was graceful and patient the whole way through. We didn't feel badly going with a budget plan either, which was hugely appreciated.Hugh Wood Incmichael.wrobleski.5 ratedGood people to work with.  Business was destroyed by an arsonist about 3 years ago and Hugh Wood was on the scene quickly. They were very professional in their handling of our claim.  We still are insured with them 3 years later.  Again, they took a bad situation and made it as good as we could have hoped!Axis InsuranceMeya N. ratedIn the end, we can never be certain or sure of the future. Risks are here to stay. Nevertheless, we have a great capacity to adapt as long as we know how to deal with all kinds of risks. Insurance seems to be a valid way of going about it. Risk only works if fraud is in background.State Farm: James B LavelleYadir Q. ratedA lovely and seamless experience.

Insurance has attained a certain level of sophistication and professionalism that is hard to discount, let alone compete with.Did You Know?Insurance BasicsTo mitigate the risk of loss, people purchase insurance policies from a company. When buying a policy, the person agrees to pay a premium, which is small, regular payment based on the losses that may occur. If the insurance provider determines there is a greater chance of risk as compared to the average policy, the premium is usually higher. Premiums are often paid monthly, and can add up over time up to be greater than the expense of replacing the insured item.Many types of insurance only cover a certain amount of risk on an item. The amount the policyholder must pay before an insurance policy begins covering an expense is called the deductible. In the event of damage or loss to whatever the policy covers, the policyholder is responsible for the deductible no matter what. If the cost of damage or loss is less than the deductible amount, the insurance company does not pay anything. If the cost is greater than the deductible, the policyholder only pays the deductible, while the insurance pays the rest. Generally, the deductible amount is related to your premium, with a higher deductible usually requiring a lower premium, and vice-versa.Insurance Agents
Selecting the right insurance involves careful research and evaluating many different options for coverage. This is why many people use an insurance agent to assist with making the right choice depending on their needs and financial situation. Agents often interview potential or current clients to get an idea of which insurance policies would benefit them the most. Based on their needs and individual risk, agents can often give potential customers a quote, which serves as a cost estimate for a specific policy. This is only a rough idea of what the policy will cost, because evaluating the risk associated with a given customer can take time. Insurance companies often compile an insurance score to quantify the risk an individual poses and calculate premiums accordingly. Credit scores play a major role in insurance scores, but past insurance-claim history is also taken into account.While agents often specialize in a particular category of insurance, some sell several different types of insurance. Agents can work for a larger insurance company or operate independently, selling policies from several different insurers.Insurance ProductsAlmost anything of value can be insured to protect against loss due to a variety of circumstances. Insurance policies are very specific in the items they protect and in what event the policy holders will be reimbursed. Some of the most common insurance policies cover things we all use.Automotive Insurance
Millions of Americans drive a car to get from place to place each day, so it makes sense that auto insurance is one of the most commonly used types. In most states, the law requires drivers to maintain an active insurance policy on any car, up to a certain amount. Most car owners are required at minimum to purchase liability insurance, which protects against damage for which the policyholder is at fault. Liability insurance covers damage to property as well as any injuries sustained in an accident. It's important to note liability insurance only covers damage or injuries of others, not the policyholder themselves. In addition to liability insurance, car owners can also purchase coverage for their own vehicle and medical expenses in the event of an accident. For this purpose, liability, vehicle and medical coverage are often packaged together in a single policy.Insurance can also be purchased for other vehicles, like motorcycles, ATVs, boats or RVs, and generally functions similarly to car insurance. Policies for alternative vehicles may have higher premiums if they are considered more dangerous, or might include other coverage options specific to the vehicle. Many companies that provide auto insurance will also offer coverage for motorcycles, ATVs, boats and RVs.Homeowners Insurance
Your home, condo or apartment is probably the most valuable thing you own or otherwise pay for, so it makes sense to get it insured. Homeowners insurance is important not just for the security of the house itself, but for its ability to cover possessions inside the home as well. Many mortgage lenders also require an active home insurance policy.Like auto insurance, homeowners insurance is typically bundled together with policies covering many different items or categories of items. The primary coverage type is for the dwelling, insuring the house itself and all structures attached to it. Policies may also cover property within the home, with premiums varying depending on the value of all assets. Personal liability may also be included for damage or injuries sustained on your property that you are responsible for, much like auto insurance.Property insurance also may cover certain major events outside of your control. These are known as perils, and may include fire, flooding, natural disasters and other catastrophic events. You may want to purchase insurance against one or more of these perils if you live in a high-risk area. Flood insurance is an exception, however, and can be purchased through the government-sponsored National Flood Insurance Program. Your lender may require this if you live in a flood-prone area.Health Insurance
To help pay for medical expenses, many people rely on their health insurance. With the passing of the Affordable Care Act, almost every American is required to enroll in a health care plan, or they face a penalty. Health insurance works similarly to other forms of insurance, although it is probably used to cover expenses more often, since car accidents and home damage are relatively rare compared to doctor visits and the need for medicine. Health insurance also operates on a premium-deductible model, and policyholders can choose what level of coverage works best for their lifestyle. For example, if you visit doctors very infrequently, you may consider a plan with a low premium and a higher deductible. On the other hand, people who require regular medical care may wish to pay a higher premium in exchange for more coverage from their deductible. Dental and vision care are sold as separate plans and are not required by law.Life Insurance
When someone dies unexpectedly or is injured severely enough to be unable to work, it can be a financial disaster for their family or loved ones. Many people choose to purchase a life insurance policy to support their family in the event their regular income is suddenly lost. Life insurance comes in two basic types: term and universal. With a term life insurance plan, you pay a premium for a predetermined amount of time, usually 10 years or more. If you die at any point in that timeframe, your family receives a death benefit. If you're still around when the term is over, the coverage is canceled and you receive nothing. Universal life covers your entire life, and usually delivers a minimum benefit at death.Travel insurance
Travel insurance is available for individuals who want to protect against unexpected setbacks in the course of travel, whether it's losing luggage or medical treatment abroad. Travel insurance may prove particularly useful for people who travel a lot for work or often visit remote locations. Travel insurance can take the form of either specific or blanket coverage. Specific coverage is useful for covering only certain risks, like medical emergencies or unexpected trip cancelation. Blanket coverage may cover some or all of your expenses for your entire trip.Pet insurance
Pet insurance is a relatively new product that may help cover the costs of medical care for a dog, cat or other domestic animal. Medical care for animals can be very costly, particularly because insurance for them is rare. By paying into a premium, you can help offset the cost of unexpected emergencies as well as routine checkups and medication. While virtually unheard of a few years ago, pet insurance has become more popular as the cost of veterinarian care has continued to rise.Umbrella insurance
Umbrella insurance is extra coverage from liability for other insurance policies, usually home or auto insurance. Consumers may choose to purchase an umbrella policy if their home or car is more expensive than a typical policy would be able to cover. For example, most car insurance liability policies cover at least $25,000 per person or $50,000 per accident. But if the accident involves a very valuable car, or the victim is willing to pursue legal action, insurance may not even begin to cover the full cost. You may want to hedge your risk by purchasing umbrella insurance to add extra protection to your existing policy.Insurance Claims BasicsTo receive a payout for an insurance policy, the policyholder must file a claim with the insurance company. The basics of the process are straightforward, but can vary depending on the type of insurance.Claims Adjusters and Examiners
A claims adjuster or claims examiner is an employee of an insurance company, and the person responsible for evaluating claims and determining if the company will reimburse the policyholder at the amount provided. An adjuster inspects claims related to property damage, as in the case of auto or home insurance policies. Claims examiners are typically involved in health and life insurance, and review medical records to determine the proper payout for major medical procedures.How To Make a Claim
Filing an insurance claim can be stressful and confusing, but you need to begin the process as soon as possible to make certain you can recover your losses. It's important to note that in the case of emergencies, you should always call 911 first. The safety and health of yourself and others takes precedent over insurance.Auto Insurance Claim: If you're involved in an accident, you need to call the police right away and have them document the situation. You can file a claim upon obtaining the police report. It's also a good idea, if possible, to take your own notes at the scene. The most important things to record are what happened before the accident, the date and time, traffic signs in the area and road conditions. Also be sure to get the other driver's name, address, license plate number and insurance information. Even photos taken with a cell phone camera can help the claims process. Once you have this documentation, call your insurance company right away.
Homeowners Insurance Claim: In the case of damage, take pictures of the affected area as soon as any safety or health emergencies are resolved. Take note of what happened and all the relevant circumstances and report to your insurer as soon as possible. If any of your possessions were damaged, use an inventory of your important assets and make note of this in the claim. Once an adjuster has made their own report, review it for accuracy.
Life Insurance Claim: Send your insurer a claim form for each beneficiary in the plan, as well as a certified copy of the policyholder's death certificate. With the proper information, life insurance claims are generally straightforward. Problems may arise if the policyholder has died within two years of opening the policy. In this case, an attorney may be needed to settle the claim.Finding Discounts on InsuranceInsurance is a wise investment, but it can make a dent in your monthly budget. Thankfully, there are a variety of ways to trim the fat off your premiums and make certain you are paying only as much as you need.Shop and Compare
Perhaps the best way to save on any insurance policy is to take the time to compare prices between as many companies and plans as possible. Even after you've chosen a plan and started paying into it, consider looking around again when it comes time to renew the policy. Consider using an independent agent when searching for a new insurance policy. While traditional agents can still find a good deal, independent agents can choose from a variety of providers and tailor your coverage to your specific needs. The Internet has also made comparison shopping easier than ever before. Potential customers can often get free quotes online very quickly.Buy Only What You Need
Insurance agents will often try to "upsell" on various extra products that may be useful for certain people, but are generally excessive for the average consumer. Stick with basic plans that cover as much as you need without any additional costs. For example, if the annual cost of your auto insurance is 10 percent or more of the total value of your car, drop all but the most essential coverage. This is especially applicable if the car you drive is older and could be replaced with savings. Otherwise, you are paying for insurance that will never actually benefit you in the event of a serious crash. It can help to create a budget and know exactly how much income you have to work with before making a decision on a new policy.Take Advantage of Discounts
Insurance providers offer a wide variety of discounts for all kinds of special customers or circumstances. In one of the most basic discounts, many companies will offer lower rates for customers who purchase home, auto and life insurance policies from the same provider. Car owners may get a rebate from taking a safe driving course. For those with teenagers on their plan, good grades can earn a small discount as well. Insuring multiple cars with the same provider may also lower premiums. Some providers will offer lower rates for military personnel, federal employees, teachers, first responders and their families.

Robert Murphy and his brother John established J & R Murphy, which made dental and surgical instruments, in 1850 in Boston, Massachusetts. Then in 1862 the brothers moved to Mansfield, Mass,. where they bought, at mortgage sale, a two-story building for $6,300. The sale also included a little shop, a two-story house, and all current water privileges on the Rumford River.
                     With this purchase they were able to expand their line, adding a great variety of fine cutlery, including oyster knives, shoe knives, paperhangers' knives, cigar knives, pruning shears, buttonhole cutters, tobacco shears, pinking irons, butter tryers, cheese tryers, can openers, cork screws, cigar box openers, and skates. They imported their steel from England and employed skilled craftsmen from there as well as from Germany, Europe's top two leaders in producing quality cutlery, to work with the local craftsmen in their shop.

John settled in Mansfield, but Robert returned to Boston in 1877 and carried on his cutlery business. Then in 1884, Robert bought the Oregon Mill in Harvard, Mass. and "began preparations for the manufacture of cutlery here." Around 1906, he and his sons, who were by all accounts working with him by then, moved the business to Ayer, the neighboring town, where it is still in business today. The 1908 catalog lists John R. Murphy and W. Edward Murphy, his sons, above the company name (presumably Robert had retired), which had been changed to Robert Murphy & Sons. 
By this time, and in their new location, John and Edward were again able to considerably expand their line of cutlery, adding rubber knives, lemon knives, chiropodists' lances, bandage knives, eel-spears, thread knives, furriers' knives, carpet knives, sloyd knives, feather curling knives, banana knives, shirt, collar and cuff blades, burnishing irons, and wood turners' parting and sizing tools.
                                         These products and many more, including the corkscrew that John Murphy, the son, had patented in April 1901, were sold through their own catalog as well as the catalog of Dame, Stoddard & Kendall. At that time, Dame, Stoddard & Kendall was a large importer (among the largest in America) and agent for many leading American manufacturers, including Murphy, and some of the best houses in Europe.  
"Robert Murphy's 'Celebrated' Steel Goods" or "Robert Murphy's Fine Corkscrews" headline each of the fifteen pages featuring Murphy products in their catalog. This firm, established in 1800 and located at 374 Washington Street in Boston, was considered "first in rank." They carried an unsurpassed stock of cutlery, fine and fancy hardware, fishing tackle, anglers' apparatus, leather goods, athletic goods, and kindred wares all under one roof -- selling to retailers and wholesalers throughout the whole country. Still in business today the well-known, highly regarded Stoddard's Cutlery recently relocated to Watertown St. in Newton, Mass. from the Chestnut Hill Mall where they had been since moving from downtown Boston.

In 1913, John and Edward incorporated the company under the name Robert Murphy's Sons Co. By 1925 they had again expanded their line to include, among other products, kitchen knives sold in sets of one dozen, which came in handsome display boxes picturing the woman of the house at the stove peeling potatoes. The handles of these knives were advertised as "waterproof rubberoid finish and securely riveted to the blades." At this time they coined their logo, STAY SHARP.
                     By 1934 they had trademarked the STAY SHARP logo with the diamond in the center and the name R. Murphy Knives: MADE SHARP and STAY SHARP. They had also added some new products, including carton and corrugated board knives, display cut-out knives, grapefruit knives, manual training knives, paring knives, oil cloth knives, pattern makers' handles, plaster knives, putty knives, roofing knives, stencil blades and handles, and wood block knives. At this point they were producing a line advertised as "TEMPERITE" Brand and also advertising kitchen and grapefruit knives in stainless steel.
                      
Murphy continued through the years in this fashion, successfully adding to their product line (butcher knives, filleting knives, and sportsman's knives, to name a few), advertising and selling their fine cutlery products on into the 1940s and '50s under the guidance of the Murphy sons, John and Edward. When John died, Edward ran the business and when he died, his wife tried to keep it going with the help of the foreman. However, after about six months she sold the business to Mr. William Maxant, in 1954, who kept the Murphy name, changing it to R. Murphy Company, Inc. William Maxant and his wife, Helen, enjoyed their successful knife business for fifteen years and then sold it to the Bethke family, owners of the Concord Oil Co. of Mass. in 1969. Ted Maxant, son of William and Helen, owns Maxant Industries, a manufacturer of bee keeping supplies and honey processing equipment. It is also located in Ayer.

 Douglas A. Bethke ran R. Murphy Knife for the family, in addition to racing cars on the Sports Car Club of America circuit. He and his Corvette emblazoned with "Murphy Knives" on the hood competed and won many races in the 1980s. In 1982 he raced and beat Paul Newman in Atlanta. In 2009 when Doug retired, he sold the business to it's current owners -- just the fourth owner for Murphy in it's 160 years -- Mark Furman and Mimi Younkins of Framingham, Mass.
 Mr. Furman, having owned and operated ManageWorks, a construction management and consulting firm, decided to apply his engineering and business background to a new pursuit. Murphy, with its long, rich local history and quality line of products made right here in Massachusetts appealed to them. They bought R. Murphy Co., Inc in May of 2009 and enthusiastically maintain the high standards of quality knife production set so long ago by John and Robert Murphy, trademarked by sons John and Edward Murphy, and carried on by the Maxant and Bethke families. MADE SHARP and STAY SHARP.
