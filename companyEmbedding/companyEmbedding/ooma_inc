We couldn’t possibly make it any clearer.Internet congestion is the enemy of voice quality. Hear for yourself how our competitor holds-up under 30% data loss. Then hear Ooma call quality under the same conditions. Ooma PureVoice™ HD technology delivers superior voice quality even under extreme conditions using a collection of advanced technologies only Ooma can provide.

Here’s how the magic happens:
Advanced Voice CompressionOoma uses an advanced voice compression algorithm that reduces bandwidth by 60% over standard VoIP technology. This leaves you with more bandwidth for all your other online activities.Wire-speed QoSAlthough Ooma uses a mere fraction of the bandwidth of standard VoIP technology, the bandwidth it does use must be an absolute priority. Ooma prioritizes voice packets without slowing down the rest of your network so you can enjoy crystal-clear calls even while uploading video clips.Encrypted callsOoma takes your privacy seriously. We use the same encryption technology governments use to protect classified data (which makes Ooma more secure than your old landline).Adaptive RedundancyPacket loss causes phone calls to sound stuttered or garbled with standard VoIP technology. Our sophisticated algorithms detect packet loss on your Internet connection before you even hear it and automatically deploy redundant packets to boost the clarity of your phone call.HD VoiceOoma HD Voice technology doubles the fidelity of your phone calls by capturing twice the speech information of a standard voice call (yes, that includes your landline.) When you and the other caller use an Ooma handset, or any HD compatible phone, your voice will sound more natural than ever.



Sophisticated technology meets elegant design.
The Ooma Telo is no dumb adapter. It’s actually a small, networked-managed, secure Linux computer packed with processing power to keep your calls clear and reliable.







1.  Ooma is a full router capable of prioritizing voice data and directing traffic to ensure the most reliable phone service. 
2.  A USB port supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth accessories and provides future expansion opportunities. 
3.  Built in speaker provides the ability to screen calls prior to answering. 
4.  A keypad provides one-touch access to voicemail. 
5.  DECT radio supports up to 4 wireless handsets and over 4000 sensors. 
6.  Built-in 900MHz dual-core processor provides the power for Ooma PureVoice™ including HD Voice and adaptive redundancy for a more natural sounding voice without stuttering or interruption. 
7.  1 GB NAND Flash with dual system image for the ultimate in reliability and upgradability to new services.

Ooma is an American publicly traded consumer telecommunications company based in Palo Alto, California. Ooma offers voice-over-IP (VOIP) calling using an Internet connection[1] to support a range of communications solutions for small business, home and mobile users.[2] In 2015, Ooma was named one of the fastest growing private companies by Silicon Valley Business Journal.[3]

History[edit]
Ooma was founded by Andrew Frame, who previously worked for Cisco Systems, in 2004.[4][5] Ooma's initial product was a "VoIP in a box" device which used peer-to-peer VoIP technology to let users make phone calls over other Ooma users' landline services.[6][7] The system works through a "hub" which connects to the main phone line as well as "scouts" which connect to additional phones.[8] In January 2008, Ooma terminated the use of peer-to-peer technology.[9]
PC Magazine awarded Ooma the DigitalLife Best of Show award in the hardware innovator category for the Ooma Hub in 2007.[10] Frame stepped down from his role as CEO in 2009 while hiring his replacement, Eric Stang.[11] That same year, Ooma released its Telo system, which consisted of a base system to access unlimited calling and caller ID.[12] In 2009, Ooma was awarded an Internet Telephony product of the year award for its development of Ooma Telo and the Ooma Telo handset.[13] That same year, Ooma was given the TMC Labs Innovation Award for the Ooma Hub and Ooma Scout.[14] Ooma received the gold consumer product of the year award as part of the Best in Biz Awards in 2011.[15]
In 2011, it was announced that Ooma's VoIP-In-A-Box was expanding to Canada.[16][17]
Ooma unveiled its HD2 handset in November 2012. The handset includes one-touch voicemail, an intercom, and baby monitoring features. Ooma also launched Ooma Linx in 2012 which used an AC outlet to connect any phone or fax machine to the Telo base station.[18] In December 2012, Ooma received the Internet Telephony Product of the Year award for its development of the Telo, HD2 handset and Linx.[19]
Ooma worked with West Valley City, Utah, in June 2014 to offer free telephone service to households through a fiber network.[20] In 2015, Ooma was named one of the fastest growing private companies by San Francisco Business Times and Silicon Valley Business Journal.[21] That same year, it was a gold winner of the Best of Biz Awards.[22]
Funding[edit]
The company's initial funding round raised $7.8 million in 2005. In 2006, Sean Parker invested in the company. Ooma held a Series B funding round in 2007 which raised $12 million. Investors included Worldview Technology Partners and Draper Fisher Jurvetson.[23] In September 2008, Ooma raised $16 million in its Series C funding round.[24]
Ooma raised a $18.3 million Series D funding round in June 2009. The round was led by Worldview Technology Partners.[11][25]
In January 2012, Ooma raised a funding round of $17.3 million from investors including Draper Fisher Jurvetson and Founder's Fund. The company had raised a total of $83.3 million at that time.[26]
Ooma held its IPO in July 2015. The company went public at $13 per share. Ooma raised $85 million from the 5 million shares offered.[1][5]
Operations[edit]
Ooma's service offerings are broken down into two business models: Ooma Telo for personal or home use and Ooma Office for businesses.
Ooma Telo[edit]
Ooma Telo was released on October 1, 2009. Telo is designed to provide unlimited, free VoIP calls within the United States and features Bluetooth integration, and HD voice. A cordless DECT 6.0 handset was also released.[27] Ooma allows customers with existing landline, cable- or DSL-based VoIP service, or mobile service to port their number to Ooma, provided their number is available and able to be ported.[28]
With the premier package, users get Multi-Ring, Do Not Disturb, and enhanced voicemail. Users will also receive Caller ID with Name, which was removed from the basic package following the release of the Ooma Telo. Ooma Premier offers access to Google Voice extensions for customers with Google Voice accounts (Ooma Telo only).[29]
Ooma Basic customers are charged monthly taxes and regulatory recovery fees (which vary by location), and get unlimited calling within the U.S., low-cost international calling, free Ooma-to-Ooma calling, basic voicemail, basic caller ID, call waiting, and E911 service.[30]
Ooma Office[edit]
Launched in 2013, Ooma Office consists of a cloud-based phone system including business applications such as conferencing, virtual fax extensions and extension dialing.[31] In August 2016, the mobile version of Ooma Office was released. The mobile version does not require the base station unit Ooma Office operates through. Features available through the mobile software include a virtual receptionist, call transferring, local and toll-free numbers, conference bridges, and extension dialing. In 2016, the Ooma Office Partner Program was released.[32][33]

History[edit]
Ooma was founded by Andrew Frame, who previously worked for Cisco Systems, in 2004.[4][5] Ooma's initial product was a "VoIP in a box" device which used peer-to-peer VoIP technology to let users make phone calls over other Ooma users' landline services.[6][7] The system works through a "hub" which connects to the main phone line as well as "scouts" which connect to additional phones.[8] In January 2008, Ooma terminated the use of peer-to-peer technology.[9]
PC Magazine awarded Ooma the DigitalLife Best of Show award in the hardware innovator category for the Ooma Hub in 2007.[10] Frame stepped down from his role as CEO in 2009 while hiring his replacement, Eric Stang.[11] That same year, Ooma released its Telo system, which consisted of a base system to access unlimited calling and caller ID.[12] In 2009, Ooma was awarded an Internet Telephony product of the year award for its development of Ooma Telo and the Ooma Telo handset.[13] That same year, Ooma was given the TMC Labs Innovation Award for the Ooma Hub and Ooma Scout.[14] Ooma received the gold consumer product of the year award as part of the Best in Biz Awards in 2011.[15]
In 2011, it was announced that Ooma's VoIP-In-A-Box was expanding to Canada.[16][17]
Ooma unveiled its HD2 handset in November 2012. The handset includes one-touch voicemail, an intercom, and baby monitoring features. Ooma also launched Ooma Linx in 2012 which used an AC outlet to connect any phone or fax machine to the Telo base station.[18] In December 2012, Ooma received the Internet Telephony Product of the Year award for its development of the Telo, HD2 handset and Linx.[19]
Ooma worked with West Valley City, Utah, in June 2014 to offer free telephone service to households through a fiber network.[20] In 2015, Ooma was named one of the fastest growing private companies by San Francisco Business Times and Silicon Valley Business Journal.[21] That same year, it was a gold winner of the Best of Biz Awards.[22]
Funding[edit]
The company's initial funding round raised $7.8 million in 2005. In 2006, Sean Parker invested in the company. Ooma held a Series B funding round in 2007 which raised $12 million. Investors included Worldview Technology Partners and Draper Fisher Jurvetson.[23] In September 2008, Ooma raised $16 million in its Series C funding round.[24]
Ooma raised a $18.3 million Series D funding round in June 2009. The round was led by Worldview Technology Partners.[11][25]
In January 2012, Ooma raised a funding round of $17.3 million from investors including Draper Fisher Jurvetson and Founder's Fund. The company had raised a total of $83.3 million at that time.[26]
Ooma held its IPO in July 2015. The company went public at $13 per share. Ooma raised $85 million from the 5 million shares offered.[1][5]
Operations[edit]
Ooma's service offerings are broken down into two business models: Ooma Telo for personal or home use and Ooma Office for businesses.
Ooma Telo[edit]
Ooma Telo was released on October 1, 2009. Telo is designed to provide unlimited, free VoIP calls within the United States and features Bluetooth integration, and HD voice. A cordless DECT 6.0 handset was also released.[27] Ooma allows customers with existing landline, cable- or DSL-based VoIP service, or mobile service to port their number to Ooma, provided their number is available and able to be ported.[28]
With the premier package, users get Multi-Ring, Do Not Disturb, and enhanced voicemail. Users will also receive Caller ID with Name, which was removed from the basic package following the release of the Ooma Telo. Ooma Premier offers access to Google Voice extensions for customers with Google Voice accounts (Ooma Telo only).[29]
Ooma Basic customers are charged monthly taxes and regulatory recovery fees (which vary by location), and get unlimited calling within the U.S., low-cost international calling, free Ooma-to-Ooma calling, basic voicemail, basic caller ID, call waiting, and E911 service.[30]
Ooma Office[edit]
Launched in 2013, Ooma Office consists of a cloud-based phone system including business applications such as conferencing, virtual fax extensions and extension dialing.[31] In August 2016, the mobile version of Ooma Office was released. The mobile version does not require the base station unit Ooma Office operates through. Features available through the mobile software include a virtual receptionist, call transferring, local and toll-free numbers, conference bridges, and extension dialing. In 2016, the Ooma Office Partner Program was released.[32][33]

The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Ooma Reports First Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Financial Results


May 23, 2017

Download this Press Release (PDF)



PALO ALTO, Calif., May 23, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Ooma, Inc. (NYSE: OOMA), a smart communications platform for small businesses and consumers, today released financial results for the first quarter ended April 30, 2017.    
First Quarter Fiscal 2018 Financial Highlights:

Revenue: Total revenue was $27.6 million, up 13% year-over-year. Subscription and services revenue increased 12% year-over-year to $24.1 million, driven by 63% growth of Ooma Office subscription and services revenue. Product and other revenue increased 17% year-over-year to $3.5 million, and was 13% of total revenue.
Net Loss: GAAP net loss was $3.4 million, or $0.19 per basic and diluted share, compared to GAAP net loss of $4.0 million, or $0.23 per basic and diluted share, in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Non-GAAP net loss was $0.3 million, or $0.02 per basic and diluted share, compared to non-GAAP net loss of $1.4 million, or $0.08 per basic and diluted share, in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
Adjusted EBITDA: Adjusted EBITDA was $0.1 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to ($1.1) million in the prior year period. 
For more information about non-GAAP net loss and Adjusted EBITDA, see the section below titled "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" and the reconciliation provided in this release.
"We are progressing well on our strategy to grow Ooma Office which delivered strong results and we continue to make significant advances on Office, including launching service for WeWork in France," said Eric Stang, chief executive officer of Ooma. "Our subscription services revenue for Office and Telo combined grew 20% in Q1 versus a year ago, however, we are disappointed that revenue from both Business Promoter and Talkatone declined in the quarter.  We are behind on some key residential initiatives for the year and are taking steps to improve our execution.  We believe our core business is fundamentally strong and we have a great opportunity ahead."
Recent Business Highlights:

Announced the expansion of Ooma Office into France as a provider of cloud-based phone service for WeWork.
Won PCMag's Business Choice Awards for Best VoIP Solution for an unprecedented fourth consecutive year.
Business Outlook: 
For the second quarter fiscal 2018, Ooma expects to report:

Total revenue between $27.6 million to $28.0 million.
GAAP net loss in the range of $3.8 million to $4.3 million, and non-GAAP net loss in the range of $0.5 million to $0.8 million.
GAAP net loss per share in the range of $0.21 to $0.23, and non-GAAP net loss per share in the range of $0.03 to $0.05 based on approximately 18.3 million basic and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. 
For the full fiscal year 2018, Ooma expects to report:

Total revenue in the range of $113.0 million to $116.0 million.
GAAP net loss in the range of $13.3 million to $14.8 million, and non-GAAP net loss in the range of $1.5 million to $2.5 million.
GAAP net loss per share in the range of $0.71 to $0.79, and non-GAAP net loss per share in the range of $0.08 to $0.13 based on approximately 18.8 million basic and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding.
The following is a reconciliation of GAAP net loss to non-GAAP net loss and GAAP basic and diluted earnings per share to non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per share guidance for the second fiscal quarter and the fiscal year ending January 31, 2018 (in millions, except per share data):

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
In addition to disclosing financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), this press release and the accompanying tables contain certain non-GAAP financial measures, including: non-GAAP net loss, non-GAAP net loss per share, non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin, non-GAAP operating loss, and Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA represents the net loss before interest and other income, depreciation and amortization and other non-GAAP expenses.
These non-GAAP financial measures exclude non-cash stock-based compensation expense and related taxes and amortization of intangibles.
These non-GAAP financial measures are presented to provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results and core business operations. Ooma considers these non-GAAP financial measures to be useful measures of the operating performance of the company, because they contain adjustments for unusual events or factors that do not directly affect what management considers to be Ooma's core operating performance, and are used by the company's management for that purpose.  Management also believes that these non-GAAP financial measures allow for a better evaluation of the company's performance by facilitating a meaningful comparison of the company's core operating results in a given period to those in prior and future periods. In addition, investors often use similar measures to evaluate the operating performance of a company. 
Non-GAAP financial measures are presented for supplemental informational purposes only to aid an understanding of the company's operating results. The non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies.  A limitation of the non-GAAP financial measures presented is that the adjustments relate to items that the company generally expects to continue to recognize. The adjustment of these items should not be construed as an inference that the adjusted gains or expenses are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring. Therefore, both GAAP financial measures of Ooma's financial performance and the respective non-GAAP measures should be considered together.  Please see the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure in the tables below.
Disclosure Information
Ooma uses the investor relations section on its website as means of complying with its disclosure obligations under Regulation FD. Accordingly, investors should monitor Ooma's investor relations website in addition to following Ooma's press releases, SEC filings, and public conference calls and webcasts.
Legal Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
This press release contains forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In particular, statements regarding future economic performance, finances, and expectations and objectives of management constitute forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical facts and generally contain words such as "believes," "expects," "may," "will," "should," "seeks," "approximately," "intends," "plans," "estimates," "anticipates," and other expressions that are predictions of or indicate future events and trends and that do not relate to historical matters. In particular, this press release includes forward looking statements regarding continued growth of our subscriber base, the strength and quality of our SaaS platform, our competitive advantage serving small business, home and mobile customers, and improvement in our financial performance.  Although the forward-looking statements contained in this press release are based upon information available at the time the statements are made and reflect management's good faith beliefs, forward-looking statements inherently involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from anticipated future results. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations include, among others:  our inability to attract new customers on a cost-effective basis; our inability to retain customers; intense competition; our reliance on retailers and reseller partnerships to sell our products; our reliance on vendors to manufacture the on-premise appliances and end-point devices we sell; our reliance on third parties for our network connectivity and co-location facilities; our reliance on third parties for some of our software development, quality assurance and operations; our reliance on third parties to provide the majority of our customer service and support representatives; our limited operating history; and interruptions to our service.  You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. We do not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements after they are made, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by applicable law.
The forward-looking statements contained in this press release are also subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those more fully described in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the risk factors contained in our Annual  Report Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2017, filed with the SEC on April 11, 2017. The forward-looking statements in this press release are based on information available to Ooma as of the date hereof, and Ooma disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law.

BBB Rating System Overview














Customer Review Rating:









                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        Ooma, Inc. has received 3.8 out of 5 stars based on 17 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.
