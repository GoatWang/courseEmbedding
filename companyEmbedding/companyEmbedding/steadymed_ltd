					Full Description



SteadyMed Ltd., incorporated on June 15, 2005, is a specialty pharmaceutical company. The Company is focused on the development and commercialization of various therapeutic product candidates to treat orphan and high-value diseases with unmet parenteral delivery needs. The Company's primary focus is to obtain approval in the United States for the sale of Trevyent for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The Company is also developing approximately two products for the treatment of post-surgical and acute pain in the home setting, which include bupivacaine PatchPump for local anesthesia post-surgery and ketorolac PatchPump for short-term management of moderately severe acute pain. Its product candidates are enabled by its PatchPump.The Company's Trevyent offers a way of administration of treprostinil for subcutaneous or intravenous treatment of PAH patients. Trevyent is a product that combines its preservative-free formulation of treprostinil with its PatchPump technology. PatchPump is a discreet, water-resistant and disposable drug administration technology that is aseptically pre-filled with sterile liquid drug at the site of manufacture and pre-programmed to deliver a steady flow of drug to a patient for approximately 50 hours. Trevyent provides patients with audible and visual feedback, which includes light emitting diodes (LEDs) and sounds that provide notifications on activation and when Trevyent is empty and needs replacement, as well as alerts in the event of occlusions or no delivery.The Company's ketorolac At Home Patient Analgesia (AHPA) product candidate is used for the short-term (approximately five days) management of moderately severe acute pain that requires analgesia at the opioid level in a post-surgical setting. Its ketorolac AHPA product candidate infuses ketorolac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), as an alternative to opioids in the home setting. Its bupivacaine AHPA product candidate provides patients with anesthesia local to the surgical site post-surgery in the ambulatory setting as an alternative to bupivacaine delivered by analgesia infusion pumps, such as the On-Q PainBuster, or other post-surgical pain products, such as Exparel. Its AHPA products come aseptically pre-filled in its PatchPump that is pre-programmed from the site of manufacture to deliver a steady rate infusion of drug to a patient over a pre-specified period of time. Its bupivacaine AHPA product candidate is aseptically pre-filled with sterile liquid drug at the site of manufacture, and is available for use in the operating room.

As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Full development of PatchPump® platform technology
SteadyMed Ltd 




Specialty pharmaceutical company SteadyMed Ltd came to Team to help take their PatchPump® wearable injector pre-filled with a therapeutic drug, from proof-of-principle to an approved drug product that is small, discreet, waterproof and easy to use.
Conceived as a platform technology, PatchPump® is designed to be highly customisable, and is intended to deliver volumes greater than 2mL over a period of minutes for bolus delivery or a number of days of continuous infusion depending on the needs of the particular therapy and disease state.
The first drug device combination product candidate, based on the company’s PatchPump® platform, is known as Trevyent® and is being developed to treat patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).
SteadyMed’s single-use Trevyent product is designed to accurately and continuously deliver a subcutaneous or intravenous infusion of the drug treprostinil 24 hours a day, every day, with each Trevyent unit lasting 48 hours.
 
Our approach
The project has required us to employ our broad skills in electronics, mechanical engineering, software, design and human factors in order to harness a novel technology and support SteadyMed through to submission of a new drug application (NDA) to the US FDA.
SteadyMed’s research team had developed a novel expanding battery, the ECell, which powers itself to drive a piston against a flexible drug container to administer liquid drug. SteadyMed wanted support and technical leadership from us to turn the technology into an approved, manufacturable product, according to tight timescales and rigorous regulatory standards.
As a company in the early stages of development, SteadyMed needed a partner who was flexible, cooperative, accommodating and used to working with young companies to meet tight timelines and strict budgets. It was also critically important to SteadyMed that their partner possessed expertise and a history of execution in the key disciplines of human factors, engineering and design.

Our first job was to look at the architecture and structure of SteadyMed’s proof-of-principle PatchPump® device. We proposed a number of refinements in terms of construction, sensor type and electronics architecture, and confirmed SteadyMed’s confidence in the technology and initial design.
We developed an uncomplicated aesthetic form for the device, reinforcing its strengths of comfort, discretion and ease of use.

As with many projects of this nature, we also managed a number of multi-national sub-contractors on SteadyMed’s behalf and worked with the client’s teams in Israel and California to evaluate and select the most appropriate manufacturing partners.
As well as full development, we also undertook formative usability testing in the UK and US to better understand the needs of PAH sufferers. From the outset, it was important to ensure that the pre-filled, pre-programmed Trevyent drug product was easy to use. We have made the process of drug administration from Trevyent very simple, offering patients just three steps to operate.
The project posed several difficult technical challenges, many of them related to meeting the tight requirements for delivery accuracy across a range of conditions – including vibration and drop, rapid temperature fluctuations and electromagnetic interference. With flow rates measuring a few μL per hour, accuracy and precision were of paramount importance but still had to be achieved with low cost components suitable for a disposable device.
















A sophisticated closed-loop control system was developed, providing robust and responsive delivery and rapid detection of infusion line occlusions. We have successfully addressed all of these challenges.
In parallel with the development of the device and working closely with the SteadyMed team, we also developed a series of test methods and test equipment, to enable fast and accurate evaluation of the PatchPump®’s performance.
 
Outcome
Development stage Trevyent units have now been manufactured and, working with SteadyMed, we will soon be undertaking stability studies and design verification testing ahead of submission of an NDA to the US FDA.
As well as Trevyent for PAH patients, we are developing a PatchPump® device based on the same ECell technology that includes integrated and automatic cannula insertion.

 
From our client
“We reviewed a number of proposals from top-tier product development consultancies for this project and concluded that Team had a unique combination of world-class expertise in design, human factors and engineering.”
“They also excel at the essential ‘softer’ skills, such as being supportive, accommodating and flexible. We had an ambitious vision with this project, and our decision to work with Team has resulted in a highly effective collaborative effort. We couldn’t be happier with the end result.”
