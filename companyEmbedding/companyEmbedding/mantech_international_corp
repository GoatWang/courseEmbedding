SynopsisWe’ve been developing, managing, and mastering technology for more than 4 decades.​​​​

Our Heritage


How We Work


Who We Support





 Our Heritage
ManTech was founded in 1968 to provide advanced technological services to the United States government. We began with a single contract with the U.S. Navy to develop war-gaming models for the submarine community. Over the years, our government's technology needs have increased dramatically in scope and sophistication, and we have grown to meet that challenge. 
For more than 4 decades, we kept a careful eye on where emerging technologies were taking the government, and we developed the resources to master those technologies—by staying close to our customers and anticipating their needs, hiring talented professionals to propel us into the future, and acquiring companies with proven capabilities.
Today, we are a multi-billion-dollar public company that provides the innovation, adaptability, and critical thinking our government needs for success in defense, intelligence, law enforcement, science, administration, health, and other fields—throughout the nation and in many countries throughout the world. We are now applying the lessons learned in the unforgiving arena of national security to help the private sector protect networks and critical information.



 How We Work
We are proud to help keep our nation safe and help our government provide critical services. We do so by adhering to the simple, no-nonsense values on which ManTech was founded more than four decades ago. ManTech has always been a customer-driven company, and our approximately 7,000 employees span the globe. We fully dedicate ourselves to our customers' missions and act as a trusted partner helping our customers stay ahead of technology, gain efficiencies, and cut costs.
ManTech carries out its work via two operating groups and a commercial business unit:

Our Mission Solutions & Services (MSS) Group provides ManTech's core business
support to the Departments of Defense and State, delivering global logistics, C4ISR,
test and evaluation, and information technology solutions worldwide.
Our Mission, Cyber & Intelligence Solutions (MCIS) Group tackles some of the
most challenging cyber security and intelligence problems facing our nation.
Our emerging ManTech Commercial Services business unit leverages its
relationship with global technology leader SAP, Hadoop, and others, along with
ManTech's core capabilities and industry expertise in supply chain, big data, and
security services for our commercial customers.




 Who We Support 
As a leading provider of technology services to the United States government, we support more than 50 different government agencies under 1,000 active contracts. Among the agencies we support:

Intelligence Community
Department of Defense
All branches of the Armed Forces
Department of State
Department of Homeland Security
Department of Energy
Department of Justice, including the FBI
Space Community
National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
Other U.S. federal government customers
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)
Department of Veterans Affairs

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
