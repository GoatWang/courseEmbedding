Get your purchases fast with our free two-day shipping programThere's so much convenience when it comes to online shopping. It's easy to find exactly what you're looking for all in one place when you shop with Walmart online. Plus, you can see all the items that you want to purchase and know immediately whether they're in stock or not. However, two issues that arise   that you don't deal with when you're shopping in store   is that you sometimes have to wait several days to get your purchases or pay a higher additional fee to get your purchases shipped faster. However, thanks to Walmart, you don t have to deal with either problem. We offer free two-day shipping on millions of the items that we sell, and it's all available to you without joining a membership club or paying extra fees for the privilege. Combine this with our low prices, every day, on everything, and you can get the things you want quickly at prices that fit your budget.How Walmart's free two-day shipping worksWhen you're looking at our website to find the types of items that you're interested in purchasing, the first step is to look for the logo that says 2-Day Shipping on the product page. Many of these items will also state Free store pickup or Free store pickup today below the free shipping information. If you see these words on the product page for your item, you have the additional option to pick the item up for free at your chosen Walmart location or receive it at your designated location for free as long as you spend $35 or more. If your purchase is less than $35, you can upgrade to free shipping for $5.99.On the left-hand side of all the pages on our website, you'll see a section that section labeled Shipping & Pickup. Beneath that, you'll find the option for 2-Day Shipping. Click the radio button next to 2-Day Shipping and the page will reload, displaying only items that are available for free two-day shipping. As long as you place your order by 2 p.m., you can expect delivery in two business days. This means that, if you order your item after 2 p.m. on a Friday, you won't receive it until the following Wednesday. However, if you order it on Tuesday before 2 p.m., you can expect to get it by the following Friday. Keep in mind that weekends and holidays don't count as business days for shipping. Also, be sure to note that the 2 p.m. cutoff time is relative to the time zone where we're shipping your item from, not the time zone from where you're ordering it.Other shipping optionsRemember that any item that's marked with 2-Day Shipping on its page is also eligible for free shipping on qualifying purchase amounts. Most of these items are also eligible for in-store pickup   many of them that same day   even if you order after 2 p.m. If you select an item that's not eligible for our free two-day shipping program, there are many others that are eligible for free three- to five-day shipping. Again, this free shipping is only for purchases of $35 or more. Items that are part of this shipping promotion include Marketplace and freight items, but shipping costs are based on location on a case-by case basis for these products.If you're ordering an item that we're not shipping to you   but one of our trusted partners is   it's possible that they might offer free shipping too. However, it might not be for a specific time frame. To verify, check the shipping information found on the product page, located below the item's price.What you should know about the free two-day shipping programHere's some additional information about Walmart's free two-day shipping program:Residents of Hawaii and Alaska aren't eligible for the free 2-Day Shipping program; it's only available in the contiguous United StatesRecipients who have their packages sent to these locations   AA, AE, AK, AP, AS, FM, GU, HI, MP, PK, PW and VI or any APO or FPO in the continental U.S.   will receive free three- to five-day shipping for their items on purchases of more than $35. There may be additional surcharges to ship to one of these areas, and this information will appear when you check out with your purchase.Show moreElectrode, Comp-147349575, DC-prod-dal2, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.15.0, SHA-06ca1a9068b558bd33bd1add57a0b13a52090f9f, CID-
