    See the review3.0 out of 5 starsGood, but needed a proof readerByJohn P. Callanon February 2, 2000Format: Hardcover|Verified PurchaseEncyclopedic Dictionary of Gears and Gearing is worth owning. It has many well-drawn illustrations, is organized to be accessable, and reads well. The authors do know what they're talking about.I have two problems with  the book - 1) some very basic gear terms, e.g. "hob" and  "hobbing" are undefined, although both terms are frequently used  thoughout the text, 2) some of the entries are out of alphabetical order  and therefore hard to find, e.g. "nongenerated gear".Aside  from these editorial problems, I learned a good deal quickly from this  reference book.0Comment|

Case Studies

High speed gearboxes designed to endure temperatures as low as -45 °C 
Working closely with the pump supplier to engineer a high speed gearing solution that could withstand temperatures as low as -45°C, David Brown Santasalo (then David Brown) delivered 26 high speed gearboxes for a major oil pipeline off the coast of East Siberia within an extremely tight schedule.

Inquiry formProduct DescriptionNEW Super Cased Muncie M22Z
4 Speed Transmission
2.98 1st gear Wide RatioThe M22Z gearset was designed around using a 3.08:1 differential rear gear. The M22Z can also be used with a 2.73:1 differential rear gear too. But, please keep in mind that the higher the differential gearing, the more torque stress is applied to the transmission gearset.
Please note: This 4 speed M22Z gearset is not recommended for repeated drag strip use!Driveline math for you to compare the NEW M22Z gearset.
M22 = 2,20:1 1st gear
M22Z = 2.98:1 1st gear
Using a baseline of an M22 with a 4.10:1 differential, the first gear take would feel the same if you had an M22Z and a 3.08:1 differential. 
So, you could have a M22Z with a 3.08:1 differential but, your vehicle would have the take off feel of a 4.10:1 differential. And a very user friendly highway final drive of a 3.08:1 differential, great for commuting.1st: 2.984:1
