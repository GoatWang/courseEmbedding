Boulevard Acquisition Corp. II: Heads We Win, Tails We Break-Even - Boulevard Acquisition II (NASDAQ:BLVDU) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Boulevard Acquisition Corp. II: Heads We Win, Tails We Break-EvenOct.13.15 | About: Boulevard Acquisition (BLVDU) Chameleon Trader Special situations, event-driven, long/short equity, micro-capOdd Lot InvestmentsSummaryOff-the-run special purpose acquisition company recently completed an IPO.If the venture succeeds, there could be meaningful upside.If it fails, investors will be returned their money.Background
On September 25th, Boulevard Acquisition Corp. II (NASDAQ:BLVDU) completed its initial public offering of 35 million units at $10 per unit. This is the second vintage special purpose acquisition company or "SPAC" launched by ~$14 billion hedge fund manager Avenue Capital, led by billionaire distressed specialist Marc Lasry. For those new to the space, SPACs are blank-check companies that raise capital through IPOs to acquire businesses.
The prior vintage SPAC, Boulevard Acquisition Corp. I, raised $225 million in an IPO in February 2014 and subsequently acquired Dow Chemical subsidiary AgroFresh, Inc. this past July. Now called AgroFresh Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:AGFS), the company provides technology to help enable growers and packers preserve their products' freshness. Boulevard Acquisition Corp. II is led by the same management team that oversaw Boulevard Acquisition Corp. I.
Free Option
SPAC IPOs are often popular among hedge funds since their structure effectively provides opportunities to collect a free option. In particular, SPACs have a specified period of time (typically two years) to complete an acquisition. If they find a compelling acquisition (that shareholders approve of), the stock price will jump. This was the case for Boulevard Acquisition Corp. I, which rose around 20% after announcing its purchase of AgroFresh, as shown below. The profit can be magnified since SPAC units typically include warrants to buy additional shares of stock.
Boulevard Acquisition Corp. I Stock Price, from Dec. '14 through June '15


On the other hand, if the manager is unable to find a compelling acquisition, the money is returned to investors, so original investors in the IPO still break even more or less. In most cases, SPAC IPOs are oversubscribed, and individual investors have little ability to participate in these types of opportunities. Boulevard Acquisition Corp. II is an exception.
Boulevard Acquisition Corp. II
Over the past few weeks since the IPO, Boulevard Acquisition Corp. II's units have continued to hover right around the IPO price of $10. Each unit consists of one share and one-half of a stock purchase warrant. A full warrant has an exercise price of $11.50. The units will split into separately traded shares and warrants 52 days after the offering. The warrants can be exercised at the later of 12 months from the IPO or 30 days after an acquisition. As is typical, the SPAC has a deadline of 24 months from its IPO to reach an agreement for an acquisition. Its mandate is quite flexible, but the prospectus notes that the SPAC's acquisition candidates...
"...may include companies that are undergoing some form of transition as a result of a restructuring, a change in their business model or their industry's basis of competition, or a material acquisition, divestiture, recapitalization or other transformative event."
This would play well to Avenue's expertise and network in the distressed space. Avenue Capital CEO Marc Lasry will serve as Boulevard Acquisition Corp. II's chairman, which I view as an incremental positive. In particular, although this is no assurance that he will spend a substantial portion of his time overseeing the SPAC, assuming the responsibility of this title does increase the likelihood that he will sufficiently vet the attractiveness of any deal that it moves forward with.
Redemption Provision
The SPAC's redemption provision is fairly typical. Per the prospectus, the company notes:
"We will provide our stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account is initially anticipated to be $10.00 per public share. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters."

The last line above is notable, as it specifies that underwriting expenses associated with the IPO will not be borne by shareholders that choose to redeem. Further, the prospectus goes on to clarify that underwriting expenses will not be borne by shareholders if the SPAC is unable to complete an acquisition by the prescribed deadline:
"The underwriters have agreed to waive their rights to their deferred underwriting commission held in the trust account in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering (or 30 months, as applicable) and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the funds held in the trust account that will be available to fund the redemption of our public shares."
Conclusion
With BLVDU trading right around the IPO price, investors now effectively have the ability to collect a free option. The opportunity likely exists due to recent market turbulence (which also had an impact on AgroFresh Solutions). The next catalyst for the mispricing to correct will be when the units split into separately traded shares and warrants in a few weeks.
Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in BLVDU over the next 72 hours.

(1) Includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business
    combination.

(2) In addition, a portion of the offering expenses will be paid from the
    proceeds of loans from our sponsor of up to $200,000 as described in this
    prospectus. These loans will be repaid upon completion of this offering out
    of the $850,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment
    of offering expenses other than underwriting commissions. In the event that
    offering expenses are less than set forth in this table, any such amounts 
    will be used for post-closing working capital expenses.

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 3.5%
    of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial
    business combination, up to $12,250,000, which constitutes the underwriters'
    deferred commissions (or up to $14,087,500 if the underwriters' 
    over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters
    from the funds held in the trust account, and the remaining funds will be 
    released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price
    of the business or businesses with which our initial business combination 
    occurs or for general corporate purposes, including payment of principal or
    interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business 
    combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or for working 
    capital. The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on 
    the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions.

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our business
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify a business combination target in a specific 
    industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses 
    associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal 
    counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may 
    engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due
    diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds,
    other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses,
    which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any
    specific category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses.

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our
    business combination to fund a "no shop" provision and commitment fees for
    financing.

Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement
warrants, $350,000,000 (or $402,500,000 if the underwriters' over-allotment
option is exercised in full), including up to $12,250,000 (or up to $14,087,500
if the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferred
underwriting commissions, will be placed in a U.S.-based trust account at J.P.
Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting
as trustee, and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a
maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions
under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct
U.S. government treasury obligations. We estimate that the interest earned on
the trust account will be approximately $35,000 per year, assuming an interest
rate of 0.01% per year. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held
in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our franchise and income
tax obligations, the proceeds from this offering will not be released from the
trust account until the earlier of (a) the completion of our initial business
combination or (b) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to
complete our business combination within 24 months from the closing of this
offering (or 27 months, as applicable), subject to applicable law. Based on
current interest rates, we do not expect that the interest earned on the trust
account, net of income taxes, will be sufficient to pay Delaware franchise
taxes.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay 
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business
combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using stock or debt
securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for
payment of the consideration in connection with our business combination, we may
apply the balance of the cash released from the trust account for general 
corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the
post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on 
indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund 
the purchase of other companies or for working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs 
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the 
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in 
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due 
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective 
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or their
affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

Commencing on the date of this prospectus, we have agreed to pay an affiliate of
our sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office space, utilities, 
secretarial support and administrative services. Upon completion of our initial
business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly 
fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to 
$200,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These loans
are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of December 31, 
2015 or the closing of this offering. The loan will be repaid upon the closing 
of this offering out of the $850,000 of offering proceeds that has been 
allocated to the payment of offering expenses.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an 
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,000,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination
entity at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants
would be identical to the private placement warrants. The terms of such loans by
our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written
agreements exist with respect to such loans.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do 
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their
affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either prior
to or following the completion of our initial business combination. However,
they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such
transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such
transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such
purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not
disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M
under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if
any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the
Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules 
under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any
such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will
comply with such rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the
SEC's "penny stock" rules) and the agreement for our business combination may
require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain
amount of cash. If too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights
so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or
cash requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares
or the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account 
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business 
combination, and then only in connection with those shares of our Class A common
stock that such stockholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the 
limitations described herein or (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we 
are unable to complete our business combination within 24 months following the 
closing of this offering (or 27 months from the closing of this offering if we 
have executed a letter of intent, agreement in principle or definitive agreement
for an initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this 
offering but have not completed the initial business combination within such 
24-month period), subject to applicable law and as further described herein and
any limitations (including but not limited to cash requirements) created by the
terms of the proposed business combination. In no other circumstances will a
public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust
account.

Our initial stockholders have entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant 
to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their
founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our 
initial business combination. In addition, our initial stockholders have agreed
to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with 
respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our business combination
within the prescribed time frame. However, if our sponsor or any of our 
officers, directors or affiliates acquires public shares in or after this
offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust
account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial
business combination within the prescribed time frame.


In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our business
combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a
business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies,
private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses
seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and
have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations
directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess
greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to
acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial
resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the
acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in
connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may
reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and
our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent,
may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these
factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating
an initial business combination.


Company Description
We are a newly organized blank check company incorporated as a Delaware
corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock
exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business
combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout


 this
prospectus as our initial business combination. We have not identified any
potential business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our
behalf, initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any
potential business combination target. We may pursue an acquisition opportunity
in any business industry or sector.

We intend to focus our search on businesses that may provide opportunities for 
risk-adjusted equity returns, where the potential returns are believed to be
appropriate for the risk that equity would be taking in the transaction. Our
efforts to identify a prospective target business will not be limited to a
particular industry or geographic region. In addition, it may include companies
that are undergoing some form of transition as a result of a restructuring, a
change in their business model or their industry's basis of competition, or a
material acquisition, divestiture, recapitalization or other transformative
event. We believe that the experience of our management, sponsor and its
affiliates in restructuring operating companies and our ability to provide
access to capital to a target business will permit us to pursue a broad range of
opportunities. Although we anticipate acquiring a target business that is an
operating business, we are not obligated to do so and may determine instead to
merge with or acquire a company with no operating history if the terms of the
transaction are determined by us to be favorable to our public stockholders and
the target business has a fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held
in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes
payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the agreement
to enter into the initial business combination. In such event, investors would
not have the benefit of basing the decision on whether to remain with our
company following such transaction on the past operations of such target
business. Furthermore, in such a situation, many of the acquisition criteria and
guidelines set forth in this prospectus may be rendered irrelevant. We can
provide no assurances that our investment team's expertise will guarantee a
successful initial business combination. In addition, our investment team is not
required to devote a significant or certain amount of time to our business on a
monthly basis and our investment team is currently devoting time to, and is
involved with, other businesses.

Boulevard Acquisition Corp. To Acquire AgroFresh Business From The Dow Chemical Company

NEW YORK, April 30, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Boulevard Acquisition Corp. (NASDAQ:   BLVD, BLVDU, BLVDW), an entity sponsored by an affiliate of Avenue Capital Group, announced today that it has entered into a definitive agreement with The Dow Chemical Company (NYSE:   DOW) under which Boulevard will acquire AgroFresh, Dow's post-harvest specialty chemical business, in a transaction that will result in AgroFresh becoming a publicly traded company with an anticipated initial enterprise value of $879 million, or 8.7x its estimated 2015 EBITDA.
AgroFresh is a global industry leader in providing innovative data-driven specialty chemical solutions aimed at enabling growers and packers of fresh produce to preserve  and enhance the freshness, quality and value of fresh produce and to maximize the percentage of produce supplied to the market relative to the amount of produce grown.  Its flagship product is the SmartFreshSM Quality System, a freshness protection technology proven to maintain firmness, texture and appearance of fruits during storage and transport. SmartFresh™ is currently commercialized in 45 countries worldwide.  
Marc Lasry, Chairman of Boulevard Acquisition Corp., said, "We are pleased to work with Dow and the AgroFresh management team to introduce the company to the public markets.  After reviewing a significant number of potential acquisitions, we believe that AgroFresh is well positioned to generate strong risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders.  It is the leading post-harvest specialty chemical business, with multiple paths for continued profitable growth ahead of it."
Upon completion of the transaction, AgroFresh will become a stand-alone public company listed on NASDAQ.  Dow will retain a non-consolidated minority ownership position in the company, and will be represented on the Board of AgroFresh.  It is intended that Thomas Macphee, currently vice president and corporate director for Dow, who had formally been responsible for AgroFresh in the company's early development, will be named Chief Executive Officer of AgroFresh upon completion of the transaction.   "I am excited by the opportunity to lead this impressive global specialty chemicals business," Mr. Macphee added.
Stephen Trevor, President and Chief Executive Officer of Boulevard Acquisition Corp., said, "AgroFresh is the leading agricultural solutions provider in a strong macro environment driven by global food demand growth.  We look forward to partnering with the AgroFresh team as it benefits from these dynamics and continues to execute its growth strategy."
Key Transaction Terms
Under the terms of the definitive agreements for the transaction, at closing, Boulevard will purchase AgroFresh in exchange for 18.4 million shares of Boulevard Common Stock and $626 million in cash, for a total of $810 million assuming a valuation of the Boulevard shares at $10 per share. 
Dow will initially hold approximately 40% of the shares of AgroFresh while the stockholders of Boulevard will initially hold approximately 60%.
The transaction has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of Boulevard and Dow, and is expected to close in the third quarter of 2015.  Closing is subject to approval by Boulevard's shareholders, the completion of customary regulatory filings, and other customary closing conditions. 
A full description of the transaction terms will be provided in the proxy statement that Boulevard intends to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") to be used at its special meeting of stockholders in lieu of an annual meeting to approve the proposed transaction with Dow.  Stockholders are advised to read, when available, Boulevard's preliminary proxy statement and definitive proxy statement in connection with the solicitation of proxies for the special meeting because these statements will contain important information.  The definitive proxy statement will be mailed to stockholders as of a record date to be established for voting on the proposed business combination. Stockholders will also be able to obtain a copy of the proxy statement, without charge, by directing a request to: Boulevard Acquisition Corp., 399 Park Avenue, 6th Floor, New York, NY 10022. The preliminary proxy statement and definitive proxy statement, once available, can also be obtained, without charge, at the SEC's internet site (http://www.sec.gov).
Investor Conference Call Scheduled
Boulevard will host an investor conference call to discuss the transaction on Thursday, April 30, 2015 at 11:00a.m. EDT.  Investors may listen to the conference call by dialing (855) 327-6837 toll free in the U.S. or (778) 327-3988 internationally.  The presentation slides and a replay of the call will be available at the following web address beginning April 30 at 12:00p.m. EDT until 12:00p.m. on May 7, 2015: https://viavid.webcasts.com/starthere.jsp?ei=1063040
