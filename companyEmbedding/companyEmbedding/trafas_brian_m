What are analysts saying about KLA-Tencor Corporation stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about KLA-Tencor Corporation stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "KLA is one of the leading suppliers of inspection and metrology products and services. The fiscal second-quarter earnings of the company were above the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, over the last one year, the stock has underperformed the Zacks characterized Semiconductor Equipment - Wafer Fabrication industry. KLA’s comprehensive product line, cost reduction initiatives and strong balance sheet remain positives that will generate growth whenever cyclical pressures permit. Though the competition and concentrated customer base increases execution risk, the increasing process control spending across foundry, memory and logic players through 2017 and beyond will enable KLA to deliver stronger results." (1/30/2017)
2. Instinet analysts commented, "olid Quarter and Guide. KLA reported DecQ revenue and EPS of $877mn and $1.52, above our estimates and the midpoint of guidance, and guided MarQ better than expectations. We maintain our Neutral rating and raise our target to $78. FY17E EPS from $5.63 to $5.60; FY18E EPS from $5.69 to $6.00." (1/27/2017)
3. Needham & Company LLC analysts commented, "KLAC reported a solid F2Q17 (Dec) and provided F3Q17 (Mar) guidance above the Street, as we had previewed. We believe the report confirms our stable growth thesis. With increasing yield-driven demand for process control at the leading edge, coupled with broader investments in C2017, we expect KLAC to avoid a C2H17 fall-off vs other peers. Strong memory bookings in the quarter highlights an increase to memory process control intensity, with further potential growth when KLAC launches a new 3D NAND offering. New product ramp-ups should enable KLAC to continue outperforming WFE beyond CY17. KLAC is still trading at a discount to its average historical P/E of ~16x, but with the improved margin profile, we expect the stock to march higher. Reiterate our Strong Buy and raise our PT to $105 (from $95)." (1/27/2017)
4. Cowen and Company analysts commented, "Record orders, rapidly growing memory exposure (even before new 3D NAND yield solutions in 2H:17), and a burgeoning foundry/logic cycle - solid all the way around. The Q has now become EPS power; given these WFE levels, ~$6.50 is possible in C2017 w/~$7.50 possible in '18. 15x (hardly heroic based on history) = $96 on C2017 w/upside from there if our model proves right. Target to $96, Outperform." (1/27/2017)

MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 2 Sell Ratings, 6 Hold Ratings, 6 Buy Ratings, 1 Strong Buy RatingConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.40)Consensus Price Target: $94.38 (0.03% downside)
