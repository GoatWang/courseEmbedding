Ethos Development




















































The Goodrich Building
The Goodrich Building is a rejuvenation of a mid-century modern retail building in the Roseway neighborhood of North East Portland. The building's namesake and architect, Burton Goodrich, was an understudy of Frank Lloyd Wright and oversaw his only project in the state of Oregon as well as many others around the country.Press: Hollywood Star Project Announcement October 2016Hollywood Star Goodrich Update March 2017










The Bridgetown
The Bridgetown is a planned 50-Unit eco-friendly apartment building in the Beaumont Village neighborhood of North East Portland. With more than 6,000 square feet of high-visibility interactive retail space, including a purpose-built restaurant space, the project will be a key-contributor to the urban fabric in an already vibrant neighborhood. An activated entry courtyard is shared between the retailers and the building's residents, creating a two way dialogue between the building and the neighborhood. With support from the Energy Trust of Oregon, the building has been designed as a low energy consumer.Developed by Ethos Development LLC and thoughtfully designed by Siteworks Design | Build, notable features include:An interior atrium starting on the 2nd floorLush interior and exterior green wallsCommon area power consumption will be offset by on-site solar panelsResidential units that feature operable windows on both sides, providing passive coolingA floating yoga room and roof deck are available to the building's residentsA vintage Coca-Cola mural on an adjacent building has been integrated into the designPanoramic views of Mt. St. Helens and Mt. Hood from top floor unitsAn on-site Zip-Car for use by the building's residents, retailers and the communityConstruction commencing May 2016 with delivery scheduled for June 2017Press: Hollywood Star Closing Article September 2015Hollywood Star Deconstruction Article Feb 2016Hollywood Star Groundbreaking Article May 2016Portland Business Journal Groundbreaking Article July 2016Renew OregonBlog Post June 2017










The Barley Pod
The Barley Pod is a planned food cart pod anchored by a tap room. It will serve the Rose City neighborhood and is one block East of Normandale Park. Press:Hollywood Star Baerlic Article June 2017










Ethos
Access to open space and our beautiful landscapes are often at odds with economic and population growth. Urban density is one part of the solution to preserving our natural environment; this connection is a key motivating factor for the work Ethos does. 










Hollywood Home
This 1910 craftsman foursquare was entirely gutted and modernized in 2013. Trish Grantham Design designed the interior with handprinted wallpaper and an eclectic mix of furnishings. Press:Portland Monthly August 2016 










Fernhill Crossing
Fernhill Crossing is a planned 19-unit apartment development in the Cully neighborhood of Northeast Portland, near Fernhill park. It features one exiting home, 8 two bedroom apartments, and 10 lofted two bedroom town homes. The units will be priced to provide housing for the missing middle - a demographic that earns too much to qualify for typical affordable housing and not quite enough for new market rate units. The grounds will have a zen-garden aesthetic, a children's play area, and on-site solar to offset common area electric use. Each unit will include an on-site parking space and several units will have gorge and mountain views. Delivery is anticipated in Summer 2019.










Margot
The property for the Margot, located on SE 29th and Division, was recently purchased from another developer who took the project through design and permitting. Ethos will be making substantive changes to the finishes and breaking ground on the 20-unit building in late summer 2017.

About Us



    We believe the traditional mortgage banking system is broken and we want to do things differently.
    We have designed our technology with you in mind, focusing on four key priorities: simplicity, transparency,
    efficiency, and an unbeatable price.
    

    Simply, we believe that the mortgage broker’s best days are ahead and we are committed to providing
    the technology, tools, and resources needed to empower our partners.  We are investing heavily in our
    platforms and processes to enable our mortgage brokers to better compete with banks and large retail lenders.
    

    It is no longer enough to claim superior service, technology, and/or price.  We will demonstrate consistent
    results, proactive communication, transparency, and a disciplined culture on each and every transaction.
    

    Our goal is to allow our partners to focus on what they do best: selling loans and advising
    consumers.  We will do the rest.
