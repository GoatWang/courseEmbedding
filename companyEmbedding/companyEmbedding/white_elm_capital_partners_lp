What is a Hedge Fund? A Closer Look at Hedge Funds.
There are plenty of investment vehicles that financially savvy individuals can think about investing in or tracking. The hedge fund is just one of those, but it is also the one that is worth looking at. There’s an air of mystery about this type of investment vehicle, but it is not always a tough nut to crack. What investors need to do is to educate themselves on what hedge funds are and to understand what risks they should expect to expose their investments to.
How Do Hedge Funds Work?
Hedge funds are considered as viable alternatives to the existing forms of investment on the financial markets. However, it is not open to every individual investor. Rather, the funds are more ideal for people and institutions that have significant amount of assets that they want to be managed and grown. Managers typically pool together the assets of their clients to create a unified fund, and then they make their trades and investments using that single fund.
It is theoretically similar to mutual funds, but they differ in the techniques. That’s the reason why it’s not open to individual investors. There are significant risks involved – aside from traditional investment vehicles like the popular mutual funds and stock market options as well as bonds, hedge fund managers lean more towards high risk but sophisticated trading techniques to realize significant profits for their clients’ portfolio.
Adding to the risk exposure is the fact that hedge funds are not as closely regulated as the other financial instruments. Hedge fund managers are not always required to make filings and reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, but that’s on a case to case basis. If the assets are large enough, the SEC will require reports. Hedge fund managers, however, are bound by law to protect their clients’ investments or face anti-fraud measures.
A Brief History of Hedge Funds
Hedge funds have a very long history. People and institutions began investing in this vehicle at the early 21st century. The funds never lost popularity over time. Before the recession hit, there was a total value of US$1.93 trillion being managed by hedge fund managers worldwide. The industry had a brief hiccup afterwards, because of the sub-prime mortgage crisis, but it eventually recovered. This is a testimony to how popular hedge funds really are, and how much investors are willing to trust their assets to managers.
Hedge fund assets totaled $2 trillion worldwide by April 2011, just three years after the crisis burst. By the third quarter of 2014, the worldwide value of assets under management or AUM is at $2.38 trillion and may continue to grow in the next years.
Hedge Fund Strategies
Hedge fund managers do not subscribe to a single strategy but, rather, they employ a combination of various strategies. It is not uncommon to find hedge fund managers putting some of the money in their management to purchase securities derivatives.
There are, however, some popular strategies that hedge fund managers acknowledge and use. Hedge fund managers will exercise any strategy and option within their discretion in response to several factors in the market.
Here are some of the strategies that hedge fund managers could use, either by itself or in tandem with other techniques in managing assets:

Global macro

This type of strategy relies on identifying macroeconomic events that take place around the world to make investment decisions. Managers generally look at the big picture globally to identify potential entry points for profitable investments. The Global Macro approach leverages multiple markets, and managers will employ long and short investment strategies to maximize profits from volatile market movements. This approach is very flexible, and very diversified as well because there are many variations of sub-strategy under this umbrella.

Directional

The directional strategy does not pay too much attention to what is happening to markets on a global basis. Instead, directional strategy dictates that fund managers look at each individual market movement when picking ideal investments. A typical action under this strategy is to invest in equities with an eye for the long term, and to couple that position with short-term buying and selling to hedge against risk.

Event-driven

Hedge fund managers following this philosophy are focused in following corporate events and leveraging their assets to earn from the market movement influenced by these occurrences. For instance, company consolidations and mergers can make possible upward movements in price. Event-driven hedge fund management will typically take positions before or after such events take place in order to leverage and earn profits from the price movements that occur. Even bankruptcy declarations can also spur action from event-driven hedge fund managers.

Relative value

Relative event hedge fund management focuses on finding price discrepancies and investing on those. This is the most technical of all the four management strategies discussed so far. Analysis is very comprehensive and somewhat holistic, as there are many types of analysis carried out under this strategy to identify the profitable price discrepancies.
How Do Hedge Fund Managers Approach Risk?
As mentioned above, hedge funds are not advisable for all types of investors because of the amount of risk involved in their operation. That is where risk mitigation comes in. In fact, managers operating in the hedge fund industry are described as being the most meticulous – they use the most stringent and the most precise means of protecting investments against the risks that the volatility of the market brings.
The most common method of reducing the risk exposure of managed assets is to diversify. The entirety of the funds used to set up the hedge funds are split between various investments, and varying investment positions. For instance, some of the funds may be put into long-term positions in low-risk, low-return funds that can steadily gain in the passage of time.
A portion of the funds may be invested in high-risk, high-return investment positions that the hedge fund manager may monitor in the short term, taking into consideration the risk factor and market environment.
In addition, hedge fund companies may employ risk officers. These are not people who are directly involved in trading, but have knowledge in how markets work. These risk officers will focus on identifying long and short-term risks to the assets under management, and will then work on creating a comprehensive risk management strategy that will be applied by the hedge fund managers for their managed assets.
Other techniques for managing risk in hedge funds include using risk management methodologies as well as operational due diligence.
Offshore and Onshore Hedge Funds
Because of their popularity and the global nature of their investment, hedge fund managers can be found all over the world. There are two types of hedge fund management companies, and they are the onshore and offshore hedge fund managers. Their differences lie mainly in the levying of tax on the investors’ earnings.
Offshore hedge fund managers give their investors the advantage of minimal tax consequences. For example, US-based investors who enjoy tax exemptions on their investments, particularly in retirement funds, will turn to offshore hedge funds. This helps them avoid being taxed for their income from the hedge funds.
On the other hand, if offshore hedge funds invest in instruments and securities in the United States, they can expect the US government to slap withholding taxes on their investments. However, there are no capital gains tax involved here – this is to make sure that offshore investors are not double-taxed for any increase on the value of their assets. Only their local jurisdiction has the legal right to levy any taxes on the investors for gains they see from their investments.
The presence of both onshore and offshore hedge management funds make the taxation more flexible and more personalized according to each investor’s personal expectations in taxation. In addition, it encourages global investment because of the measures imposed specifically to avoid the horrors of double-taxation – a common fear among investors who have eyes on diversifying globally.
Prominent Centers of Investment
The United States remains the center of global hedge fund management. 70% of the hedge fund managers that oversee the progress of global funds are based in the United States. The Securities and Exchange Commission has in its registry nearly 4,000 financial experts, as of April 2012, who handled management of hedge funds. These are found across the US, but most of them are based in New York City and Connecticut’s Gold Coast.
As for European hedge funds, London is the home of the managers with over 800 of them found in the city. In 2011, these firms were responsible for managing 85% of the hedge fund assets from continental Europe.
There is a growing market in Asia, particularly in Japan. Growing economic centers Hong Kong and Singapore are also experiencing a growth in hedge fund assets under management, but it will be some time before they achieve the demand in hedge fund managers enjoyed by the US and London in Europe. In fact, most of the hedge funds from Asia are managed by offshore companies based in these two centers.

Hedge Funds are not the only alternative way to invest in the investment universe. A different class of investment are Managed Futures.

 
Commodity trading advisors are these that provide managed futures accounts or funds and they have very different return profile and correlations than hedge funds. Managed Futures offer a good way to diversify hedge fund or other traditional investments and in some cases could also offer lower minimum investment requirements. Because hedge funds are usually stock picking and don’t provide crisis alpha, managed funds which do, are a good way to avoid painful market correction.

    offspring.
Iorio — who is unofficially called a Tiger Grandcub
    because he worked with Tiger Cub Stephen Mandel Jr. of
    Greenwich, Connecticut–based Lone Pine Capital for six
    years — posted gains of between 5 and 6 percent in the
    second quarter of 2013 in his main fund, White Elm Capital
    Partners, depending on the share class. This was nearly double
    the nearly 3 percent increase posted by the S&P 500. For
    the first half of the year, the hedge fund is up between 10 and
    11 percent compared with 13.8 percent for the S&P 500.
The strong gains come on the heels of a roughly 32 percent
    profit in 2012. Since its September 1, 2007, inception,
    Greenwich, Connecticut-based White Elm Capital Partners has
    risen between 48 and 51 percent compared with just 24 percent
    for the S&P 500.
Little surprise, then, that Iorio has been able to bring in
    new capital of late. According to his second-quarter letter,
    dated July 16, the firm manages a little more than $1 billion,
    more than double the total at the end of the third quarter of
    2012. The flagship fund itself now runs $551 million, compared
    with $269 million at the end of the third quarter.
Iorio and his team of analysts seek out stocks that could
    double over three years. He also prides himself on making money
    and generating strong outperformance on his short positions.
    "We focus on what we can analyze and avoid macro debates," he
    explained in the third-quarter report.
In addition, Iorio looks for sectors and themes where he can
    find clear winners and losers that he says create dispersion.
    Iorio and his team eschew cyclicality, negative free cash flow,
    and macro or policy-related debates. "Put simply, if we cannot
    answer the key questions with research, we are not investing,"
    he told clients in the report.
Like his mentor, Mandel, Iorio takes a global approach. At
    the end of the first quarter, only about $570 million was
    invested in U.S. stocks. "Our long investments in Europe and
    North America continued their solid performance," Iorio stated
    in his second-quarter letter.
One of his biggest winners was also a favorite of his
    mentor: cable operator Kabel Deutschland Holding, which
    recently received a takeout offer from Vodafone Group. It was
    also among Lone Pine’s best performers in the
    second quarter, according to investors. "We have owned Kabel
    since its initial public offering in March 2010, as we had
    identified the strong secular growth trends in the German cable
    market and Kabel’s underappreciated competitive
    advantage," Iorio stated in the letter.
Iorio also did very well with Liberty Global, another major
    European cable company. However, he stressed that his long
    positions in North American companies were the
    fund’s biggest source of alpha, outperforming the
    S&P 500 Index on an exposure-weighted basis by more than 4
    percentage points.
Among the stocks in North America, White Elm’s
    biggest contributors to its long performance were the mortgage
    servicers. "The structural shift of mortgage servicing from the
    banking system into specialty servicers is progressing," Iorio
    wrote. His favorites are Ocwen Financial Corp. and Altisource
    Portfolio Solutions.
Iorio’s biggest loser among his longs was Golar
    LNG, a London-based liquefied natural gas shipping company. He
    is sticking with it, however, asserting in the letter that "the
    long-term thesis is still intact, given Golar’s
    growing role in the global liquefied natural gas markets and
    the prospective upside from its expansion into floating LNG
    projects."
In general, White Elm’s shorts "marginally
    detracted" from performance, which is sort of a moral victory.
    Iorio explained that the environment for shorting "remains
    tricky" given the aggressive loose monetary policy among
    central banks.
He lamented the recent correction in many leveraged
    equities, such as operators of cell towers, which would be hurt
    by higher borrowing costs if interest rates continue to
    increase. Iorio, however, said the fundamentals of these
    businesses remain very strong. "Therefore, given current
    valuations, the prospective returns for these businesses more
    than compensate for the risk of higher financing costs," he
    added.
Iorio also told clients he is looking for new ideas in more
    dislocated markets, like Europe, that have lagged the U.S. and
    Japanese stock markets. "Europe has traditionally been a source
    of opportunity for White Elm as we have been able to invest in
    many high-quality businesses at compelling valuations," he
    wrote.
For example, he singled out U.K.-based Domino’s
    Pizza Group, which he said is one of the largest franchisers
    for Domino’s Pizza internationally. "Through great
    management, effective deployment of technology to drive
    consumer engagement and an innovative menu,
    Domino’s UK has executed well in a difficult
    consumer environment," Iorio added.
Entering the third quarter, White Elm’s five
    largest long positions (in alphabetical order) were: Altisource
    Portfolio Solutions, a Luxembourg-based provider of services to
    the real estate and mortgage portfolio management industry;
    Golar; Liberty Global; Ocwen Financial, which serves high-risk
    real estate loans; and SBA Communications Corp., which owns and
    operates wireless communications towers.
