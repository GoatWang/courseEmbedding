Heating Fuels



Keeping your family warm and comfortable
  From families to farmers, Mirabito recognizes that every customer has individual energy needs. That’s why we offer a wide range of products designed to meet our customers’ diverse energy usage and keep you comfortable all year long.  
Fuel Oil
  
A fraction obtained from petroleum distillation, either as a distillate or a residue. Broadly speaking, fuel oil is any liquid petroleum product that is burned in a furnace or boiler for the generation of heat or used in an engine for the generation of power.
  
Propane
  
Propane is a three-carbon alkane, normally a gas, but compressible to a transportable liquid. It is derived from other petroleum products during oil or natural gas processing. It is commonly used as a fuel for engines, oxy-gas torches, barbecues, portable stoves and residential central heating.
  
Bio Heat
  
Bio Heat combines renewable biodiesel made from soy, animal fats, or used oils and ultra low sulfur heating oil. The national Biodiesel board states that biodiesel reduces life cycle carbon emissions by an average of 80% percent compared to petroleum fuel oil.
  
Coal
  
Coal, a fossil fuel, is the largest source of energy for the generation of electricity worldwide. Coal is extracted from the ground by mining, either underground or in open pits.
  
Kerosene
  
Kerosene is used for both outdoor fuel tanks along with many portable heating pieces of equipment. A form of Kerosene is also used as jet fuel powering aircraft.
  
Wood Pellets
  
Wood pellets are compressed by-products from the forest products industry, often woodchips and sawdust. They are a locally available and a cost-effective heating fuel with several advantages over other types of biomass.
  
Automatic Delivery
  
Never worry about running out of fuel again.
  
Automatic delivery gives you worry free on-time delivery, guaranteed fuel supply, and a sense of security knowing Mirabito has your fuel supply cover. Never check your fuel tank again!
