8point3 Energy Partners
 
8point3 Energy Partners is a growth-oriented limited partnership formed by First Solar and SunPower to own, operate and acquire solar energy generation projects. Our primary objective is to generate predictable cash distributions that grow at a sustainable rate. We intend to achieve this objective by acquiring high-quality solar assets primarily developed by our Sponsors that generate long-term contracted cash flows and serve utility, C&I and residential customers in the United States and other select markets, primarily within countries that comprise the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

Better Buy: TerraForm Global Inc vs. 8point3 Energy Partners LP
In the battle of two yieldcos, there's only one clear winner right now.











                Travis Hoium
            

                (TMFFlushDraw)



            
            Feb 9, 2017 at 3:04PM
            
            





8point3 Energy Partners LP (NASDAQ:CAFD) and TerraForm Global Inc (NASDAQ:GLBL) were supposed to be two of the renewable energy industry's leading yieldcos. 8point3 Energy Partners was supposed to be a way for First Solar and SunPower to fund solar projects in the U.S. and TerraForm Global was central to SunEdison's growth plans abroad.
But since their launch, both yieldcos have been a disappointment for investors. 8point3 Energy Parters has plunged from a launch price of $21 per share to $13.50 as I'm writing and TerraForm Global has genuine concerns it will end up in bankruptcy. Given the current state of these companies, here's a look at which stock investors should throw out and which one they should take another look at.

Image source: Getty Images.

What's the point of a yieldco?
The point of a yieldco is to own renewable energy projects that spit off cash and pay that cash to investors in the form of a dividend. They intend to use their stock as a source of funding, along with debt, to buy projects and add to their dividends in the future.
This structure requires a relatively low dividend yield so that projects can be acquired accretively. If projects are bought with a rate of return of 8% and the company has a dividend yield of 10%, the shares issued to fund acquisitions wouldn't be additive to future dividends, they would be harmful. So, yieldcos with dividend yields over 7% have typically not been able to grow because they can't acquire products accretively.
This is the predicament 8point3 Energy Partners and TerraForm Global find themselves in. 8point3's dividend yield is a lofty 7.3% and management recently said it would only grow its dividend 12% in 2017, below the 15% growth the dividend has had since the yieldco launched. And TerraForm Global is in so much flux its dividend is suspended altogether. So, both companies have to be valued based on what they are today with little growth built in.
The worst case scenario for these yieldcos
If growth isn't likely, then we should look at the downside risk for both stocks. 8point3 Energy Partners currently has a dividend yield of 7.3% and 20.3 years of weighted average life retaining on asset contracts with offtakers. The worst that can happen, outside of the stock falling, is investors taking their dividend over the next two decades and getting no growth in the payout.
TerraForm Global is in much worse shape. It's still possible the company could be dragged into bankruptcy by SunEdison, although the likelihood of that now is small. Instead, a buyout is being discussed with Brookfield Asset Management, which could take the entire company private. But the highest offer that's been put on the table is $4.35 per share, below where shares are trading now. If TerraForm Global's range of possibilities are $0 to less than where shares trade now, with no dividend on the horizon, what is there to like about the stock?





The better yieldco today?
Given the sheer upheaval at TerraForm Global, 8point3 Energy Partners is definitely the better stock. It has a solid dividend and long contracts that will keep cash flowing in. And if the stock recovers and the dividend yield falls it could eventually be a growth stock, which would be good for the yieldco's future.

What to Take From 8point3 Energy Partners LP's Changing Growth Outlook
Management thinks growth may slow in the future, which wouldn't be entirely bad for long-term investors. 











                Travis Hoium
            

                (TMFFlushDraw)



            
            Jan 30, 2017 at 1:17PM
            
            





Outperforming both plans and expectations hasn't been enough for 8point3 Energy Partners LP (NASDAQ:CAFD) to impress investors. Fiscal fourth-quarter 2016 results announced Thursday after the market closed beat revenue, net income, and adjusted EBITDA guidance, and if it weren't for a slight delay in a $6 million reimbursement, the company would have beaten cash available for distribution (CAFD) guidance as well. 
The stock's relatively poor performance and dividend yield of 7.2% as of the time of this writing has left sponsors First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) and SunPower (NASDAQ:SPWR) looking for alternatives to selling projects to the yieldco. And if that lasts long enough, the yieldco's value to the sponsors could soon dissipate.

The numbers
Quarterly results were solid for 8point3 Energy Partners, as acquisitions added to the portfolio. Revenue was $14.5 million, net income was $4.2 million, EBITDA came in at $18.3 million, and CAFD was $20.4 million. The CAFD figure would have been around $26 million if it weren't for the delayed reimbursement from a utility partner. 
This performance continues 8point3 Energy Partners' streak of meeting or beating expectations as a public company, and it made big moves in acquiring a 49% stake in the SunPower-developed 102 MW Henrietta project and a 34% stake in the First Solar developed 300 MW Stateline project. But we may be entering a lull in project acquisitions that could lead to slower growth. 
Lowering expectations
One slight disappointment for investors was the announcement that 8point3 Energy Partners only plans to grow the dividend 12% in 2017. That's below the 15% dividend growth rate since the company was launched and is at the low end of guidance. 
The driver of the reduction in the dividend is the yieldco market overall. Low stock prices have led to higher dividend yields than companies expected, which make it difficult to issue shares to buy projects accretively. 8point3 Energy Partners' current 7% dividend yield isn't conducive to new share offerings to fund projects, and sponsors apparently think there are better buyer options elsewhere. 
There are two ways to take the dynamic of dividend growth and funding acquisitions. One is to be disappointed the dividend won't grow, but then you have to realize that a 7% dividend yield with contracted cash flows for 20 years is still a great value. The other reaction is to respect management's restraint in waiting for the ability to fund projects accretively instead of just trying to grow for growth's sake. Many yieldcos have erred on the side of growth, and it's usually come back to haunt them in the long run. 





Frustration setting in
Amid the solid performance in the quarter, sponsors SunPower and First Solar are getting frustrated with the yieldco's high dividend yield and inability to buy projects they want to sell. SunPower pulled the 20 MW IPT Solar Gen project and 54 MW of Stanford projects from the right of first offer (ROFO) portfolio and replaced them with the 100 MW Boulder Solar 1 project and 42 MW of commercial projects. SunPower also asked to have the 100 MW El Pelicano project removed, and First Solar would like to remove the 179 MW Switch Station. 
Taken as a whole, the sponsors are pulling projects from the ROFO portfolio that they want to monetize near term and replacing them with projects further down the line. That may not be a problem if the yieldco recovers in a year or two, but it shows their frustration with the inability to drop down assets at will. On the flip side, it may also mean they can sell projects more easily, and with a higher price on the open market than to 8point3 Energy Partners, which is good for the sponsors. 
What to take from 8point3 Energy Partners' results
8point3 Energy Partners may be slowing down its growth plans, and sponsors may have to adjust where they're selling projects. But that's not all bad for investors. 
At worst, 8point3 Energy Partners is a great dividend stock with an average 20 years of contracted cash flows on solar projects that essentially guarantee the dividend for years to come. And if the stock recovers in the future, it can go on a growth spurt again. 
Despite a slowdown in 8point3 Energy Partners' potential dividend growth, this is a stock I'll hold on to for a long time to come.
