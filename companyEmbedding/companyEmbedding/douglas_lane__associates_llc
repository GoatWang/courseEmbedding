What are analysts saying about AbbVie stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about AbbVie stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "AbbVie’s key drug Humira is performing well and should continue to be driven by growing awareness, favorable clinical data, new indications and expansion into new markets. Moreover, Imbruvica has multi-billion dollar potential and AbbVie is exploring the possibility of label expansion into solid tumors and autoimmune diseases. Investor focus will be on the stock with several late-stage data-readouts are expected in 2017. AbbVie’s shares outperformed the large-cap pharma industry so far this year. However, Viekira faces intense pricing and competitive pressure in the HCV market. Though Humira is doing well, the company is concerned about the product’s long-term prospects owing to the potential biosimilar competition. Estimates remained stable ahead of the company’s Q2 earnings release. AbbVie has had a mixed record of earnings surprises in the recent quarters. " (7/13/2017)
2. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "ABBV's IPR with CHRS will be heard this week, which looks challenging in light of the prior institution decision. However, the market already expects ABBV to lose and we do not see the '135 patent alone as critical to delaying biosimilars, indicating positive asymmetry in our view. We look at the key IPR arguments as well as the risk/ reward around the decision expected in May as we prepare to attend the hearing." (2/14/2017)
3. Argus analysts commented, "strong" second quarter earnings print.The analysts noted that not only were AbbVie's results driven by sales of Humira and Imbruvica, but its pipeline also "strengthened" following the acquisition of Stemcentrix and a partnership with Boehringer Ingelheim for the commercial rights of a new immunology drug that is in a late stage trial.The analysts also stated that the earnings print confirmed Imbruvica's "rapid acceptance" which bodes well for future sales.  Coupled with the Venclexta drug, AbbVie boasts two "powerful drugs" to treat first- and second-line CLL and other hematogical malignancies.Related Link: Investors Cheer AbbVie's Q2 Numbers, ForecastThe analysts also stated that AbbVie's stock is "attractively valued" at just 11.2x their 2017 earnings per share estimate, which is "well below" the average multiple of 14.5 of other companies under Argus' coverage.Finally, the analysts boosted their full-year 2016 adjusted earnings per share estimate to $4.84 from $4.80 and their 2017 earnings per share estimate to $5.95 from $5.90."The company has strengthened its product portfolio and pipeline through several deals over the past 12 months, and continues to post strong sales of Humira, aided by new indications," (8/8/2016)

Consensus Ratings for AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings.

Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 7 Hold Ratings, 5 Buy Ratings, 1 Strong Buy RatingConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.54)Consensus Price Target: $74.58 (3.98% upside)
