Our public offering of 750,000 is being made on a self-underwritten basis: no 
minimum number of shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed. 
The net proceeds to us from the sale of up to 750,000 shares offered at a 
public offering price of $1.00 per share will vary depending upon the total 
number of shares sold. Regardless of the number of shares sold, we expect to 
incur offering expenses estimated at $4,726 for legal, accounting, printing 
and other costs in connection with this offering. We will not receive any 
proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling shareholders. We will not 
maintain an escrow account for the receipt of proceeds from the sale of our 
shares. 

The following table sets forth the uses of proceeds from the primary offering 
would be used assuming the sale of 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%, respectively, of 
the securities offered for sale by the Company. There is no assurance that 
we will raise the full $750,000 as anticipated.

(1)Expenditures for the 12 months following the completion of this offering. 
   The expenditures are categorized by significant area of activity. 
 
(2)Our offering expenses are estimated to be $4,726, and we plan to pay the 
   balance of offering expenses from cash on hand. 
 
The above figures represent only estimated costs. All proceeds will be deposited
into our corporate bank account. Any funds that we raise from our offering of
750,000 shares will be deposited in a Company bank account in the United States
immediately available for our use and will not be returned to investors. We do
not have any arrangements to place the funds received from our offering of
$750,000 in an escrow, trust or similar account. Accordingly, if we file for
bankruptcy protection or a petition for involuntary bankruptcy is filed by
creditors against us, your funds will become part of the bankruptcy estate and
administered according to the bankruptcy laws. If a creditor sues us and obtains
a judgment against us, the creditor could garnish the bank account and take
possession of the subscriptions. As such, it is possible that a creditor could
attach your subscription. If that happens, you will lose your investment and
your funds will be used to pay creditors.

The priority of the use of proceeds from this offering are (1) legal and
accounting, (2) contract labor, (3) salaries and consulting, (4) R&D,
engineering and testing, (5) sales, marketing and travel, (6) materials
purchases, (7) general and administrative, (8) facilities and (9) retention.
 
The significant steps and milestones that will need to be complete in
implementing our business plan and the project timeline for achieving each step
is illustrated as follows:

Certainly competition exists in the market place for our product lines. The
difference in our thrust will be that our products are technology driven and
materially improved over earlier generation alternatives.

In the case of wind/solar lighting products, no domestic product has the
established tie-in to direct sources of rare-earth magnets and quality low cost
generators. The advanced blade design and high-tech material use will set the
company apart from lesser quality poor designs. The package of low cost
components / high-tech material and superior design is the bat to beat the
competition with.

Specifically for down-hole pump products, such as, sucker rods, tubing, and
fracking balls, we will have a strength, cost and survivability advantage over
steel and first generation composite products. The depths that pumping equipment
go to now almost preclude the use of steel (it does not have the strength to
support its weight at these super long lengths). Capturing market share based on
a superior product is the focus, but the capacity constraints of suppliers to
the pumpers will enhance our position to a quicker entry and a larger presence.


Company Description
FairWind Energy Inc. is a development stage company. We were incorporated under 
the laws of the state of Nevada on April 18, 2013. We are involved in the 
design, engineering and manufacturing of composite products. The initial thrust 
of our business will be to supply products to the oil and gas


 industry. These 
products will include upstream production products such as sucker rods, 
fracking plugs, casings and other products where high temperature resistance, 
chemical resistance and a low weight to strength ratio products offer 
advantages to traditional materials (e.g. , steel). If we are able to supply 
products to the oil and gas industry, then we plan to continue the development 
and sales of wind and solar hybrid energy systems. These systems also benefit 
from the use of higher performance materials (composites) and we will intend
to incorporate them in product design and development. 

Through its proprietary use of materials and manufacturing technique, FairWind
Energy is developing power sources drawing from renewable energy supply. We also
use our trade secrets and composite industry know-how to cross-market products
into the oil & gas extraction industry. Providing a reliable power source based
on renewable energies required us to address shortcomings of existing
technologies ranging from availability of supply (i.e., solar power at night) to
quality of componentry available (blades, stanchions, magnets). The
hybridization of power sources (solar and wind) and manufacturing with next
generation composite materials is our solution.

In a priority project, we are currently near developmental completion of a high
strength, high Tg (high temperature use) composite designed and intended to be
used in the oil & gas industry. Intended for use in the exploration and
production sector, we have manufactured nearly 5,000 feet of “sucker rod” used
to be use in connection with the extraction of oil and gas from underground. The
employed design uses proprietary resin systems that exceed typical temperature
use limits of competing thermosetting systems. Additionally, utilizing higher
tensile strength reinforcements, our parts can achieve higher operating loads,
allowing for superior performance. New designs for mechanical joints in the rod
string have also been completed. Significant testing has been completed on the
final design (and will be continuing). We believe that the testing marks we have
achieved to date are a result of the high performance materials and architecture
of the product.

Our intended business operations will be to make use of our proprietary resin
systems and unique composite architecture and apply that to other areas. With
proof of concept via physical and field trial testing in hand, we will proceed
to apply the proven benefits (see above) in other infrastructure projects. Two
examples that are currently in the examination stage, include pultruded power
poles suitable for supporting high voltage electrical transmission lines.
Another early stage endeavor is second generation composite strength members for
cable and conductor. As a replacement to more typical construction materials
(e.g., steel, aluminum, concrete and even lower performing FRP) – we believe
that our composite parts mix the benefits of strength, weight, corrosion
resistance, non-conductivity and high temperature operation.

Another project in current development is a hybrid power generating system,
incorporating both solar and wind power. Initially, we have purchased wind
turbines and are in the process of combining them with solar panels. The first
planned demonstration project will be to power street/parking lot lighting. The
potential to independently operate off battery stored power, or to back-feed
into the grid is possible. After vetting the POC prototypes, we intend to
combine already-established supply chain lines for componentry with in-house
manufactured composite elements (e.g., see power poles above). This hybrid power
project gives us some business diversity, as well as a secondary market for our
composite metrics.

Our public offering of 750,000 is being made on a self-underwritten basis: no 
minimum number of shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed. 
The net proceeds to us from the sale of up to 750,000 shares offered at a 
public offering price of $1.00 per share will vary depending upon the total 
number of shares sold. Regardless of the number of shares sold, we expect to 
incur offering expenses estimated at $4,726 for legal, accounting, printing 
and other costs in connection with this offering. We will not receive any 
proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling shareholders. We will not 
maintain an escrow account for the receipt of proceeds from the sale of our 
shares. 

The following table sets forth the uses of proceeds from the primary offering 
would be used assuming the sale of 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%, respectively, of 
the securities offered for sale by the Company. There is no assurance that 
we will raise the full $750,000 as anticipated.

(1)Expenditures for the 12 months following the completion of this offering. 
   The expenditures are categorized by significant area of activity. 
 
(2)Our offering expenses are estimated to be $4,726, and we plan to pay the 
   balance of offering expenses from cash on hand. 
 
The above figures represent only estimated costs. All proceeds will be deposited
into our corporate bank account. Any funds that we raise from our offering of
750,000 shares will be deposited in a Company bank account in the United States
immediately available for our use and will not be returned to investors. We do
not have any arrangements to place the funds received from our offering of
$750,000 in an escrow, trust or similar account. Accordingly, if we file for
bankruptcy protection or a petition for involuntary bankruptcy is filed by
creditors against us, your funds will become part of the bankruptcy estate and
administered according to the bankruptcy laws. If a creditor sues us and obtains
a judgment against us, the creditor could garnish the bank account and take
possession of the subscriptions. As such, it is possible that a creditor could
attach your subscription. If that happens, you will lose your investment and
your funds will be used to pay creditors.

The priority of the use of proceeds from this offering are (1) legal and
accounting, (2) contract labor, (3) salaries and consulting, (4) R&D,
engineering and testing, (5) sales, marketing and travel, (6) materials
purchases, (7) general and administrative, (8) facilities and (9) retention.
 
The significant steps and milestones that will need to be complete in
implementing our business plan and the project timeline for achieving each step
is illustrated as follows:

Certainly competition exists in the market place for our product lines. The
difference in our thrust will be that our products are technology driven and
materially improved over earlier generation alternatives.

In the case of wind/solar lighting products, no domestic product has the
established tie-in to direct sources of rare-earth magnets and quality low cost
generators. The advanced blade design and high-tech material use will set the
company apart from lesser quality poor designs. The package of low cost
components / high-tech material and superior design is the bat to beat the
competition with.

Specifically for down-hole pump products, such as, sucker rods, tubing, and
fracking balls, we will have a strength, cost and survivability advantage over
steel and first generation composite products. The depths that pumping equipment
go to now almost preclude the use of steel (it does not have the strength to
support its weight at these super long lengths). Capturing market share based on
a superior product is the focus, but the capacity constraints of suppliers to
the pumpers will enhance our position to a quicker entry and a larger presence.


Company Description
FairWind Energy Inc. is a development stage company. We were incorporated under 
the laws of the state of Nevada on April 18, 2013. We are involved in the 
design, engineering and manufacturing of composite products. The initial thrust 
of our business will be to supply products to the oil and gas


 industry. These 
products will include upstream production products such as sucker rods, 
fracking plugs, casings and other products where high temperature resistance, 
chemical resistance and a low weight to strength ratio products offer 
advantages to traditional materials (e.g. , steel). If we are able to supply 
products to the oil and gas industry, then we plan to continue the development 
and sales of wind and solar hybrid energy systems. These systems also benefit 
from the use of higher performance materials (composites) and we will intend
to incorporate them in product design and development. 

Through its proprietary use of materials and manufacturing technique, FairWind
Energy is developing power sources drawing from renewable energy supply. We also
use our trade secrets and composite industry know-how to cross-market products
into the oil & gas extraction industry. Providing a reliable power source based
on renewable energies required us to address shortcomings of existing
technologies ranging from availability of supply (i.e., solar power at night) to
quality of componentry available (blades, stanchions, magnets). The
hybridization of power sources (solar and wind) and manufacturing with next
generation composite materials is our solution.

In a priority project, we are currently near developmental completion of a high
strength, high Tg (high temperature use) composite designed and intended to be
used in the oil & gas industry. Intended for use in the exploration and
production sector, we have manufactured nearly 5,000 feet of “sucker rod” used
to be use in connection with the extraction of oil and gas from underground. The
employed design uses proprietary resin systems that exceed typical temperature
use limits of competing thermosetting systems. Additionally, utilizing higher
tensile strength reinforcements, our parts can achieve higher operating loads,
allowing for superior performance. New designs for mechanical joints in the rod
string have also been completed. Significant testing has been completed on the
final design (and will be continuing). We believe that the testing marks we have
achieved to date are a result of the high performance materials and architecture
of the product.

Our intended business operations will be to make use of our proprietary resin
systems and unique composite architecture and apply that to other areas. With
proof of concept via physical and field trial testing in hand, we will proceed
to apply the proven benefits (see above) in other infrastructure projects. Two
examples that are currently in the examination stage, include pultruded power
poles suitable for supporting high voltage electrical transmission lines.
Another early stage endeavor is second generation composite strength members for
cable and conductor. As a replacement to more typical construction materials
(e.g., steel, aluminum, concrete and even lower performing FRP) – we believe
that our composite parts mix the benefits of strength, weight, corrosion
resistance, non-conductivity and high temperature operation.

Another project in current development is a hybrid power generating system,
incorporating both solar and wind power. Initially, we have purchased wind
turbines and are in the process of combining them with solar panels. The first
planned demonstration project will be to power street/parking lot lighting. The
potential to independently operate off battery stored power, or to back-feed
into the grid is possible. After vetting the POC prototypes, we intend to
combine already-established supply chain lines for componentry with in-house
manufactured composite elements (e.g., see power poles above). This hybrid power
project gives us some business diversity, as well as a secondary market for our
composite metrics.
