The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Mr. DiPiero is the chief executive officer of FGI.
He cofounded FGI in 2000 with the goal of providing middle-market companies with various business loans and financial products and services to help them prosper on a global scale. In just fourteen years, FGI has grown to operate in over sixty countries, providing services through four key business units: FGI Finance, FGI Risk, FGI Capital, and FGI Equity. Mr. DiPiero is a leading advocate for social responsibility and has ensured that corporate citizenship is a core value at FGI.
Prior to cofounding FGI, Mr. DiPiero served as vice president of Delaware Terminal Company Inc., a division of Delphi Petroleum International, where he was responsible for the firm’s International Business Development Division.
Mr. DiPiero has been interviewed and quoted by numerous publications, including Business Week, US Banker, Reuters, trfnews, BCR Factorscan, Commercial Factor, ABF Journal, and The Secured Lender—to name a few. He currently sits on the boards of OneTwoSee Inc., Jack Robie Inc., and Jefferson Investments. Moreover, he is the founder of Boards for Kids, a nonprofit organization that helps children with limited financial means worldwide get in touch with the natural environment through surfing, ocean education, and hands-on participation in beach cleanups. The program’s goal is to engage kids so they understand that they can effect change and play active roles in caring for their communities and environment.
Mr. DiPiero was born and raised in Middletown, New Jersey, and currently resides in New York City. During the 1993–1994 season, he was a proud member of the Nebraska Huskers football team. He has a B.A. in communications from Monmouth University and an M.B.A. from Drexel University.
