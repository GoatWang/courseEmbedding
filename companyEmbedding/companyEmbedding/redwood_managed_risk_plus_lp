Douglas Hubbard 
                Hubbard Decision Research

Time: 00:35 sec


"Running Monte Carlos is the only way to analyze big uncertain decisions."




John Zhao 
                Suncor Energy 

Time: 02:36 min


"It's mandated [at Suncor] to do Monte Carlo simulation on all major projects' capital cost estimates."




Risk analysis is part of every decision we make. We are constantly faced with uncertainty, ambiguity, and variability. And even though we have unprecedented access to information, we can’t accurately predict the future. Monte Carlo simulation (also known as the Monte  Carlo Method) lets you see all the possible outcomes of your decisions and assess the impact of risk, allowing for better decision making under uncertainty.
What is Monte Carlo simulation?
    Monte Carlo simulation is a computerized mathematical technique that allows people to account for risk in quantitative analysis and decision making. The technique is used by professionals in such widely disparate fields as finance, project management, energy, manufacturing, engineering, research and development, insurance, oil & gas, transportation, and the environment.
 Monte Carlo simulation furnishes the decision-maker with a range of possible outcomes and the probabilities they will occur for any choice of action.. It shows the extreme possibilities—the outcomes of going for broke and for the most conservative decision—along with all possible consequences for middle-of-the-road decisions.
The technique was first  used by scientists working on the atom bomb; it was named for Monte Carlo, the  Monaco resort town renowned for its casinos. Since its introduction in World  War II, Monte Carlo simulation has been used  to model a variety of physical and conceptual systems. 
 How Monte Carlo simulation works
    Monte Carlo simulation performs risk analysis by  building models of possible results by substituting a range of values—a probability distribution—for any factor  that has inherent uncertainty. It then calculates results over and over, each  time using a different set of random values from the probability functions.  Depending upon the number of uncertainties and the ranges specified for them, a  Monte Carlo simulation could involve thousands or tens of thousands of  recalculations before it is complete. Monte Carlo simulation produces  distributions of possible outcome values.
    By using  probability distributions, variables can have different probabilities of  different outcomes occurring.   Probability distributions are a much more realistic way of describing  uncertainty in variables of a risk analysis.   Common probability distributions include:
Normal – Or “bell curve.”  The user simply defines the mean or expected  value and a standard deviation to describe the variation about the mean.  Values in the middle near the mean are most  likely to occur.  It is symmetric and  describes many natural phenomena such as people’s heights.  Examples of variables described by normal  distributions include inflation rates and energy prices.
Lognormal – Values are positively skewed, not  symmetric like a normal distribution.  It  is used to represent values that don’t go below zero but have unlimited  positive potential.  Examples of  variables described by lognormal distributions include real estate property  values, stock prices, and oil reserves. 
Uniform – All values have an equal chance of  occurring, and the user simply defines the minimum and maximum.  Examples of variables that could be uniformly  distributed include manufacturing costs or future sales revenues for a new  product.
Triangular – The user defines the minimum, most  likely, and maximum values.  Values  around the most likely are more likely to occur.  Variables that could be described by a  triangular distribution include past sales history per unit of time and  inventory levels.
PERT- The user defines the minimum, most  likely, and maximum values, just like the triangular distribution.  Values around the most likely are more likely  to occur.  However values between the  most likely and extremes are more likely to occur than the triangular; that is,  the extremes are not as emphasized.  An  example of the use of a PERT distribution is to describe the duration of a task  in a project management model.
Discrete – The user defines specific values  that may occur and the likelihood of each.   An example might be the results of a lawsuit: 20% chance of positive  verdict, 30% change of negative verdict, 40% chance of settlement, and 10%  chance of mistrial.
During a  Monte Carlo simulation, values are sampled at random from the input probability  distributions.  Each set of samples is  called an iteration, and the  resulting outcome from that sample is recorded.   Monte Carlo simulation does this hundreds or thousands of times, and the  result is a probability distribution of possible outcomes.  In this way, Monte Carlo simulation provides  a much more comprehensive view of what may happen.  It tells you not only what could happen, but  how likely it is to happen.
Monte Carlo  simulation provides a number of advantages over deterministic, or “single-point estimate” analysis:

Probabilistic Results. Results show not only what could  happen, but how likely each outcome is.
Graphical Results. Because of the data a Monte Carlo  simulation generates, it’s easy to create graphs of different outcomes and  their chances of occurrence.  This is important for communicating findings to other stakeholders.
Sensitivity Analysis. With just a few cases, deterministic  analysis makes it difficult to see which variables impact the outcome the  most.  In Monte Carlo simulation, it’s  easy to see which inputs had the biggest effect on bottom-line results.
Scenario Analysis: In deterministic models, it’s very  difficult to model different combinations of values for different inputs to see  the effects of truly different scenarios.   Using Monte Carlo simulation, analysts can see exactly which inputs had which values together when certain outcomes occurred.  This is invaluable for pursuing further analysis.
Correlation of Inputs. In Monte Carlo simulation, it’s possible to model interdependent relationships between input variables.   It’s important for accuracy to represent how, in reality, when some  factors goes up, others go up or down accordingly. 

An enhancement to Monte Carlo simulation is the use of Latin Hypercube sampling, which samples more accurately from the entire range of distribution functions. 


Palisade Monte Carlo simulation products
         The advent of spreadsheet  applications for personal computers provided an opportunity for professionals  to use Monte Carlo simulation in everyday  analysis work. Microsoft Excel is the dominant spreadsheet analysis tool and  Palisade’s @RISK  is the leading Monte Carlo simulation add-in for Excel. First  introduced for Lotus 1-2-3 for DOS in 1987, @RISK has a long-established  reputation for computational accuracy, modeling flexibility, and ease of use.  The introduction of Microsoft Project led to another logical application of  Monte Carlo simulation—analyzing the uncertainties and risks inherent to the  management of large projects. @RISK is also used for project management.
