NEW YORK, May 16, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- ARC Realty Finance Trust, Inc. ("ARC RFT") announced today that it closed on its first portfolio investment – a $6.5 million mezzanine loan originated as part of a $57.5 million total financing provided to the ownership of the W Minneapolis, a premier hotel located in the heart of downtown Minneapolis, Minnesota.  
(Logo:  http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20130516/NY16079LOGO )
The W Minneapolis is a 32-story, 229-room, full service luxury hotel.  It is one of Minneapolis' landmark buildings and is considered to be an iconic element of the Minneapolis skyline.  Also known as "The Foshay", the property was modeled after the Washington Monument when built in 1929 and was added to the National Registry of Historic Places in 1978 as an example of Art Deco architecture.  The Foshay was originally configured as office space until 2006 when current ownership acquired, extensively renovated and repositioned the property as the W Minneapolis.
Opened in 2008, the W Minneapolis is a four-star hotel and the top performing luxury hotel in the downtown Minneapolis market.  The W Minneapolis features award-winning dining options, including the nationally recognized Manny's Steakhouse.  The top floor of the property offers the only observation deck in Minneapolis providing 360-degree views of the city.
