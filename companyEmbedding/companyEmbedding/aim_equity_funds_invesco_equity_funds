2017 Investment Outlook


































The Long Cycle Continues





We expect the long post-crisis economic recovery to continue in 2017. As a base case, we think growth is poised to broaden out to more countries, with the global economy drawing on more sources of strength than at any point since 2010.
From an investment perspective, our base case view is broadly supportive for risk assets. We prefer equities over credit and credit over rates, but we expect low returns from these traditional exposures given 1) elevated valuations, 2) limited upside for corporate earnings from current levels and 3) limits to economic growth potential. Broadening exposure beyond conventional stocks and bonds, identifying opportunities in emerging markets and deploying more dynamic asset allocation strategies are some ways to adapt.
In some respects, our outlook represents an extension of the same long cycle we envisioned heading into 2016. The key difference for 2017 revolves around four emerging transitions. Populism is challenging globalism and creating new tail risks. Concerns about low growth are giving way to concerns about inflation. Years of focus on monetary policy are giving way to a close watch over fiscal policy. And concerns about new regulation are acceding to hopes for de-regulation.
Transition will be an evolving theme in 2017, and we will be re-visiting it in our publications throughout the year. In this Investment Outlook, we highlight specific signposts we will be watching, both to gauge the pace of transition and to test our base case view on the key investment questions.









Three Key Questions







Is it time to de-risk?
Is it time to de-risk?
No. We think de-risking would be premature, at
least from a purely return-generating standpoint. We
expect the macro environment to remain supportive
of risk assets during 2017 amid a slow-but-steady
expansion in developed markets and an acceleration
of growth in some emerging markets.

What’s driving the expansion?
What’s driving the expansion?
We believe this is a slow-growth recovery best
explained by cyclical economic drivers. We believe
the concerns about the developed world being mired
in a pattern of underinvestment and stalled growth—
so-called secular stagnation—are overdone.

Where do we see opportunities?
Where do we see opportunities?
In a low-return world, we look for sources of
return beyond conventional stock and bond market
approaches. We also think range-bound or volatile
markets create opportunities for more dynamic
investment strategies.

Transitions We’re Watching in 2017


















												Globalism to Populism
											



The biggest transition in the current environment is a shift away from globalism to a rising populist trend.















												Stagnation to Inflation
											



We expect concerns around potential secular stagnation to give way to a more inflationary paradigm in the US.















												Monetary to Fiscal Policy
											



The focus for stimulus is shifting toward fiscal spending, as central banks are stretching toward the limits of their easing ability.
















												Regulation to De-Regulation
											



We see the potential for greater regulatory divergence globally and the potential for competitive de-regulation.

Next Generation of ETF Investing

                Over the last two decades, investors have increasingly turned to Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) seeking to benefit from a defined strategy, diversified exposure to stocks, tax efficiency and low costs. Today, we combine the potential benefits of ETFs with the advanced strategies of Goldman Sachs Asset Managment (GSAM).
            









What Are the Potential Benefits of ETFs?





ETFs have grown in popularity due to the many benefits they offer: intraday trading ease, relative transparency and a likelihood of tax efficiency—all typically at lower total cost than most actively managed mutual funds.
 











The Four Ts

We note that ETFs are not riskless investments, so investors can lose money. Please see the ETF Risk Disclosures for additional risk considerations in the end disclosures. Ordinary brokerage commissions apply. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns.
Goldman Sachs does not provide legal, tax or accounting advice to its clients. All investors are strongly urged to consult with their legal, tax, or accounting advisors regarding any potential transactions or investments. There is no assurance that the tax status or treatment of a proposed transaction or investment will continue in the future. Tax treatment or status may be changed by law or government action in the future or on a retroactive basis.










Exponential Growth of the ETF Market





Developed in the early 1990s with lower cost, transparency and tax efficiency in mind, today there are ETFs representing both broad and narrow sectors of the market, and hundreds of ways to diversify. With $2 trillion in investor assets, it’s safe to say that ETFs are here to stay.

Next Generation of Equity Index Investing

                GSAM has developed a series of ETFs built on smart beta1 principles—a transparent, rules-based strategy that goes beyond stocks’ market capitalization, resulting in a more economically intuitive way to invest.

Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta™ ETFs















Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta™ ETFs

 / 






















Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta™ ETFs





These ETFs are designed to track an ActiveBeta® Index, a proprietary performance-seeking methodology from Goldman Sachs, which tilts towards stocks based on four well-established drivers of performance, often referred to as factors.








The Four Factors














The Advantages of Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta™ Investing









Opportunity to Outperform the Market




To construct the ActiveBeta® Index, GSAM employs a simple, transparent process that helps identify and emphasize stocks within the market-cap weighted universe, potentially providing greater returns.
 









A Diversified Approach




Individual factors can be cyclical in the short run, which may lead to timing and performance challenges. Combining four complementary smart beta factors equally can potentially result in a more consistent investment experience over time.
 









Lower Cost




Not only are ActiveBeta™ ETFs a fraction of the price of most smart beta ETFs, they are also among the most competitively priced products on the market.2

Next Generation Fixed Income Investing

                GSAM now offers the next generation, smart beta Access ETFs that seek better risk-adjusted returns to help meet the needs of today’s fixed income investor.
            









Access ETFs by Goldman Sachs





GSAM’s Access ETFs can help investors build efficient fixed income portfolios. Going a step further than traditional market-value weighted methodology, a smart beta approach selects bonds based on liquidity and customized fundamentals.














The Advantages of Goldman Sachs Fixed Income Investing









Smarter Access to Bond Markets




The index employs a simple, transparent process that helps identify an investible universe, then eliminates issuers with relative deteriorating fundamentals to offer exposure to existing sector or market beta.
 









Seeks Smoother Performance, Less Volatility




As bond investors look for income and diversification, a smart beta approach seeks liquidity while minimizing exposure to factors historically associated with volatility and underperformance.
 









Lower Cost




Access ETFs are among the most competitively priced ETFs on the market. They also offer transparency and can alleviate some of the challenges of buying bonds in the over-the-counter market.3

Access to Top Insights

                GSAM developed the Goldman Sachs Hedge Fund VIP Index, which tracks insights from some of the leading thinkers in the hedge fund universe. The Goldman Sachs Hedge Industry VIP ETF seeks to track this index and provides exposure to hedge fund managers’ most important long equity ideas.
            









Introducing the Goldman Sachs Hedge Industry VIP ETF (Ticker: GVIP)





The fund seeks to track the Goldman Sachs Hedge Fund VIP Index, which is constructed in accordance with a rules-based methodology derived from concepts previously developed by Goldman Sachs’ Global Investment Research division. The Index is designed to measure the performance of fundamentally-driven hedge fund managers' “Very-Important-Positions” — those positions that appear most frequently among their top 10 long equity holdings. The Goldman Sachs Hedge Industry VIP ETF (Ticker: GVIP) seeks to deliver these high-conviction ideas through the ease, transparency and liquidity of an ETF.









The Advantages of Investing in GVIP














The Fund is not a hedge fund and does not invest in hedge funds.
1. ETFs offer many benefits, including intraday trading, relative transparency and tax efficiency potential, all at typically lower expense ratios than most actively-managed mutual funds.

Access to the Treasury Market

                GSAM developed an ETF that provides access to Treasuries with a maturity of less than a year, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the US Government. Investors in the Goldman Sachs TreasuryAccess 0-1 Year ETF can gain easy access to Treasury markets while avoiding the operational and pricing complexities of US Treasury Auctions and over-the-counter market.
            









Introducing the Goldman Sachs TreasuryAccess 0-1 Year ETF (Ticker: GBIL)





The fund seeks to track the Citi US Treasury 0–1 Year Composite Select Index, which is designed to measure the performance of U.S. Treasury Obligations4 with a maximum remaining maturity of one year. The Goldman Sachs TreasuryAccess 0–1 Year ETF (Ticker: GBIL) provides access to the Treasury market through a lower cost, convenient and transparent ETF. The fund benefits from the experience of the GSAM Liquidity Solutions team, providing trade execution, price negotiation and security selection in the short-term Treasury market.









The Advantages of Investing in GBIL










Any guarantee on U.S Treasury Obligations applies only to the underlying securities of the Fund if held to maturity and not to the value of the Fund’s shares.
Individual shares may only be purchased and sold in secondary market transactions through brokers; shares trade at market prices rather than NAV; shares may trade at a price greater than or less than NAV; and investors may incur commission costs when buying or selling shares.
The Fund is not a money market fund and does not attempt to maintain a stable net asset value.

Important Disclosure

Unless otherwise stated, portfolio facts and statistics are shown for Class A shares; other classes may have different characteristics.

 †NAV: Unless you are eligible for a waiver, the public offering price you pay when you buy Class A shares of the Fund is the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the shares plus an initial sales charge. The initial sales charge varies depending upon the size of your purchase.  No sales charge is imposed where Class A or Class C shares are issued to you pursuant to the automatic investment of income dividends or capital gains distributions. It is the responsibility of the financial intermediary to ensure that the investor obtains the proper “breakpoint” discount. Class C, Class I and Class Y do not have an initial sales charge; however, Class C does charge a contingent deferred redemption charge.  See the 
                          
    prospectus for more information.
1Van Eck Associates Corporation (the “Adviser”) has agreed to waive fees and/or pay Fund expenses to the extent necessary to prevent the operating expenses of the Fund (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, interest expense, trading expenses, dividends and interest payments on securities sold short, taxes and extraordinary expenses) from exceeding 1.38% for Class A, 2.20% for Class C, 0.95% for Class I, and 1.13% for Class Y of the Fund’s average daily net assets per year until May 1, 2018. During such time, the expense limitation is expected to continue until the Board of Trustees acts to discontinue all or a portion of such expense limitation.
2The S&P North American Natural Resources Sector (SPGINRTR) Index (the "Index") provides investors with a benchmark that represents U.S. traded securities that are classified under the GICS® energy and materials sector excluding the chemicals industry; and steel sub-industry. The MSCI ACWI Commodity Producers Index captures the global opportunity set of commodity producers in the energy, metal and agricultural sectors. All indices are unmanaged and include the reinvestment of all dividends, but do not reflect the payment of transaction costs, advisory fees or expenses that are associated with an investment in the Fund. An index’s performance is not illustrative of the Fund’s performance. Indices are not securities in which investments can be made.
The views and opinions expressed are those of VanEck. Fund manager commentaries are general in nature and should not be construed as investment advice. Opinions are subject to change with market conditions. Any discussion of specific securities mentioned in the commentaries is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation to buy these securities. Fund holdings will vary.
You can lose money by investing in the Fund. Any investment in the Fund should be part of an overall investment program, not a complete program. The Fund is subject to risks associated with concentrating its investments in hard assets and the hard assets sector, including, precious metals and natural resources, and can be significantly affected by events relating to these industries, including international political and economic developments, inflation, and other factors. The Fund’s portfolio securities may experience substantial price fluctuations as a result of these factors, and may move independently of the trends of industrialized companies. The Fund’s investments in foreign securities involve risks related to adverse political and economic developments unique to a country or a region, currency fluctuations or controls, and the possibility of arbitrary action by foreign governments, including the takeover of property without adequate compensation or imposition of prohibitive taxation. The Fund is also subject to inflation risk, short-sales risk, market risk, non-diversification risk, leverage risk, credit risk and counterparty risk. Please see the 
        
    prospectus and      
    summary prospectus for information on these and other risk considerations.
Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal. An investor should consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the investment company carefully before investing. The prospectus and summary prospectus contain this and other information.  Please read them carefully before investing.

Morningstar details

Source: Morningstar Inc. Ratings are based on a risk-adjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Open-end mutual funds and exchange-traded funds are considered a single population for comparison purposes. Ratings are calculated for funds with at least a three year history. The overall rating is derived from a weighted average of three-, five- and 10-year rating metrics, as applicable, excluding sales charges and including fees and expenses. ©2017 Morningstar Inc. All rights reserved. The information contained herein is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers. It may not be copied or distributed and is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The top 10% of funds in a category receive five stars, the next 22.5% four stars, the next 35% three stars, the next 22.5% two stars and the bottom 10% one star. Ratings are subject to change monthly. Had fees not been waived and/or expenses reimbursed currently or in the past, the Morningstar rating would have been lower. Ratings for other share classes may differ due to different performance characteristics.

An all-seasons approach to investing
An active approach to navigating volatile markets








 About risk
			 


Changing Fixed Income Market Conditions Risk. The current historically low interest rate environment was created in part by the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) and certain foreign central banks keeping the federal funds and equivalent foreign rates at or near zero. There is a risk that interest rates will rise when the FRB and central banks raise these rates. This risk is heightened due to the completion of the FRB's quantitative easing program and the "tapering" of other similar foreign central bank actions. This eventual increase in the federal funds and equivalent foreign rates may expose fixed income markets to heightened volatility and reduced liquidity for certain fixed income investments, particularly those with longer maturities. In addition, decreases in fixed income dealer market-making capacity may also potentially lead to heightened volatility and reduced liquidity in the fixed income markets. As a result, the value of the Fund's investments and share price may decline. Changes in central bank policies could also result in higher than normal shareholder redemptions, which could potentially increase portfolio turnover and the Fund's transaction costs.
Convertible Securities Risk. The market values of convertible securities are affected by market interest rates, the risk of actual issuer default on interest or principal payments and the value of the underlying common stock into which the convertible security may be converted. Additionally, a convertible security is subject to the same types of market and issuer risks as apply to the underlying common stock. In addition, certain convertible securities are subject to involuntary conversions and may undergo principal write-downs upon the occurrence of certain triggering events, and, as a result, are subject to an increased risk of loss.
Debt Securities Risk. The prices of debt securities held by the Fund will be affected by changes in interest rates, the creditworthiness of the issuer and other factors. An increase in prevailing interest rates typically causes the value of existing debt securities to fall and often has a greater impact on longer-duration debt securities and higher quality debt securities. Falling interest rates will cause the Fund to reinvest the proceeds of debt securities that have been repaid by the issuer at lower interest rates. Falling interest rates may also reduce the Fund's distributable income because interest payments on floating rate debt instruments held by the Fund will decline. The Fund could lose money on investments in debt securities if the issuer or borrower fails to meet its obligations to make interest payments and/or to repay principal in a timely manner. Changes in an issuer's financial strength, the market's perception of such strength or in the credit rating of the issuer or the security may affect the value of debt securities. The Adviser's credit analysis may fail to anticipate such changes, which could result in buying a debt security at an inopportune time or failing to sell a debt security in advance of a price decline or other credit event.
Depositary Receipts Risk. Investing in depositary receipts involves the same risks as direct investments in foreign securities. In addition, the underlying issuers of certain depositary receipts are under no obligation to distribute shareholder communications or pass through any voting rights with respect to the deposited securities to the holders of such receipts. The Fund may therefore receive less timely information or have less control than if it invested directly in the foreign issuer.
Derivatives Risk. The value of a derivative instrument depends largely on (and is derived from) the value of an underlying security, currency, commodity, interest rate, index or other asset (each referred to as an underlying asset). In addition to risks relating to the underlying assets, the use of derivatives may include other, possibly greater, risks, including counterparty, leverage and liquidity risks. Counterparty risk is the risk that the counterparty to the derivative contract will default on its obligation to pay the Fund the amount owed or otherwise perform under the derivative contract. Derivatives create leverage risk because they do not require payment up front equal to the economic exposure created by owning the derivative. As a result, an adverse change in the value of the underlying asset could result in the Fund sustaining a loss that is substantially greater than the amount invested in the derivative, which may make the Fund's returns more volatile and increase the risk of loss. Derivative instruments may also be less liquid than more traditional investments and the Fund may be unable to sell or close out its derivative positions at a desirable time or price. This risk may be more acute under adverse market conditions, during which the Fund may be most in need of liquidating its derivative positions. Derivatives may also be harder to value, less tax efficient and subject to changing government regulation that could impact the Fund's ability to use certain derivatives or their cost. Also, derivatives used for hedging or to gain or limit exposure to a particular market segment may not provide the expected benefits, particularly during adverse market conditions.
Foreign Securities Risk. The Fund's foreign investments may be adversely affected by political and social instability, changes in economic or taxation policies, difficulty in enforcing obligations, decreased liquidity or increased volatility. Foreign investments also involve the risk of the possible seizure, nationalization or expropriation of the issuer or foreign deposits (in which the Fund could lose its entire investments in a certain market) and the possible adoption of foreign governmental restrictions such as exchange controls. Unless the Fund has hedged its foreign securities risk, foreign securities risk also involves the risk of negative foreign currency rate fluctuations, which may cause the value of securities denominated in such foreign currency (or other instruments through which the Fund has exposure to foreign currencies) to decline in value. Currency exchange rates may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time. Currency hedging strategies, if used, are not always successful.
Management Risk. The Fund is actively managed and depends heavily on the Adviser's judgment about markets, interest rates or the attractiveness, relative values, liquidity, or potential appreciation of particular investments made for the Fund's portfolio. The Fund could experience losses if these judgments prove to be incorrect. Additionally, legislative, regulatory, or tax developments may adversely affect management of the Fund and, therefore, the ability of the Fund to achieve its investment objective.
Market Risk. The market values of the Fund's investments, and therefore the value of the Fund's shares, will go up and down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. Market risk may affect a single issuer, industry or section of the economy, or it may affect the market as a whole. Individual stock prices tend to go up and down more dramatically than those of certain other types of investments, such as bonds. During a general downturn in the financial markets, multiple asset classes may decline in value. When markets perform well, there can be no assurance that specific investments held by the Fund will rise in value.
Preferred Securities Risk. Preferred securities are subject to issuer-specific and market risks applicable generally to equity securities. Preferred securities also may be subordinated to bonds or other debt instruments, subjecting them to a greater risk of non-payment, may be less liquid than many other securities, such as common stocks, and generally offer no voting rights with respect to the issuer.
REIT Risk/Real Estate Risk. Investments in real estate related instruments may be affected by economic, legal, cultural, environmental or technological factors that affect property values, rents or occupancies of real estate related to the Fund's holdings. Shares of real estate related companies, which tend to be small- and mid-cap companies, may be more volatile and less liquid.
Small- and Mid-Capitalization Risks. Small- and mid-capitalization companies tend to be more vulnerable to changing market conditions, may have little or no operating history or track record of success, and may have more limited product lines and markets, less experienced management and fewer financial resources than larger companies. These companies' securities may be more volatile and less liquid than those of more established companies, and their returns may vary, sometimes significantly, from the overall securities market.
Value Investing Style Risk. A value investing style subjects the Fund to the risk that the valuations never improve or that the returns on value equity securities are less than returns on other styles of investing or the overall stock market.

			Objective & Strategy
		

			
				The fund seeks long-term growth of capital by focusing on growth/value anomalies – companies with above-average growth prospects that are trading at below-average valuations. The fund may act as a conservative cornerstone within a diversified portfolio.

			
			
				
			
		


A Conservative Approach
A diversified strategy that seeks strong upside participation with stronger downside
protection over a full market cycle. The fund may serve as a conservative strategy
to mid caps in a diversified portfolio.1



Mid cap core and more
 
Diversification beyond style boxes
 
Attractive results


The investment team focuses on
companies with above-average growth
prospects that are managed by good
stewards of capital and are trading at
attractive valuations.
 
A conservative approach to mid caps in
an equity allocation can complement
more aggressive, higher-risk managers.
This approach goes beyond traditional
style boxes, providing diversification
across market cycles.
 
The management team seeks to provide
investors with solid upside participation
coupled with better downside
protection.
This strategy aims to add value with
less risk versus its benchmark index
over full market cycles.2




Footnote(s)

1 The securities of mid-sized companies may be more volatile than securities of large-sized companies.
2 Full market cycles are defined as market high to market high or market low to market low.

Ratings are based on a risk-adjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Open-end mutual funds and exchange-traded funds are considered a single population for comparison purposes. Ratings are calculated for funds with at least a three year history. The overall rating is derived from a weighted average of three-, five- and 10-year rating metrics, as applicable, excluding sales charges and including fees and expenses. ©2017 Morningstar Inc.

The top 10% of funds in a category receive five stars, the next 22.5% four stars, the next 35% three stars, the next 22.5% two stars and the bottom 10% one star. Ratings are subject to change monthly. Had fees not been waived and/or expenses reimbursed currently or in the past, the Morningstar rating would have been lower. Ratings for other share classes may differ due to different performance characteristics.

 About risk
			 


Cash/Cash Equivalents  Risk. In rising markets, holding cash or cash
equivalents will negatively affect the Fund’s performance relative to its
benchmark.

Derivatives  Risk. The value of a derivative instrument depends largely on
(and is derived from) the value of an underlying security, currency,
commodity, interest rate, index or other asset (each referred to as an
underlying asset). In addition to risks relating to the underlying assets, the
use of derivatives may include other, possibly greater, risks, including
counterparty, leverage and liquidity risks. Counterparty risk is the risk that the counterparty to the derivative contract will default on its obligation to pay
the Fund the amount owed or otherwise perform under the derivative
contract. Derivatives create leverage risk because they do not require
payment up front equal to the economic exposure created by owning the
derivative. As a result, an adverse change in the value of the underlying
asset could result in the Fund sustaining a loss that is substantially greater
than the amount invested in the derivative, which may make the Fund’s
returns more volatile and increase the risk of loss. Derivative instruments
may also be less liquid than more traditional investments and the Fund may
be unable to sell or close out its derivative positions at a desirable time or
price. This risk may be more acute under adverse market conditions, during
which the Fund may be most in need of liquidating its derivative positions. Derivatives may also be harder to value, less tax efficient and subject to
changing government regulation that could impact the Fund’s ability to use
certain derivatives or their cost. Also, derivatives used for hedging or to gain
or limit exposure to a particular market segment may not provide the
expected benefits, particularly during adverse market conditions.

Emerging Markets Securities  Risk. Emerging markets (also referred to
as developing markets) are generally subject to greater market volatility,
political, social and economic instability, uncertain trading markets and more
governmental limitations on foreign investment than more developed
markets. In addition, companies operating in emerging markets may be
subject to lower trading volume and greater price fluctuations than
companies in more developed markets. Securities law and the enforcement
of systems of taxation in many emerging market countries may change
quickly and unpredictably. In addition, investments in emerging markets
securities may also be subject to additional transaction costs, delays in
settlement procedures, and lack of timely information.

Foreign Securities  Risk. The Fund’s foreign investments may be
adversely affected by political and social instability, changes in economic or
taxation policies, difficulty in enforcing obligations, decreased liquidity or
increased volatility. Foreign investments also involve the risk of the possible
seizure, nationalization or expropriation of the issuer or foreign deposits (in
which the Fund could lose its entire investments in a certain market) and
the possible adoption of foreign governmental restrictions such as exchange
controls. Unless the Fund has hedged its foreign securities risk, foreign
securities risk also involves the risk of negative foreign currency rate
fluctuations, which may cause the value of securities denominated in such
foreign currency (or other instruments through which the Fund has exposure
to foreign currencies) to decline in value. Currency exchange rates may
fluctuate significantly over short periods of time. Currency hedging
strategies, if used, are not always successful.

Management  Risk. The Fund is actively managed and depends heavily
on the Adviser’s judgment about markets, interest rates or the
attractiveness, relative values, liquidity, or potential appreciation of particular
investments made for the Fund’s portfolio. The Fund could experience
losses if these judgments prove to be incorrect. Additionally, legislative,
regulatory, or tax developments may adversely affect management of the
Fund and, therefore, the ability of the Fund to achieve its investment
objective.

Market  Risk. The market values of the Fund’s investments, and
therefore the value of the Fund’s shares, will go up and down, sometimes
rapidly or unpredictably. Market risk may affect a single issuer, industry or
section of the economy, or it may affect the market as a whole. Individual
stock prices tend to go up and down more dramatically than those of certain
other types of investments, such as bonds. During a general downturn in the
financial markets, multiple asset classes may decline in value. When
markets perform well, there can be no assurance that specific investments
held by the Fund will rise in value.

Mid-Capitalization Companies  Risk. Mid-capitalization companies tend
to be more vulnerable to changing market conditions and may have more
limited product lines and markets, less experienced management and fewer
financial resources than larger companies. These companies’ securities may
be more volatile and less liquid than those of more established companies, and their returns may vary, sometimes significantly, from the overall
securities market.

The Morningstar Category is shown next to the Morningstar Style Box which identifies a fund's investment focus, based on the underlying securities in the fund.Morningstar CategoryWhile the investment objective stated in a fund's prospectus may or may not reflect how the fund actually invests, the Morningstar category is assigned based on the underlying securities in each portfolio. Morningstar categories help investors and investment professionals make meaningful comparisons between funds. The categories make it easier to build well-diversified portfolios, assess potential risk, and identify top-performing funds. We place funds in a given category based on their portfolio statistics and compositions over the past three years.

 Executive Remuneration




































Our equity investment philosophy is centered on generating capital appreciation for the investor. The primary emphasis is on providing the investor with a degree of capital appreciation, superior to that of the returns from the equity class as represented by a market index over the longer term. Our core investment premise is that the equity markets are not completely efficient. A well-organized and thorough research effort combined with a disciplined portfolio management approach will enable out performance of the market index over time.  A key pillar of our disciplined approach is to stay true to the mandate of the specific fund as specified in the offer document under all circumstances. This is key to generating superior performance over time even though there could be times when staying true to the mandate may result in short-term underperformance. Our investment philosophy is a matrix framework of Company, Industry, Economic and Technical analysis. The equity team will provide many of the inputs for this framework, but we will also use inputs from external sources as and when required. This open framework is combined with an environment that encourages regular and constant debate; which we believe leads to superior decision making.      Stock categorization system The objective of our stock categorization system is to enable us to identify stocks that are likely to be the best investments from within our universe. Each category of stock has a description of fundamental attributes that we expect the company to possess. The categorizations are as follows:     Stock 
            Category Descriptions 
            (eg.) Growth
            Prospects (eg.) Company Attribute

            competitive Profit leverage   *  P2P - Path to Profit, ROE - Return on Equity   Stocks that fit into one of these categories typically display superior return profiles, but more importantly this enables fund managers to focus on the attributes that drive stock price performance and keep a watch for red flags.     








 The philosophy for managing fixed income portfolios revolves around optimizing risk adjusted returns for the investor by investing in high quality credit assets, managing interest rate risk and minimizing liquidity risk.  Our fixed income investment philosophy is based on a top down research oriented model with focus on economic data analysis. We strive to generate optimized risk adjusted returns by providing for safety of capital, liquidity of funds and investment income for the investors. The portfolios are actively managed for both the interest rate risk, credit and  liquidity risk. The interest rate risk is managed across duration buckets and portfolio composition is managed through active asset allocation across credits and the liquidity risk through a well-diversified portfolio.  The investment team follows a disciplined research oriented investment process to meet fund-specific investment objectives on a long-term investment horizon. The fund manager strives for outperforming the benchmark by selecting
superior credits, based on the in-house analytical credit research and interest rate direction calls without compromising
on the liquidity risk.  The credit risk assessment constitutes an integral part of the investment process and is carried out across sectors covering manufacturing, finance and services. By applying the credit model, we determine and monitor the credit worthiness of an issuer and assess the credit exposure limit. Our internal credit rating acts as a powerful risk containment tool that allow the fund manager to narrow down select credits to match the credit strategies of individual funds.

                                    SEBI vide its circular reference no. SEBI/IMD/Cir No.18/198647/2010 dated March
                                    15, 2010 has stated that mutual fund should play an active role in ensuring better
                                    corporate governance of listed companies. The said circular stated that the AMCs
                                    should disclose their general policies and procedures for exercising the voting
                                    rights in respect of shares held by them.

                                    Subsequently, SEBI vide its circular ref. no. CIR/IMD/DF/05/2014 dated March 24,
                                    2014 and SEBI/HO/IMD/DF2/CIR/P/2016/68 dated August 10, 2016 have amended certain
                                    provisions of above mentioned circular specifying additional compliance / disclosure
                                    requirements with respect to exercise of voting rights by mutual funds.

                                    This policy is drafted in pursuance of SEBI circular dated March 15, 2010 read with
                                    March 24, 2014 and August 10, 2016 and provides general philosophy, broad guidelines
                                    and procedures for exercising voting rights.

                                    Invesco Asset Management (India) Limited (“IAMI”) is an Investment Manager to the
                                    scheme(s) of Invesco Mutual Fund (“the Fund”). As an investment manager, IAMI has
                                    fiduciary responsibility to act in the best interest of unit-holders of the Fund.
                                    This responsibility includes exercising voting rights attached to the securities
                                    of the companies in which the schemes of the Fund invest. It will be IAMI’s endeavor
                                    to participate in the voting process (i.e. exercise voting rights) based on the
                                    philosophy enunciated in this policy.


                                 











                                        Philosophy of Voting Policy

                                         




                             









                                    Good corporate governance ensures that a corporation is managed keeping in mind
                                    the long-term interest of shareholders. Promoting good corporate governance standards
                                    forms an integral part of corporate ownership responsibilities.
                                

                                    With this in the forefront, IAMI expects all corporations, in which it invests in,
                                    to comply with high corporate governance standards. Accordingly, as the decision
                                    to invest is generally an endorsement of sound management practices, IAMI may generally
                                    vote with the management of these corporations. However, when IAMI is of the view
                                    that the unit holders will be prejudiced by any such proposal, then it may vote
                                    against such proposal to protect the interest of unit holders. Also in case of resolutions
                                    moved by the shareholders of the company, IAMI will exercise its voting rights in
                                    the best interest of its unit holders. In certain circumstances, IAMI may also decide
                                    to refrain from voting where it has insufficient information or there is conflict
                                    of interest or it does not have a clear stance on the proposal under consideration.
                                

                                    IAMI, as an investment manager, will generally vote in accordance with the Voting
                                    Policy. However, it may deviate from the policy if there are particular facts and/or
                                    circumstances that warrant for such deviation to protect the interests of unit-holders
                                    of the Fund.
                                


                                 











                                        Conflict of Interest in Exercising Voting Rights

                                         




                             









                                    IAMI, under schemes, may invest in the securities of associate/group companies (to
                                    the extent permitted under SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996). Further, IAMI
                                    is an affiliate of a diverse financial services organization consisting of many
                                    affiliates. Moreover IAMI under schemes may invest in securities of companies which
                                    have invested in schemes of Invesco Mutual Fund. Such scenarios may lead to a situation
                                    creating conflict of interest.
                                

                                    In a situation where an investee company, an affiliate or associate/group company
                                    were to approach IAMI with regard to a particular voting decision then such matter
                                    will be referred to the Voting Committee.
                                

                                    IAMI will attempt to avoid conflict of interest and will exercise its voting rights
                                    in the best interest of the unit-holders. Voting decisions in such cases will be
                                    based on merits without any bias and the same parameters will be applied for taking
                                    voting decisions as are applied for other companies.

                                            interest of the unit-holders in particular.


                                    IAMI will exercise voting rights keeping in mind the need to improve economic value
                                    of the companies and importance of protecting the interests of unit holders of its
                                    schemes but subject to importance of the matter and cost/time implications. The
                                    analysts in equity team will make recommendations on key voting issues and same
                                    will be approved by the Head of Equity or in his absence by the Fund Manager. In
                                    case of conflicts or need for a clearer direction, the matter may be referred to
                                    the Voting Committee for its guidance.

                                    As a guiding principle, IAMI shall exercise voting rights solely in the interest
                                    of unit holders of the Fund. IAMI has constituted a Voting Committee (VC). The Committee

                                    to ensure that these guidelines and procedures are adhered to and also make changes
                                    in the Policy as may be required from time to time. The members of this Committee

                                        Steps (Procedure) in Exercising Voting Rights
                                    

                                         




                             










                                    The following points outline the key steps in exercising Voting rights:


Notification of company AGMs / EGMs and relevant voting items to Fund Management
                                            Team.
The IAMI shall endeavor to vote for all holdings of the Fund, aggregated for all
                                            its schemes, but subject to the importance of the matter and the cost/time implications.
                                            The voting will cover all equity holding across all schemes of Invesco Mutual Fund.
Custodian will send ballots and or other relevant papers (notice of meeting, proxy
                                            form, attendance slips etc.) to IAMI relating to AGM/EGM as soon as it receives.
The fund management team is authorized to decide on voting decisions but may refer
                                            decisions to the Voting Committee for its guidance/direction.
Based on internal discussion within the fund management team, a decision would be
                                            arrived at as to whether IAMI should vote on the proposed resolution. Routine matters
                                            and ordinary resolutions like adoption of financials (unless there are significant
                                            auditor qualifications), dividend declaration, general updating/corrective amendments
                                            to the Articles of Association would also be considered for voting purpose. However
                                            IAMI may on a case to case basis, not vote on such resolutions, if it deems fit
                                            to do so.
Proposed resolutions would be discussed within the fund management team and decision
                                            would be taken on whether to vote (“for”/”against”) or “abstain” from voting. IAMI
                                            may abstain from voting on proposals that do not have a readily determinable financial
                                            impact on shareholder value and/or matters for which disclosure is inadequate. For
                                            the remaining proposals, IAMI would vote either “for” or “against” based on overall
                                            merits and demerits of the proposed resolution. IAMI will generally support and
                                            vote “for” proposals which are likely to result in maximizing long-term investment
                                            returns for unit holders. IAMI would not support and will vote “against” proposals
                                            that appear to be detrimental to the company financials / interest of the minority
                                            shareholders or which would adversely impact shareholders’ value.
IAMI may exercise its voting rights by authorising its own executives/authorized
                                            representative to attend the AGM/EGM or may instruct the Custodian to exercise voting
                                            rights in accordance with the instructions of IAMI.
IAMI may exercise its voting rights through Postal Ballot or may use Electronic
                                            voting mechanism, wherever available, either through its own executives or by authorizing
                                            the Custodian. The records of voting exercised through Postal Ballot will be maintained
                                            by IAMI.
IAMI may utilize the services of third party professional agencies for getting in-depth
                                            analyses of proposals and vote recommendations. However, the recommendations of
                                            the third party agencies will be non-binding in nature. IAMI will perform due diligence
                                            on proxy voting advisory firms at the time of initial selection as well as at the
                                            time of renewal of services of the proxy voting. The due diligence will be carried
                                            out on parameters viz. resource strength, Companies under coverage, extent of institutional
                                            ownership, depth of analysis, quality of advice / recommendations, analyst access
                                            & support, timely availability of reports, composition of board of directors, advisory
                                            board and top management, web-based interface platform and clientele. 
The rationale supporting each voting decision (For, Against and Abstain) will be
                                            recorded and such records will be retained for number of years (currently 8 years)
                                            as may be required under the SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996 from time to
                                            time.

Notification of company AGMs / EGMs and relevant voting items to Fund Management
                                            Team.
The IAMI shall endeavor to vote for all holdings of the Fund, aggregated for all
                                            its schemes, but subject to the importance of the matter and the cost/time implications.
                                            The voting will cover all equity holding across all schemes of Invesco Mutual Fund.
Custodian will send ballots and or other relevant papers (notice of meeting, proxy
                                            form, attendance slips etc.) to IAMI relating to AGM/EGM as soon as it receives.
The fund management team is authorized to decide on voting decisions but may refer
                                            decisions to the voting committee for its guidance/direction.
Based on internal discussion within the fund management team, a decision would be
                                            arrived at as to whether IAMI should attend the meeting and/or vote on the proposed
                                            resolution. IAMI would not vote for resolutions/matters pertaining to its equity
                                            holdings in quant based funds (arbitrage and Agile). Moreover routine matters and
                                            ordinary resolutions like adoption of financials (unless there are significant auditor
                                            qualifications), dividend declaration, general updating/corrective amendments to
                                            the Articles of Association would be ignored for voting purpose. However IAMI may
                                            on a case to case basis, vote on such resolutions, if it deems fit to do so.
Proposed resolutions which screen through the above criteria would be discussed
                                            within the fund management team and decision would be taken on whether to vote (“for“/“against“)
                                            or “abstain“ from voting. IAMI may abstain from voting on proposals
                                            that do not have a readily determinable financial impact on shareholder value and/or
                                            matters for which disclosure is inadequate. For the remaining proposals, IAMI would
                                            vote either “for“ or “against“ based on overall merits and
                                            demerits of the proposed resolution. IAMI will generally support and vote “for“
                                            proposals which are likely to result in maximizing long-term investment returns
                                            for unit holders. IAMI would not support and vote “against“ proposals
                                            that appear to be detrimental to the company financials / interest of the minority
                                            shareholders, which would adversely impact shareholders value.
IAMI may authorize either its own executives/authorized representative to attend
                                            the AGM/EGM to exercise the voting rights or may instruct the Custodian to exercise
                                            voting rights in accordance with the instructions of IAMI. Proof of such authorization
                                            will be maintained by the Deutsche Bank.
Record of matters on which voting rights were exercised will be maintained by Deutsche
                                            Bank and will be subject to internal audit.
Requisite disclosure will be placed before the Board of Religare Invesco AMC and
                                            Religare Invesco Trustee Company on a quarterly basis or such other frequency as
                                            the VC may consider appropriate.
Report on actual exercise of voting rights will be placed on the website of the
                                            Fund (www.invescomutualfund.com)
                                            and also in the annual report sent to the unit holders on an annual basis.

2017 Investment Outlook


































The Long Cycle Continues





We expect the long post-crisis economic recovery to continue in 2017. As a base case, we think growth is poised to broaden out to more countries, with the global economy drawing on more sources of strength than at any point since 2010.
From an investment perspective, our base case view is broadly supportive for risk assets. We prefer equities over credit and credit over rates, but we expect low returns from these traditional exposures given 1) elevated valuations, 2) limited upside for corporate earnings from current levels and 3) limits to economic growth potential. Broadening exposure beyond conventional stocks and bonds, identifying opportunities in emerging markets and deploying more dynamic asset allocation strategies are some ways to adapt.
In some respects, our outlook represents an extension of the same long cycle we envisioned heading into 2016. The key difference for 2017 revolves around four emerging transitions. Populism is challenging globalism and creating new tail risks. Concerns about low growth are giving way to concerns about inflation. Years of focus on monetary policy are giving way to a close watch over fiscal policy. And concerns about new regulation are acceding to hopes for de-regulation.
Transition will be an evolving theme in 2017, and we will be re-visiting it in our publications throughout the year. In this Investment Outlook, we highlight specific signposts we will be watching, both to gauge the pace of transition and to test our base case view on the key investment questions.









Three Key Questions







Is it time to de-risk?
Is it time to de-risk?
No. We think de-risking would be premature, at
least from a purely return-generating standpoint. We
expect the macro environment to remain supportive
of risk assets during 2017 amid a slow-but-steady
expansion in developed markets and an acceleration
of growth in some emerging markets.

What’s driving the expansion?
What’s driving the expansion?
We believe this is a slow-growth recovery best
explained by cyclical economic drivers. We believe
the concerns about the developed world being mired
in a pattern of underinvestment and stalled growth—
so-called secular stagnation—are overdone.

Where do we see opportunities?
Where do we see opportunities?
In a low-return world, we look for sources of
return beyond conventional stock and bond market
approaches. We also think range-bound or volatile
markets create opportunities for more dynamic
investment strategies.

Transitions We’re Watching in 2017


















												Globalism to Populism
											



The biggest transition in the current environment is a shift away from globalism to a rising populist trend.















												Stagnation to Inflation
											



We expect concerns around potential secular stagnation to give way to a more inflationary paradigm in the US.















												Monetary to Fiscal Policy
											



The focus for stimulus is shifting toward fiscal spending, as central banks are stretching toward the limits of their easing ability.
















												Regulation to De-Regulation
											



We see the potential for greater regulatory divergence globally and the potential for competitive de-regulation.

Next Generation of ETF Investing

                Over the last two decades, investors have increasingly turned to Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) seeking to benefit from a defined strategy, diversified exposure to stocks, tax efficiency and low costs. Today, we combine the potential benefits of ETFs with the advanced strategies of Goldman Sachs Asset Managment (GSAM).
            









What Are the Potential Benefits of ETFs?





ETFs have grown in popularity due to the many benefits they offer: intraday trading ease, relative transparency and a likelihood of tax efficiency—all typically at lower total cost than most actively managed mutual funds.
 











The Four Ts

We note that ETFs are not riskless investments, so investors can lose money. Please see the ETF Risk Disclosures for additional risk considerations in the end disclosures. Ordinary brokerage commissions apply. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns.
Goldman Sachs does not provide legal, tax or accounting advice to its clients. All investors are strongly urged to consult with their legal, tax, or accounting advisors regarding any potential transactions or investments. There is no assurance that the tax status or treatment of a proposed transaction or investment will continue in the future. Tax treatment or status may be changed by law or government action in the future or on a retroactive basis.










Exponential Growth of the ETF Market





Developed in the early 1990s with lower cost, transparency and tax efficiency in mind, today there are ETFs representing both broad and narrow sectors of the market, and hundreds of ways to diversify. With $2 trillion in investor assets, it’s safe to say that ETFs are here to stay.

Next Generation of Equity Index Investing

                GSAM has developed a series of ETFs built on smart beta1 principles—a transparent, rules-based strategy that goes beyond stocks’ market capitalization, resulting in a more economically intuitive way to invest.

Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta™ ETFs















Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta™ ETFs

 / 






















Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta™ ETFs





These ETFs are designed to track an ActiveBeta® Index, a proprietary performance-seeking methodology from Goldman Sachs, which tilts towards stocks based on four well-established drivers of performance, often referred to as factors.








The Four Factors















The Advantages of Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta™ Investing









Opportunity to Outperform the Market




To construct the ActiveBeta® Index, GSAM employs a simple, transparent process that helps identify and emphasize stocks within the market-cap weighted universe, potentially providing greater returns.
 









A Diversified Approach




Individual factors can be cyclical in the short run, which may lead to timing and performance challenges. Combining four complementary smart beta factors equally can potentially result in a more consistent investment experience over time.
 









Lower Cost




Not only are ActiveBeta™ ETFs a fraction of the price of most smart beta ETFs, they are also among the most competitively priced products on the market.2

Next Generation Fixed Income Investing

                GSAM now offers the next generation, smart beta Access ETFs that seek better risk-adjusted returns to help meet the needs of today’s fixed income investor.
            









Access ETFs by Goldman Sachs





GSAM’s Access ETFs can help investors build efficient fixed income portfolios. Going a step further than traditional market-value weighted methodology, a smart beta approach selects bonds based on liquidity and customized fundamentals.














The Advantages of Goldman Sachs Fixed Income Investing









Smarter Access to Bond Markets




The index employs a simple, transparent process that helps identify an investible universe, then eliminates issuers with relative deteriorating fundamentals to offer exposure to existing sector or market beta.
 









Seeks Smoother Performance, Less Volatility




As bond investors look for income and diversification, a smart beta approach seeks liquidity while minimizing exposure to factors historically associated with volatility and underperformance.
 









Lower Cost




Access ETFs are among the most competitively priced ETFs on the market. They also offer transparency and can alleviate some of the challenges of buying bonds in the over-the-counter market.3

Access to Top Insights

                GSAM developed the Goldman Sachs Hedge Fund VIP Index, which tracks insights from some of the leading thinkers in the hedge fund universe. The Goldman Sachs Hedge Industry VIP ETF seeks to track this index and provides exposure to hedge fund managers’ most important long equity ideas.
            









Introducing the Goldman Sachs Hedge Industry VIP ETF (Ticker: GVIP)





The fund seeks to track the Goldman Sachs Hedge Fund VIP Index, which is constructed in accordance with a rules-based methodology derived from concepts previously developed by Goldman Sachs’ Global Investment Research division. The Index is designed to measure the performance of fundamentally-driven hedge fund managers' “Very-Important-Positions” — those positions that appear most frequently among their top 10 long equity holdings. The Goldman Sachs Hedge Industry VIP ETF (Ticker: GVIP) seeks to deliver these high-conviction ideas through the ease, transparency and liquidity of an ETF.









The Advantages of Investing in GVIP














The Fund is not a hedge fund and does not invest in hedge funds.
1. ETFs offer many benefits, including intraday trading, relative transparency and tax efficiency potential, all at typically lower expense ratios than most actively-managed mutual funds.

Access to the Treasury Market

                GSAM developed an ETF that provides access to Treasuries with a maturity of less than a year, which are backed by the full faith and credit of the US Government. Investors in the Goldman Sachs TreasuryAccess 0-1 Year ETF can gain easy access to Treasury markets while avoiding the operational and pricing complexities of US Treasury Auctions and over-the-counter market.
            









Introducing the Goldman Sachs TreasuryAccess 0-1 Year ETF (Ticker: GBIL)





The fund seeks to track the Citi US Treasury 0–1 Year Composite Select Index, which is designed to measure the performance of U.S. Treasury Obligations4 with a maximum remaining maturity of one year. The Goldman Sachs TreasuryAccess 0–1 Year ETF (Ticker: GBIL) provides access to the Treasury market through a lower cost, convenient and transparent ETF. The fund benefits from the experience of the GSAM Liquidity Solutions team, providing trade execution, price negotiation and security selection in the short-term Treasury market.









The Advantages of Investing in GBIL










Any guarantee on U.S Treasury Obligations applies only to the underlying securities of the Fund if held to maturity and not to the value of the Fund’s shares.
Individual shares may only be purchased and sold in secondary market transactions through brokers; shares trade at market prices rather than NAV; shares may trade at a price greater than or less than NAV; and investors may incur commission costs when buying or selling shares.
The Fund is not a money market fund and does not attempt to maintain a stable net asset value.

Important Disclosure

Unless otherwise stated, portfolio facts and statistics are shown for Class A shares; other classes may have different characteristics.

 †NAV: Unless you are eligible for a waiver, the public offering price you pay when you buy Class A shares of the Fund is the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the shares plus an initial sales charge. The initial sales charge varies depending upon the size of your purchase.  No sales charge is imposed where Class A or Class C shares are issued to you pursuant to the automatic investment of income dividends or capital gains distributions. It is the responsibility of the financial intermediary to ensure that the investor obtains the proper “breakpoint” discount. Class C, Class I and Class Y do not have an initial sales charge; however, Class C does charge a contingent deferred redemption charge.  See the 
                          
    prospectus for more information.
1Van Eck Associates Corporation (the “Adviser”) has agreed to waive fees and/or pay Fund expenses to the extent necessary to prevent the operating expenses of the Fund (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, interest expense, trading expenses, dividends and interest payments on securities sold short, taxes and extraordinary expenses) from exceeding 1.38% for Class A, 2.20% for Class C, 0.95% for Class I, and 1.13% for Class Y of the Fund’s average daily net assets per year until May 1, 2018. During such time, the expense limitation is expected to continue until the Board of Trustees acts to discontinue all or a portion of such expense limitation.
2The S&P North American Natural Resources Sector (SPGINRTR) Index (the "Index") provides investors with a benchmark that represents U.S. traded securities that are classified under the GICS® energy and materials sector excluding the chemicals industry; and steel sub-industry. The MSCI ACWI Commodity Producers Index captures the global opportunity set of commodity producers in the energy, metal and agricultural sectors. All indices are unmanaged and include the reinvestment of all dividends, but do not reflect the payment of transaction costs, advisory fees or expenses that are associated with an investment in the Fund. An index’s performance is not illustrative of the Fund’s performance. Indices are not securities in which investments can be made.
The views and opinions expressed are those of VanEck. Fund manager commentaries are general in nature and should not be construed as investment advice. Opinions are subject to change with market conditions. Any discussion of specific securities mentioned in the commentaries is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation to buy these securities. Fund holdings will vary.
You can lose money by investing in the Fund. Any investment in the Fund should be part of an overall investment program, not a complete program. The Fund is subject to risks associated with concentrating its investments in hard assets and the hard assets sector, including, precious metals and natural resources, and can be significantly affected by events relating to these industries, including international political and economic developments, inflation, and other factors. The Fund’s portfolio securities may experience substantial price fluctuations as a result of these factors, and may move independently of the trends of industrialized companies. The Fund’s investments in foreign securities involve risks related to adverse political and economic developments unique to a country or a region, currency fluctuations or controls, and the possibility of arbitrary action by foreign governments, including the takeover of property without adequate compensation or imposition of prohibitive taxation. The Fund is also subject to inflation risk, short-sales risk, market risk, non-diversification risk, leverage risk, credit risk and counterparty risk. Please see the 
        
    prospectus and      
    summary prospectus for information on these and other risk considerations.

The prospectus and summary prospectus contain this and other information.  Please read them carefully before investing.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
