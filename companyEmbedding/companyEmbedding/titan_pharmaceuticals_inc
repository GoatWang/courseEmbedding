Technology









Overview
ProNeura offers continuous drug delivery and consists of a small, solid rod made from a mixture of ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) and a drug substance. The resulting product is a solid matrix that is placed subcutaneously, normally in the inner part of the upper arm in a simple office procedure, and is removed in a similar manner at the end of the treatment period.
This continuous drug delivery technology was developed to address the need for a simple, practical method to potentially provide continuous drug administration on an outpatient basis over extended periods of up to 6 to 12 months. 
















Making Products with ProNeura
The drug substance that is part of the ProNeura implant is released slowly into the patient's body at continuous levels, through the process of dissolution. This results in a stable level of medication in the blood, similar to intravenous administration. Such long-term, linear release characteristics are generally desirable, as this avoids peak-and-trough level dosing that poses problems in the treatment of several chronic diseases. 















How ProNeura is Made
In the case of Probuphine®, the ProNeura implant contains 80 mg of buprenorphine HCl, uniformly distributed throughout the EVA matrix.

Competitive Advantage of ProNeura
By providing continuous, stable blood levels of medication, the ProNeura subdermal implant has the potential to offer several significant benefits to patients compared with other routes of administration. In addition to potential safety, efficacy and tolerability advantages resulting from long-term, non-fluctuating drug exposure, ProNeura would be implanted in a short, outpatient procedure once every three months to a year, making it more convenient for patients and enhancing compliance.

The Ropinirole implant is a subdermal implant utilizing Titan's proprietary ProNeura drug delivery platform. It has the potential to deliver continuous, non-fluctuating levels of this dopamine agonist in order to provide continuous dopaminergic stimulation (CDS) for a minimum of three months - and potentially six months or longer - from a single treatment. 





Overview of Parkinson's Disease
Bridging the Gap in Treatment with the Ropinirole Implant
Continuous dopaminergic stimulation (CDS) by subdermal delivery of dopamine agonists through the Ropinirole implant may palliate motor complications and delay or prevent the onset of dyskinesia (the involuntary movements often associated with Parkinson's disease).




What is Parkinson's Disease
Parkinson’s disease is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons, which alters activity in the brain region impacting movement and motor function.






Current Treatments
Parkinson’s disease is treated with drugs designed to replace or mimic dopamine in the brain.
Following several years of chronic treatment, these drugs can lose their benefit and trigger serious side effects.






Research
Pulsatile dopaminergic stimulation from current oral treatment may cause motor side effects.

Overview of
Opioid Addiction
What is Opioid Addiction?
Opioid addiction is a medical condition that is increasingly recognized as a global epidemic by world health authorities. Addiction is a primary, chronic disease of brain reward, motivation, memory and neurobiological circuitry. It is characterized by cravings, accompanied by a lack of impulse control, as well as cycles of relapse and remission. If left untreated, addiction is a progressive disease that often results in disability or premature death.
Current Treatments
Opioid addiction requires long-term treatment plans and medical care; abstinence is rarely a successful therapeutic approach. The current gold standard for medication assisted therapy (MAT) in the U.S. is buprenorphine. While sublingual buprenorphine is widely used as a treatment for opioid addiction, there are challenges with this option, including patient compliance, dosing that results in variable medication levels, and diversion and abuse associated with current daily medications.
Given the significant health epidemic of opioid addiction in the U.S., federal officials are seeking ways to ensure greater access to safe and effective treatments for the disease, while minimizing the risk of diversion and abuse. The U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) Department recently announced that it will move to expand access to MAT by revising the regulations related to the prescribing of buprenorphine to treat opioid dependence. The current cap on the number of patients that can be treated with buprenorphine products by a physician limits the availability of this important medication assisted therapy. The HHS revision to the regulation will provide a balance between expanding the supply of buprenorphine-based treatment, encouraging use of evidence-based MAT, and minimizing the risk of drug diversion.
Treatment options that minimize the risk of abuse and diversion, such as Titan's Probuphine implant, could increasingly play a crucial role in the maintenance treatment of patients suffering from opioid addiction. 





Opioid Dependence
Market Need
Buprenorphine dominates the current opioid addiction market

$2B
U.S. sales of daily oral formulations of buprenorphine, 2015

Since 2006
U.S. buprenorphine prescriptions have exceeded those of methadone

 








Challenges With Oral Buprenorphine That Probuphine can overcome






Patient compliance
Currently used sublingual dosing results in variable levels of medication in blood
Diversion and abuse associated with current daily dosed formulations




 







Clinical Studies
A final Phase 3 double-blind, double dummy clinical study of 177 patients met the pre-specified endpoint of non-inferiority as well as all secondary endpoints. Data from that trial also indicate that patients who were clinically stable on 8mg or less of buprenorphine per day maintained stability when transferred to Probuphine and were more likely to sustain abstinence from illicit opioids throughout the six months than those being treated with sublingual buprenorphine. Prior to the final Phase 3 trial, the efficacy and safety of Probuphine were studied in several other clinical trials, including a 163-patient, placebo-controlled study over a 24-week period (published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA)), and a follow on study of 287 patients (published in the journal Addiction).

         10-Q: TITAN PHARMACEUTICALS INC

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  The following discussion contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934(the "Exchange Act"). Such statements include, but are not limited to, any statements relating to our product development programs and any other statements that are not historical facts. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties that could negatively affect our business, operating results, financial condition and stock price. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations include those risks and uncertainties relating to the regulatory approval process, the development, testing, production and marketing of our drug candidates, patent and intellectual property matters and strategic agreements and relationships. We expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect any change in our expectations or any changes in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based, except as required by law.  Probuphine(R) and ProNeura(TM) are trademarks of Titan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. This Form 10-Q also includes trade names and trademarks of companies other than Titan Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  References herein to "we," "us," "Titan," and "our company" refer to Titan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and its subsidiaries unless the context otherwise requires.  Overview  We are a pharmaceutical company developing proprietary therapeutics for the treatment of serious medical disorders. Our product development programs utilize our proprietary long-term drug delivery platform, ProNeura(TM), and focus primarily on innovative treatments for select chronic diseases for which steady state delivery of a drug provides an efficacy and/or safety benefit.  Probuphine(R), our first product candidate based on the ProNeura platform, was approved by the FDA in May 2016 for the maintenance treatment of opioid dependence in patients who are stable on low to moderate doses of daily sublingual buprenorphine treatment. We have licensed development and commercialization rights of Probuphine for the U.S. and Canadian markets to Braeburn and pursuant to the license agreement as amended to date, we received a $15 million milestone payment upon FDA approval of the Probuphine NDA, and are entitled to receive royalties on net sales of Probuphine ranging in percentage from the mid-teens to the low twenties based on a tiered structure. The agreement also provides for up to an additional $165 million in sales milestones and $35 million in regulatory milestones on Probuphine. Additionally, in certain circumstances the agreement entitles us to a low single digit royalty, up to an aggregate of $50 million, on net sales by Braeburn, if any, of other future competing products in the addiction market, e.g. a monthly depot injection. Braeburn commenced commercialization activities in support of the Probuphine product launch shortly after FDA approval. During the second half of 2016, Braeburn was engaged in training qualified health care providers in the implant insertion and removal procedures, physician outreach, payment and reimbursement discussions with third party payors and sales and marketing efforts associated with the launch including hiring personnel for a field sales force. In January 2017, Braeburn indicated that more than 2,500 health care providers from all 50 states and Puerto Rico were certified to provide Probuphine to their patients, and more than 70 payors, including private insurers, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and Veterans Administration programs covered Probuphine. Also, the permanent J-code for Probuphine as the first six-month buprenorphine implant for the maintenance treatment of opioid addiction became effective on January 1, 2017, and we were informed that it should be incorporated into the reimbursement processing systems of most third party payor plans by early to mid-second quarter 2017. With a field sales force and medical support staff of more than 60 in place by early first quarter 2017, Braeburn commenced a full commercial launch focused on more than 80 key treatment centers throughout the U.S. to establish 'sites of excellence' for the long-term maintenance treatment with Probuphine. As with the launch of any new method of medical treatment in the current reimbursement environment, progress is slow during the initial several months while the challenges of the third party payor system are addressed. Braeburn has devoted substantial resources to support the patient and the physician community to facilitate this process of getting prior approvals from third party payors for treatment with Probuphine. While they have indicated good progress with some payors, it remains a challenge with some and recently Braeburn expanded its distribution channels and processing capacity by adding a second specialty pharmacy company to increase coverage across the country. During the first quarter, the number of patients seeking treatment with Probuphine showed a steady growth from month to month, and at the same time the number of health care providers that have prescribed Probuphine has been increasing from week to week. While revenues to Titan from Probuphine have to date been limited, the patient and physician trends are encouraging and we believe Braeburn is establishing a strong foundation for future success. We have been advised that most patients completing the first six month treatment with Probuphine during the quarter opted for treatment continuation. We believe we will benefit from the trend of opioid addiction treatment's move towards extended release formulations, a trend evidenced by the development efforts of the major suppliers of daily dosed buprenorphine products aimed at adding extended release formulations to their product pipeline. However, in light of the difficulties encountered to date, we cannot predict either the timing or the degree to which Probuphine will be accepted by the medical community.  We have continued to make progress in the efforts to advance potential commercialization of Probuphine outside of the U.S. and Canada. To obtain regulatory clarity for product approval in Europe, we met in December 2016 with the U.K. and German regulatory agencies, and based on feedback from these meetings we submitted an application to the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, seeking eligibility for Probuphine to follow the centralized review and approval process for its Marketing Authorization Application or MAA. In early March 2017, we received confirmation from the EMA that Probuphine is eligible for a centralized review and approval process. We were recently informed by the EMA that a pediatric indication waiver has been granted. While we are still early in this process, it is our estimate that an MAA could be filed in the fourth quarter of 2017. We have also been granted Small Manufacturing Entity, or SME, status in Europe, which provides for some monetary benefits during the application process and commercialization. We have continued the interactions regarding potential partnerships for Probuphine in Europe and elsewhere, and this regulatory clarity has helped in advancing the dialogue.  We believe that our ProNeura long term drug delivery platform has the potential to be used in the treatment of other chronic conditions where maintaining stable, around the clock blood levels of a medication may benefit the patient and improve medical outcomes. We have two products in early development using the ProNeura platform, an implant designed to provide long-term delivery of ropinirole, a dopamine agonist approved as a daily dosed oral formulation for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, and an implant designed to provide long-term delivery of T3, a synthetic thyroid hormone approved as a daily dosed oral formulation for the treatment of hypothyroidism.  The non-clinical development work related to the ropinirole implant, including the toxicology studies, was completed in the fourth quarter of 2016 and the IND was submitted to the FDA in January 2017. In late February 2017, in a telephone conversation, we received comments from the FDA following its initial review of the IND requesting additional information related to final test results for the ropinirole implant and the applicator, as well as the name of the Principal Investigator, and we were asked to hold the initiation of the clinical study. We received the FDA's written comments in late March giving details of the requested information. We are working as quickly as possible to provide the FDA with the additional information and expect to have during June all the data needed for the FDA submission. .We hope to be able to commence the clinical study in early third quarter, although there is no assurance that the FDA will clear the IND within that timeframe, if at all.  During 2016 we identified refinements to the T3 implant formulation, however, due to shortage of the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, further investigation had to be temporarily suspended during the fourth quarter of 2016. In early 2017, we obtained the requisite supply of the API and have commenced work towards the optimization of the T3 implant. We intend to have further discussions this quarter with experts on the clinical development pathway, and the timing of further development activities will be dependent on those discussions and the availability of additional financial resources.  Our goal is to further expand the product pipeline, and we are currently evaluating other drugs and disease settings for opportunities to use the ProNeura platform in potential treatment applications where conventional treatment is limited by variability in blood drug levels and poor patient compliance.  We operate in only one business segment, the development of pharmaceutical products.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  See Note 1 to the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements included in Part 1, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for information on recent accounting pronouncements.  Results of Operations for the three months Ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016  License revenues were approximately $40,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared with no license revenue during the three months ended March 31, 2016. License revenue for the 2017 period reflects the recognition of royalties earned on net sales of our Probuphine product by Braeburn.  Research and development expenses for the three month period ended March 31, 2017 were approximately $2.1 million, compared to approximately $0.7 million for the comparable period in 2016, an increase of approximately $1.4 million, or 200%. The increase in research and development costs was primarily associated with increases in external research and development expenses related to the support of our Probuphine and ProNeura product development programs and other research and development expenses. During the three month period ended March 31, 2017, external research and development expenses relating to our product development programs were approximately $1.1 million compared to approximately $0.6 million for the comparable period in 2016. Other research and development expenses include internal operating costs such as clinical research and development personnel-related expenses, clinical trials related travel expenses, and allocation of facility and corporate costs. As a result of the risks and uncertainties inherently associated with pharmaceutical research and development activities described elsewhere in this report, we are unable to estimate the specific timing and future costs of our clinical development programs or the timing of material cash inflows, if any, from our product candidates.  General and administrative expenses for the three month period ended March 31, 2017 were approximately $1.4 million compared to approximately $1.1 million for the comparable period in 2016, an increase of approximately $0.3 million, or 27%. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily related to increases in non-cash stock-based compensation and employee-related costs of approximately $0.1 million and professional fees of approximately $0.1 million.  Net other income for the three month period ended March 31, 2017 was approximately $0.4 million compared to net other expense of approximately $15,000 for the comparable period in 2016. Net other income for the three month period ended March 31, 2017 consisted primarily of non-cash gains on changes in the fair value of warrants and interest income.  Our net loss for the three month period ended March 31, 2017 was approximately $3.0 million, or approximately $0.14 per share, compared to approximately $1.8 million, or approximately $0.09 per share, for the comparable period in 2016.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  We have funded our operations since inception primarily through the sale of our securities and the issuance of debt, as well as with proceeds from warrant and option exercises, corporate licensing and collaborative agreements, and government-sponsored research grants. At March 31, 2017, we had working capital of approximately $10.0 million compared to working capital of approximately $13.0 million at December 31, 2016.  Our operating activities used approximately $3.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2017. This consisted primarily of the net loss for the period of approximately $3.0 million, $0.4 million related to non-cash gains on changes in the fair value of warrants and $0.2 million related to net changes in other operating assets and liabilities. This was offset, in part, by non-cash charges of approximately $0.4 million related to stock-based compensation and approximately $0.1 million related to depreciation and amortization. Uses of cash in operating activities were primarily to fund product development programs and administrative expenses.  Our investing activities used approximately $26,000 during the three months ended March 31, 2017, which was primarily related to purchases of equipment.  We had no financing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2017.  At March 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $10.9 million, which we believe are sufficient to fund our planned operations through the second quarter of 2018. We will require additional funds, either through payments from Braeburn under the license agreement or through other financing arrangements, to advance our current ProNeura development programs beyond the planned activities for the next 12 months and to complete the regulatory approval process necessary to commercialize any products we might develop.

Probuphine is designed to provide a constant, low-level dose of buprenorphine for six months in patients who are already stable on low-to-moderate doses of other forms of buprenorphine, as part of a complete treatment program. Until today, buprenorphine for the treatment of opioid dependence was only approved as a pill or a film placed under the tongue or on the inside of a person’s cheek until it dissolved. While effective, a pill or film may be lost, forgotten or stolen. However, as an implant, Probuphine provides a new treatment option for people in recovery who may value the unique benefits of a six-month implant compared to other forms of buprenorphine, such as the possibility of improved patient convenience from not needing to take medication on a daily basis. An independent FDA advisory committee supported the approval of Probuphine in a meeting held earlier this year. "Opioid abuse and addiction have taken a devastating toll on American families. We must do everything we can to make new, innovative treatment options available that can help patients regain control over their lives,” said FDA Commissioner Robert M. Califf, M.D. “Today’s approval provides the first-ever implantable option to support patients’ efforts to maintain treatment as part of their overall recovery program.” Expanding the use and availability of medication-assisted treatment (MAT) options like buprenorphine is an important component of the FDA’s opioid action plan and one of three top priorities for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Opioid Initiative aimed at reducing prescription opioid and heroin related overdose, death and dependence. Opioid dependence is the diagnostic term used for the more common concept, “addiction,” in the Probuphine clinical trials. Addiction is defined as a cluster of behavioral, cognitive and physiological phenomena that may include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling drug use, persisting in drug use despite harmful consequences, a higher priority given to drug use than to other activities and obligations, as well as the possibility of the development of tolerance or development of physical dependence. Physical dependence is not the same as addiction. Newer diagnostic terminology uses the term “opioid use disorder,” which includes both milder forms of problematic opioid use as well as addiction. MAT is a comprehensive approach that combines approved medications (currently, methadone, buprenorphine or naltrexone) with counseling and other behavioral therapies to treat patients with opioid use disorder. Regular adherence to MAT with buprenorphine reduces opioid withdrawal symptoms and the desire to use, without causing the cycle of highs and lows associated with opioid misuse or abuse. At sufficient doses, it also decreases the pleasurable effects of other opioids, making continued opioid abuse less attractive. According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, patients receiving MAT for their opioid use disorder cut their risk of death from all causes in half. “Scientific evidence suggests that maintenance treatment with these medications in the context of behavioral treatment and recovery support are more effective in the treatment of opioid use disorder than short-term detoxification programs aimed at abstinence,” said Nora Volkow, M.D., director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse at the National Institutes of Health. “This product will expand the treatment alternatives available to people suffering from an opioid use disorder.” Probuphine should be used as part of a complete treatment program that includes counseling and psychosocial support. Probuphine consists of four, one-inch-long rods that are implanted under the skin on the inside of the upper arm and provide treatment for six months. Administering Probuphine requires specific training because it must be surgically inserted and removed. Only a health care provider who has completed the training and become certified through a restricted program called the Probuphine Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program should insert and remove the implants. If further treatment is needed, new implants may be inserted in the opposite arm for one additional course of treatment. The FDA is requiring postmarketing studies to establish the safety and feasibility of placing the Probuphine implants for additional courses of treatment. The safety and efficacy of Probuphine were demonstrated in a randomized clinical trial of adults who met the clinical criteria for opioid dependence and were considered stable after prior buprenorphine treatment. A response to MAT was measured by urine screening and self-reporting of illicit opioid use during the six month treatment period. Sixty-three percent of Probuphine-treated patients had no evidence of illicit opioid use throughout the six months of treatment – similar to the 64 percent of those who responded to sublingual (under the tongue) buprenorphine alone. The most common side effects from treatment with Probuphine include implant-site pain, itching, and redness, as well as headache, depression, constipation, nausea, vomiting, back pain, toothache and oropharyngeal pain. The safety and efficacy of Probuphine have not been established in children or adolescents less than 16 years of age. Clinical studies of Probuphine did not include participants over the age of 65. Probuphine has a boxed warning that provides important safety information for health care professionals, including a warning that insertion and removal of Probuphine are associated with the risk of implant migration, protrusion, expulsion and nerve damage resulting from the procedure. Probuphine must be prescribed and dispensed according to the Probuphine REMS program because of the risks of surgical complications and because of the risks of accidental overdose, misuse and abuse if an implant comes out or protrudes from the skin. As part of this program, Probuphine can only be prescribed and dispensed by health care providers who are certified with the REMS program and have completed live training, among other requirements. Probuphine implants contain a significant amount of drug that can potentially be expelled or removed, resulting in the potential for accidental exposure or intentional misuse and abuse if the implant comes out of the skin. Patients should be seen during the first week after insertion and a visit schedule of no less than once-monthly is recommended for continued counseling and psychosocial support. Probuphine is marketed by San Francisco-based Titan Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Braeburn Pharmaceuticals based in Princeton, New Jersey. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.         CLINICAL SUMMARY    SIX CLINICAL STUDIES COMPLETED TO DATE WITH FINAL PHASE 2 STUDY UNDER WAY     1 Initial small dose finding study   2 & 3 Two well-controlled Phase 3 safety and efficacy studies showing clinical and statistical superiority over placebo and non-inferiority to Suboxone published in Journal of American Medical Association and Addiction   4 & 5 Two open-label long-term treatment safety studies   6 Relative bioavailability study                STUDY RESULTS       Mild-to-moderate adverse events typical of the safety profile of buprenorphine; low number of serious adverse events similar to placebo 				Well-tolerated implant procedure 				No evidence of implant diversion or misuse              KEY BENEFITS     EFFICACY Effective in reducing illicit opioid use   COMPLIANCE Treatment with the ProNeura™ implant is expected to enhance patient compliance     SAFETY Non-fluctuating drug exposure over six months may provide superior safety and tolerability   EASE OF USE Patients are dosed once every six months in an outpatient setting                PRONEURA™ Titan's proprietary long-term, drug delivery platform provides continuous drug release and non-fluctuating medication levels over a period of three months to a year depending on drug characteristics. ProNeura products are subdermal implants that are ideal for treating chronic diseases for which the maintenance of stable medication levels could offer advantages over other routes of administration.      HOME TECHNOLOGY            OVERVIEW     ProNeura offers continuous drug delivery and consists of a small, solid rod made from a mixture of ethylene-vinyl acetate (“EVA”) and a drug substance.                                                     .   The resulting product is a solid matrix that is placed subcutaneously, normally in the inner part of the upper arm in a simple office procedure, and is      removed in a similar manner at the end of the treatment period.         This continuous drug delivery technology was developed to address the need for a simple, practical method to potentially provide continuous drug administration on an      outpatient basis over extended periods of up to 6 to 12 months.                                     Continuous Drug Delivery Technology      The continuous drug delivery system consists of a small, solid rod made from a mixture of ethylene-vinyl acetate (“EVA”) and a drug substance. The resulting product is a solid matrix that is placed subcutaneously, normally in the inner part of the upper arm in a simple office procedure, and is removed in a similar manner at the end of the treatment period. The drug substance is released slowly, at continuous levels, through the process of dissolution. This results in a stable blood level similar to intravenous administration. Such long-term, linear release characteristics are generally desirable as this avoids peak and trough level dosing that poses problems for many Central Nervous System (“CNS”) and other disease settings.  This continuous drug delivery technology was developed to address the need for a simple, practical method to potentially provide continuous drug administration on an outpatient basis over extended periods of up to 6-12 months. In addition to Probuphine, which is the first product to complete clinical testing that has utilized this proprietary continuous drug delivery technology, Titan has conducted initial non-clinical studies with long-term delivery of dopamine agonists demonstrating the potential of this product in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease in non-clinical models of the disease.        Company Overview     Titan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical Company developing proprietary therapeutics primarily for the treatment of serious medical disorders.  Titan’s principal asset is Probuphine®, the first slow-release implant formulation of buprenorphine hydrochloride (“buprenorphine”), designed to maintain a stable, round-the-clock blood level of the medicine in patients for up to six months following a single treatment. The outpatient treatment of opioid dependence with daily dosed sublingual buprenorphine formulations represents a $1.5 billion market in the U.S., and a seven day transdermal patch formulation of buprenorphine for the treatment of chronic pain was launched in the U.S. in 2011. This novel implant formulation is inserted subdermally in a patient’s upper arm providing continuous medication, and has the potential to enhance patient compliance to treatment, and limit diversion for illicit use and accidental exposure to the sublingual formulations. An FDA-requested Phase 3 study is currently in progress with completion expected in mid-2015 and resubmission of the New Drug Application later in 2015. In December 2012, Titan entered into a license agreement with Braeburn Pharmaceuticals Sprl (“Braeburn”) that grants Braeburn exclusive commercialization rights to Probuphine® in the United States and Canada. Titan received a non-refundable up-front license fee of $15.75 million and will receive a $15 million milestone payment upon the approval of the NDA by the FDA. Additionally, Titan will be eligible to receive up to $165 million upon achievement of specified sales milestones and up to $35 million in regulatory milestones in the event of future NDA submissions and approvals for additional indications, including chronic pain. Titan will receive tiered royalties on net sales of Probuphine ranging from the mid-teens to the low twenties.  Probuphine is the first product to utilize ProNeura™, a novel, proprietary, long-term drug delivery technology. The ProNeura technology has the potential to be used in developing products for the treatment of other chronic conditions, such as Parkinson’s disease, where maintaining stable, round-the-clock blood levels of a drug can benefit the patient and improve medical outcomes.  Finally, Titan has monetized substantially all of the future royalty revenue of 8-10% of net sales of Fanapt® (iloperidone), an atypical antipsychotic compound being marketed in the U.S. for the treatment of schizophrenia by Novartis Pharma AG (“Novartis”). The future royalty revenue has been sold to Deerfield Management (“Deerfield”), a healthcare investment fund, in exchange for cash and debt considerations which have been used to advance the development of Probuphine and for general corporate purposes.      Management Team President Sunil Bhonsle, M.B.A. Executive Vice President and Chief Development Officer Katherine L.

Repayment of the loans is on an interest-only basis through December 31, 2018, followed by monthly payments of principal and accrued interest for the balance of the 46-month term. The loans bear interest at a floating coupon rate of one-month LIBOR (floor of 1.10%) plus 8.40%. A final payment equal to 5.0% of each loan tranche will be due on the scheduled maturity date for such loan. In addition, if the Company repays all or a portion of the loan prior to the applicable maturity date, it will pay the Lender a prepayment penalty fee, based on a percentage of the then outstanding principal balance, equal to 4% if the prepayment occurs during the interest-only payment period, 3% if the prepayment occurs during the 12 months following such period, and 2% thereafter.
The Companys obligations under the Loan Agreement are secured by a first priority security interest in all of its assets, with the exception of its intellectual property. The Company agreed not to pledge or otherwise encumber its intellectual property assets, subject to certain exceptions.
The Loan Agreement includes customary affirmative and restrictive covenants, excluding any covenants to attain or maintain certain financial metrics, and also includes customary events of default, including for payment failures, breaches of covenants, change of control and material adverse changes. Upon the occurrence of an event of default and following any applicable cure periods, a default interest rate of an additional 5% may be applied to the outstanding loan balances, and the Lender may declare all outstanding obligations immediately due and payable and take such other actions as set forth in the Loan Agreement.
