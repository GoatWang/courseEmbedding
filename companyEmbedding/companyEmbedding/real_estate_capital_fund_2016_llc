Home> Industries> Real Estate, Hospitality & Construction> Trends in real estate private equity for 2016Trends in real estate private equity for 2016 Share	Our report this year finds that fundraising is up and real estate investors are seeing opportunities in markets across the globe, including ones that have seen slowdowns. New sources of financing are emerging in markets such as Israel, and the industry is innovating to provide investors and fund managers with liquidity.	At the same time, the real estate industry is going through a phase of institutionalization as it formalizes processes, outsources noncore activities and takes proactive steps to managing increased regulatory oversight. A new environment for real estate fund managers	With a rate rise on the horizon in the US, and a slowdown in China that some fear may destabilize its real estate market and affect both developed and emerging economies, the rising tide that had previously lifted all real estate boats over the last several years seems likely to recede. 	The counterweight to these concerns is that many local economies are showing slow yet steady growth, and real estate supply and demand are in relative check, in part because that growth did not lead development to overshoot the needs of industry and commerce. The cycle is clearly turning, and the successful investment strategies of yesterday may not suit the conditions emerging today. Regulatory reviews, compliance and exams	The challenges brought on by a nearly 50% increase in registered investment advisers since the implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act required the Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations (OCIE) to consider both tactical and strategic opportunities to examine higher-risk registrants and, within those examinations, focus on high-risk compliance areas.	Going forward, it is clear that more and more private fund advisers will receive greater examination scrutiny. But the consequent potential for decreased systemic risk and increased confidence on the part of investors and counterparties will be a significant benefit for the industry as a whole. Taxing times ahead	The OECD’s project on base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) may have been originally intended to tackle real and perceived tax avoidance by multinational companies, but its effects have rippled through to the real estate fund management industry.	The risk for any international business, including real estate firms, is that different approaches by individual countries create a highly complex and constantly evolving tax landscape. Even where legislative changes are not made, it is fair to assume that governments, under pressure to increase their tax bases, will tighten up the enforcement of their existing rules. Privacy please	The last 12 months have seen a clutch of public-to-private deals led by private equity real estate managers. We expect the trend to continue, thanks to rising levels of dry powder among real estate funds, some attractive pricing for the REIT sector and shareholder activism.	The attractiveness of the sector to buyers stems back to actions taken by REITs following the downturn. Many REITs took advantage of a high level of available and lower-cost capital to refinance and clean up their balance sheets. In addition, many sold off assets that were non-core or that did not fit their strategies.	As a result, today’s REITs are in relatively good shape, characterized by lower risk, better yields and better capitalization. Managing complexity	With ever larger funds being raised, more products and strategies being offered to investors and greater demands for transparency and improved reporting, fund managers are increasingly looking to outsource their administration.	Outsourcing to fund administrators can provide clear benefits, such as a more flexible use of resources, an ability to focus on revenue and return-generating activities, a more scalable platform, assurance for investors that reporting is being managed by an independent third party and more predictable operating costs.	For new firms, outsourcing can be a relatively easy decision. For established firms, however, the deciding factors are likely to be more nuanced. Focus on Brazil, China and Israel Brazil	For investors that understand the Brazilian real estate market, now may be the best buying opportunity in at least a decade. Prices are low due to three factors: a significant currency correction, an economic slowdown and resultant oversupply of real estate and a decade of high construction levels that has exacerbated the oversupply. China	Following the summer’s stock market correction and the renminbi’s devaluation, it’s clear that some investors have become more cautious about parts of the Chinese real estate market. With pockets of overdevelopment in some areas, investors need to choose their markets wisely in China. Israel	Low interest rates and growing demand from investors for international exposure is making the Israeli bond market an attractive source of capital for real estate funds. While the flow of issuers has largely come from the US, there are signs that some companies in other regions, such as the UK, are eyeing the market with interest. Outlook	Although some are raising warning flags, we believe the outlook is positive, based on both macro and micro economic factors.	A stable inflationary policy continues to benefit asset prices, while lower unemployment and relatively low commodity prices also play a beneficial role. Also, the slow post-crisis recovery has allowed supply to match demand more closely than has historically been the case after a downturn.	Real estate funds continue to attract high levels of capital, with successful closes across the real estate investment spectrum, from value-added and opportunistic to core and distressed.	In the past, warning flags would be justified seven years into an economic cycle, but market data suggests this cycle will be longer than average.

LibraryContactsBuilding your business future	Today’s real estate, hospitality and construction companies must adopt new approaches to address regulatory requirements and financial risks – while meeting the challenges of expanding globally and achieving sustainable growth.	Our Real Estate, Hospitality & Construction practice has the ability to mobilize a team of seasoned professionals to address complex and demanding challenges and provide seamless service on a global basis. We can help move you forward. Are you ready to break ground? In working with you, we draw on our industry knowledge and insight to help you strategically position yourself – wherever you are in the world. Let us help you better understand some of the key challenges facing the industry, including:	 Real estate IPOs	With fewer financing options available, companies increasingly are looking to IPOs to raise equity, using the proceeds to refinance portfolios, make new investments or to provide owners and investors with the opportunity to liquidate their holdings. The IPO value journey	We can help you evaluate your options and assist you throughout the entire process, including working through the challenging accounting and tax issues. Although the IPO event itself generally lasts 90 to 120 days, the IPO value journey begins at least a year or two before the IPO and continues well beyond it.	Even when the financial climate is not ideal for fund raising, it could be a good time to begin planning for an IPO, while you wait for markets to settle.	The IPO journey is not easy, but with the right people and careful planning, real estate companies can navigate the long road from private to public ownership. Related materials:  Visit EY's Global IPO Center of Excellence  Q1 2017 Global Trends IPO ReportRegulatory and technical accounting changes	Major regulatory and technical accounting changes are occurring in the US, Europe and other geographies, which has created a challenging environment for real estate, hospitality and construction organizations. These include the Dodd-Frank Act, the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD) and proposed accounting changes for leases and revenue recognition from the Financial Accounting Standards Board and International Accounting Standards Board.	We are committed to helping our clients understand how to approach these changes. We advise funds on SEC examinations and help them assess, design and implement compliance programs. Effectively navigating the sophisticated marketing regime required by the AIFMD will be a key challenge and could lead to a competitive advantage for alternative investment groups. Considering the potential implications of leasing and revenue recognition early on is important, because what organizations do today in preparation can have a significant effect on their business tomorrow. Related materials:  New IASB leases standard — engineering and construction - EY  FASB: final guidance - How the new revenue recognition standard will affect homebuildersGreen buildings	The world is turning green, and as the benefits of going green become clearer and more affordable, tenant and investor demands for sustainable buildings are increasing. Construction and engineering companies around the world are building more and more environmentally friendly buildings, and existing buildings are being upgraded to meet these standards as well. Green buildings can also have a demonstrable impact on the corporate bottom line.	Our global team can advise you on: 	 The cost and benefit analysis of energy applications 	 Achieving specific green building certification standards, such as the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) green building rating system, which has been introduced around the globe 	 Tax credits and incentives available – at the federal, state and local level in countries around the world – to improve the energy efficiency of buildings, which could possibly outweigh the cost of certification standards 	 Cost reductions, operational efficiencies and other rewards that can have a direct impact on a company’s performance and results Related materials:  Climate Change and Sustainability Services  Related materials: Climate Change and Sustainability ServicesReal estate private equity	The recession, financial crisis and pullbacks in the credit market have all impacted real estate private equity funds over the past several years. Given the challenging environment that still remains, it is more important than ever to understand the trends affecting the sector so you can respond effectively.	Key trends include: 	 Distressed deal opportunities will continue, and convergence of the bid-ask spread will foster greater deal volumes. 	 Due to regulatory and financial reporting changes, the fund operating models will change over the medium to long term. 	 Overall, fund terms have not come back to where they were pre-crash, and many real estate fund managers have had to make investor concessions. 	 Investors are now more focused on scrutinizing the real estate fund platforms where they are placing capital. More information will be needed to meet investors’ reporting requirements.
