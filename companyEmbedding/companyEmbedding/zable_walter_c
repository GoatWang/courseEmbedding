Cubic Corporation bio


Walter Joseph Zable (June 17, 1915 – June 23, 2012) was an American businessman, entrepreneur, semi-professional football player and standout college athlete. He was the founder, chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of Cubic Corporation, a public corporation providing military defense equipment and automated fare collection equipment. At the time of Zable's death, he was the world's oldest public company CEO and Cubic was worth 1.28 billion dollars.[1] Earlier in his life he had played semi-professional football for the Richmond Arrows in the Dixie League. Some sources also mention him as having played for the National Football League's New York Giants, although no official Giants records exist of his having played for the team.

Early life and college[edit]
Walter J. Zable was born in Los Angeles, California.[2] However, he grew up in Boston, Massachusetts during the Great Depression while his father worked as a mill worker.[2] Before Zable even reached high school he had already taken a keen interest in electronics.[2] During the daytime he would work on his athletic ability—specifically his football, baseball and track and field prowess—and at nighttime he was enrolled in Boston Trade School where he would take classes at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Wentworth Institute of Technology.[2] Years later Zable recounted that "electronics and athletics were [his] life."[2] He graduated from high school in 1933.
Zable earned a full athletic scholarship to the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia.[3] He chose William & Mary over Harvard University which was much closer to home and also offered him an academic scholarship.[1] Zable suited up for the Indians football team from 1934 through 1936.[4] He enjoyed success on the gridiron and earned honorable mention All-America accolades his senior year.[4] In addition to football, Zable also lettered in baseball, basketball, and track and field.[4]
Post college[edit]
Football and business careers[edit]
Shortly after graduating college in 1937 with a Bachelor of Science degree in physics, Zable played semi-professional football.[2][3] He played for the Richmond Arrows in the short-lived Dixie League.[3] After a year of playing football, he enrolled in the University of Florida Graduate School and earned his Master of Science degree in physics in 1939.[2] Zable then moved on to business. Prior to starting Cubic Corporation in 1951, Zable worked for Sperry Gyroscope Company, Federal Telecommunications Laboratories of ITT, Flight Research Company, and Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company.[5] Along the way he married his first wife, Betty Virginia (Carter) Zable, and then they moved to southern California.[2] He began Cubic Corporation in 1951 to launch his first product, a device used to measure and test microwave output.[2] Over the next six decades, Zable would expand Cubic Corporation into a billion dollar-plus engineering giant that employs approximately 8,000 people worldwide.[3]
Philanthropy[edit]
Walter J. Zable and his late wife, Betty Virginia Zable, were philanthropists as well. In 1990, for instance, they donated $10 million to their alma mater, The College of William & Mary, and in return the college named their football stadium after him.[6] Back in 1971, he "established the Walter J. Zable/San Diego Chapter of the National Football Foundation and College Hall of Fame (NFFCHF) to help preserve the genuine sportsmanship and integrity exhibited in high school and college football," according to an official San Diego City Council proclamation in honor of his 90th birthday.[3] Players such as Junior Seau and Mark Malone benefited directly from this NFF chapter.[3] Recognizing his contribution to both athletics and his fellow man, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) bestowed him with the Theodore Roosevelt Award in 1987, which is the highest honor the NCAA confers.[3] Past winners include George H. W. Bush, Bill Cosby, and Bob Dole.
Death[edit]
On June 23, 2012, Zable died at age 97 from natural causes.[4] At the time of his death he was survived by his son Walter C. Zable, daughter Karen (Zable) Cox, and five grandchildren.[1] He was the world's oldest public company CEO and Cubic was worth 1.28 billion dollars.[1]

Cubic Corporation bio


Walter Joseph Zable (June 17, 1915 – June 23, 2012) was an American businessman, entrepreneur, semi-professional football player and standout college athlete. He was the founder, chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of Cubic Corporation, a public corporation providing military defense equipment and automated fare collection equipment. At the time of Zable's death, he was the world's oldest public company CEO and Cubic was worth 1.28 billion dollars.[1] Earlier in his life he had played semi-professional football for the Richmond Arrows in the Dixie League.

Early life and college[edit]
Walter J. Zable was born in Los Angeles, California.[2] However, he grew up in Boston, Massachusetts during the Great Depression while his father worked as a mill worker.[2] Before Zable even reached high school he had already taken a keen interest in electronics.[2] During the daytime he would work on his athletic ability—specifically his football, baseball and track and field prowess—and at nighttime he was enrolled in Boston Trade School where he would take classes at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Wentworth Institute of Technology.[2] Years later Zable recounted that "electronics and athletics were [his] life."[2] He graduated from high school in 1933.
Zable earned a full athletic scholarship to the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia.[3] He chose William & Mary over Harvard University which was much closer to home and also offered him an academic scholarship.[1] Zable suited up for the Indians football team from 1934 through 1936.[4] He enjoyed success on the gridiron and earned honorable mention All-America accolades his senior year.[4] In addition to football, Zable also lettered in baseball, basketball, and track and field.[4]
Post college[edit]
Football and business careers[edit]
Shortly after graduating college in 1937 with a Bachelor of Science degree in physics, Zable played semi-professional football.[2][3] He played for the Richmond Arrows in the short-lived Dixie League.[3] After a year of playing football, he enrolled in the University of Florida Graduate School and earned his Master of Science degree in physics in 1939.[2] Zable then moved on to business. Prior to starting Cubic Corporation in 1951, Zable worked for Sperry Gyroscope Company, Federal Telecommunications Laboratories of ITT, Flight Research Company, and Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company.[5] Along the way he married his first wife, Betty Virginia (Carter) Zable, and then they moved to southern California.[2] He began Cubic Corporation in 1951 to launch his first product, a device used to measure and test microwave output.[2] Over the next six decades, Zable would expand Cubic Corporation into a billion dollar-plus engineering giant that employs approximately 8,000 people worldwide.[3]
Philanthropy[edit]
Walter J. Zable and his late wife, Betty Virginia Zable, were philanthropists as well. In 1990, for instance, they donated $10 million to their alma mater, The College of William & Mary, and in return the college named their football stadium after him.[6] Back in 1971, he "established the Walter J. Zable/San Diego Chapter of the National Football Foundation and College Hall of Fame (NFFCHF) to help preserve the genuine sportsmanship and integrity exhibited in high school and college football," according to an official San Diego City Council proclamation in honor of his 90th birthday.[3] Players such as Junior Seau and Mark Malone benefited directly from this NFF chapter.[3] Recognizing his contribution to both athletics and his fellow man, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) bestowed him with the Theodore Roosevelt Award in 1987, which is the highest honor the NCAA confers.[3] Past winners include George H. W. Bush, Bill Cosby, and Bob Dole.
Death[edit]
On June 23, 2012, Zable died at age 97 from natural causes.[4] At the time of his death he was survived by his son Walter C. Zable, daughter Karen (Zable) Cox, and five grandchildren.[1] He was the world's oldest public company CEO and Cubic was worth 1.28 billion dollars.[1]

Our History - Walter J. & Betty C. Zable Foundation



















































  



 

 

Our History
 






About the Zable Foundation
The Walter J. & Betty C. Zable Foundation is a private foundation founded in 1997.
Building on a lifetime of community philanthropy the Walter J. and Betty C. Zable Foundation was established to carry on their wishes to  support science; athletics, and care to those in our community in need.
Upon the passing of Walter J. Zable the foundation is now governed by the independent directors he appointed to carry on the mission of his philanthropy.
The History of  Walter J. & Betty C. Zable 
Walter J. Zable was the founder and chief executive officer of San Diego-based Cubic Corporation for over six decades. He formed the company in 1951 and took it public in 1959. Today, Cubic is a market leader in the national defense and mass transportation industries and is traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Zable died in June 2012 at the age of 97 due to natural causes. He was known to be the world’s oldest CEO of a publicly traded company at the time of his death.
As a young man Zable had a passion for sports and electronics. His love of sports earned him an athletic scholarship at the College of William and Mary. In his senior year he was named an All-American football receiver honorable mention.  Walter graduated in 1937 with a degree in Physics.  He lettered in football, baseball, basketball and track and field.  For his athletic accomplishments he was named to the William & Mary Sports Hall of Fame in 1969.
Walter went on to earn a master’s degree in physics and mathematics from the University of Florida in 1939. After college Walter played semi-professional football for the Richmond Arrows in the short lived Dixie league a predecessor to the National Football League.

Betty Virginia Carter was born in Hoboken, New Jersey in 1919.  She met Walter while attending the College of William and Mary.  She graduated in 1940 with a degree in Liberal Arts.  She started her career in publishing in New
York City and eventually she and Walter married and moved to San Diego in 1951.  She worked at Cubic Corporation when it was founded helping to support her husband’s new company.  Walter and Betty had two children, Walter C. Zable and Karen Cox.  Betty died in 2007.
With the success of Cubic Corporation over the years, Walter and Betty Zable became very involved with philanthropy. They contributed too many local San Diego based and national charities over the years with an emphasis on science, athletics and supporting those in need.
In 1990, Walter and Betty Zable donated $10 million to the College of William & Mary for scholarships, graduate student aid and other programs. In support of the donation the college renamed its football stadium the Walter J. Zable football stadium.
In June of 2005 the City of San Diego recognized the Zable contributions to the community and technology by declaring “Walter J. Zable Day” in his honor. Upon his passing, in 2012 the United States Congress lowered the Capital flag to half mass and Governor Jerry Brown declared “Walter J.  Zable Day” in the state of California.

FAMOUS FOOTBALL PLAYER’S LAST PLAY MAKES LASTING IMPRESSION
Walter J. Zable grew up in South Boston during the Great Depression. Life was hard, times were tough and sports gave him the chance to go to college and a way to escape things that might have kept him from the life he was destined to lead.
“Sports put him through school and helped him make a bit of a living,” says his son, Walter C. Zable. “If it hadn’t been for sports, he probably wouldn’t have gone to college. That’s why he always had such an affinity for sports and why it was important to him to help other athletes.”
It was through sports that Zable made a tremendous difference at USD, where he served on the Board of Trustees from 1977 to 1996, where he endowed athletic scholarships and where the football field is named in his honor.
When Zable passed away last summer, at 97, USD learned that he and his late wife, Betty, had designated $6 million from their estate to support Torero Athletics and fund athletic scholarships.
“From the early days of Walter’s time on the Board of Trustees to the creation of the Sports Banquet to supporting multiple capital campaigns, Walter and Betty Zable and their family have graced USD with their generosity,” says Associate Vice President for Athletics Ky Snyder. “The Zable Men’s Basketball endowment and support of our most recent capital campaign ensures that the Zable family’s support of our student-athletes will live on in perpetuity.”
Zable is also remembered as a prominent engineer and entrepreneur. In 1951, Zable founded Cubic Corporation, an innovative electronics company that would grow rapidly from its humble beginnings in the family garage. Today, Cubic is a global market leader providing innovative solutions and services in the defense, security and transportation markets. It has a market cap of more than $1 billion.
“My mother was the company’s first secretary and I remember as a kid going into the garage and seeing guys soldering circuit boards and testing equipment,” says Walter C. Zable, Cubic’s executive chairman of the board. “My father didn’t think much of organizational charts. His management style was to give people the freedom to use their own imagination to design products.”
His parents established the Walter J. and Betty C. Zable Foundation in 1997. The foundation seeks to continue the legacy of the founders by encouraging and promoting health, science research, assisting programs that benefit youth, underprivileged individuals and sports-related activities, primarily in San Diego County.
Cubic also supported education programs and was a founding sponsor of the Greater San Diego Inner-City Games, which provides after-school sports and fitness, art and academic opportunities for students. Cubic also honored hundreds of scholar-athletes through the National Football Foundation and College Hall of Fame’s Walter J. Zable/San Diego Chapter.
For Zable, the focus always came back to sports and finding ways to help young people excel — at USD and throughout the community.
“The University of San Diego was lucky to have Walter Zable on our Board of Trustees for nearly 20 years,” says USD President Mary E. Lyons, PhD. “His legacy, generosity and vision will live on through our Toreros who, because of him, are making a difference in the world.”
Walter C. Zable says he and his wife, Stefanie, “embrace the legacy of the family and, together with the next generation of Zables, will focus on helping the youth — both in our communtiy and globally.” — Krystn Shrieve

                by Jim Ducibella
                 | 
                June 27, 2012Walter J. Zable ’37 may have been one of San Diego’s most influential citizens, but his mind and his heart were never far from Williamsburg and William & Mary, especially Tribe athletics.Zable, whose $10 million pledge to the College prompted the Board of Visitors to name the Tribe’s football stadium in his honor in 1990, died Saturday of natural causes at age 97. The family’s plans for a memorial service are pending.“Every college and university has a few graduates who are larger than life, whose accomplishments are simply extraordinary, and whose loyalty to their alma mater is the stuff of legend,” said President Taylor Reveley. “Walt Zable was such alumnus at the College of William & Mary. His alma mater salutes his marvelous life and mourns his loss. Zable Stadium stands in our midst as an enduring remembrance of the great Walt.”Zable, a Boston native, turned down a scholarship offer from Harvard to attend William & Mary, where he became an honorable mention All-American in football while also lettering in baseball, basketball and track.While at the College, he received a Bachelor's degree in physics and met his late wife of 65 years, Betty Virginia Carter Zable '40.Those academic and emotional ties to the school remained strong all of his life, even after he moved to California in the early 1940s.“Walt was one of the most respected men I ever met, a tremendous businessman and a great supporter of the College, especially the football program,” said Senior Associate Athletics Director for Development Bobby Dwyer. “He was always so very proud not only of his football career, but of his accomplishments in track. His generosity to the College, especially football, was remarkable. “Whether it was giving for scholarships, facilities, endowments, whatever -- he was always there. And he was so generous that he inspired others to give. He was an absolutely remarkable man, and it's a huge loss for the William & Mary community.”In 1949, he started his own business in his garage focused on microwave technology. The business later moved to an office in Point Loma, Cal., where the Cubic Corporation made its first profitable product, a gadget that measured the power of microwaves.Zable served as Cubic’s Chief Executive, Chairman and President until his passing. Today, Cubic employs 7,800 workers worldwide and posted $1.28 billion in revenue last year.Cubic is a leading maker of air and ground combat training systems for militaries around the world. It’s also the top maker of automatic fare payment systems for some of the world’s largest mass transit agencies and provides specialized mission support services ranging from communications to asset tracking to the Pentagon and other defense agencies.Over the years, however, Cubic was in and out of several businesses – in part because of Zable’s knack for finding poor performing firms and fixing them either with technology or management acumen. Cubic made the first electronic scoreboard, which was installed in a San Diego stadium in 1966. It developed automation technology for elevators, eliminating the need for elevator staff. It built an electronic voting records system five decades ago. “Walt Zable was a professional-level athlete, a brilliant and curious student, a business visionary, an exceedingly generous philanthropist,” said Athletic Director Terry Driscoll. “He was closely connected to the College his entire life.“He was a friend from the first time we met. I will miss his wonderfully entertaining personality and sharp sense of humor. William & Mary athletics and the College have lost one of their greatest student-athletes, alumni and benefactors.”Among his many outside interests, Zable held directorships at the National Football Foundation, the College Hall of Fame and was on the advisory board of the San Diego Hall of Champions.That passion for athletics permeated many of his relationships at his alma mater.“I had a wonderful relationship with Walt," said football coach Jimmye Laycock. "I'd give him a call to let him know what was going on. He always wanted to know if I was teaching the guys to tackle better. He was extremely supportive of the program -- not only what we were accomplishing but how we were achieving it. He was very, very proud of that."  Laycock escorted Zable through the Laycock Center during the dedication of the building in June of 2008 and said Zable regaled him with tales of his days at the College and how things were done back then. Zable also was friends with former San Diego Chargers coach Sid Gillman, one of football's greatest innovators, and occasionally shared some of those conversations with the Tribe coach.   "He knew his football, and he was always interested in what was happening here,” Laycock said. “I really enjoyed him, getting to know him, talking to him. I'll miss him. He was a great guy."Zable leaves behind his son, Walter C. Zable and his wife Stefanie, daughter Karen and her husband Carter M. Cox, and five granddaughters.The San Diego Union-Tribune contributed to this story.

He was the founder, chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of Cubic Corporation, a public corporation providing military defense equipment and automated fare collection equipment. At the time of Zable's death, he was the world's oldest public company CEO and Cubic was worth 1.28 billion dollars.[1] Earlier in his life he had played semi-professional football for the Richmond Arrows in the Dixie League. Some sources also mention him as having played for the National Football League's New York Giants, although no official Giants records exist of his having played for the team.Contents1 Early life and college2 Post college2.1 Football and business careers2.2 Philanthropy2.3 Death3 Awards and honors4 References5 External linksEarly life and collegeWalter J. Zable was born in Los Angeles, California.[2] However, he grew up in Boston, Massachusetts during the Great Depression while his father worked as a mill worker.[2] Before Zable even reached high school he had already taken a keen interest in electronics.[2] During the daytime he would work on his athletic ability—specifically his football, baseball and track and field prowess—and at nighttime he was enrolled in Boston Trade School where he would take classes at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Wentworth Institute of Technology.[2] Years later Zable recounted that "electronics and athletics were [his] life."[2] He graduated from high school in 1933.Zable earned a full athletic scholarship to the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia.[3] He chose William & Mary over Harvard University which was much closer to home and also offered him an academic scholarship.[1] Zable suited up for the Indians football team from 1934 through 1936.[4] He enjoyed success on the gridiron and earned honorable mention All-America accolades his senior year.[4] In addition to football, Zable also lettered in baseball, basketball, and track and field.[4]Post collegeFootball and business careersShortly after graduating college in 1937 with a Bachelor of Science degree in physics, Zable played semi-professional football.[2][3] He played for the Richmond Arrows in the short-lived Dixie League.[3] After a year of playing football, he enrolled in the University of Florida Graduate School and earned his Master of Science degree in physics in 1939.[2] Zable then moved on to business. Prior to starting Cubic Corporation in 1951, Zable worked for Sperry Gyroscope Company, Federal Telecommunications Laboratories of ITT, Flight Research Company, and Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company.[5] Along the way he married his first wife, Betty Virginia (Carter) Zable, and then they moved to southern California.[2] He began Cubic Corporation in 1951 to launch his first product, a device used to measure and test microwave output.[2] Over the next six decades, Zable would expand Cubic Corporation into a billion dollar-plus engineering giant that employs approximately 8,000 people worldwide.[3]PhilanthropyWalter J. Zable and his late wife, Betty Virginia Zable, were philanthropists as well. In 1990, for instance, they donated $10 million to their alma mater, The College of William & Mary, and in return the college named their football stadium after him.[6] Back in 1971, he "established the Walter J. Zable/San Diego Chapter of the National Football Foundation and College Hall of Fame (NFFCHF) to help preserve the genuine sportsmanship and integrity exhibited in high school and college football," according to an official San Diego City Council proclamation in honor of his 90th birthday.[3] Players such as Junior Seau and Mark Malone benefited directly from this NFF chapter.[3] Recognizing his contribution to both athletics and his fellow man, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) bestowed him with the Theodore Roosevelt Award in 1987, which is the highest honor the NCAA confers.[3] Past winners include George H. W. Bush, Bill Cosby, and Bob Dole.DeathOn June 23, 2012, Zable died at age 97 from natural causes.[4] At the time of his death he was survived by his son Walter C. Zable, daughter Karen (Zable) Cox, and five grandchildren.[1] He was the world's oldest public company CEO and Cubic was worth 1.28 billion dollars.[1]Awards and honorsSports Illustrated Silver Anniversary All-American Football Team (1962)[6]William & Mary Sports Hall of Fame (1969)[3]San Diego Chapter of the National Football Foundation Distinguished American Award (1979)[4]Theodore Roosevelt Award (1987)[6]Honored with a "Walter J.

Cubic Corporation bio


Walter Joseph Zable (June 17, 1915 – June 23, 2012) was an American businessman, entrepreneur, semi-professional football player and standout college athlete. He was the founder, chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of Cubic Corporation, a public corporation providing military defense equipment and automated fare collection equipment. At the time of Zable's death, he was the world's oldest public company CEO and Cubic was worth 1.28 billion dollars.[1] Earlier in his life he had played semi-professional football for the Richmond Arrows in the Dixie League. Some sources also mention him as having played for the National Football League's New York Giants, although no official Giants records exist of his having played for the team.

Early life and college[edit]
Walter J. Zable was born in Los Angeles, California.[2] However, he grew up in Boston, Massachusetts during the Great Depression while his father worked as a mill worker.[2] Before Zable even reached high school he had already taken a keen interest in electronics.[2] During the daytime he would work on his athletic ability—specifically his football, baseball and track and field prowess—and at nighttime he was enrolled in Boston Trade School where he would take classes at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Wentworth Institute of Technology.[2] Years later Zable recounted that "electronics and athletics were [his] life."[2] He graduated from high school in 1933.
Zable earned a full athletic scholarship to the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia.[3] He chose William & Mary over Harvard University which was much closer to home and also offered him an academic scholarship.[1] Zable suited up for the Indians football team from 1934 through 1936.[4] He enjoyed success on the gridiron and earned honorable mention All-America accolades his senior year.[4] In addition to football, Zable also lettered in baseball, basketball, and track and field.[4]
Post college[edit]
Football and business careers[edit]
Shortly after graduating college in 1937 with a Bachelor of Science degree in physics, Zable played semi-professional football.[2][3] He played for the Richmond Arrows in the short-lived Dixie League.[3] After a year of playing football, he enrolled in the University of Florida Graduate School and earned his Master of Science degree in physics in 1939.[2] Zable then moved on to business. Prior to starting Cubic Corporation in 1951, Zable worked for Sperry Gyroscope Company, Federal Telecommunications Laboratories of ITT, Flight Research Company, and Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company.[5] Along the way he married his first wife, Betty Virginia (Carter) Zable, and then they moved to southern California.[2] He began Cubic Corporation in 1951 to launch his first product, a device used to measure and test microwave output.[2] Over the next six decades, Zable would expand Cubic Corporation into a billion dollar-plus engineering giant that employs approximately 8,000 people worldwide.[3]
Philanthropy[edit]
Walter J. Zable and his late wife, Betty Virginia Zable, were philanthropists as well. In 1990, for instance, they donated $10 million to their alma mater, The College of William & Mary, and in return the college named their football stadium after him.[6] Back in 1971, he "established the Walter J. Zable/San Diego Chapter of the National Football Foundation and College Hall of Fame (NFFCHF) to help preserve the genuine sportsmanship and integrity exhibited in high school and college football," according to an official San Diego City Council proclamation in honor of his 90th birthday.[3] Players such as Junior Seau and Mark Malone benefited directly from this NFF chapter.[3] Recognizing his contribution to both athletics and his fellow man, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) bestowed him with the Theodore Roosevelt Award in 1987, which is the highest honor the NCAA confers.[3] Past winners include George H. W. Bush, Bill Cosby, and Bob Dole.
Death[edit]
On June 23, 2012, Zable died at age 97 from natural causes.[4] At the time of his death he was survived by his son Walter C. Zable, daughter Karen (Zable) Cox, and five grandchildren.[1] He was the world's oldest public company CEO and Cubic was worth 1.28 billion dollars.[1]
Awards and honors[edit]

William & Mary Sports Hall of Fame (1969)[3]
San Diego Chapter of the National Football Foundation Distinguished American Award (1979)[4]

Cubic Corporation bio


Walter Joseph Zable (June 17, 1915 – June 23, 2012) was an American businessman, entrepreneur, semi-professional football player and standout college athlete. He was the founder, chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of Cubic Corporation, a public corporation providing military defense equipment and automated fare collection equipment. At the time of Zable's death, he was the world's oldest public company CEO and Cubic was worth 1.28 billion dollars.[1] Earlier in his life he had played semi-professional football for the Richmond Arrows in the Dixie League. Some sources also mention him as having played for the National Football League's New York Giants, although no official Giants records exist of his having played for the team.

Early life and college[edit]
Walter J. Zable was born in Los Angeles, California.[2] However, he grew up in Boston, Massachusetts during the Great Depression while his father worked as a mill worker.[2] Before Zable even reached high school he had already taken a keen interest in electronics.[2] During the daytime he would work on his athletic ability—specifically his football, baseball and track and field prowess—and at nighttime he was enrolled in Boston Trade School where he would take classes at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Wentworth Institute of Technology.[2] Years later Zable recounted that "electronics and athletics were [his] life."[2] He graduated from high school in 1933.
Zable earned a full athletic scholarship to the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia.[3] He chose William & Mary over Harvard University which was much closer to home and also offered him an academic scholarship.[1] Zable suited up for the Indians football team from 1934 through 1936.[4] He enjoyed success on the gridiron and earned honorable mention All-America accolades his senior year.[4] In addition to football, Zable also lettered in baseball, basketball, and track and field.[4]
Post college[edit]
Football and business careers[edit]
Shortly after graduating college in 1937 with a Bachelor of Science degree in physics, Zable played semi-professional football.[2][3] He played for the Richmond Arrows in the short-lived Dixie League.[3] After a year of playing football, he enrolled in the University of Florida Graduate School and earned his Master of Science degree in physics in 1939.[2] Zable then moved on to business. Prior to starting Cubic Corporation in 1951, Zable worked for Sperry Gyroscope Company, Federal Telecommunications Laboratories of ITT, Flight Research Company, and Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company.[5] Along the way he married his first wife, Betty Virginia (Carter) Zable, and then they moved to southern California.[2] He began Cubic Corporation in 1951 to launch his first product, a device used to measure and test microwave output.[2] Over the next six decades, Zable would expand Cubic Corporation into a billion dollar-plus engineering giant that employs approximately 8,000 people worldwide.[3]
Philanthropy[edit]
Walter J. Zable and his late wife, Betty Virginia Zable, were philanthropists as well. In 1990, for instance, they donated $10 million to their alma mater, The College of William & Mary, and in return the college named their football stadium after him.[6] Back in 1971, he "established the Walter J. Zable/San Diego Chapter of the National Football Foundation and College Hall of Fame (NFFCHF) to help preserve the genuine sportsmanship and integrity exhibited in high school and college football," according to an official San Diego City Council proclamation in honor of his 90th birthday.[3] Players such as Junior Seau and Mark Malone benefited directly from this NFF chapter.[3] Recognizing his contribution to both athletics and his fellow man, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) bestowed him with the Theodore Roosevelt Award in 1987, which is the highest honor the NCAA confers.[3] Past winners include George H. W. Bush, Bill Cosby, and Bob Dole.
Death[edit]
On June 23, 2012, Zable died at age 97 from natural causes.[4] At the time of his death he was survived by his son Walter C. Zable, daughter Karen (Zable) Cox, and five grandchildren.[1] He was the world's oldest public company CEO and Cubic was worth 1.28 billion dollars.[1]

Cubic Corporation bio


Walter Joseph Zable (June 17, 1915 – June 23, 2012) was an American businessman, entrepreneur, semi-professional football player and standout college athlete. He was the founder, chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of Cubic Corporation, a public corporation providing military defense equipment and automated fare collection equipment. At the time of Zable's death, he was the world's oldest public company CEO and Cubic was worth 1.28 billion dollars.[1] Earlier in his life he had played semi-professional football for the Richmond Arrows in the Dixie League. Some sources also mention him as having played for the National Football League's New York Giants, although no official Giants records exist of his having played for the team.

Early life and college[edit]
Walter J. Zable was born in Los Angeles, California.[2] However, he grew up in Boston, Massachusetts during the Great Depression while his father worked as a mill worker.[2] Before Zable even reached high school he had already taken a keen interest in electronics.[2] During the daytime he would work on his athletic ability—specifically his football, baseball and track and field prowess—and at nighttime he was enrolled in Boston Trade School where he would take classes at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Wentworth Institute of Technology.[2] Years later Zable recounted that "electronics and athletics were [his] life."[2] He graduated from high school in 1933.
Zable earned a full athletic scholarship to the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia.[3] He chose William & Mary over Harvard University which was much closer to home and also offered him an academic scholarship.[1] Zable suited up for the Indians football team from 1934 through 1936.[4] He enjoyed success on the gridiron and earned honorable mention All-America accolades his senior year.[4] In addition to football, Zable also lettered in baseball, basketball, and track and field.[4]
Post college[edit]
Football and business careers[edit]
Shortly after graduating college in 1937 with a Bachelor of Science degree in physics, Zable played semi-professional football.[2][3] He played for the Richmond Arrows in the short-lived Dixie League.[3] After a year of playing football, he enrolled in the University of Florida Graduate School and earned his Master of Science degree in physics in 1939.[2] Zable then moved on to business. Prior to starting Cubic Corporation in 1951, Zable worked for Sperry Gyroscope Company, Federal Telecommunications Laboratories of ITT, Flight Research Company, and Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company.[5] Along the way he married his first wife, Betty Virginia (Carter) Zable, and then they moved to southern California.[2] He began Cubic Corporation in 1951 to launch his first product, a device used to measure and test microwave output.[2] Over the next six decades, Zable would expand Cubic Corporation into a billion dollar-plus engineering giant that employs approximately 8,000 people worldwide.[3]
Philanthropy[edit]
Walter J. Zable and his late wife, Betty Virginia Zable, were philanthropists as well. In 1990, for instance, they donated $10 million to their alma mater, The College of William & Mary, and in return the college named their football stadium after him.[6] Back in 1971, he "established the Walter J. Zable/San Diego Chapter of the National Football Foundation and College Hall of Fame (NFFCHF) to help preserve the genuine sportsmanship and integrity exhibited in high school and college football," according to an official San Diego City Council proclamation in honor of his 90th birthday.[3] Players such as Junior Seau and Mark Malone benefited directly from this NFF chapter.[3] Recognizing his contribution to both athletics and his fellow man, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) bestowed him with the Theodore Roosevelt Award in 1987, which is the highest honor the NCAA confers.[3] Past winners include George H. W. Bush, Bill Cosby, and Bob Dole.
Death[edit]
On June 23, 2012, Zable died at age 97 from natural causes.[4] At the time of his death he was survived by his son Walter C. Zable, daughter Karen (Zable) Cox, and five grandchildren.[1] He was the world's oldest public company CEO and Cubic was worth 1.28 billion dollars.[1]
