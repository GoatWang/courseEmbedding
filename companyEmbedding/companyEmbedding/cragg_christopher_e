Christopher Cragg
















Hi, I'm Chris!





                You can call me Christopher or Chris or even
                
                “Oi, you” which usually works. I’m an Englishman
                
                in Canada looking for something to write about,
                
                stories to tell and donuts to eat.
            

                With nearly a decade of experience as a writer, sub-editor, online editor, 
                
                proofreader and copywriter, I live for creating eye-bulgingly good content.
            

                I’ve had the pleasure throughout my career to tell some big brand stories for
                
                Nike, Net-A-Porter, Mr Porter, Dom Perignon, National Geographic and many
                
                others. YEEZY sneakers, Riccardo Tisci, Manchester City FC or orangutan
                
                sanctuaries in Borneo – I’m happy to cover any topic, big or small and I’m
                
                always excited to work outside of my comfort zone (which is pretty big tbh).
                
                Send it my way and I’ll have something to say.
            

                Aside from writing, I’m into scriptwriting, film, design, social media
                
                (20k followers on Instagram and rising), weightlifting, exploring Canada
                
                and donuts. But mostly donuts. The motto I usually live my day by is
                
                “are you going to finish that?” but what’s more appropriate in this
                
                particular case is my other motto – “There’s no harm in trying.”
            

                Still with me? SMASHING.
                

                    Email me
                ,
                
                    call me

                        of London, Riccardo Tisci and several independent
                        London sneaker retailers.                            











                                ANHEUSER-BUSCH                            

                                Working closely with Anheuser-Busch, 
                        I was tasked to create promotional copy, 
                        competitions and advertorials focussing on 
                        new attractions and events at several of their 
                        theme parks in Florida including Sea World 
                        and Aquatica. It was a pleasure helping to elevate 
                        the profiles of these exciting parks by 
                        creating competitions, quizzes and interactive 
                        editorial for young readers.                            











                                MIND GYM                            

                                A regular client of mine, Mind Gym help
                        organizations and businesses all over the
                        world by applying the latest psychology to
                        effect change, build relationships and improve
                        performance with bite-size learning packages.
                        I regularly proof read their materials and
                        promotional copy before they go to print.                            











                                NATIONAL TELEVISION AWARDS                            

                                Britain’s leading TV awards launched their
                        web presence in 2011 and I was taken on
                        as content editor for their entertainment
                        news blog. Creating a digital strategy to
                        support ticket sales and generate excitement
                        about the show and nominees, I sourced
                        news stories, competitions and fed exclusive
                        announcements and give-aways through their
                        newly-launched social media channels.                            











                                SEGA                            

                                Throughout my career working across
                        children’s magazines and websites, I regularly
                        worked with SEGA, creating advertorial
                        features and copy packed with puzzles, facts
                        and content to support campaigns for their
                        game titles and book releases.                            















                                DOM PÉRIGNON                            

                                To celebrate Dom Pérignon’s collaboration with 
                        renowned artist, Jeff Koons, Claridge’s Hotel
                        in London transformed one of its boutiques
                        into an interactive exhibition for the special
                        release. Working with Hotel Creative, I created all
                        of the copy for the installation, along with
                        a collectable booklet, Dom Pérignon,

                                Buildable boardgame fun! Working closely with
                        one of the most famous toy companies in the
                        world, I created advertorial features and copy
                        to promote the campaign for their new line of
                        board games that you build, play and change.

                                An award-winning, multi-platform media business
                        that creates special interest content with over
                        one million active subscribers to their websites
                        and magazines. I worked across several of their
                        pre-school titles from the BBC as a sub-editor
                        creating engaging and eye-popping content.                            











                                HASBRO                            

                                Creating content for children’s titles meant that
                        I got to work closely with some of the biggest
                        brands in the world. For Hasbro I created
                        promotional copy, advertorials and competitions
                        targeted at young readers to engage them with
                        the brand and create interest in their latest and
                        most popular products.

                                In early 2015 I worked closely with this leading
                        global healthcare communications agency to
                        edit and manage all content for the launch of
                        a new micro site which acted as a resource for
                        surgeons looking for information on post-surgical
                        techniques and recovery practices.

                                Australian luxury swimwear brand Triangl,
                        produces practical, bright, neoprene swimwear
                        that’s popular among celebrities hitting the beach.
                        Working with Hotel Creative, I was
                        given the job of creating their brand manifesto for
                        their summer 2015 launch, encapsulating
                        the care-free, effortlessly cool, endless
                        summer their customers are looking for.

                                In late 2013 I worked with the Insurance
                        Bureau of Canada creating editorial schedules
                        for their 2014 digital strategy, sharing news
                        and promotional opportunities across all
                        available social media platforms.

                                Launched in 2011 by Net-a-Porter following
                        the success of the online luxury retailer for
                        women, Mr Porter is now the global online retailer
                        for luxury brands for men. With over
                        180 of the world’s leading brands on their
                        site, I freelanced for most of 2015 as online
                        product sub-editor on their editorial team
                        ensuring all content on the e-commerce side
                        was presented correctly and on brand prior
                        to their twice-weekly updates.
