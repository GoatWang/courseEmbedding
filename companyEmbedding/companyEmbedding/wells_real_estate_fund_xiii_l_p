History

At age 23, Leo Wells syndicated his first piece of real estate, a 1,000-acre piece of timberland in North Georgia. Though some people thought he sold the property too soon, Leo ended up avoiding an ensuing real estate downturn. The subsequent buyers could not hold on to the land. Later, Leo bought and resold it for an even larger profit.For the next 10 years, Leo succeeded in all areas of the business – sales, acquisitions, leasing, management, and dispositions – and became a Life Member of the Atlanta Board of Realtors Million Dollar Club. In 1976, he founded Wells & Associates, a real estate brokerage and investment firm, licensed in five Southeastern states. Two years later, Leo introduced a series of private real estate funds, becoming one of the leading real estate brokers in Atlanta by the end of the decade. In 1984, he founded Wells Real Estate Funds. Leo would go on to become a pioneer in the nontraded real estate investment trust (REIT) industry and one of the largest purchasers of office real estate in the United States. Through his company, Leo also has built a lasting legacy of corporate citizenship built on the creed of Glorifying God and Caring for People. In just the past decade:Wells has been recognized seven times as one of Atlanta's Best Places to Work by the Atlanta Business Chronicle, and the company took the top honor among mid-sized companies in 2009Wells employees have contributed thousands of dollars, donations, and hours to dozens of local charities during the company's semi-annual "Let's Make a Difference Day" events In 2006, Wells was named one of The Principal® 10 Best Companies for Employee Financial SecurityIn 2009, Wells was presented with the ProPatria award by Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve (ESGR), an agency of the U.S. Department of Defense, for the company's policies toward employees serving in the National Guard and Reserve – the ProPatria award is the Defense Department's highest state-level awardIn 2009, Wells also earned the Patriot Award from ESGR for the company's support of the National Guard and Reserve

aggregate of all Capital Contributions (or the Agreed Value
thereof) made by each Venturer pursuant to Subsection 3.1 hereof,
and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of all
Capital Contributions (or the Agreed Value thereof) made by all of
the Venturers pursuant to Subsection 3.1 hereof. Each
Venturer’s interest in the Venture shall always be
proportional to its Capital Contributions.
 

Each Venturer (the “First
Venturer”) does hereby agree to indemnify and hold the other
Venturer (the “Second Venturer”) harmless from and
against any claim, action, liability, loss, damage, cost or
expense, including, without limitation, attorney’s fees and
expenses incurred by the Second Venturer by reason of (i) any act
or omission of the First Venturer in connection with the operation
of the Venture and the Properties, or (ii) the claims made by third
parties to the extent that the Second Venturer’s percentage
share of the total liability, loss, damage, cost or expense
incurred by the Venture and the Venturers in connection with such
claims exceeds its Distribution Percentage Interest at the time
such liability, loss, damage, cost or expense is suffered or
incurred. Upon dissolution, each Venturer shall look solely to the
assets of the Venture for the return of its investment, and if the
Venture Property remaining after payment or discharge of the debts
and liabilities of the Venture, including debts and liabilities
owed to one or more of the Venturers, is insufficient to return the
aggregate Capital Contributions of each Venturer, such Venturers
shall have no recourse against the Venture or any other
Venturer.
 

3.3 Allocations and
Distributions . Allocations for accounting purposes and for
federal, state and local income tax purposes of each item of
income, loss, deduction and gain, and distributions of Net Cash
Flow and Extraordinary Receipts shall be allocated among the
Venturers as follows:
 

(a) Allocation of Tax Items .
For federal, state and local income tax purposes and for purposes
of maintaining the Venturers’ Capital Accounts, except as
otherwise provided herein, each item of income, gain, loss and
deduction of the Venture for each tax year shall be allocated to
the Venturers in accordance with their Distribution Percentage
Interests.
 

(b) Net Cash Flow . All
distributions of Net Cash Flow shall be made to the Venturers in
accordance with each such Venturer’s Distribution Percentage
Interest and shall be made at such intervals as may be approved by
the Venturers, but in no event less frequently than
quarterly.
 

(c) Extraordinary Receipts .
Distributions of Extraordinary Receipts shall be made as
follows:
 

(i) Distributions Not in
Connection With Dissolution . Distribution of Extraordinary
Receipts not generated in connection with an event of dissolution
shall be made as follows: first , to the establishment of
any reserve approved by the Venturers; and second , to the
Venturers based on their respective Distribution Percentage
Interests.
 

(ii) Distributions in Connection
With Dissolution . Distribution of Extraordinary Receipts
generated in connection with an event of dissolution (as well as
the other assets of the Venture) shall be made as follows:
first , to the payment of debts and liabilities of the
Venture to creditors (including all mortgages, but excluding any
other debts or liabilities to Venturers or affiliates of
Venturers), and to the expenses of liquidation; second , to
the establishment of such reserves as the Venturers may deem
reasonably necessary for contingent or unforeseen liabilities or
obligations of the Venture, which may be held in escrow for a
reasonable period of time and then distributed pursuant to the
remainder of this Subsection; third , to the repayment of
any remaining debts and obligations of the Venture to the Venturers
or affiliates of the Venturers; and fourth , to the
Venturers in accordance with the positive balances in their
respective Capital Accounts.
 

(d) Compliance with Section
704(c) . To comply with Section 704(c) of the I.R.C., items of
income, gain, loss, depreciation and cost recovery deductions
attributable to Contributed Property shall be allocated for federal
income tax purposes among the Venturers in the manner provided
under Section 704(c) of the




I.R.C. taking into account the
variation, if any, between the Agreed Value of such Property and
its adjusted tax basis at the time of contribution.
 

(e) Qualified Income Offset .
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein, in
the event that any Venturer receives an adjustment, allocation or
distribution described in Treasury Regulations Sections
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), (5) or (6) which causes a deficit balance
in such Venturer’s Capital Account, such Venturer will be
allocated items of income or gain (consisting of a pro rata portion
of each item of partnership income, including gross income, and
gain for such year) in an amount and manner sufficient to eliminate
such deficit balance as quickly as possible, all in accordance with
Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d). (It is the
intent of the Venturers that the foregoing provision constitute a
“Qualified Income Offset,” as defined in Treasury
Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d), and the foregoing
provision shall in all events be interpreted so as to constitute a
valid “Qualified Income Offset.”)
 

3.4 Income Taxes and
Accounting.
 

(a) Income Tax Returns . All
income tax returns of the Venture shall be prepared on an accrual
basis (except to the extent as may otherwise be Approved by all
Venturers or be required by law, statute or regulation governing
such tax and returns).
 

(b) Elections . Any provision
of this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, solely for
federal income tax purposes, each of the Venturers hereby
recognizes that the Venture will be subject to all provisions of
Subchapter K of Chapter 1 of Subtitle A of the I.R.C.; provided,
however, that the filing of U.S. Partnership Returns of Income
shall not be construed to extend the purposes of the Venture or
expand the obligations or liabilities of the Venturers. The Venture
shall file an election under Section 754 of the I.R.C. only in the
event of a transfer or proposed transfer by any one or more
Venturers of all or any part of their interest or interests in the
Venture to any Entity. Such election shall be filed by the Venture
upon the request of any Venturer made with respect to the income
tax return for the period which includes the date of transfer of
such interest in the Venture; such request shall be in writing and
shall be made not less than 60 days prior to the initial date
established by law for filing such income tax return.
 

(c) Fiscal Year . The Venture
shall operate on a calendar year basis.
 

(d) Books of Account . The
books of account of the Venture and the Venturer’s Properties
shall be kept and maintained at all times by the Administrative
Venturer or the delegated representative thereof at the principal
place of business of the Administrative Venturer. The books of
account shall be maintained on an accrual basis, unless otherwise
determined by the Administrative Venturer, in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied, and
shall show all items of income and expense relating to the Venture
and the Properties.
 

(e) Reports . The
Administrative Venturer shall cause to be prepared at the expense
of the Venture and furnished to each of the Venturers the
information and data with respect to the Venture during the Fiscal
Year as shall enable each Venturer on a timely basis to prepare or
cause to be prepared the reports required under their respective
partnership agreements to be made to their partners. In addition,
within 60 days after the end of each Fiscal Year, the
Administrative Venturer shall use its best efforts to cause to be
prepared and to deliver to each Venturer a report setting forth in
sufficient detail all such information and data with respect to
business transactions effected by or involving the Venture during
such Fiscal Year as shall enable the Venture and each Venturer to
prepare its federal, state and local income tax returns on a timely
basis in accordance with the laws, rules and regulations then
prevailing. The Administrative Venturer shall cause to be prepared
federal, state and local tax returns required of the Venture and
submit such returns to the Venturers no later than 30 days prior to
the date required for the filing thereof and shall file the
same.
 

(f) Records . Any Venturer
shall have the right at all reasonable times during
usual




business hours to audit, examine and
make copies of the books of account of the Venture. Such right may
be exercised through any agent or employee of such Venturer
designated by such Venturer or by an independent certified public
accountant designated by such Venturer. Any Venturer shall bear all
expenses incurred in any examination or audit made for such
Venturer’s account.
 

(g) Audits . In the event
that the Internal Revenue Service or any other governmental agency
with jurisdiction shall conduct, commence or give notification of
intent to conduct or commence any audit or other investigation of
the books, records, tax returns or other affairs of the Venture,
the Administrative Venturer shall immediately advise the Venturers
thereof by Notice. The Administrative Venturer shall be the
“tax matters partner,” as that term is defined by
I.R.C., if one is needed for the Venture.
 

3.5 Banking . Funds of the
Venture shall be deposited in an account or accounts of a type, in
form and name and in a bank or banks selected by the Administrative
Venturer. No funds other than Venture funds shall be deposited in
any such account. Withdrawals from bank accounts shall be made by
the Administrative Venturer and by such other parties as may be
designated by the Venturers.
 

4. MANAGEMENT.
 

4.1 Authority of Administrative
Venturer . The overall management and control of the business
and affairs of the Venture shall be vested in the Venturers,
collectively, acting by and through the Administrative Venturer.
The Administrative Venturer shall have responsibility for
establishing the policies and operating procedures with respect to
the business and affairs of the Venture and for making all
decisions, except as otherwise provided herein and except Major
Decisions, as to all matters which the Venture has authority to
perform, as fully as if the Venturers were themselves making such
decisions. All decisions, other than Major Decisions, with respect
to the management and control of the Venture made by the
