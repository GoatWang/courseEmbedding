 TFG invests substantially all its capital through a master fund, Tetragon Financial Group Master Fund Limited ("TFGMF"), in which it holds 100% of the issued non-voting shares.  In this report, unless otherwise stated, we report on the consolidated business incorporating TFG and TFGMF.  References to "we" are to Tetragon Financial Management LP, TFG's investment manager (the "Investment Manager").

 (iv)   
 TFG seeks to deliver 10-15% Fair Value RoE per annum to shareholders.  TFG's returns will most likely fluctuate with LIBOR.  LIBOR directly flows through some of TFG's investments and, as it can be seen as the risk-free short-term rate, it should affect all of TFG's investments.  In high-LIBOR environments, TFG should achieve higher sustainable returns; in low-LIBOR environments, TFG should achieve lower sustainable returns.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
TFG generated Fair Value earnings of $49.7 million in Q3 2016, giving an annualised Fair Value Return on Equity ("RoE") for the first nine months of the year of 6.4%.(4)
Fair Value NAV Per Share Total Return ("NAV Total Return")(5) grew 1.3% in Q3 2016 and 7.8% year to date through 30 September 2016.  As in the Half Yearly Report, we show a chart showing this metric since TFG's IPO at the end of this Executive Summary.
During Q3 2016, all asset classes were profitable.  Noteworthy positive performers were: CLO 1.0 investments, which had Fair Value Net Income ("Net Income")(6) of $20.6 million; equities (European event-driven and mining strategies) which had Net Income of $20.3 million; and a distressed fund investment which had Net Income of $9.9 million.
The third quarter dividend was declared at 16.75 cents per share, giving a 12-month rolling dividend growth of 3.9%.
During the third quarter, TFG increased the size of its revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility") from $75 million to $150 million with the addition of a second lender to the facility.
In September, TFG became a member of the Association of Investment Companies (AIC), the trade body for closed-ended investment companies.(7)
TFG also commissioned Edison Investment Research Limited to publish a report regarding the company, and we expect Edison to publish updates on a quarterly basis.(8)
In addition, TFG has a five-star Morningstar RatingTM from Morningstar, Inc. as of 30 September 2016.  The five-star rating relates to TFG's overall performance, as well as over three years and over five years.(9)
TFG intends to conduct a tender offer for a number of TFG non-voting shares with a maximum value of up to $50 million, to be held as treasury shares.  Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch will act as dealer manager in the tender offer, which will use a modified Dutch auction structure.  Details of this planned tender offer will be announced shortly.  A repurchase of TFG shares at a price below NAV will be accretive to Fully Diluted Fair Value NAV Per Share ("NAV Per Share").
Finally, TFG's next Investor Day will follow the release of its full year 2016 results, and thus is scheduled for 8 March 2017 in London.  More details on this event will follow in due course.

 (i) 
 Net Cash consists of: (1) cash held directly by Tetragon Financial Group Master Fund Limited, (2) excess margin held by brokers associated with assets held directly by Tetragon Financial Group Master Fund Limited, and (3) cash held in certain designated accounts related to TFG's investments, which may only be used for designated purposes without incurring significant tax and transfer costs, net of "Other Net Assets and Liabilities." 






 (ii) 
 Assets characterised as "Equities" consist of the Fair Value of investments in Polygon-managed equity funds as well as the Fair Value of, or capital committed to, equity assets (as applicable) held directly on TFG's balance sheet.  Please see Figure 12 for further details on asset composition.  




To achieve TFG's investment objective of generating distributable income and capital appreciation, TFG's current investment strategy is:

To identify attractive asset classes and investment strategies. 
To identify asset managers it believes to be superior. 
To use the market experience of TFM, TFG's investment manager, to negotiate favourable terms for its investments. 
Through TFG Asset Management, and where sensible, to seek to own all, or a portion, of asset management companies with which it invests in order to enhance the returns achieved on its capital.

In addition, TFM's current investment strategy is to continue to grow TFG Asset Management – as TFG's diversified alternative asset management business – with a view to a possible initial public offering and listing of its shares.
As part of its investment strategy, TFM may employ hedging strategies and leverage in seeking to provide attractive returns while managing risk.
The Investment Manager seeks to identify asset classes that offer excess returns relative to their investment risk, or "intrinsic alpha."  It analyses the risk/reward, correlation, duration and liquidity characteristics of each potential capital use to gauge its attractiveness and incremental impact on the Company.
The Investment Manager then seeks to find high-quality managers who invest in these asset classes; selects or structures suitable investment vehicles that optimise risk-adjusted returns for TFG's capital; and/or seeks for TFG (via TFG Asset Management) to own a share of the asset management company.  TFG aims to not only produce asset level returns, but also aims to enhance these returns with capital appreciation and investment income from its investments in asset management businesses that derive income from external investors.
Certain considerations when evaluating the viability of a potential asset manager typically include: performance track records, reputation, regulatory requirements, infrastructure needs and asset gathering capacity.  Potential profitability and scalability of the business are also important considerations.  Additionally, the core capabilities, investment focus and strategy of any new business should offer a complementary operating income stream to TFG Asset Management's existing businesses.  The Investment Manager looks to mitigate potential correlated risks across TFG Asset Management's investment managers by diversifying its exposure across asset classes, investment vehicles, durations, and investor types, among other factors.
TFG's asset management businesses can operate autonomously, or on the TFG Asset Management platform.  In either case, the objective is for them to benefit from an established infrastructure, which can assist in critical business management functions such as risk management, investor relations, financial control, technology, and compliance/legal matters, while maintaining entrepreneurial independence.

KEY METRICS
The Company focuses on the following key metrics prepared on a Fair Value(21) basis, when assessing how value is being created for, and delivered to, TFG shareholders:

Earnings: Fair Value Return on Equity and Fair Value EPS 
Fair Value NAV Per Share: NAV Per Share Total Return and NAV per share 
Dividends

EARNINGS – FAIR VALUE RETURN ON EQUITY
Annualised Fair Value RoE year to date through Q3 2016 was 6.4%.(22)
Although 2016 has so far proved to be a difficult environment in general for investment funds, TFG was pleased to continue to produce a positive set of results in the first three quarters, recording a Net Income(23) of $94.8 million.  This resulted in an annualised RoE of 6.4% for the first nine months of the year, an increase on the annualised RoE of 4.5% for H1 2016.
On a year-to-date basis, all investment classes across the portfolio have positively contributed to TFG's RoE.

Average RoE is calculated from TFG's IPO in 2007.  2015 RoE includes a fair value adjustment for certain TFG Asset Management businesses, the value of which has accumulated over several years.  Consequently, the full year return of 14.5% is not prepared on a like for like basis with prior years.  Like for like performance for 2015 was 8.2%.
FAIR VALUE EARNINGS PER SHARE ("EPS")
TFG generated a Fair Value EPS(24) of $1.02 year to date through Q3 2016
The Fair Value Net Income of $94.8 million resulted in an EPS of $1.02.  The EPS of $0.55 generated in Q3 2016 represents a significant increase over the aggregate EPS result of $0.47 for the first two quarters of 2016.  As detailed in last quarter's report, the 2016 EPS continues to significantly trail the results from the same period last year, reflecting not only the generally adverse and volatile conditions in 2016, but also some strong one-off contributions in 2015.(25)

FULLY DILUTED FAIR VALUE NAV PER SHARE
Fully Diluted Fair Value NAV Per Share ("NAV Per Share") is $20.05 at the end of Q3 2016.  NAV Total Return is 7.8% year to date through Q3 2016.

NAV Per Share increased significantly during the year as the positive impact from operating performance was boosted by an H1 2016 repurchase of 10 million shares for an all-in cost of $100.7 million. 
Although the share repurchase reduced net assets, by buying its shares at a discount to NAV, TFG increased the NAV Per Share by approximately $0.94. As noted in the Executive Summary, TFG intends to conduct another tender offer for a number of TFG non-voting shares with a maximum value of up to $50 million.

DIVIDENDS PER SHARE ("DPS") (26)
TFG's quarterly dividend was 16.75 cents per share for Q3 2016.

TFG declared a Q3 2016 dividend of $0.1675 per share, unchanged from Q2 2016. On a rolling 12-month basis, the dividend of $0.665 per share represents a 3.9% increase over the prior 12-month period and equates to an annualised dividend yield of 6.3% on the 30 September 2016 share price of $10.60. 


This dividend declaration continues TFG's progressive dividend policy, which targets a payout ratio of 30-50% of normalised earnings. The Q3 2016 DPS of $0.1675 brings the cumulative DPS declared since TFG's IPO to $4.585.

 (i) 
 "U.S. CLO 1.0" refers to U.S. CLOs issued before or during 2008.  "U.S. CLO 2.0" refers to U.S. CLOs issued after 2008.  The U.S. CLO 1.0 segment includes an investment in the BB tranche of a U.S. CLO 1.0 with Fair Value of $1.7 million. 






 (ii) 
 Assets characterised as "Other Equities" consist of the Fair Value of, or capital committed to, investment assets held directly on the balance sheet.  






 (iii) 
 The TFG Asset Management net income figure for 2015 includes the consolidated net income before tax of Polygon, LCM and Hawke's Point to 30 June 2015, and changes in the Fair Value of those investments from 1 July to 31 December 2015.  The income relating to investments in Equitix and GreenOak reflects the changes in the carrying value of these equity investments, and in the case of Equitix, interest income and changes in Fair Value connected to the loans held.  For Q3 2016 all calculations reflect the changes in fair value of all businesses owned by TFG Asset Management, and any net distributions made from them to TFG. 




Figure 12 above shows Fair Value Net Assets and Fair Value Net Income by asset class for Q3 2016 compared to 2015. 
CLOs

U.S. CLO 1.0: TFG's U.S. CLO 1.0 investments contributed $20.6 million in Fair Value Net Income over the third quarter of 2016, and $33.1 million year to date through the end of Q3 2016. We sold one position during Q3 2016 that generated $16.2 million in net income. The income on this U.S. CLO 1.0 investment was driven primarily by unrealised mark-to-market gains in equity assets received from various distressed workout securities reorganised during the 2008 credit crisis. We continue to monitor this amortizing segment of the portfolio for opportunities to monetise the Company's remaining investments. As of the end of Q3 2016, all of TFG's U.S. CLO 1.0 deals were passing their junior-most O/C tests.(27) 


U.S. CLO 2.0: TFG's U.S. CLO 2.0 investments produced $7.0 million in Fair Value Net Income during Q3 2016, and $30.7 million year to date through the end of Q3 2016. As stated in the past, we intend for our new issue CLO investment activity to occur primarily via the Tetragon Credit Income II L.P. ("TCI II") private equity vehicle, subject to market conditions and that vehicle's investment strategy. As of the end of Q3 2016, all of TFG's U.S. CLO 2.0 were in compliance with their junior-most O/C tests.(28) 


European CLOs: The European CLO segment of TFG's portfolio produced $2.3 million in Fair Value Net Income during Q3 2016, and $11.0 million year to date through the end of the quarter. Our European CLOs continue to amortise and the fair value of our positions have reduced by approximately 33% from the prior year-end. All of TFG's European CLOs were in compliance with their junior-most O/C tests as of the end of Q3 2016.(29) 


CLO Equity – TCI II: The Company's investment in TCI II produced $0.2 million of Fair Value Net Income during Q3 2016, and $0.4 million year to date through the end of the quarter. TCI II had made, or committed to make, investments with a total cost of $150.1 million through the end of Q3 2016. TFG's available undrawn capital commitment totalled $62.0 million.

EQUITIES

Equity Funds: Polygon's event-driven equity investments generated Fair Value Net Income of $9.0 million during Q3 2016 and $21.3 million year to date, with positive performance coming from investments in the Polygon European equity strategy, which was up 4.5% net during Q3, bringing year-to-date net performance to 9.8%. The Polygon mining equities fund was up 4.0% net in Q3 2016, and 16.7% net year to date. Please refer to page 23 for further details on the performance of the individual funds. 


Other Equities: These assets generated Fair Value Net Income of $11.3 million in Q3 2016 and $17.3 million year to date through the end of Q3 2016.

CREDIT

Convertible Fund: The Polygon convertible fund investment contributed Fair Value Net Income of $2.7 million during Q3 2016, and $4.8 million year to date. The Polygon Convertible strategy returned 5.0% net during Q3 2016, bringing year-to-date net performance to 9.3%. 


Distressed Fund: The Polygon distressed fund investment generated $9.9 million of Fair Value Net Income during Q3 2016, bringing the total to $10.1 million through the end of Q3 2016. The fund returned 9.2% net in Q3, bringing year-to-date net performance to 11.5%.

REAL ESTATE

Real Estate: TFG's investment in Real Estate contributed $4.3 million of Fair Value Net Income during Q3 2016, and $10.1 million year to date through the end of Q3 2016, reflecting a combination of realised and unrealised gains in certain investment vehicles.

TFG ASSET MANAGEMENT (privately-held securities in asset management business)

TFG Asset Management: TFG's investment in TFG Asset Management comprises a diverse portfolio of alternative asset managers. TFG Asset Management recorded Fair Value Net Income of $3.8 million during Q3 2016, and $1.9 million year to date through the end of Q3. After adjusting for FX hedging, TFG's investment in Equitix made a positive contribution year to date of approximately $14.0 million, reflecting the performance of this business. The value of TFG's investment in TCIP has also increased during the year as it continues to deliver against its business plan for its first vehicle, TCI II. TFG's investments in Polygon, GreenOak and LCM have all recorded unrealised losses during 2016, reflecting a combination of factors, including, in some cases, the application of less favourable market multiples or discount rates, and a more conservative view on elements of projected performance this year. We continue to believe that the underlying economics and momentum of these businesses remain positive, as measured by, among other things, EBITDA and AUM growth, as described in the TFG Asset Management section in this report. Please see Appendix IV for further information on the basis for determining the Fair Value of the TFG Asset Management investment. Additionally, please see Figure 16 for TFG Asset Management's pro forma operating results.

CASH AND BORROWINGS

Net Cash: TFG held $423.1 million of Fair Value net cash at 30 September 2016. The Company actively manages its cash levels to cover future commitments and to enable it to capitalise on opportunistic investments. 


Borrowings: As previously reported, in April 2016 TFG obtained its Revolving Credit Facility for an initial maximum facility amount of $75 million, with a stated maturity date of 1 April 2019. In August 2016, with the addition of a second lender to the facility, the maximum facility amount increased to $150 million. The drawdown as of quarter-end was $38.0 million and this is reflected as an adjustment to the net cash number disclosed above.(30)

Q3 2016 Major New Investments

CLO Equity – TCI II: During the third quarter, TFG made an additional capital commitment of $12.0 million to TCI II, bringing TFG's total capital commitments to $62.0 million. There have been no capital calls as of the end of Q3 2016. 


Real Estate: TFG made some additional capital contributions to existing investment programs across Europe, the U.S. and Asia. 


Equity Funds: In September, an additional $7.0 million subscription was made into the Polygon European Equity Fund. 


Direct Loans: A £3.0 million loan was made to GreenOak in connection with its acquisition of Grafton Advisors, a UK property adviser. See page 21 for further details.

Q3 2016 Major Asset Sales and Optional Redemptions 

U.S. CLOs: As mentioned above, TFG sold one U.S. CLO 1.0 equity investment during Q3 2016 realising gross proceeds of $33.0 million. Shortly after the end of the quarter, TFG initiated an optional early redemption of another U.S. CLO 1.0. 


Real Estate: During the third quarter, TFG realised $20.4 million in capital and income through distributions from a number of GreenOak managed investment programs, across Europe, the U.S. and Asia.

 (i) 
 This table includes the income and expenses attributable to TFG's majority owned businesses, Polygon, LCM and Equitix during that period.  In the case of Equitix this only covers the period from 2 February 2015, the date of the closing of TFG's acquisition of Equitix.  Although TFG currently has an 85% effective economic share of its business, 100% of Equitix's income and expenses are reflected with the 15% not attributable to TFG backed out through the minority interest line.  GreenOak is not included.  The EBITDA equivalent is a non-GAAP measure and is designed to reflect the operating performance of the TFG Asset Management businesses rather than what is reflected in TFG's U.S. GAAP financial statements. 






 (ii) 
 The performance and success fees include some realised and unrealised Polygon performance fees.  These represent the fees calculated by the applicable administrator of the relevant Polygon funds, in accordance with the applicable fund constitutional documents, when determining NAV at the reporting date.  Similar amounts, if any, from LCM are recognised when received.  TFG is generally able to invest at a preferred level of fees.  Success fees also include fees earned by Equitix on successfully completing certain primary projects and delivering de-risked investments into their secondary funds; these are recognised once they are entitled to recover them. 




 

Overview: Figure 16 shows a pro forma statement of operations that reflects the operating performance of the majority-owned asset management companies within TFG Asset Management. Although, under U.S. GAAP, they are currently reported partially at Fair Value and partially on a consolidated basis, the aim of also presenting the underlying performance in this way is to give investors insight into a key driver behind that valuation. GreenOak, in which TFG holds a minority interest, is not currently included in the calculation of pro forma EBITDA. 


EBITDA: During Q3 2016, TFG Asset Management's EBITDA was $12.8 million, resulting in a year-to-date 2016 EBITDA equivalent of $30.4 million. Whilst tracking below EBITDA for the equivalent period in 2015, the shortfall in 2016 has decreased from over $10.0 million at the end of H1 2016 to $3.5 million at the end of Q3 2016, with growth in performance and success fees driving this change. In addition, as was observed in the Half Yearly Report, management fees in 2016 now account for a greater percentage of total income than they did in the prior year. We believe that this is an indication of an improvement in the quality of the earnings year on year. 


Management fee income: Management fee income continued to increase year on year as shown in Figure 16. In particular, fee income generated in the Equitix business grew as capital was put to work (thereby earning full fees) and fee-paying AUM was increased in new fund vehicles. 


Performance and success fees: Performance and success fees have grown period on period, primarily reflecting the positive performance across the Polygon hedge funds, which has led to a marked increase in unrealised performance fees. The other main component of this category is primary fee income from the Equitix business, which is close to, but slightly behind the equivalent period in 2015. 


Other fee income: This category includes a number of different income streams, including third- party CLO management fee income relating to certain U.S. CLO 1.0 transactions. This stream continued to decline as expected as these transactions amortised down. In addition, this category includes certain cost recoveries from TFG relating to seeded Polygon hedge funds. The cost recoveries, which are described in more detail in the TFG Asset Management Overview section of this report, decreased year on year, although the teams supporting those seeded funds continued to grow. As these businesses mature and build third-party capital, we expect that such cost recoveries should decrease. The other fee income category also includes fee income generated by Equitix on certain management services contracts, which grew year on year. 


Operating expenses: This category of expenses was $14.9 million higher than the equivalent period in 2015, reflecting a number of different factors. Firstly, TCIP is a new and growing business which was not recording any material level of expenses during the comparable period in 2015. Secondly, Equitix continues to grow its business, including the management services segment, resulting in an increase in both costs as and revenues. Finally, TFG Asset Management continued to invest by increasing headcount in a number of areas, which will support any continued growth of the platform.

BUSINESS OVERVIEWS
The following pages provide a summary of each asset management business and a review of AUM growth and underlying strategy / investment vehicle performance during Q3 2016.

TFG owns 100% of LCM. 
Currently, LCM manages loan assets exclusively through CLOs, which are long-term, multi-year investment vehicles. The typical duration of a CLO, and thus LCM's management fee stream, depends on, among other things, the term of its reinvestment period (currently typically four to five years for a new issue CLO), the prepayment rate of the underlying loan assets, as well as post-reinvestment period reinvestment flexibility and weighted average life constraints. 
CLO managers typically earn a management fee of up to 0.50% of total assets, and a performance fee of 20% over a CLO equity IRR hurdle. 
Further information on LCM is available at www.lcmam.com.



 Amount of TFG's Investment in Products: 
 $217.2 million.TFG held CLO equity investments with total fair value of $210.9 million (all in U.S. CLO 2.0 deals) in LCM-managed CLOs.LCM provides expertise to the management of a portfolio of U.S. broadly-syndicated leveraged loans held directly on TFG's balance sheet.  At the end of Q3 2016, the fair value of these loans was $6.3 million.

 Note:  The AUM noted above includes investments in the relevant strategies by TFG, other than in respect of the Private Equity Vehicle, where there is no such investment.  The Private Equity vehicle, at the time of the Polygon transaction and currently, remains a closed investment strategy.  Past performance or experience (actual or simulated) does not necessarily give a guide for the future and no representation is being made that the funds listed will or are likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown.  Except as otherwise noted, all performance numbers provided herein reflect the actual net performance of the funds net of management and performance fees, as well as any commissions and direct expenses incurred by the funds, but before withholding taxes, and other indirect expenses.  All returns include the reinvestment of dividends, if any.  Differences in account size, timing of transactions and market conditions prevailing at the time of investment may lead to different results.  Differences in the methodology used to calculate performance may also lead to different performance results than those shown.P&L YTD in 2016 for the Private Equity Vehicle was ˗$32.6 million through to 30 September 2016 before FX movements of +$1.9 million.  P&L is +$119.9 million from closing date net asset value before FX movements of ˗$37.3 million.  The fund is generally precluded from hedging FX exposure.  The fund has made life to date distributions of $605 million to its partners.  The estimated approximate LTD multiple is based on the fund's quarter end net asset value and historical distributions and other returns over an original aggregate purchase price for the fund's initial assets of approximately $459 million and excludes the effects of FX and certain assets purchased through recycled capital.  The estimated approximate LTD multiple including those two items (FX and recycled capital) would be 1.82 x.  Each of these multiples will be different from the multiples reflected for specific limited partners in the fund, which would be calculated with respect to relevant class of partners in accordance with the fund's limited partnership agreement. 




EQUITIX




 Description of Business: 


Equitix is an integrated core infrastructure asset management and primary project platform. 
Equitix was established in 2007 and is based in London.

Fees in this product include a management fee and a carry interest fee that is over a hurdle currently set at 7.5%. The carried interest fee is typically 20% over the hurdle, and the management fee after the investment period is typically between 1.25% and 1.65%; during the investment period it ranges between 0.95% and 2.0% on invested capital. The core funds also have an additional fee on committed capital of approximately 0.30%.

TCIP and TCICM




 Description of Business: 


TCIP acts as a general partner of a private equity vehicle that, among other things, makes investments in CLOs relating to risk retention rules.(36) 
The business was established at the end of 2015 and is managed out of New York and London. 
TFG owns 100% of the business. 
TCIP currently acts as general partner of Tetragon Credit Income II L.P. ("TCI II"), which focuses on CLO investments relating to risk retention rules, including majority stakes in CLO equity tranches of transactions managed by LCM or sub-advised by third-party CLO managers. TCI II is structured with a management fee and carried interest over a preferred return (each on non-LCM investments). It has a multi-year investment period and a term of seven years (subject to potential extensions and otherwise as required by applicable regulatory requirements). 
TCI Capital Management LLC ("TCICM") is a specialist in below-investment grade U.S. broadly-syndicated leveraged loans. TCICM was established as a Delaware limited liability company in November 2015 and is a subsidiary of Tetragon Credit Income II L.P and recently commenced operations. It acts as a CLO collateral manager and sponsor for certain CLO investments. It utilises, and has access to, the TFG Asset Management platform, including personnel from Polygon Global Partners and LCM Asset Management LLC. 
Currently, TCICM manages loan assets exclusively through CLOs (which includes warehouse vehicles created in anticipation of future CLOs), which are long-term, multi-year investment vehicles. At this time, TCICM utilises, and expects to continue to utilise, the investment expertise of certain third-party sub-advisors to assist in the management of its CLOs. Such sub-advisors will typically earn a substantial portion of the management fees from the CLOs. 
CLO managers typically earn a management fee of up to 0.50% of total assets, and a performance fee of 20% over a CLO equity IRR hurdle. 
Further information on TCIP and TCICM is available at www.tetragoninv.com.



 Amount of TFG's Investment in Products: 
 $62.0 million of committed capital in TCI II. 


 Committed Capital and AUM: 
 TCI II had a third close in August 2016, bringing its total committed capital to $253.4 million.   TCI II invests in CLOs managed by LCM and TCICM.   As of 30 September 2016, TCICM had assets under management of $901.3 million. (i)   Includes, where relevant, investments from TCI II.  TCICM utilises, and expects to continue to utilise, the investment expertise of certain third-party sub-advisors to assist in the management of its CLOs.  Such sub-advisors will typically earn a substantial portion of the management fees from the CLOs. 


 Performance in Q3 2016: 
 During Q3 2016, TCI II made an investment in a majority stake in the equity tranche of TCI-Symphony CLO 2016-1 Ltd, a U.S. CLO managed by TCICM and sub-advised by a third party.  Additionally, TCI II made an initial commitment to invest in a majority stake in the equity tranche of LCM XXII Ltd, a U.S. CLO managed by LCM.  TCIP continues to evaluate investment opportunities for TCI II during its investment period.  Including a distribution made shortly after the end of Q3 2016, TCI II had made distributions of income of approximately $1.7 million to its limited partners.

    		              						            			  	 	The reconciliation on the table above shows the adjustments required to get from this measure of earnings to U.S. GAAP net income.   
   
Adjustment one takes into account a Fair Value adjustment of $6.8 million for Polygon, LCM, Hawke's Point and TCIP as if they were de-consolidated and held at Fair Value rather than consolidated as they currently are for U.S. GAAP purposes.  Further details are provided in Appendix IV. 
Adjustment two removes share-based compensation of $17.5 million as, under ASC 805, TFG is recognizing the value of the shares given in consideration for the Polygon transaction as compensation over the period in which they are vesting, as well as in relation to certain long-term compensation plans.  This mechanism and the future vesting schedule for all share-based compensation related shares are described in more detail in the 2016 TFG unaudited interim financial statements.  The long-term compensation plans are also detailed in Appendix VII.

APPENDICES
APPENDIX I
CERTAIN REGULATORY INFORMATION
This Performance Report is made public by means of a press release, which contains inside information within the meaning of Article 7(1) of the EU Market Abuse Regulation, and has been filed with the Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets (Autoriteit Financiële Markten).  In addition, this report is also made available to the public by way of publication on the TFG website (www.tetragoninv.com).
An investment in TFG involves substantial risks.  Please refer to the Company's website at www.tetragoninv.com for a description of the risks and uncertainties pertaining to an investment in TFG.
This release does not contain or constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase securities in the United States or any other jurisdiction.  The securities of TFG have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act"), as amended, and may not be offered or sold in the United States or to U.S. persons unless they are registered under applicable law or exempt from registration.  TFG does not intend to register any portion of its securities in the United States or to conduct a public offer of securities in the United States.  In addition, TFG has not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940, and investors will not be entitled to the benefits of such Act.  TFG is registered in the public register  of  the  Netherlands Authority  for  the  Financial Markets  under  Section  1:107  of  the FMSA as a collective investment scheme from a designated country.  
This release contains inside information within the meaning of Article 7(1) of the EU Market Abuse Regulation.
TFG shares (the "Shares") are subject to legal and other restrictions on resale and the Euronext Amsterdam N.V. and SFS trading markets are less liquid than other major exchanges, which could affect the price of the Shares.
There are additional restrictions on the resale of Shares by Shareholders who are located in the United States or who are U.S. persons and on the resale of Shares by any Shareholder to any person who is located in the United States or is a U.S. person.  These restrictions include that each Shareholder who is located in the United States or who is a U.S. person must be a "Qualified Purchaser" or a "Knowledgeable Employee" (each as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940), and, accordingly, that Shares may be resold to a person located in the United States or who is a U.S. person only if such person is a "Qualified Purchaser" or a "Knowledgeable Employee" under the Investment Company Act of 1940.  These restrictions may adversely affect overall liquidity of the Shares.
APPENDIX II
FAIR VALUE DETERMINATION OF CLO EQUITY INVESTMENTS
In accordance with the valuation policies set forth on TFG's website, the values of TFG's CLO equity  investments  are  determined  using  a  third-party  cash  flow  modelling  tool.  The  model contains certain assumption inputs that are reviewed and adjusted as appropriate to factor in how historic, current and potential market developments (examined through, for example, forward- looking observable data) might impact the performance of TFG's CLO equity investments.  Since this involves modelling, among other things, forward projections over multiple years, this is not an exercise in recalibrating future assumptions to the latest quarter's historical data.
Subject to the foregoing, when determining the U.S. GAAP-compliant Fair Value of TFG's portfolio, the Company seeks to derive a value at which market participants could transact in an orderly market and also seeks to benchmark the model inputs and resulting outputs to observable market data when available and appropriate.
The below modelling assumptions are unchanged from last quarter.

APPENDIX III
FAIR VALUE DETERMINATION OF TFG ASSET MANAGEMENT
In accordance with the accounting guidance in the AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide (2015): Investment Companies (the "Guide"), as an Investment Company, TFG  carries all of its investments at Fair Value.  However, as outlined in section 7.10 of the Guide, operating entities should be consolidated where TFG (i) has an economic interest in excess of 50%; (ii) is deemed to have control over the significant operational and financial decisions of the entity; and (iii) where the purpose of the operating entity is to provide services to the Investment Company (i.e., TFG) rather than realise a gain on the sale of the investment.  As at 30 September 2016, this consolidation exemption was applied to TFG's holdings in Polygon, LCM, Hawke's Point and TCIP (the "Consolidated Businesses") because these businesses were managing some of TFG's investment capital and thus could be deemed to be providing services to TFG.  In contrast, Equitix is not managing TFG's capital so is not subject to point (iii) above, and GreenOak is minority-owned so is not subject to points (i) or (ii) above.
The resultant inconsistency of treatment under U.S. GAAP of the businesses in TFG Asset Management is potentially confusing to the reader of TFG's financial statements, particularly since the determination and articulation in Q3 2015 of the "IPO Strategy"(37) for TFG Asset Management, which confirmed that the primary commercial purpose for TFG Asset Management, including the Consolidated Businesses, is to be held as an investment for capital appreciation, in line with TFG's investment objective.  Consequently, from Q3 2015, TFG has prepared and presented its non-GAAP financial metrics and performance information using a consistent Fair Value basis for all of TFG Asset Management.  Some of the differences resulting from the presentation of non-GAAP metrics are reconciled in Appendix IV.
TFG's investments in the TFG Asset Management businesses are considered to be "Level 3" investments in the U.S. GAAP valuation hierarchy and the Audit Committee of TFG, comprising the Independent Directors, has engaged third-party valuation specialists to determine an indicative valuation for each of these businesses.  These valuations have been adopted for the purposes of reporting the Fair Value impact in TFG's non-GAAP metrics as at 30 September 2016.
Figure 31 sets out the valuation approach utilised for each of the businesses as well as the range of market metrics utilised in determining Fair Value.  Both management and performance fees (collectively, the "Fees") continue to be calculated based on the U.S. GAAP measure of Net Asset Value and thus the non-GAAP adjustments do not currently impact the Fees payable to the Investment Manager.

APPENDIX IV
RECONCILIATION BETWEEN U.S. GAAP AND FAIR VALUE BASIS
This section describes how the non-GAAP Fair Value adjustments relating to LCM, Polygon, Hawke's Point and TCIP have been made to the U.S. GAAP financials to arrive at the Key Performance Metrics.
Figure 32 details the impact of such a change in accounting treatment for LCM, Polygon, Hawke's Point and TCIP in terms of carrying value and performance fees.
In arriving at the imputed performance fee, the change in NAV is adjusted by the full amortisation of the remaining base cost ($27.7 million) of the purchase of 25% of LCM in 2012.  Previously, this was being amortised on a straight-line basis over 10 years, and each quarter an applicable adjustment is made to reduce the performance fees payable to the investment manager.

APPENDIX IV
RECONCILIATION BETWEEN U.S. GAAP AND FAIR VALUE BASIS (continued)
Figure 33 shows a reconciliation between the Statement of Operations prepared on a full Fair Value basis and on a U.S. GAAP basis.
In addition to adding in the unrealised Fair Value as detailed in Figure 32, the reconciliation shows the removal of the operating P&L for H1 2016, and the reversal of certain balance sheet items relating to Polygon, LCM, Hawke's Point or TCIP.  Such items include the remaining intangible asset balance relating to Polygon's management contracts and a reversal of a deferred tax liability.
We adjust for change in notional performance fees as calculated in Figure 32. 
In addition, as in prior periods, we back out share-based compensation of $11.5 million as, under ASC 805, TFG is recognising the value of the shares given in consideration for the Polygon transaction as compensation over the period in which they are vesting.  This mechanic and future vesting schedule for share-based compensation are described in more detail in the 2016 Interim Master Fund unaudited financial statements.

Figure 34 shows a reconciliation between the Balance Sheet prepared on a full Fair Value basis and on a U.S. GAAP basis.
In addition to adding in the unrealised Fair Value of $167.0 million as detailed in Figure 32, the reconciliation shows the removal of certain balance sheet items relating to Polygon, LCM, Hawke's Point and TCIP, including the value of Polygon's un-amortised management contracts ($20.9 million), cash of $36.8 million held in TFG Asset Management, a small amount of fixed assets, a deferred tax asset and receivables, which mainly relate to cost recoveries.  On the liability side, we reverse certain accrued expenses including compensation and add back a notional performance fee of $27.1 million relating to the Fair Value adjustment as detailed in Figure 32.

*The amounts set forth above in regards to Messrs. Griffith and Dear include their interests with respect to the Escrow Shares.  In addition to the foregoing, as of 30 September 2016, certain employees of subsidiaries of TFG and other affiliated persons own in the aggregate approximately 3.4 million shares, including interests with respect to the Escrow Shares, in each case, however, excluding any TFG shares held by the GreenOak principals or employees.
As previously disclosed, non-voting shares of TFG (together with accrued dividends and previously vested shares, (the "Vested Shares")) that were issued pursuant to TFG's acquisition in October 2012 of TFG Asset Management L.P. (f/k/a Polygon Management L.P.) and certain of its affiliates (the "Polygon Transaction") have vested with certain persons (other than Messrs. Griffith and Dear), all of whom are employees or partners of TFG-owned or affiliated entities, pursuant to the Polygon Transaction.
Certain of these persons may from time to time enter into purchases or sales trading plans (each a, "Fixed Trading Plan") providing for the sale of Vested Shares or the purchase of TFG shares in the market, or may otherwise sell their Vested Shares or purchase TFG shares, subject to applicable compliance policies.  Applicable brokerage firms may be authorised to purchase or sell TFG shares under the relevant Fixed Trading Plan pursuant to certain irrevocable instructions.  Each Fixed Trading Plan is intended to comply with Rule 10b5-1 under the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  Each Fixed Trading Plan has been or will be approved by TFG in accordance with its applicable compliance policies.
For additional information regarding the Polygon Transaction and the future vesting schedule for shares issued thereunder, see Note 22 to the 2015 Tetragon Financial Group Master Fund Limited audited financial statements.
Rule 10b5-1 provides a "safe harbor" that is designed to permit individuals to establish a pre-arranged plan to buy or sell company stock if, at the time such plan is adopted, the individuals are not in possession of material, non-public information.
Prior to publicly announcing their tender offer, TFG (through TFGMF) entered into an agreement to repurchase approximately 593,653 non-voting shares of TFG (plus scrip dividend shares payable in respect of the Q3 2016 dividend) held by Michael Humphries, a manager of certain Polygon funds, in connection with the winding up of a swap transaction between the Master Fund and Michael Humphries with respect to the relative values of TFG shares and interests in the Polygon funds following the acquisition of Polygon in 2012.  The purchase price for these shares will be determined on the basis of the volume-weighted average price per share for the first 10 trading days in November 2016.

APPENDIX VII
EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS
In Q1 2016, TFG implemented an equity-based long-term incentive plan for certain senior employees of TFG Asset Management (excluding the principals of TFM).
Awards under the long-term incentive plan, along with other equity-based awards, are typically spread over multiple vesting dates up to 2024 which may vary for each employee and are subject to forfeiture provisions.  The arrangements may also include additional periods, beyond the vesting dates, during which employees gain exposure to the performance of the TFG shares, but the shares are not issued to the employees.  Such periods may range from one to five years beyond the vesting dates.  The shares underlying these equity-based incentive programs typically will be held in escrow until they vest and will be eligible to receive shares under the TFG Optional Stock Dividend Plan ("DRIP Shares").
Where grants under these equity-based incentive programs will only be settled through the issuance of shares rather than through cash, and in accordance with U.S. GAAP rules for share-based compensation, TFG has elected to account for equity-based plans under ASC 718 – Equity-based payments to employees – and is applying the straight-line method for expense recognition and for calculating the share dilution effect.  This means that the total expense of the initial awards is determined at the award date, or at the date that the award becomes eligible to be settled only in shares ("Award Date"), by applying a reference share price on the Award Date to the shares awarded.  Taking into account all equity-based awards granted to TFG Asset Management employees, including the Q1 2016 LTIP awards, approximately 5.1 million shares have been awarded at a weighted average reference share price of $8.76 per share, implying a total share-based compensation charge of approximately $45 million spread over a period of up to eight years, excluding employer-related taxes.
The dilutive effect of the equity-based compensation plans will be reflected increasingly in TFG's fully diluted share count over the life of the plans.  Such dilution will include, among other things and in addition to the award shares, any DRIP Shares and shares that will be required to cover employer taxes.  At the end of Q3 2016, approximately 0.7 million shares were included in the fully diluted share count.

 Notes 


 (i) 
 Transactions are investments made on a particular investment date. Multiple transactions may be associated with the same tranche of the same CLO deal.  Note that certain transactions may have been removed from the table above, as the remaining value of the assets of those CLOs is immaterial.  The transactions continue to be held as of the date of this report. 


 (ii) 
 "Outstanding" refers to investments in CLOs which have not yet been optionally redeemed, sold, or wound down to less-than-material remaining expected value.  "Called" refers to investments in CLOs where TFG initiated or approved an optional redemption, and "wound down" refers to CLOs which have amortised or repaid without an optional redemption, in both cases with less-than-material remaining expected value. 


 (iii) 
 "Primary" refers to investments made in the new issuance CLO market, whereas "Secondary" refers to investments made after the original issue date of the CLO. 


 (iv) 
 The USD investment cost reflects a USD-EUR exchange rate fixed at a single historical rate to avoid the impact of skewed weightings and FX volatility over time.  As such, the investment costs of European CLOs as shown in this table may not be comparable to the investments costs as shown in TFG's financial statements. 


 (v) 
 Par weighted average spread over LIBOR or EURIBOR (as appropriate) of the underlying loan assets in each CLO's portfolio. 


 (vi) 
 Notional weighted average spread over LIBOR or EURIBOR (as appropriate) of the debt tranches issued by each CLO, as of the closing date of each transaction. 


 (vii) 
 Notional weighted average spread over LIBOR or EURIBOR (as appropriate) of the debt tranches issued by each CLO, as of the most recent trustee report date. 


 (viii) 
 The current junior-most O/C cushion is the excess (or deficit) of the junior-most O/C test ratio over the test requirement, as of the latest trustee report available as of the report date. 


 (ix) 
 The junior-most O/C cushion at close is the excess (or deficit) of the junior-most O/C test ratio over the test requirement that was expected on each deal's closing date (or date of purchase, if later). Please note that two of TFG's investments are so called "par structures" which don't include a junior O/C test.  They have been marked by an "N/A" in the relevant junior-most O/C test columns. 


 (x) 
 Calculated by annualizing the change from the expected closing date junior-most O/C cushion to the current junior-most O/C cushion. 


 (xi) 
 Calculated from TFG's investment date.  For outstanding investments, includes both historical cash flows received to-date and prospective cash flows expected to be received, based on TFG's base case  modelling assumptions. Refer to www.tetragoninv.com for more information on TFG's modelling assumptions and methodology.  For all other investments, includes only historical realised cash flows received to-date. 


 (xii) 
 Inception to report date cash flow received on each transaction as a percentage of its original cost.

Statement Regarding Non-Mainstream Pooled Investments (NMPI)
TFG notes the UK Financial Conduct Authority ("FCA") rules relating to the restrictions on the retail distribution of unregulated collective investment schemes and close substitutes (referred to as "non-mainstream pooled investments"), which came into effect on 1 January 2014.
TFG has received appropriate legal advice that confirms that TFG's shares do not constitute NMPI under the FCA's rules and are, therefore, excluded from the FCA's restrictions that apply to non-mainstream pooled investment products.
TFG expects that it will continue to conduct its affairs in such a manner that TFG's shares will continue to be excluded from the FCA's rules relating to NMPI.

 TFG: Delivering Results Since 2005 


 (1) 
 (i) TFG commenced investing as an open-ended investment company in 2005, before its IPO in April 2007. 



 (ii) TFG seeks to deliver 10-15% Fair Value Return on Equity ("RoE") per annum to shareholders.  TFG's returns will most likely fluctuate with LIBOR.  LIBOR directly flows through some of TFG's investments and, as it can be seen as the risk-free short-term rate, it should affect all of TFG's investments.  In high-LIBOR environments, TFG should achieve higher sustainable returns; in low-LIBOR environments, TFG should achieve lower sustainable returns.  



 (iii) RoE is calculated from TFG's IPO in 2007.  2015 RoE includes a fair value adjustment for certain TFG Asset Management businesses, the value of which has accumulated over several years.  Consequently the full year return of 14.5% is not prepared on a like for like basis with prior years.  Like for like performance for 2015 was 8.2%.  Please see Appendix III and Appendix IV for a definition of Fair Value RoE and Appendix IV for other details. 



 (iv) Annualised total shareholder return to 30 September 2016, defined as share price appreciation including dividends reinvested, for the last year, the last three years, the last five years, and since TFG's initial public offering in April 2007, and annualised Fair Value NAV Per Share Total Return ("NAV Total Return") to 30 September 2016, for the last year, the last three years, the last five years, and since TFG's initial public offering in April 2007 as sourced from Bloomberg.  NAV Total Return is determined in accordance with the "NAV total return performance" calculation as set forth on the Association of Investment Companies ("AIC") website.  TFG's NAV Total Return is determined for any period by calculating, as a percentage return on the Fully Diluted Fair Value NAV per Share ("NAV Per Share") at the start of such period, (i) the change in NAV Per Share over such period, plus (ii) the aggregate amount of any dividends per share paid during such period, with any dividend deemed reinvested at the NAV Per Share at the month end date closest to the applicable ex-dividend date (i.e., so that the amount of any dividend is increased or decreased by the same percentage increase or decrease in NAV Per Share from such ex-dividend date through to the end of the applicable period). 



 (v) Fair Value EPS ("EPS") divided by Dividends per Share at 30 September 2016. 



 (vi) As an "investment company" under U.S. GAAP, the vast majority of TFG's investments are held at fair value, while certain TFG Asset Management businesses are consolidated if they are deemed to be "service providers" to TFG.  For the quarter ending 30 September 2015, TFG began reporting its key performance metrics on a fair value basis that adjusts U.S. GAAP metrics to include the fair value of the TFG Asset Management businesses that are currently consolidated under U.S. GAAP.  The fair values used are as determined by TFG's Audit Committee based on information provided by an independent valuation specialist, prepared in accordance with ASC 820.  The consistent use of fair value across all investments is referred to in this report as "Fair Value".  Fair Value Key Metrics such as Fair Value NAV Per Share Total Return, Fair Value RoE and Fair Value NAV are calculated in a way that reflects the incentive fees that would otherwise have arisen if these Fair Values were actually reflected in the U.S. GAAP investment company accounting for TFG's financial statements and used as the basis for the calculation of fees.  Please refer to Appendices III and IV for further details.  During the third quarter of 2016, TFG determined, in consultation with its auditors and non-audit accounting advisors, that, based on the relative growth of its investments in TFG Asset Management businesses, TFG may be unable to continue satisfying the requirements for "investment company" reporting under U.S. GAAP for future reporting periods (including, potentially, with respect to the current reporting year) which would result in significantly more investments being consolidated under U.S. GAAP and, over time, a greater disparity between the U.S. GAAP and Fair Value performance metrics.  However, TFG has further determined, in consultation with its auditors and non-audit accounting advisors, that TFG would satisfy the requirements for "investment entity" reporting under the International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS"), a change to which would result in all, or substantially all, of TFG's investments being held at fair value, such that the disparity between IFRS and Fair Value performance metrics would be significantly less than the expected disparity between U.S. GAAP and Fair Value performance metrics for future periods.  As such, TFG is actively considering a potential change in its accounting principles from U.S. GAAP to IFRS, with any such change being initially reflected in our annual report for 2016 and requiring the restatement of certain reports for prior periods to IFRS.  Any change in accounting principles could result in differences in the presentation and basis of reporting between TFG's reporting for future periods under IFRS and its reporting for prior periods under U.S. GAAP, limiting the comparability of reports for these periods, and may also result in the accrual and payment of the incentive fees described above that are included in the calculations of the Fair Value Key Metrics, but have not yet arisen under the current U.S. GAAP investment company accounting for TFG's financial statements.  TFG's assessment of this potential change in accounting principles is ongoing and there can be no assurance as to what, if any, change will ultimately be made.  



 (vii) NAV Per Share based on TFG's financial statements as of 30 September 2016.  Please note that the reported NAV Per Share excludes any shares held in treasury or in a subsidiary as of that date, but includes shares held in escrow which are expected to be released and incorporated into the U.S. GAAP NAV per Share over a five-year period and the number of shares corresponding to the applicable intrinsic value of the options issued to the Investment Manager at the time of the Company's IPO.  Please see Figure 22 for more details. 



 (viii) Partner & Employee shareholdings at 30 September 2016, including all deferred compensation arrangements.  Please refer to the 2015 Audited Tetragon Financial Group Master Fund Limited financial statements for more details of these arrangements. 


 Executive Summary

 TFG's 'Home Member State' for the purposes of the EU Transparency Directive (Directive 2004/109/EC) is the Netherlands. 


 (3) 
 TFG invests substantially all its capital through a master fund, Tetragon Financial Group Master Fund Limited ("TFGMF"), in which it holds 100% of the issued non-voting shares.  In this report, unless otherwise stated, we report on the consolidated business incorporating TFG and TFGMF.  References to "we" are to Tetragon Financial Management LP, TFG's investment manager (the "Investment Manager").

 Fair Value NAV Per Share Total Return ("NAV Total Return") to 30 September 2016, for the last year, the last three years, the last five years, and since TFG's initial public offering in April 2007 as sourced from Bloomberg.  NAV Total Return is determined in accordance with the "NAV total return performance" calculation as set forth on the Association of Investment Companies ("AIC") website.  TFG's NAV Total Return is determined for any period by calculating, as a percentage return on the Fully Diluted Fair Value NAV per Share ("NAV Per Share") at the start of such period, (i) the change in NAV Per Share over such period, plus (ii) the aggregate amount of any dividends per share paid during such period, with any dividend deemed reinvested at the NAV Per Share at the month end date closest to the applicable ex-dividend date (i.e., so that the amount of any dividend is increased or decreased by the same percentage increase or decrease in NAV Per Share from such ex-dividend date through to the end of the applicable period). 


 (6) 
 Please refer to Financial Highlights on page 27 of this report for the definition of Fair Value Net Income.

 Founded in 1932, the AIC represents approximately 350 members across a broad range of closed-ended investment companies, incorporating investment trusts and other closed ended investment companies.  TFG is classified by the AIC in its Flexible Investment sector as a company whose policy allows it to invest in a range of asset types.  The AIC has indicated that the sector may assist investors and advisers to more easily find and compare those investment companies that have the ability to invest in a range of assets and allow investors to compare investment companies with similar open-ended funds. 



 The AIC has a Code of Corporate Governance (AIC Code) which sets out a framework of best practice in respect of the governance of investment companies.  The Board of Directors of TFG considers that reporting against the principles and recommendations of the AIC Code, and by reference to the AIC Corporate Governance Guide for Investment Companies (which incorporates the UK Corporate Governance Code), will provide better information to shareholders.  Please visit the TFG website at http://www.tetragoninv.com/site-services/aic/aic-code for further information.

 TFG received a five-star Morningstar Rating™ as of 30 September 2016.  The Morningstar Rating™ is an assessment of a fund's past performance – based on both return and risk – which shows how similar investments compare with their competitors.  A high rating alone is insufficient basis for an investment decision. 



 As of 30 September 2016, TFG has an overall five-star Morningstar Rating™, as well as five stars over both three and five years. 



 Morningstar, Inc. rates investments from one to five stars based on how well they have performed in comparison to similar investments, after adjusting for risk and accounting for all relevant sales charges.  Within each Morningstar Category, the top 10% of investments receive five stars, the next 22.5% four stars, the middle 35% three stars, the next 22.5% two stars, and the bottom 10% receive one star.  Investments are rated for up to three time periods – 3, 5, and 10 years – and these ratings are combined to produce an overall rating.  Investments with less than three years of history are not rated.  Morningstar states that ratings are objective and based entirely on a mathematical evaluation of past performance. 



 TFG has subscribed to Morningstar Essentials™, for which it has paid a fee to enable it to use the Morningstar Rating™ on TFG's website and other investor materials.

 (i) Fair Value Total NAV Return is determined in accordance with the "NAV total return performance" calculation as set forth on the Association of Investment Companies ("AIC") website.  TFG's Fair Value NAV per share Total Return is determined for any period by calculating, as a percentage return on the Fair Value NAV per Share at the start of such period, (i) the change in Fair Value NAV per share over such period, plus (ii) the aggregate amount of any dividends per share paid during such period, with any dividend deemed reinvested at the Fair Value NAV per share at the month end date closest to the applicable ex-dividend date (i.e., so that the amount of any dividend is increased or decreased by the same percentage increase or decrease in Fair Value NAV per share from such ex-dividend date through to the end of the applicable period). 



 (ii)  MSCI ACWI refers to the MSCI All Countries World Index, which is managed by MSCI Inc.  It is a global equity index consisting of developed and emerging market countries.  Any indices and other financial benchmarks are provided for illustrative purposes only.  Comparisons to indices have limitations because, for example, indices have volatility and other material characteristics that may differ from the fund.  Any index information contained herein is included to show general trends in the markets in the periods indicated, is not meant to imply that these indices are the only relevant indices, and is not intended to imply that the portfolio or investment was similar to any particular index either in composition or element of risk.  The indices shown here have not been selected to represent appropriate benchmarks to compare an investor's performance, but rather are disclosed to allow for comparison of the investor's performance to that of certain well-known and widely-recognised indices.  The volatility of the indices may be materially different from the individual performance attained by a specific investor.  In addition, the fund's holdings may differ significantly from the securities that comprise the indices.  You cannot invest directly in an index.  Further information on the composition and calculation of the MSCI ACWI is available at www.msci.com.  The data depicted here is sourced from Bloomberg using Bloomberg's "Custom Total Return Holding Period" function. 



 (iii) Cumulative return determined on a quarterly compounding basis using the actual TFG quarterly incentive fee LIBOR based hurdle rate.  In the period from IPO to June 2008 this was 8%; thereafter, the hurdle has been determined using the 3 month USD LIBOR rate on the first day of each calendar quarter plus a spread of 2.647858%.

 In order to manage its balance sheet more efficiently whilst also hopefully allowing for opportunistic investments during times of market dislocation, TFG has obtained an unsecured Revolving Credit Facility.  Its stated maturity date of 1 April 2019 will automatically be extended by six months on 1 April and 1 October in each year unless a lender (with respect to its commitment and loans) has provided prior written notice withholding consent to such an extension.  The Revolving Credit Facility is subject to a minimum usage fee of 4% per annum on any amount by which 25% of the maximum facility amount exceeds the aggregate outstanding borrowings.  In addition, there is a non-usage fee of 1% which is applied to the undrawn amount of the facility, excluding the amount which is subject to the minimum usage fee.  Any drawn portion will incur interest at a rate of 1-month U.S. LIBOR plus a spread of 4%.

 Appendix III 


 (37) 
 TFM has determined that it will continue to grow TFG Asset Management, as TFG's diversified alternative asset management business, with a view to a planned initial public offering and listing of shares of TFG Asset Management in the next three to five years (referred to as the "IPO Strategy").   


 Appendix V 


 (38) 
 (i) The Total Escrow Shares of 12.9 million consists of 6.9 million shares which have been used as consideration for the acquisition of Polygon and applicable stock dividends relating thereto, as well as 6.0 million shares held in a separate escrow account in relation to equity-based compensation. 



 (ii) This comprises: a) The number of shares corresponding to the applicable intrinsic value of the options issued to the Investment Manager at the time of the Company's IPO with a strike price of $10.00, to the extent such options are in the money at period end.  At the reporting date, this was 0.7 million shares.  The intrinsic value of the manager (IPO) share options is calculated as the excess of (x) the closing price of the shares as of the final trading day in the relevant period over (y) $10.00 (being the exercise price per share) times (z) 12,545,330 (being a number of shares subject to the options before the application of potential anti-dilution).  The terms of exercise under the options allow for exercise using cash, as well as, with the consent of the board of the Company, certain forms of cashless exercise.  Each of these prescribed methods of exercise may give rise to the issuance of a different number of shares than the approach described herein.  If the options were to be surrendered for their intrinsic value with the board's consent, rather than exercised, the number of shares issued would equal the intrinsic value divided by the closing price of the shares as of the final trading day in the relevant period.  This approach has been selected because we currently believe it is more reasonably illustrative of a likely outcome if the options are exercised.  The options are exercisable until 26 April 2017.  b) The number of shares corresponding to the applicable intrinsic value of the remaining unexercised options issued to the GreenOak Founders in relation to the acquisition of a 10% stake in GreenOak in September 2010.  At the reporting date, this was 0.9 million.  The intrinsic value of the GreenOak share options is calculated as the excess of (x) the closing price of the shares as of the final trading day in the relevant period over (y) $5.50 (being the exercise price per share) times (z) 1,954,120 (being a number of shares subject to the options. 



 (iv) Certain Escrow Shares (6.9 million), which have been used as consideration for the acquisition of Polygon and applicable stock dividends relating thereto, and which are held in escrow and are expected to be released and incorporated into the U.S. GAAP NAV per Share over the next two years. 



 (v) Dilution in relation to equity-based awards by TFG Asset Management for certain senior employees.  At the reporting date, this was 0.7 million.  The basis and pace of recognition is expected to match the rate at which service is being provided to TFG Asset Management in relation to these shares.  Please see Appendix VII for more details. 


 (39) 
 Equity-based awards are intended to give certain senior employees of TFG Asset Management long-term exposure to TFG stock (with vesting subject to forfeiture and certain restrictions).  Please see Appendix VII for further details. 


 Appendix VI 


 (40) 
 TFG has and may also continue to engage in share repurchases in the market from time to time.  Such purchases may at appropriate price levels below NAV represent an attractive use of TFG's excess cash and an efficient means to return cash to shareholders.  Any decision to engage in share repurchases will be made by the Investment Manager, upon consideration of relevant factors, and will be subject to, among other things, applicable law and profits at the time.  The Company also continues to explore other methods of improving the liquidity of its shares. 



 An investment in TFG involves substantial risks.  Please refer to the company's website at www.tetragoninv.comfor a description of the risks and uncertainties pertaining to an investment in TFG.
