The Robert Toigo Foundation is hoping to build off the success- es of its first recipients of its Bridge to Business grants as it looks to create a program that provides not only vital capital to entrepreneurs in the asset management space but also to con- struct a network of valuable resources to leverage its position as a leading supporter of women and minorities in the business world.

The Highs and Lows of Spin-Outs and Start-Ups
March 27, 2012 BY Greg Saitz  
Read more
It’s a dream shared by multitudes of entrepreneurial-minded asset management professionals at large firms: breaking away, starting their own firms, doing things their way without being shackled by corporate bureaucracy. A fair number of these dreamers take the plunge and head off on their own—and a small number of them actually become successful independent managers.
The odds for success may be relatively long, but that doesn’t stop people from trying. In the past several years, individuals or teams from Wells Capital Management, Invesco, Janus CapitalGroup, Lord Abbett, Tradewinds Global Investors and numerous others have left their firms to blaze their own trail. Success, they warn, will likely only come if the new venture is launched the right way.

In 2008, when Stuart Kaye departed Invesco, where he had been director of research for the firm’s global quantitative strategies group, he left behind a yellow and black street sign depicting a man holding a briefcase and floppy disk that read, “Nerd Xing.” “I snatched it up and proudly kept it,” recalls one of his Invesco co-workers, Nili Gilbert.
Today, that sign hangs in Kaye’s office once again, except this time it is in the Stamford, Conn.-based offices of Matarin Capital Management, an institutionally focused quantitative shop that Kaye and Gilbert co-founded last year after she, too, left Invesco.

Matarin’s Investment Team
Stuart Kaye, Nili Gilbert and Ralph Coutant are responsible for Matarin’s proprietary model development, portfolio construction and day-to-day management (including trading) of all investment strategies. Stuart, Nili and Ralph have been successfully investing client assets for 20+, 11+ and 15+ years, respectively. The three worked together for over a decade developing and deploying strategies similar to those at Matarin while at Invesco. Stuart worked with Ralph for 8 years, and Nili with Ralph for 7 years at Invesco prior to founding Matarin.
As a partner at AJO, Stuart focused on both portfolio management and research for all AJO quantitative products. He was responsible for researching and selecting individual factors, assessing and assigning weights in the construction of client portfolios, and running optimizations for approximately $20 billion assets under management (AUM).
Prior to AJO, Stuart served as U.S. Head of Research for the Quantitative Strategies Group at Invesco (and its predecessor, Chancellor Capital Management), and was responsible for both research and portfolio management. While at Invesco, Stuart hired, managed and mentored Ralph, beginning in 1999 and Nili beginning in 2003, each having joined Invesco as members of the Quantitative Strategies Group. Stuart was instrumental in the development of the fundamentally based stock and asset allocation factors used in quantitatively implemented portfolios, which reached over $20 billion in AUM. He also developed models to forecast the U.S. stock and bond markets used in Invesco’s asset allocation strategies and a wide array of other products.
Nili led the expansion of Invesco’s Quantitative Strategies Group U.S.-based stock and bond asset allocation strategies into a wider array of global developed markets and asset classes, including commodities, currencies, and money markets. She was directly responsible for the creation and combination of factors used in the proprietary models and the construction of global macro strategies in which over $7 billion in AUM were invested. Nili’s research efforts also focused on individual securities, with an emphasis on the design of macro and industry factors used in the stock selection models. Additionally, Nili was instrumental in the redesign of several other Invesco strategies, including the Financial Futures Hedge Fund, one of Invesco’s flagship products.
During his tenure at Invesco, Ralph was primarily responsible for stock selection model research, providing expertise in factor research and selection, weighting and timing strategies, and transactions costs modeling. As a lead idea generator, Ralph provided intuitive, fundamental, and “real world” perspectives to quantitative investing—much in the way Matarin performs its research today.
