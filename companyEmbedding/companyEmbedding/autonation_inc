Jackson: Extending the brand

AutoNation Inc. will start selling self-branded service contracts in 50 Texas stores this month, in a move that begins the retailer's nationwide launch of private-label finance and insurance products. AutoNation plans to brand all protection products sold in its dealerships under the AutoNation name by year end. It plans to begin selling those products online in 2016, after an online pilot to be conducted this year. Private-label products are another way to add substance to the retailer's branding initiative, CEO Mike Jackson said. That initiative began in early 2013 with most of the company's dealerships assuming the AutoNation name in place of regional brand names. "By extending the brand AutoNation to mean something, you have to take it to more than just a name on the store," Jackson said. "Every time I sell an AutoNation product that delights a customer, like a service contract, that further binds the customer to us in another new way, rather than handing them off to a warranty company." Before this month's move, AutoNation, the country's largest new-vehicle retailer, sold 18 extended service plans across the company. AutoNation executives say the company took the best elements from all 18 to create one plan that offers what it bills as "best-in-class coverage." The AutoNation plan is provided and administered by the Warranty Group, a service contract provider in Chicago.Other products
Through the rest of this year, AutoNation plans to add private-label options for its other F&I products, provided by the same vendors the company works with today, said Steve Strader, AutoNation's senior vice president of customer financial services. Those include vehicle appearance protection sold via PermaPlate and tire and wheel coverage sold via Safe-Guard Products International. The new approach is possible because customers now know the AutoNation name, Strader said. Third-party surveys show that consumers have a higher awareness of the AutoNation brand than of the brands the company used to use, he said. In the past, "We were not comfortable in trying to launch what we call a private-label product because we did not have the brand recognition," Strader said. "Now we do." The private-label products will be sold at all domestic-brand and mass-market import-brand stores carrying the AutoNation name. The initiative excludes the company's luxury-brand stores that haven't adopted the AutoNation brand name, Strader said. AutoNation isn't shutting out products offered by the automakers. But those plans will be sold only when customers request them. For instance, if a customer at an AutoNation Ford store wants to buy a Ford-branded extended service contract, AutoNation will sell it. But "we're going to attempt to sell our own plan first," Strader said.Retailer as administrator?
While the products will be provided by third-party vendors for now, the company eventually may consider doing so itself. That would be more profitable, but it would require AutoNation to develop the scale and experience to administer such programs and the resulting customer claims, Strader said. He said AutoNation will stick with the third-party approach for at least three years. "I would venture to say down the road that a lot of these products and services that we use third parties to administer and provide, over a long-term horizon, will all gradually migrate to within our company," Strader said. "But that's a decision we haven't made yet."

History[edit]
In 1981, Republic Industries was created, specializing in waste disposal by Robert Alpert of A&B Investors, Tom Fatjo, and Bill DeArman. H. Wayne Huizenga became Chairman of the Board in 1995.[9] Republic began its used auto sales initiative with the purchase of Auto Nation USA in 1997,[10] followed by Car Choice Inc.[11] Republic began opening AutoNation used megastores. CarMax brought a lawsuit against Republic for copyright and trademark infringement. Republic's sales for 1995 were $5.2 billion.[9]
In 1996, Republic began purchasing new car dealerships and offering long-term contracts to owners who joined the automotive division management team. Some dealers began seeking out Republic to sell their dealerships because of the long-term contracts. In 1996, Republic built twelve AutoNation locations.[9]
In 1996, Alamo Rent A Car was acquired.[11]
In 1997, Republic continued acquisitions in the car rental business with the purchase of National Car Rental, Spirit Rent-A-Car, Value Rent-A-Car, Snappy Car Rental, and EuroDollar Rent A Car. Huizenga had Republic start consolidating operations between new and used cars and its rental companies into one operation. Acquiring six Saturn dealerships in Arizona and Florida, Republic sold the dealerships to Saturn in 1997 because they did not generate enough sales despite being a successful brand.[9] Maroone Automotive Group of Buffalo, NY and Florida was acquired in 1997 for $200 million in Republic Stock.[10]
A 2-for-1 split in the company stock was completed in 1996.
In an attempt to expand the company's electronic security division, the company offered to purchase ADT but the acquisition was called off.[9] In October 1997, Republic sold off its electronic security division after failing to expand it with the attempted-purchase of ADT.
Republic Industries offered in July 1998 an IPO of its original core waste disposal business as Republic Services. From this sale of 36% of Republic Services, Republic Industries netted $1.4 billion. While CarMax had received a $50 million jury award in its lawsuit, it was overturned during an appeal in 1998.[9] Drivers' Mart, a competitor, was purchased.[12]
The remaining 64% of Republic Services were spun off to Republic Industries shareholders in 1999.[9] The company's first Chief Executive Officer (CEO) was Steve Berrard, who resigned from the company in July 1999.[13] Mike Jackson, CEO, moved to spin off the car rental business as ANC Rental. AutoNation USA used car megastores, which lost $25 million the quarter before, were all closed down. Plans to brand all auto dealers as AutoNation were scrapped and a regional brand focus was instituted.[10]
In January 2003, Jackson was named chairman of the board replacing Huizenga.[10] On October 24, 2005, the AutoNation building in downtown Fort Lauderdale suffered significant damage due to Hurricane Wilma.[14] The company has since transferred to another nearby building.
In 2006, Mike Jackson, CEO of AutoNation announced that his company would be reducing orders from General Motors, Ford and Chrysler in 2007. Jackson made the statement that the company would instead focus on selling BMW, Mercedes and Lexus vehicles due to anticipation of further market share loss by US automakers resulting in high dealer inventories.[15]
In 2009, AutoNation announced the AutoNation Payment Protection program, promising that the dealership will buy back any car at market value, should the owner lose their job.[16]
In 2011, AutoNation was the first auto retailer in the U.S. to sell a total of 8 Million vehicles.[17]
In January 2013, AutoNation announced that it would completely replace localized brand names of its car retail operations with its own name. This re-branding across the United States was supported and approved by the major automotive manufacturers, including GM, Ford, Chrysler, Nissan, Toyota, Honda, VW and Hyundai. It involved a total of 210 franchises operating under previously assigned local group names.[18]
In May 2013, AutoNation partnered with Indy Car Series Champion Ryan Hunter-Reay to support his "Racing for Cancer" charity. This charity serves as a key component of the AutoNation charity program. The charity was founded as a 501(c)(3) charitable organization following the 2009 passing of the founder's mother due to colon cancer.
In August 2013, AutoNation announced the sale of its 9 Millionth vehicle. A record achievement for the industry.[19]
In January 2015, AutoNation announced that Mike Jackson will take an expanded role while Michael Maroone retired after over 15 years as President. Bill Berman is the new Chief Operating Officer as of February 4, 2015.[20]
In June 2015, AutoNation retailed its 10-millionth vehicle.[21]
On April 11, 2017, USA Today wrote that AutoNation’s CEO Mike Jackson questioned the marked value of the Tesla, the maker of electric cars, by saying that Tesla is "either one of the great Ponzi schemes of all time or it’s gonna work out."[22] The previous day, Tesla passed General Motors as the most valuable American automotive manufacturer, measured by its market capitalization. Jackson also said, "Clearly General Motors is undervalued and Tesla is overvalued. Anybody can see that."[22]
In June of 2017, The company sold its 11 millionth vehicle.

History[edit]
In 1981, Republic Industries was created, specializing in waste disposal by Robert Alpert of A&B Investors, Tom Fatjo, and Bill DeArman. H. Wayne Huizenga became Chairman of the Board in 1995.[9] Republic began its used auto sales initiative with the purchase of Auto Nation USA in 1997,[10] followed by Car Choice Inc.[11] Republic began opening AutoNation used megastores. CarMax brought a lawsuit against Republic for copyright and trademark infringement. Republic's sales for 1995 were $5.2 billion.[9]
In 1996, Republic began purchasing new car dealerships and offering long-term contracts to owners who joined the automotive division management team. Some dealers began seeking out Republic to sell their dealerships because of the long-term contracts. In 1996, Republic built twelve AutoNation locations.[9]
In 1996, Alamo Rent A Car was acquired.[11]
In 1997, Republic continued acquisitions in the car rental business with the purchase of National Car Rental, Spirit Rent-A-Car, Value Rent-A-Car, Snappy Car Rental, and EuroDollar Rent A Car. Huizenga had Republic start consolidating operations between new and used cars and its rental companies into one operation. Acquiring six Saturn dealerships in Arizona and Florida, Republic sold the dealerships to Saturn in 1997 because they did not generate enough sales despite being a successful brand.[9] Maroone Automotive Group of Buffalo, NY and Florida was acquired in 1997 for $200 million in Republic Stock.[10]
A 2-for-1 split in the company stock was completed in 1996.
In an attempt to expand the company's electronic security division, the company offered to purchase ADT but the acquisition was called off.[9] In October 1997, Republic sold off its electronic security division after failing to expand it with the attempted-purchase of ADT.
Republic Industries offered in July 1998 an IPO of its original core waste disposal business as Republic Services. From this sale of 36% of Republic Services, Republic Industries netted $1.4 billion. While CarMax had received a $50 million jury award in its lawsuit, it was overturned during an appeal in 1998.[9] Drivers' Mart, a competitor, was purchased.[12]
The remaining 64% of Republic Services were spun off to Republic Industries shareholders in 1999.[9] The company's first Chief Executive Officer (CEO) was Steve Berrard, who resigned from the company in July 1999.[13] Mike Jackson, CEO, moved to spin off the car rental business as ANC Rental. AutoNation USA used car megastores, which lost $25 million the quarter before, were all closed down. Plans to brand all auto dealers as AutoNation were scrapped and a regional brand focus was instituted.[10]
In January 2003, Jackson was named chairman of the board replacing Huizenga.[10] On October 24, 2005, the AutoNation building in downtown Fort Lauderdale suffered significant damage due to Hurricane Wilma.[14] The company has since transferred to another nearby building.
In 2006, Mike Jackson, CEO of AutoNation announced that his company would be reducing orders from General Motors, Ford and Chrysler in 2007. Jackson made the statement that the company would instead focus on selling BMW, Mercedes and Lexus vehicles due to anticipation of further market share loss by US automakers resulting in high dealer inventories.[15]
In 2009, AutoNation announced the AutoNation Payment Protection program, promising that the dealership will buy back any car at market value, should the owner lose their job.[16]
In 2011, AutoNation was the first auto retailer in the U.S. to sell a total of 8 Million vehicles.[17]
In January 2013, AutoNation announced that it would completely replace localized brand names of its car retail operations with its own name. This re-branding across the United States was supported and approved by the major automotive manufacturers, including GM, Ford, Chrysler, Nissan, Toyota, Honda, VW and Hyundai. It involved a total of 210 franchises operating under previously assigned local group names.[18]
In May 2013, AutoNation partnered with Indy Car Series Champion Ryan Hunter-Reay to support his "Racing for Cancer" charity. This charity serves as a key component of the AutoNation charity program. The charity was founded as a 501(c)(3) charitable organization following the 2009 passing of the founder's mother due to colon cancer.
In August 2013, AutoNation announced the sale of its 9 Millionth vehicle. A record achievement for the industry.[19]
In January 2015, AutoNation announced that Mike Jackson will take an expanded role while Michael Maroone retired after over 15 years as President. Bill Berman is the new Chief Operating Officer as of February 4, 2015.[20]
In June 2015, AutoNation retailed its 10-millionth vehicle.[21]
On April 11, 2017, USA Today wrote that AutoNation’s CEO Mike Jackson questioned the marked value of the Tesla, the maker of electric cars, by saying that Tesla is "either one of the great Ponzi schemes of all time or it’s gonna work out."[22] The previous day, Tesla passed General Motors as the most valuable American automotive manufacturer, measured by its market capitalization. Jackson also said, "Clearly General Motors is undervalued and Tesla is overvalued. Anybody can see that."[22]
In June of 2017, The company sold its 11 millionth vehicle.

History[edit]
In 1981, Republic Industries was created, specializing in waste disposal by Robert Alpert of A&B Investors, Tom Fatjo, and Bill DeArman. H. Wayne Huizenga became Chairman of the Board in 1995.[9] Republic began its used auto sales initiative with the purchase of Auto Nation USA in 1997,[10] followed by Car Choice Inc.[11] Republic began opening AutoNation used megastores. CarMax brought a lawsuit against Republic for copyright and trademark infringement. Republic's sales for 1995 were $5.2 billion.[9]
In 1996, Republic began purchasing new car dealerships and offering long-term contracts to owners who joined the automotive division management team. Some dealers began seeking out Republic to sell their dealerships because of the long-term contracts. In 1996, Republic built twelve AutoNation locations.[9]
In 1996, Alamo Rent A Car was acquired.[11]
In 1997, Republic continued acquisitions in the car rental business with the purchase of National Car Rental, Spirit Rent-A-Car, Value Rent-A-Car, Snappy Car Rental, and EuroDollar Rent A Car. Huizenga had Republic start consolidating operations between new and used cars and its rental companies into one operation. Acquiring six Saturn dealerships in Arizona and Florida, Republic sold the dealerships to Saturn in 1997 because they did not generate enough sales despite being a successful brand.[9] Maroone Automotive Group of Buffalo, NY and Florida was acquired in 1997 for $200 million in Republic Stock.[10]
A 2-for-1 split in the company stock was completed in 1996.
In an attempt to expand the company's electronic security division, the company offered to purchase ADT but the acquisition was called off.[9] In October 1997, Republic sold off its electronic security division after failing to expand it with the attempted-purchase of ADT.
Republic Industries offered in July 1998 an IPO of its original core waste disposal business as Republic Services. From this sale of 36% of Republic Services, Republic Industries netted $1.4 billion. While CarMax had received a $50 million jury award in its lawsuit, it was overturned during an appeal in 1998.[9] Drivers' Mart, a competitor, was purchased.[12]
The remaining 64% of Republic Services were spun off to Republic Industries shareholders in 1999.[9] The company's first Chief Executive Officer (CEO) was Steve Berrard, who resigned from the company in July 1999.[13] Mike Jackson, CEO, moved to spin off the car rental business as ANC Rental. AutoNation USA used car megastores, which lost $25 million the quarter before, were all closed down. Plans to brand all auto dealers as AutoNation were scrapped and a regional brand focus was instituted.[10]
In January 2003, Jackson was named chairman of the board replacing Huizenga.[10] On October 24, 2005, the AutoNation building in downtown Fort Lauderdale suffered significant damage due to Hurricane Wilma.[14] The company has since transferred to another nearby building.
In 2006, Mike Jackson, CEO of AutoNation announced that his company would be reducing orders from General Motors, Ford and Chrysler in 2007. Jackson made the statement that the company would instead focus on selling BMW, Mercedes and Lexus vehicles due to anticipation of further market share loss by US automakers resulting in high dealer inventories.[15]
In 2009, AutoNation announced the AutoNation Payment Protection program, promising that the dealership will buy back any car at market value, should the owner lose their job.[16]
In 2011, AutoNation was the first auto retailer in the U.S. to sell a total of 8 Million vehicles.[17]
In January 2013, AutoNation announced that it would completely replace localized brand names of its car retail operations with its own name. This re-branding across the United States was supported and approved by the major automotive manufacturers, including GM, Ford, Chrysler, Nissan, Toyota, Honda, VW and Hyundai. It involved a total of 210 franchises operating under previously assigned local group names.[18]
In May 2013, AutoNation partnered with Indy Car Series Champion Ryan Hunter-Reay to support his "Racing for Cancer" charity. This charity serves as a key component of the AutoNation charity program. The charity was founded as a 501(c)(3) charitable organization following the 2009 passing of the founder's mother due to colon cancer.
In August 2013, AutoNation announced the sale of its 9 Millionth vehicle. A record achievement for the industry.[19]
In January 2015, AutoNation announced that Mike Jackson will take an expanded role while Michael Maroone retired after over 15 years as President. Bill Berman is the new Chief Operating Officer as of February 4, 2015.[20]
In June 2015, AutoNation retailed its 10-millionth vehicle.[21]
On April 11, 2017, USA Today wrote that AutoNation’s CEO Mike Jackson questioned the marked value of the Tesla, the maker of electric cars, by saying that Tesla is "either one of the great Ponzi schemes of all time or it’s gonna work out."[22] The previous day, Tesla passed General Motors as the most valuable American automotive manufacturer, measured by its market capitalization. Jackson also said, "Clearly General Motors is undervalued and Tesla is overvalued. Anybody can see that."[22]
In June of 2017, The company sold its 11 millionth vehicle.

History[edit]
In 1981, Republic Industries was created, specializing in waste disposal by Robert Alpert of A&B Investors, Tom Fatjo, and Bill DeArman. H. Wayne Huizenga became Chairman of the Board in 1995.[9] Republic began its used auto sales initiative with the purchase of Auto Nation USA in 1997,[10] followed by Car Choice Inc.[11] Republic began opening AutoNation used megastores. CarMax brought a lawsuit against Republic for copyright and trademark infringement. Republic's sales for 1995 were $5.2 billion.[9]
In 1996, Republic began purchasing new car dealerships and offering long-term contracts to owners who joined the automotive division management team. Some dealers began seeking out Republic to sell their dealerships because of the long-term contracts. In 1996, Republic built twelve AutoNation locations.[9]
In 1996, Alamo Rent A Car was acquired.[11]
In 1997, Republic continued acquisitions in the car rental business with the purchase of National Car Rental, Spirit Rent-A-Car, Value Rent-A-Car, Snappy Car Rental, and EuroDollar Rent A Car. Huizenga had Republic start consolidating operations between new and used cars and its rental companies into one operation. Acquiring six Saturn dealerships in Arizona and Florida, Republic sold the dealerships to Saturn in 1997 because they did not generate enough sales despite being a successful brand.[9] Maroone Automotive Group of Buffalo, NY and Florida was acquired in 1997 for $200 million in Republic Stock.[10]
A 2-for-1 split in the company stock was completed in 1996.
In an attempt to expand the company's electronic security division, the company offered to purchase ADT but the acquisition was called off.[9] In October 1997, Republic sold off its electronic security division after failing to expand it with the attempted-purchase of ADT.
Republic Industries offered in July 1998 an IPO of its original core waste disposal business as Republic Services. From this sale of 36% of Republic Services, Republic Industries netted $1.4 billion. While CarMax had received a $50 million jury award in its lawsuit, it was overturned during an appeal in 1998.[9] Drivers' Mart, a competitor, was purchased.[12]
The remaining 64% of Republic Services were spun off to Republic Industries shareholders in 1999.[9] The company's first Chief Executive Officer (CEO) was Steve Berrard, who resigned from the company in July 1999.[13] Mike Jackson, CEO, moved to spin off the car rental business as ANC Rental. AutoNation USA used car megastores, which lost $25 million the quarter before, were all closed down. Plans to brand all auto dealers as AutoNation were scrapped and a regional brand focus was instituted.[10]
In January 2003, Jackson was named chairman of the board replacing Huizenga.[10] On October 24, 2005, the AutoNation building in downtown Fort Lauderdale suffered significant damage due to Hurricane Wilma.[14] The company has since transferred to another nearby building.
In 2006, Mike Jackson, CEO of AutoNation announced that his company would be reducing orders from General Motors, Ford and Chrysler in 2007. Jackson made the statement that the company would instead focus on selling BMW, Mercedes and Lexus vehicles due to anticipation of further market share loss by US automakers resulting in high dealer inventories.[15]
In 2009, AutoNation announced the AutoNation Payment Protection program, promising that the dealership will buy back any car at market value, should the owner lose their job.[16]
In 2011, AutoNation was the first auto retailer in the U.S. to sell a total of 8 Million vehicles.[17]
In January 2013, AutoNation announced that it would completely replace localized brand names of its car retail operations with its own name. This re-branding across the United States was supported and approved by the major automotive manufacturers, including GM, Ford, Chrysler, Nissan, Toyota, Honda, VW and Hyundai. It involved a total of 210 franchises operating under previously assigned local group names.[18]
In May 2013, AutoNation partnered with Indy Car Series Champion Ryan Hunter-Reay to support his "Racing for Cancer" charity. This charity serves as a key component of the AutoNation charity program. The charity was founded as a 501(c)(3) charitable organization following the 2009 passing of the founder's mother due to colon cancer.
In August 2013, AutoNation announced the sale of its 9 Millionth vehicle. A record achievement for the industry.[19]
In January 2015, AutoNation announced that Mike Jackson will take an expanded role while Michael Maroone retired after over 15 years as President. Bill Berman is the new Chief Operating Officer as of February 4, 2015.[20]
In June 2015, AutoNation retailed its 10-millionth vehicle.[21]
On April 11, 2017, USA Today wrote that AutoNation’s CEO Mike Jackson questioned the marked value of the Tesla, the maker of electric cars, by saying that Tesla is "either one of the great Ponzi schemes of all time or it’s gonna work out."[22] The previous day, Tesla passed General Motors as the most valuable American automotive manufacturer, measured by its market capitalization. Jackson also said, "Clearly General Motors is undervalued and Tesla is overvalued. Anybody can see that."[22]
In June of 2017, The company sold its 11 millionth vehicle.

History[edit]
In 1981, Republic Industries was created, specializing in waste disposal by Robert Alpert of A&B Investors, Tom Fatjo, and Bill DeArman. H. Wayne Huizenga became Chairman of the Board in 1995.[9] Republic began its used auto sales initiative with the purchase of Auto Nation USA in 1997,[10] followed by Car Choice Inc.[11] Republic began opening AutoNation used megastores. CarMax brought a lawsuit against Republic for copyright and trademark infringement. Republic's sales for 1995 were $5.2 billion.[9]
In 1996, Republic began purchasing new car dealerships and offering long-term contracts to owners who joined the automotive division management team. Some dealers began seeking out Republic to sell their dealerships because of the long-term contracts. In 1996, Republic built twelve AutoNation locations.[9]
In 1996, Alamo Rent A Car was acquired.[11]
In 1997, Republic continued acquisitions in the car rental business with the purchase of National Car Rental, Spirit Rent-A-Car, Value Rent-A-Car, Snappy Car Rental, and EuroDollar Rent A Car. Huizenga had Republic start consolidating operations between new and used cars and its rental companies into one operation. Acquiring six Saturn dealerships in Arizona and Florida, Republic sold the dealerships to Saturn in 1997 because they did not generate enough sales despite being a successful brand.[9] Maroone Automotive Group of Buffalo, NY and Florida was acquired in 1997 for $200 million in Republic Stock.[10]
A 2-for-1 split in the company stock was completed in 1996.
In an attempt to expand the company's electronic security division, the company offered to purchase ADT but the acquisition was called off.[9] In October 1997, Republic sold off its electronic security division after failing to expand it with the attempted-purchase of ADT.
Republic Industries offered in July 1998 an IPO of its original core waste disposal business as Republic Services. From this sale of 36% of Republic Services, Republic Industries netted $1.4 billion. While CarMax had received a $50 million jury award in its lawsuit, it was overturned during an appeal in 1998.[9] Drivers' Mart, a competitor, was purchased.[12]
The remaining 64% of Republic Services were spun off to Republic Industries shareholders in 1999.[9] The company's first Chief Executive Officer (CEO) was Steve Berrard, who resigned from the company in July 1999.[13] Mike Jackson, CEO, moved to spin off the car rental business as ANC Rental. AutoNation USA used car megastores, which lost $25 million the quarter before, were all closed down. Plans to brand all auto dealers as AutoNation were scrapped and a regional brand focus was instituted.[10]
In January 2003, Jackson was named chairman of the board replacing Huizenga.[10] On October 24, 2005, the AutoNation building in downtown Fort Lauderdale suffered significant damage due to Hurricane Wilma.[14] The company has since transferred to another nearby building.
In 2006, Mike Jackson, CEO of AutoNation announced that his company would be reducing orders from General Motors, Ford and Chrysler in 2007. Jackson made the statement that the company would instead focus on selling BMW, Mercedes and Lexus vehicles due to anticipation of further market share loss by US automakers resulting in high dealer inventories.[15]
In 2009, AutoNation announced the AutoNation Payment Protection program, promising that the dealership will buy back any car at market value, should the owner lose their job.[16]
In 2011, AutoNation was the first auto retailer in the U.S. to sell a total of 8 Million vehicles.[17]
In January 2013, AutoNation announced that it would completely replace localized brand names of its car retail operations with its own name. This re-branding across the United States was supported and approved by the major automotive manufacturers, including GM, Ford, Chrysler, Nissan, Toyota, Honda, VW and Hyundai. It involved a total of 210 franchises operating under previously assigned local group names.[18]
In May 2013, AutoNation partnered with Indy Car Series Champion Ryan Hunter-Reay to support his "Racing for Cancer" charity. This charity serves as a key component of the AutoNation charity program. The charity was founded as a 501(c)(3) charitable organization following the 2009 passing of the founder's mother due to colon cancer.
In August 2013, AutoNation announced the sale of its 9 Millionth vehicle. A record achievement for the industry.[19]
In January 2015, AutoNation announced that Mike Jackson will take an expanded role while Michael Maroone retired after over 15 years as President. Bill Berman is the new Chief Operating Officer as of February 4, 2015.[20]
In June 2015, AutoNation retailed its 10-millionth vehicle.[21]
On April 11, 2017, USA Today wrote that AutoNation’s CEO Mike Jackson questioned the marked value of the Tesla, the maker of electric cars, by saying that Tesla is "either one of the great Ponzi schemes of all time or it’s gonna work out."[22] The previous day, Tesla passed General Motors as the most valuable American automotive manufacturer, measured by its market capitalization. Jackson also said, "Clearly General Motors is undervalued and Tesla is overvalued. Anybody can see that."[22]
In June of 2017, The company sold its 11 millionth vehicle.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
