Editors Review

                    ES File Explorer File Manager has pretty much everything you need to manage your files on your Android phone or tablet, and even adds more by including a media browser, several viewers for different file types, and even management of cloud storage, network files, and network playback. With all this functionality available, it's a wonder that the software remains free, but it does anyway. Root users get a bonus, too, with the ability to manage system files and set permissions right from within ES File Explorer File Manager.
