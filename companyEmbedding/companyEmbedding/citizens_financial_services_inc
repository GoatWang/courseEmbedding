MANSFIELD, Pa., July 26, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Citizens Financial Services, Inc. (OTC BB: CZFS), parent company of First Citizens Community Bank, released today its unaudited financial results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017.








For the six months ended June 30, 2017, net income totaled $6,771,000 which compares to net income of $6,314,000 for the first six months of 2016, an increase of $457,000 or 7.2%.  Basic earnings per share of $1.95 for the first six months of 2017 compares to $1.80 for the first six months last year.  Annualized return on equity for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 was 10.63% and 10.34%, while return on assets was 1.10% and 1.06%, respectively.
For the three months ended June 30, 2017, net income totaled $3,468,000 which compares to net income of $3,031,000 for the second quarter of 2016, an increase of $437,000.  Basic earnings per share of $1.00 for the second quarter of 2017 compares to $.86 for the second quarter last year.  Annualized return on equity for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 was 10.80% and 9.88%, while return on assets was 1.12% and 1.02%, respectively.
Net interest income before the provision for loan loss for the six months ended June 30, 2017 totaled $20,401,000 compared to $18,376,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2016, which is an increase of $2,025,000, or 11.0%.  The net interest margin for the six months ended June 30, 2017 was 3.79% compared to 3.62% for the same period last year.  For the first six months of 2017, the strategy has been to shift interest earning assets from the investment portfolio into the loan portfolio which has resulted in higher yields on interest earning assets, coupled with the Federal Reserve's recent action, in which they raised short term rates 50 basis points.  For the six months ended June 30, 2017, the provision for loan losses totaled $1,240,000 compared to $270,000 last year.  The increase in the provision for loan loss is reflective of the strong loan growth during the first half of 2017.  Although the increase in the provision impacts short-term profitability, the origination of high quality loans has resulted in net interest income growth currently and for future revenue growth.
Non-interest expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2017 totaled $14,357,000 compared to $14,213,000 for the same period last year.  This is an increase of only $144,000, or 1.0%, while net interest income before the provision increased 11.0% as noted above.  The most significant increase was in salaries and benefits which increased $861,000 due to the increased costs associated with the additional lending teams, branch and loan production office expansion, and normal employee merit increases.  The increase in salaries and benefits was offset by a decrease in other expenses of $662,000. For the three months ended June 30, 2017, non-interest expenses decreased $135,000 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2016.
At June 30, 2017, total assets were $1.265 billion which compares to $1.223 billion at December 31, 2016.  Available for sale securities of $275.2 million at June 30, 2017 decreased $38.8 million from December 31, 2016 to fund growth in the loan portfolio, which is part of the balance sheet strategy to shift interest earning assets into loans.  Net loans as of June 30, 2017 totaled $878.1 million and have increased $87.4 million, or 11.1%, which is 22.2% on an annualized basis, from December 31, 2016.  Deposit growth has also been strong, increasing $45.7 million from December 31, 2016 to a total of $1.051 billion at June 3, 2017.  Borrowed funds decreased $9.7 million from December 31, 2016 to June 30, 2017.  This decrease is attributable to the increase in deposits and decrease in investment securities, which also funded the loan growth in 2017.
Stockholders' equity totaled $127.8 million at June 30, 2017, which compares to $123.3 million at December 31, 2016, an increase of $4.5 million.  The increase was attributable to net income for the six months ended June 30, 2017 totaling $6.8 million and net treasury share transactions of $200,000.  As a result of changes in interest rates impacting the fair value of investment securities, the unrealized gain on available for sale investment securities increased $.4 million from the end of 2016. These were offset by cash dividends of $2.9 million.  On June 7, 2017, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend and a stock dividend for its shareholders. The cash dividend of $0.425 per share, along with the 5.00% stock dividend, was paid on June 30, 2017 to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 16, 2017. The quarterly cash dividend is an increase of 2.4% over the regular cash dividend of $0.415 per share declared one year ago.  Dividends are a key part of the Board of Director's commitment to providing a solid return to the shareholders. This return is supported by the loan growth experienced over the last 12 months and reflects our efforts to remain a strong independent community bank.
Citizens Financial Services, Inc. has nearly 1,700 shareholders, the majority of whom reside in markets where offices are located.

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
Citizens was established in 1828 as the High Street Bank in Providence, Rhode Island.[3][4] In 1871, the Rhode Island legislature gave a second charter to establish the Citizens Savings Bank which eventually acquired its parent group to form Citizens Trust Company.[3][4] The bank then expanded through Rhode Island, opening a total of 29 branches in that state. It established Citizens Financial Group as a holding company when the bank acquired The Greenville Trust Company in 1954.
In 1985, Citizens changed status from a mutual savings bank to a federal stock savings bank. Expansion into other states began with Massachusetts in 1986.

Citizens Bank headquarters in downtown Providence, constructed 1991.


In 1988, Royal Bank of Scotland acquired Citizens.[4] Under RBS ownership, Citizens acquired several smaller banks in New England to become the second largest bank in the region. In 1996, in conjunction with the acquisition of First NH Bank, the Bank of Ireland gained a 23.5% stake in Citizens, which RBS then acquired two years later to resume 100% ownership.
Expansion outside New England began in 2001, when RBS purchased the retail banking division of Mellon Financial Corporation in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware for $2 billion. This made Citizens Bank the second-largest bank in Pennsylvania, and a major bank in both Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.[5]
In July 2003, the bank purchased the naming rights to the new home field of the Philadelphia Phillies and renamed it Citizens Bank Park.[6]
On January 17, 2003, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. purchased Commonwealth Bancorp, Inc., the holding company for Commonwealth Bank, based in Norristown, Pennsylvania.[7]
In 2004, RBS purchased the credit card division of Connecticut-based People's Bank.[8][9] This purchase allowed Citizens to issue and market its own credit cards. This purchase allowed Citizens to issue and market its own credit cards.
Charter One Financial[edit]

In August 2004, Citizens Financial acquired Cleveland, Ohio-based Charter One Financial, parent company of Charter One Bank, with branches in Illinois, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, upstate New York, and Vermont for $10.5 billion.[10][11] Because Citizens Republic Bancorp of Flint, Michigan already operated under the Citizens Bank name in most of Charter One's territory, Citizens Financial elected to keep the Charter One name in Charter One's Midwestern footprint. However, it re-branded the New York and Vermont branches as Citizens Bank. This purchase made Citizens Financial the 12th largest bank in the United States with over $131 billion in assets and 1,530 branches across 13 states.[11]
In early 2005, the Charter One name replaced the Citizens Bank banner on seven branches in Butler County, Pennsylvania. This rebranding resolved a 3½-year-old name dispute with Butler-based Citizens National Bank. By mid-2005, Citizens National and Citizens Financial agreed to a compromise. Citizens National Bank changed its name to NexTier Bank, while the Citizens Financial Group branches reverted to the "Citizens Bank" name.[12]
On September 1, 2007, the individual banks under Citizens Financial Group, excluding Citizens Bank of Pennsylvania, merged into RBS Citizens, N.A.[13]
In November 2008, Charter One sold its network of 65 branches in Indiana to Old National Bank which rebranded them under the Old National Bank banner.[14][15] The transaction closed in June 2010.
In 2014, Citizens soll 94 branches in metropolitan Chicago to U.S. Bancorp.[16][17]
Citizens Republic Bancorp, which had a similar name as Citizens Financial, was acquired by FirstMerit Bank in 2013 (which itself would be acquired by Huntington Bancshares in 2016), and subsequently all branches were rebranded as FirstMerit banks.[18] With conflicting names no longer an issue, Citizens Bank announced June 30, 2014, that Charter One banks in Michigan and Ohio would be rebranded as Citizens Bank. The name change officially took place on April 27, 2015, bringing to an end the name Charter One in Cleveland, Ohio; the city in which it was founded.[19][20]
Financial crisis[edit]
In May 2008, Citizens Financial Group failed to publicly announce that it was under investigation by the SEC for its involvement in the sub-prime mortgage crisis that devastated the U.S. housing market and bond investors around the world.[21] The SEC only investigated banks it suspected of involvement in the purchase and sale of subprime securities.[22]
In 2008, the company lost $929 million and anticipated writing off $2 billion in bad loans.[23] Royal Bank of Scotland posted the biggest loss in British corporate history and announced cost cutting measures at Citizens.[24]
A Philadelphia developer sued Citizens Bank January 27, 2010, for $8 billion, under a claim that the bank used sham accusations of default to recall loans in an effort to prop up its failing parent companies, Citizens Financial Group and "its ultimate parent, The Royal Bank of Scotland Group."[25]
The Road to IPO[edit]
Following the effective nationalization of RBS in 2008, speculation arose as to whether RBS would retain Citizens Bank. In 2012, public pressure in the United Kingdom grew for RBS to focus on its home market and sell foreign assets, including Citizens Bank, in order for UK taxpayers to earn their money back. Substantial interest in Citizens Bank had been rumored from other foreign banks such as Brazil-based Itaú Unibanco and Canada-based Toronto-Dominion Bank, the latter of which already had an existing U.S. branch network that overlapped with the existing Citizen footprint east of the Appalachian Mountains.[26] The Bank of Montreal, with its existing U.S. presence, was also mentioned as a possible buyer.[27] U.S. banks mentioned as potential Citizens buyers included JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, U.S. Bancorp, PNC Financial Services, and Fifth Third Bank.[27][28]
In February 2013, RBS confirmed at least a partial spinoff of Citizens through an initial public offering within the next two years. Then in October 2013, RBS announced it would sell its Chicago-area branches, which represented 6% of its U.S. deposits;[29] Citizens later agreed to sell those branches to U.S. Bancorp on January 7, 2014.[30] Finally in November 2013, RBS announced that it would divest all of Citizens Financial Group.[31]
The bank began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol CFG on September 24, 2014, raising $3 billion.[32] By April 2015, RBS Group's shareholding in the bank had dropped to 45.6%.[33] A further sale in July 2015 reduced RBS' stake to 23.4%.[34] RBS sold its remaining stake in the bank in October 2015.[35]
In June 2016, it was announced that Citizen's Financial Group had joined the Fortune 500 for the first time.[36]
Misappropriation of depositor funds[edit]
In August 2015, the CFPB and other federal regulators levied nearly $35 million in penalties against Citizens Bank "for failing to credit to customers’ accounts the full amount of their deposits". The regulators declared that, from 2008 to 2013, "The bank’s actions resulted in consumers being shorted millions of dollars".[37][38] Joint action by the CFPB, the FDIC, and the Comptroller of the Currency determined that Citizens Bank had engaged in "deceptive practices" by "fail[ing] to give customers their full deposits at times when the size of the deposit didn’t match the number written on deposit slips", despite promising to correct such discrepancies, instead pocketing the difference.[39] The bank was required to reimburse its customers for lost funds as well as pay roughly $20 million in fines to the three agencies.[37] The New York Times said that Citizens Bank's misconduct "is appalling precisely because it is so basic", demonstrating that "regulators like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau are a necessary defense against a system prone to abuses".[40]
Paul Manafort investigation[edit]
On May 12, 2017, the Wall Street Journal reported that the United States Department of Justice requested from Citizens Trump 2016 campaign manager Paul Manafort's transaction records. According to the article, the request is related to the investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. Manafort reportedly secured a 2.7 million-dollar loan from Citizens in 2016.[41]

Citizens' branch footprint


Like several other banks, Citizens has agreements with several supermarket chains to locate bank branches in the stores. The greatest number of these are in Pittsburgh-based Giant Eagle stores, most of which were acquired in the acquisition of Mellon Financial Corporation's retail banking division. Citizens also operates branches inside many Stop & Shop and Shaw's stores in New England. One unique aspect at Citizens branches inside supermarkets is full-service banking from 10 am to 3 pm on Sunday, when banks, including Citizens standalone branches, are traditionally closed. This made Citizens one of the first banks in North America to operate on Sundays. In September 2010, Giant Eagle announced a new agreement with Huntington Bank in which Huntington would open branches in several stores in Ohio and West Virginia and will replace existing branches of other banks when the store's agreements with those banks expire.[42]
On June 25, 2008, Citizens Bank announced would sell 18 branches in upstate New York as it prepared to open 57 branches downstate. Community Bank System Inc. of DeWitt, New York purchased the branches in Ausable Forks, Champlain, Fort Covington, Indian Lake, Lake Placid, Lyons Falls, Long Lake, Malone, Newcomb, North Creek, Plattsburgh, Saranac Lake, Ticonderoga, Tupper Lake and Whitehall.[43] The sale completed on November 7, 2008.
In October 2009, Citizens Bank opened a full-service branch inside a Dunkin' Donuts in Bellingham, Massachusetts. The branch offers teller windows, a full-service automated teller machine (ATM) and Dunkin' Donuts promotions for using the bank's services.[44]
Citizens was one of the first banks in the US to use Radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology on its ATM cards, via MasterCard PayPass. In late 2009, however, Citizens began reissuing its cards under Visa without the RFID technology.

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
Citizens was established in 1828 as the High Street Bank in Providence, Rhode Island.[3][4] In 1871, the Rhode Island legislature gave a second charter to establish the Citizens Savings Bank which eventually acquired its parent group to form Citizens Trust Company.[3][4] The bank then expanded through Rhode Island, opening a total of 29 branches in that state. It established Citizens Financial Group as a holding company when the bank acquired The Greenville Trust Company in 1954.
In 1985, Citizens changed status from a mutual savings bank to a federal stock savings bank. Expansion into other states began with Massachusetts in 1986.

This made Citizens one of the first banks in North America to operate on Sundays. In September 2010, Giant Eagle announced a new agreement with Huntington Bank in which Huntington would open branches in several stores in Ohio and West Virginia and will replace existing branches of other banks when the store's agreements with those banks expire.[42]
On June 25, 2008, Citizens Bank announced would sell 18 branches in upstate New York as it prepared to open 57 branches downstate. Community Bank System Inc. of DeWitt, New York purchased the branches in Ausable Forks, Champlain, Fort Covington, Indian Lake, Lake Placid, Lyons Falls, Long Lake, Malone, Newcomb, North Creek, Plattsburgh, Saranac Lake, Ticonderoga, Tupper Lake and Whitehall.[43] The sale completed on November 7, 2008.
In October 2009, Citizens Bank opened a full-service branch inside a Dunkin' Donuts in Bellingham, Massachusetts. The branch offers teller windows, a full-service automated teller machine (ATM) and Dunkin' Donuts promotions for using the bank's services.[44]
Citizens was one of the first banks in the US to use Radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology on its ATM cards, via MasterCard PayPass. In late 2009, however, Citizens began reissuing its cards under Visa without the RFID technology.

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
Citizens was established in 1828 as the High Street Bank in Providence, Rhode Island.[3][4] In 1871, the Rhode Island legislature gave a second charter to establish the Citizens Savings Bank which eventually acquired its parent group to form Citizens Trust Company.[3][4] The bank then expanded through Rhode Island, opening a total of 29 branches in that state. It established Citizens Financial Group as a holding company when the bank acquired The Greenville Trust Company in 1954.
In 1985, Citizens changed status from a mutual savings bank to a federal stock savings bank. Expansion into other states began with Massachusetts in 1986.
RBS ownership[edit]

Citizens Bank headquarters in downtown Providence, constructed 1991.


In 1988, Royal Bank of Scotland acquired Citizens.[4] Under RBS ownership, Citizens acquired several smaller banks in New England to become the second largest bank in the region. In 1996, in conjunction with the acquisition of First NH Bank, the Bank of Ireland gained a 23.5% stake in Citizens, which RBS then acquired two years later to resume 100% ownership.
Expansion outside New England began in 2001, when RBS purchased the retail banking division of Mellon Financial Corporation in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware for $2 billion. This made Citizens Bank the second-largest bank in Pennsylvania, and a major bank in both Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.[5]
In July 2003, the bank purchased the naming rights to the new home field of the Philadelphia Phillies and renamed it Citizens Bank Park.[6]
On January 17, 2003, Citizens Financial Group, Inc. purchased Commonwealth Bancorp, Inc., the holding company for Commonwealth Bank, based in Norristown, Pennsylvania.[7]
In 2004, RBS purchased the credit card division of Connecticut-based People's Bank.[8][9] This purchase allowed Citizens to issue and market its own credit cards. This purchase allowed Citizens to issue and market its own credit cards.
Charter One Financial[edit]




Charter One Bank branch, downtown Ypsilanti, Michigan


In August 2004, Citizens Financial acquired Cleveland, Ohio-based Charter One Financial, parent company of Charter One Bank, with branches in Illinois, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, upstate New York, and Vermont for $10.5 billion.[10][11] Because Citizens Republic Bancorp of Flint, Michigan already operated under the Citizens Bank name in most of Charter One's territory, Citizens Financial elected to keep the Charter One name in Charter One's Midwestern footprint. However, it re-branded the New York and Vermont branches as Citizens Bank. This purchase made Citizens Financial the 12th largest bank in the United States with over $131 billion in assets and 1,530 branches across 13 states.[11]
In early 2005, the Charter One name replaced the Citizens Bank banner on seven branches in Butler County, Pennsylvania. This rebranding resolved a 3½-year-old name dispute with Butler-based Citizens National Bank. By mid-2005, Citizens National and Citizens Financial agreed to a compromise. Citizens National Bank changed its name to NexTier Bank, while the Citizens Financial Group branches reverted to the "Citizens Bank" name.[12]
On September 1, 2007, the individual banks under Citizens Financial Group, excluding Citizens Bank of Pennsylvania, merged into RBS Citizens, N.A.[13]
In November 2008, Charter One sold its network of 65 branches in Indiana to Old National Bank which rebranded them under the Old National Bank banner.[14][15] The transaction closed in June 2010.
In 2014, Citizens soll 94 branches in metropolitan Chicago to U.S. Bancorp.[16][17]
Citizens Republic Bancorp, which had a similar name as Citizens Financial, was acquired by FirstMerit Bank in 2013 (which itself would be acquired by Huntington Bancshares in 2016), and subsequently all branches were rebranded as FirstMerit banks.[18] With conflicting names no longer an issue, Citizens Bank announced June 30, 2014, that Charter One banks in Michigan and Ohio would be rebranded as Citizens Bank. The name change officially took place on April 27, 2015, bringing to an end the name Charter One in Cleveland, Ohio; the city in which it was founded.[19][20]
Financial crisis[edit]
In May 2008, Citizens Financial Group failed to publicly announce that it was under investigation by the SEC for its involvement in the sub-prime mortgage crisis that devastated the U.S. housing market and bond investors around the world.[21] The SEC only investigated banks it suspected of involvement in the purchase and sale of subprime securities.[22]
In 2008, the company lost $929 million and anticipated writing off $2 billion in bad loans.[23] Royal Bank of Scotland posted the biggest loss in British corporate history and announced cost cutting measures at Citizens.[24]
A Philadelphia developer sued Citizens Bank January 27, 2010, for $8 billion, under a claim that the bank used sham accusations of default to recall loans in an effort to prop up its failing parent companies, Citizens Financial Group and "its ultimate parent, The Royal Bank of Scotland Group."[25]
The Road to IPO[edit]
Following the effective nationalization of RBS in 2008, speculation arose as to whether RBS would retain Citizens Bank. In 2012, public pressure in the United Kingdom grew for RBS to focus on its home market and sell foreign assets, including Citizens Bank, in order for UK taxpayers to earn their money back. Substantial interest in Citizens Bank had been rumored from other foreign banks such as Brazil-based Itaú Unibanco and Canada-based Toronto-Dominion Bank, the latter of which already had an existing U.S. branch network that overlapped with the existing Citizen footprint east of the Appalachian Mountains.[26] The Bank of Montreal, with its existing U.S. presence, was also mentioned as a possible buyer.[27] U.S. banks mentioned as potential Citizens buyers included JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, U.S. Bancorp, PNC Financial Services, and Fifth Third Bank.[27][28]
In February 2013, RBS confirmed at least a partial spinoff of Citizens through an initial public offering within the next two years. Then in October 2013, RBS announced it would sell its Chicago-area branches, which represented 6% of its U.S. deposits;[29] Citizens later agreed to sell those branches to U.S. Bancorp on January 7, 2014.[30] Finally in November 2013, RBS announced that it would divest all of Citizens Financial Group.[31]
The bank began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol CFG on September 24, 2014, raising $3 billion.[32] By April 2015, RBS Group's shareholding in the bank had dropped to 45.6%.[33] A further sale in July 2015 reduced RBS' stake to 23.4%.[34] RBS sold its remaining stake in the bank in October 2015.[35]
In June 2016, it was announced that Citizen's Financial Group had joined the Fortune 500 for the first time.[36]
Misappropriation of depositor funds[edit]
In August 2015, the CFPB and other federal regulators levied nearly $35 million in penalties against Citizens Bank "for failing to credit to customers’ accounts the full amount of their deposits". The regulators declared that, from 2008 to 2013, "The bank’s actions resulted in consumers being shorted millions of dollars".[37][38] Joint action by the CFPB, the FDIC, and the Comptroller of the Currency determined that Citizens Bank had engaged in "deceptive practices" by "fail[ing] to give customers their full deposits at times when the size of the deposit didn’t match the number written on deposit slips", despite promising to correct such discrepancies, instead pocketing the difference.[39] The bank was required to reimburse its customers for lost funds as well as pay roughly $20 million in fines to the three agencies.[37] The New York Times said that Citizens Bank's misconduct "is appalling precisely because it is so basic", demonstrating that "regulators like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau are a necessary defense against a system prone to abuses".[40]
Paul Manafort investigation[edit]
On May 12, 2017, the Wall Street Journal reported that the United States Department of Justice requested from Citizens Trump 2016 campaign manager Paul Manafort's transaction records. According to the article, the request is related to the investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. Manafort reportedly secured a 2.7 million-dollar loan from Citizens in 2016.[41]
Services[edit]




Citizens' branch footprint


Like several other banks, Citizens has agreements with several supermarket chains to locate bank branches in the stores. The greatest number of these are in Pittsburgh-based Giant Eagle stores, most of which were acquired in the acquisition of Mellon Financial Corporation's retail banking division. Citizens also operates branches inside many Stop & Shop and Shaw's stores in New England. One unique aspect at Citizens branches inside supermarkets is full-service banking from 10 am to 3 pm on Sunday, when banks, including Citizens standalone branches, are traditionally closed. This made Citizens one of the first banks in North America to operate on Sundays. In September 2010, Giant Eagle announced a new agreement with Huntington Bank in which Huntington would open branches in several stores in Ohio and West Virginia and will replace existing branches of other banks when the store's agreements with those banks expire.[42]
On June 25, 2008, Citizens Bank announced would sell 18 branches in upstate New York as it prepared to open 57 branches downstate. Community Bank System Inc. of DeWitt, New York purchased the branches in Ausable Forks, Champlain, Fort Covington, Indian Lake, Lake Placid, Lyons Falls, Long Lake, Malone, Newcomb, North Creek, Plattsburgh, Saranac Lake, Ticonderoga, Tupper Lake and Whitehall.[43] The sale completed on November 7, 2008.
In October 2009, Citizens Bank opened a full-service branch inside a Dunkin' Donuts in Bellingham, Massachusetts. The branch offers teller windows, a full-service automated teller machine (ATM) and Dunkin' Donuts promotions for using the bank's services.[44]
Citizens was one of the first banks in the US to use Radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology on its ATM cards, via MasterCard PayPass. In late 2009, however, Citizens began reissuing its cards under Visa without the RFID technology.

		Recovering Losses
		Caused By Investment Misconduct





Meyer Wilson Law Firm Investigating United Development Funding Claims
Were you sold investments in UDF? Call today.



The investment fraud lawyers at the law firm of Meyer Wilson are investigating
	 potential claims on behalf of investors in United Development Funding
	 (UDF) against the brokerage firms who sold the investments to their customers.


		If you invested in United Development Funding at the recommendation of
		 your broker and lost money, we invite you to contact an investment fraud
		 lawyer at Meyer Wilson today for a free review.
		Fill Out a Free Online Review Form


About UDF
For several years, UDF, a Texas-based non-traded real estate investment
	 trust (REIT), has marketed itself to retail investors on the premise that
	 it offers “unique and fundamentally sound investments in affordable
	 residential real estate.” According to UDF’s website, all
	 UDF investments are sold through brokerage firms. Under securities industry
	 rules, brokerage firms are required to conduct extensive due diligence
	 on any investment that a firm sells to its customers. It has been reported
	 that UDF has raised approximately $1 billion in funding through brokerage
	 firm sales to retail investors in recent years.
The Raid

	According to
	The
Wall Street Journal, federal agents raided UDF’s offices in February, issuing subpoenas
	 to company executives and removing various materials from the premises.
	 A spokesperson for the FBI said that the agents were conducting “law
	 enforcement activity” but declined further comment. No charges have
	 yet been filed.

News of the FBI raid sent shares of UDF’s largest fund, United Development
	 Funding IV, plummeting 54%.
Potential Problems Revealed

	Just two days before the FBI raid,
	The Wall Street Journal published an article highlighting potential problems with UDF IV’s
	 concentrated lending practices. According to the article, although UDF
	 operates in North Carolina, South Carolina and Florida, 99% of the UDF
	 IV fund’s portfolio consists of loans made to borrowers in Texas.
	 The article further states that 67% of the balance of UDF IV loans was
	 made to a single borrower, Texas-based Centurion American Development,
	 or Centurion’s affiliates.

In December 2015, a Dallas hedge fund publicly raised questions about UDF
	 on an Internet site. Among the allegations raised by the hedge fund was
	 that UDF had used new investor money to repay investors in UDF’s
	 earlier investment vehicles “consistent with a Ponzi scheme.”
What To Do Next
The lawyers at Meyer Wilson have represented approximately 1,000 investors
	 over the last 15 years and have recovered tens of millions of dollars
	 on their behalf. If you invested money in United Development Funding through
	 the recommendation of a brokerage firm and lost money in those investments,
	 contact the lawyers at Meyer Wilson to discuss your potential recovery
	 options. You might be able to recover your losses against the brokerage
	 firm that sold you the investments. Initial consultations are free and
	 all of our cases are handled on a contingency fee basis.

I had spoken to a local attorney about my investment losses and he didn't know how to help me, so he referred me to David Meyer. David and his staff were not only professional, but they were also really congenial and pleasant to speak with. Any time I had a question they were always responsive and made sure I understood each step in the process of recovering my losses. My overall experience was positive and I would encourage anyone who even thinks they have been a victim of stockbroker misconduct to call David.

					- S.T.,Canton, Ohio
				

Meyer Wilson represented me in a suit brought last year against my brokerage firm, securing a very fair and equitable settlement for me. I was impressed with the professional manner in which they handled our relationship and kept me aware of developments in the case. I highly recommend them.

					- R.G., M.D.,Cincinnati, Ohio
				





I rolled over my retirement account to my stockbroker when I retired and trusted him to provide me an investment plan that would cover my living expenses and protect my life savings. He sold me a variable annuity and controlled how my retirement was invested in the stock market. I relied on him totally as the expert and I ended up losing a big portion of my savings. I was referred to Meyer Wilson to file my arbitration claim against the brokerage firm. Mr. Meyer and his associates and staff were great to work with. They explained everything to me, walked me through each stage of the arbitration, worked hard to prepare my case, and I am very happy with the outcome.

					- L.B.,Tennessee
				

I really appreciate all of the efforts of the legal team at Meyer & Associates. They were very prompt in responding to me and answering my questions, often the same day. I am happy I received the highest settlement that I think was possible. Thanks for a job exceptionally well done!

					- J.H.,Indiana
				





When the financial advisor we trusted with our life savings lost all of it in the stock market we did not know where to go for help. Fortunately, we found the law firm of Meyer & Associates. They aggressively pursued the brokerage firm responsible and we were delighted with the outcome. We don't know what we would have done without the lawyers and staff at Meyer & Associates - we will always be thankful for what they did for us.

					- Mr. and Mrs. H.,Ohio
				

I am thankful I had the opportunity to work with you and get to know you. Our family cannot thank you enough for the outstanding work you and your firm did to win our case. Your passion, commitment and compassion to win this case for our family were simply amazing. After going to several other attorneys who would not even take the case I was so fortunate to have found you to take the case. Right from the start you had the passion and desire to win this case for us. I have never worked with an attorney or firm as compassionate as yours. I would highly recommend your firm to anyone.

					- G.A.
				





My husband and I needed a law firm with expertise in financial investment fraud, and Meyer Wilson handled everything for us. We were very glad to find Meyer Wilson. Their entire staff made us fill that we were part of the Meyer Wilson Family.

					- A.H.
				

When our broker lost a large portion of our retirement savings, we didn't know where to turn and thought we would just have to accept that we were left with nothing.
We saw an article about Attorney David Meyer and called his office. We were not used to dealing with attorneys and didn't know what to expect, but Mr. Meyer and his staff were kind and kept us well informed about our rights. We were very satisfied with the results they were able to get for us and the short length of time it took to have some of our losses returned. Having the money reinvested has definitely made life easier for us.

					- A.W.,Ohio
				





I was a business litigation attorney for approximately 30 years and practiced law with one of largest law firms in the nation. I have been involved in many large, complex cases, and I believe I have a reasonable understanding of how lawyers and law firms should go about their work.
Everything that David P. Meyer and Associates did for me in connection with my securities arbitration claim was done in a first class manner, much as I would expect from the best large law firms. It has been my pleasure to have dealt with David Meyer and I strongly recommend his firm to anyone who has a potential investment misconduct claim.

					- R.S., Esq.,California
				

At a time in our life when we thought life would be easier because we had worked hard and carefully planned and saved for our "Golden Years", we discovered our stockbroker had lost our entire life's savings. We thought there was no hope of recovering any of it. That's when we were referred to David Meyer and Associates. Mr. Meyer and his staff explained the arbitration process and gave us hope. Thanks to their hard work, the arbitration and settlement process put us back on track. They were a Godsend when we needed them most.

					- S.W.,Kentucky
				





I accepted an early retirement from my large employer after more than 30 years, based on the recommendation of my stockbroker that I had plenty of money to live on. I put every dollar I had into my stockbroker's hand and trusted him and his brokerage firm. As the months went by, I was losing money at a alarming rate and I soon found out that many of my co-workers were losing their retirement savings with the same brokerage firm. I do not remember how I heard about David Meyer & Associates but they came to be my knight in shining armor. Hiring Mr. Meyer's law firm was probably the smartest thing I've done in my life. Dozens of my co-workers hired them too. It took some time to get through the process but David and his firm did a great job for all of us. I can honestly say that I would probably be back to working 40 hours a week again, if not for David's success with our claims.
There's an old saying, "You can't take on City Hall"; well, David did better than that - he took on this large brokerage firm......and won! I have nothing but the highest praise for David Meyer and his staff of very qualified people.

					- R.H.,Ohio
				

"We had never participated in any type of lawsuit before, but after our stockbroker mishandled our investments and nearly lost all of the money it took us over thirty years to save, we felt we needed to do something. We hired Mr. Meyer and he went to bat for us against the brokerage firm. The staff at David Meyer and Associates communicated with us regularly as they led us through the process of recovering our losses. They were always helpful and we felt well served by them. Not knowing what to expect, we were pleased with how fast we were able to obtain a recovery. Hiring Mr. Meyer to help us recover our losses has made retirement easier for us."

					- J.R.,Kentucky
				





I, and many of my coworkers, retired after 30+ years of employment and rolled over our lump-sum retirement to a national brokerage firm. The broker we entrusted with our life savings failed to protect our nest egg and we lost a big portion of our retirement. A group of us all hired David Meyer & Associates to hold the brokerage firm accountable for not investing our retirement properly. Mr. Meyer and his firm got a great result for us and we are now able to enjoy our retirement.

					- B.H.,Texas
				

My husband and I hired a financial planner to ensure the safety of our retirement nest egg, but he lost most of that money through a series of investments that were inappropriate for people at our stage in life. After my husband passed, I didn't know where to turn and had even spoken to a local attorney that did not think there was anything I could even do. I felt like the situation was my fault for trusting the broker. I heard about David Meyer & Associates and he and his staff let me know what my rights were and that there was hope through the arbitration process. They took care of everything and I was surprised at how easy they made it for me to pursue a claim. Mr. Meyer and his staff was always professional and responsive to my calls and they really took their time with me to review paperwork and mad sure that I remained well informed throughout the process. I feel like Mr. Meyer not only helped me to recover my investment losses, but he also helped me to get justice for my late husband.

					- J.S.,Ohio
				





Mr. Meyer was able to help me recover losses from my retirement account that occurred when my stockbroker failed to invest my IRA properly for someone at my stage in life. As they handled my case, Mr. Meyer and his staff were always available to answer my questions and they were responsive to my needs. I felt as if they really cared about me and my situation and I was impressed with their professionalism.

					- L. M.,Florida
				

I trusted my brokerage firm that I have been with for years with money that my father had intended to be invested in safe, secure investments to provide for my mother's living expenses after his passing as well as for his family members. The brokerage firm recommended an investment that was later found to be invested in securities different than had been represented. I was very pleased with the results that Meyer and Associates were able to obtain for me and my family.

					- J.F.,Indiana
				





I was angry when my retirement savings were mismanaged by my stockbroker. I knew I had lost most of my hard-earned money, but I was unsure of what, if anything, I could do about it. My daughter-in-law had heard of Mr. Meyer's law firm so I gave them a call. They supplied me with the information I needed to know about my rights as an investor and why I had a claim to recover some of my losses from the brokerage firm. I was very much impressed with the way they handled my claim and pleased with the result they were able to get for me. It was well worth the call.

					- G.C.,Tennessee
				

I was very pleased with Mr. Meyer’s handing of my arbitration claim. Throughout the process, I felt that I was treated with respect and I always appreciated the extra effort David Meyer and his staff put forth to recover the money my stockbroker had lost. I never felt my relationship with David was limited to an attorney-client relationship. I always thought it was more like a friend helping another friend. They did a tremendous job and when it was over, David was able to get back a lot more money for me than I ever expected. I have kept the firm’s number handy and would tell anyone that has been a victim of stockbroker misconduct to contact Meyer and Associates.

					- C.F.,Ohio
				





We were devastated when our long-time stockbroker inexcusably caused our company's pension plan and profit sharing plans to lose hundreds of thousands of dollars in unsuitable investments in just 3 short years with two different brokerage firms. Thankfully, our accountant had heard of Meyer & Associates and referred us to Mr. Meyer for help. Mr. Meyer understood that our employees were the real victims, and he dedicated himself to making the brokerage firms put as much money back into our coffers as possible. I urge anyone who thinks they have been wronged by their stockbroker or brokerage firm to seek the advice of Meyer & Associates - I am so thankful that I did.

					- M.F.,Ohio
				

Our brokerage firm recommended that we mortgage our paid-off home and then convinced us to invest the loan proceeds into unsuitable annuities. The results were devastating. We never imagined that we would be retired, with limited income, and find ourselves faced with a new mortgage payment and large investment losses. Thankfully, we hired Meyer Wilson - they skillfully guided us through the NASD (now FINRA) arbitration process and achieved an outstanding recovery for us. We do not know what we would have done without their help.

					- Mr. and Mrs. R.,Springfield, Ohio
				





From my first call to the firm to the final communication with them was a remarkable experience. The staff listened to my situation with care and concern through our entire journey. I entered with the dark shadow of fear of the unknown and Meyer Wilson walked me through my doubt and fears back into the light of reality and satisfaction. I cannot put into words the sense of security I felt while dealing with my case. The firm exemplifies professionalism in every phase of my journey through the legal system. Thank you Meyer Wilson for your council and support.

					- K.P.,Idaho
				

My wife and I became victims in a ponzi scheme set up by our financial adviser, one we had worked with for many years. He was working with a legitimate investment firm and we had no reason to believe we were being taken. He also covered his tracks very well and even his company was unaware of what he was doing. We tried to recover our losses for over a year but were unsuccessful and every road was a dead end. We heard about Meyer Wilson and contacted them for help. They worked with us extensively over the next months and they were able to recover a large amount of our lost investment. They were in contact with us throughout the whole process and kept us informed of where we stood and what we needed to do. I can't stress enough how much we appreciate all that they have done for us and what a blessing it was to find them. They come highly recommended and you would do well to contact them for assistance.

					- M.L.
				





Meyer & Associates pursued my securities arbitration case with great care and attention. They covered every detail and I am ecstatic about the results. As a lawyer myself, I can appreciate how hard they worked on my behalf. I recommend Meyer & Associates highly and without any reservation.

					- C. Hostler, Esq.,West Virginia
				

I think this is the first time I have used a law firm to resolve issues
 with regard to what I felt was a serious breach of trust and negative
 performance from a financial manager. From the moment I contacted MeyerWilson,
 I was always treated with what felt like genuine respect and real interest
 in my situation. I had some changes of personnel during it all, but the
 new people were equally respectful and competent which made everything
 feel seamless. Being my first time to work with a law firm on this type
 of issue I was constantly surprises at both the competence, skills, respect,
 thoroughness, and the pleasant ease the experience was. I highly recommend
 both the firm and their unusually qualified and helpful people working there.

					- D.G.,Salt Lake City, UT
				





The case I brought to Meyer Wilson involved more of an ethical injustice
	 and had many legal hurdles. Despite this, Mr. Chad Kohler, Esq., explained
	 thoroughly all aspects of my case, advised me using his expertise, and
	 guided me through a mediation process resulting in a satisfactory settlement.
	 Had it not been for the representation of Meyer Wilson, and in particular,
	 Mr. Kohler, I would have never had a resolution.

					- V.B.
				

My experience with Meyer Wilson proved to be a very professional, as well
	 as, personal interaction. Chad Kohler represented my case with the caring
	 and realistic guidance needed to attain a satisfactory resolution during
	 mediation. I appreciate the personal interest and legal expertise he and
	 his staff offered me during a difficult time. I was able to make an informed
	 decision and feel that with the help of Meyer Wilson my case was resolved
	 with the best possible outcome.

					- K.M.

	 clients (a California doctor and his daughter) who invested in what turned
	 out to be a longstanding Ponzi scheme operated by their broker. The clients
	 believed that they were investing in secured note funds. In reality, the
	 note funds were a sham, and the broker used the clients’ money to
	 fund a lavish lifestyle that included airplanes, a boat, and various cars
	 and motorcycles. The broker ultimately pleaded guilty to various federal
	 charges and was sentenced to 6.5 years in prison. The brokerage firm agreed
	 to settle the claims even though it alleged that it was unaware of the
	 broker’s misconduct and despite the fact that the daughter did not
	 open a brokerage account with the firm.

	 of $500,000.





Meyer Wilson Recovers $425,000 on Behalf of Michigan Ponzi Scheme Victims
Meyer Wilson negotiated settlements on behalf of two separate clients who
	 were victimized by a Ponzi scheme perpetuated by their former stockbroker.
	 The scheme involved the sale of sham investments and the improper wiring
	 of money from the customers' brokerage accounts directly to outside
	 bank accounts owned and controlled by the stockbroker. Meyer Wilson asserted
	 that the brokerage form ignored obvious red flags and failed to properly
	 supervise the activities of its licensed salesperson.

More than $425,000 of Ponzi Scheme Losses Recovered by Meyer Wilson Against Brokerage Firms
Meyer Wilson represented a group of individuals who were victims of a Ponzi
	 scheme operated by a financial advisor in Ohio. The scheme went on for
	 several years and the broker was affiliated with two different brokerage
	 firms during that time. Meyer Wilson filed a FINRA arbitration case against
	 the two firms on behalf of the group of victims and obtained a settlement
	 for the group.





$415,000 Recovered for Elderly Widow
Meyer Wilson recovered $415,000 on behalf of an elderly widow against a
	 large national brokerage firm that failed to process a husband’s
	 written instructions making his wife the beneficiary of two annuities.
	 When the husband died, the wife learned that the brokerage firm never
	 sent the change-of beneficiary forms to the annuity companies. Because
	 of the brokerage firm’s mistake, the annuity companies refused to
	 pay the widow any death benefits. Meyer Wilson successfully negotiated
	 a substantial settlement paid by the brokerage firm.

$345,000 Paid to Meyer Wilson Clients in Broker Theft Case
Meyer Wilson successfully settled claims against a brokerage firm for $345,000
	 that were brought on behalf of an elderly Michigan couple relating to
	 various fraudulent transfers made in their investment accounts by their
	 broker. The evidence uncovered by Meyer Wilson proved that the broker
	 forged transfer forms, generated phony investment certificates, and transferred
	 money directly from the clients’ investment accounts to third-party
	 bank accounts that the broker owned or controlled. The settlement amount
	 paid by the brokerage firm reflected over 98% of the money that was directly
	 withdrawn from the clients’ brokerage accounts by the broker.





Ohio Retiree Recovers Settlement of $325,000
Meyer Wilson investment fraud attorneys represented a 93-year-old man against
	 a national full-service brokerage firm and received a $325,000 settlement

Meyer Wilson Recovers $265,000 in Losses for NY Real Estate Investor Caused by Lack of Due Diligence
$265,000 lost in a tenancy-in-common (TIC) investment was recovered by the Meyer Wilson investment fraud attorneys for a New York real estate investor.

$245,000 Recovered for 89-year-old Woman
An 89-year-old woman recovered nearly a quarter million of lost retirement
	 money after Meyer Wilson filed a claim on her behalf against her brokerage
	 firm. The firm's registered representative fraudulently sold her a
	 whole life insurance policy as part of an overall investment scheme that
	 caused her significant losses and was wholly unsuitable. The money recovered
	 was a significant portion of the investments she made into the insurance
	 policy. The attorneys at Meyer Wilson were able to successfully defeat
	 the brokerage firm's motion to dismiss, which argued that claims were
	 not appropriate since the life insurance policy was not a security. The
	 arbitration panel agreed with Meyer Wilson, which argued that the life
	 insurance policy was part of an overall investment strategy recommended
	 to the claimant by her financial adviser.

Ponzi Scheme Losses Returned to California Victims
Meyer Wilson represented a group of individuals who were victims of a Ponzi
	 scheme operated by a financial adviser in California. The broker was affiliated
	 with a large independent broker-dealer during the time he sold numerous
	 fraudulent promissory notes to investors. Meyer Wilson filed a FINRA arbitration
	 case against the firm on behalf of the group of victims and recovered
	 a settlement of $225,000 for the group.





Large Independent Brokerage Firm Pays $225,000 Settlement Relating to Improper TIC Sales
A large independent broker-dealer entered into a settlement with Meyer
	 Wilson clients relating to the improper sale tenants-in-common interests,
	 or TICs, to three California customers. A TIC is an undivided interest
	 in real property. Many brokerage firms sell TICs to their customers as
	 a way to purportedly invest in commercial real estate ventures like shopping
	 malls. Meyer Wilson's claims focused on the brokerage firm's failure
	 to conduct proper due diligence and misrepresentations made by the brokerage
	 firm's registered representatives downplaying the substantial risks
	 that TICs involve.

Retired Connecticut Executive Recovers $210,000 in Lost Investments
The Meyer Wilson investment fraud attorneys recovered $210,000 for a retired
	 95-year-old Connecticut man who lost money due to investments in an unregistered
	 private investment pool managed by a brokerage firm’s registered
	 representatives.





Retired Cincinnati Couple Recovers $180,000 in Churning Case
Meyer Wilson successfully settled claims on behalf of a husband and wife
	 who were the victims of a long-time churning scheme perpetuated by their
	 stockbroker involving unit investment trusts (UITs). UITs are similar
	 to mutual funds and intended to be long-term investments, but the broker
	 in this case frequently purchased and held UITs in the customers'
	 accounts customers for only a few months at a time before selling and
	 purchasing different UITs, generating a commission on each purchase and
	 sale. The final settlement negotiated by Meyer Wilson represented a substantial
	 portion of the clients' overall losses.

Meyer Wilson Wins FINRA Arbitration - Brokerage Firm Hilliard Lyons Ordered to Pay $180,000
A Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) arbitration panel unanimously
	 ordered brokerage firm Hilliard Lyons to pay damages, attorneys' fees
	 and costs of more than $180,000 to a client represented by Meyer Wilson.
	 The brokerage firm filed an appeal in federal district court and the appealed
	 was denied in its entirety. The federal judge affirmed and upheld the
	 entire arbitration award in favor of Meyer Wilson's client.

	 professional against an independent broker-dealer for churning, unauthorized
	 trading, improper use of margin, and unsuitable investments, including

Widow Recovers $142,500 in a Non-Traded Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) Case
Meyer Wilson successfully in recovered $142,500 for a 57-year old Florida
	 widow whose life savings was invested in various unsuitable investments,
	 including non-traded real estate investment trusts (REITs). A REIT is
	 a company that owns or finances income-producing real estate. A non-traded
	 REIT is not traded on a major stock exchange. Meyer Wilson argued that
	 the investments sold to the widow were unsuitable and that the brokerage
	 firm failed to properly supervise the investment recommendations made
	 by its brokers.





Brokerage Firm and Control Person Settle Claims Relating to Improper Sales of Private Placements
A brokerage firm and one of its control persons entered into a substantial settlement involving the improper sale of highly speculative private placements to a 65-year old brokerage customer from Texas. Despite the customer's age and financial situation, the brokerage firm recommended and facilitated the customer investing a substantial portion of his life savings into eight different, highly risky, completely illiquid private placements. Each private placement ultimately failed and suffered substantial losses. In addition to being unsuitable for this particular customer, Meyer Wilson also argued that documents produced by the brokerage firm during the arbitration proved that the brokerage firm and the control person responsible for performing due diligence failed to conduct any meaningful analysis and investigation of the private placements before allowing them to be sold to the brokerage firm's customers.

Stock Option Losses Recovered
Meyer Wilson was successful in recovering $130,000 for a couple after their financial adviser invested them almost exclusively in options. Their entire life savings was decimated after the adviser recommended and sold highly risky options to the retirees who were living on a fixed income.

$100,000: Meyer Wilson Recovers Money for Labor Union Lost in Ponzi Scheme

Illinois Couple Recovers Investment Losses
Meyer Wilson investment fraud attorneys successfully recovered losses from an independent broker-dealer whose registered representative sold unapproved securities. The Meyer Wilson arbitration attorneys achieved this settlement for an Illinois couple after successfully defeating the brokerage firm's motion to dismiss, which argued that claims were not appropriate because the claimant never opened an investment account with the firm.

$650,000 Recovered for Retired Ohio Couple Relating to Whole Life Insurance Policies Sold by Their Financial Advisor
An Ohio financial advisor convinced a retired Ohio couple, both of whom
	 were in their early 70s at the time and completely free of any debt, that
	 to achieve their estate planning goals they needed to take out a $1.2
	 million mortgage on property that they owned to fund three whole life
	 insurance policies. The policies came with combined monthly premiums exceeding
	 $38,500 (or $462,000 per year). The financial advisor assured the couple
	 that the policies would ultimately pay for themselves. About three years
	 later, however, it was apparent that the policies would never work as
	 promised. By that time, the mortgage proceeds were entirely depleted,
	 and the dividends from the policies were still not nearly enough to cover
	 the hefty monthly premiums. Meyer Wilson filed claims on behalf of the
	 couple against the financial advisor’s supervising brokerage firm.
	 The brokerage firm filed a motion to dismiss arguing that it did not have
	 any duty to supervise the sale of whole life insurance. The arbitration
	 panel denied the brokerage firm’s motion. Meyer Wilson ultimately
	 negotiated a settlement recovering nearly all of the couple’s actual losses.





$650,000 Recovered for Investor in Ponzi Scheme
The victim of a large-scale Ponzi scheme in the Midwest recovered $650,000
	 of his investment losses from the brokerage firm responsible for supervising
	 the broker who sold the fraudulent securities. Meyer Wilson filed a FINRA
	 arbitration on behalf of the victim and then negotiated the settlement
	 through the process of mediation by emphasizing all the red flags of the
	 broker’s misconduct that the firm missed in its supervisory responsibilities.

Meyer Wilson Recovers $550,000 in Legal Malpractice Case
Meyer Wilson successfully settled claims against a law firm and its attorney
	 that were brought in court on behalf of two retirees for the legal malpractice
	 of an attorney attempting to represent them in an investment misconduct
	 case. The attorney had no experience representing investors against brokerage
	 firms and failed to timely file an appropriate action on their behalf.
	 The two retirees then hired Meyer Wilson to represent them. The attorneys
	 at Meyer Wilson were able to successfully argue that the clients’
	 underlying investment misconduct case was straightforward and had significant
	 value. The settlement for these clients reflects what should have happened
	 in the underlying case had the attorney properly and timely brought their
	 claims before a FINRA arbitration panel.





Over $500,000 for Texas Investors
Meyer Wilson successfully negotiated individual settlements on behalf of
	 a group of Texas investors who were each sold unsuitable investments by
	 the same stockbroker. Each investor’s portfolio was heavily concentrated
	 in oil-related stocks and sustained significant losses when the energy
	 markets declined in 2015. Many of the investors were retirees who saw
	 their portfolios decline by 50 percent or more. The brokerage firm agreed
	 to settle all of the investors’ claims within less than six months
	 after the claims were filed by Meyer Wilson.

$450,000 Recovered in Broker Theft Case Involving Large National Brokerage Firm
Meyer Wilson recovered $450,000 on behalf of a developmentally impaired
	 individual who was the victim of theft by her stockbroker. The broker
	 – who was later sentenced to five years in prison for his crimes
	 – orchestrated dozens of money transfers directly from the victim’s
	 brokerage accounts to outside third-party bank accounts that were set
	 up in the victim’s name and over which the broker controlled. From
	 there, the broker stole the victim’s money. Although the victim’s
	 brokerage accounts were entirely depleted within a short three-month timeframe,
	 documents obtained by Meyer Wilson during the course of the case showed
	 that the brokerage firm never made a single compliance inquiry into any
	 of the withdrawals. The brokerage firm agreed to settle the victim’s
	 claims for an amount in excess of the victim’s total losses.





Brokerage Firm Pays $262,500 Relating to Improper Sales of Alternative Investments
A large independent brokerage firm settled with Meyer Wilson clients relating
	 to its improper sale of several private placements and real estate investment
	 trusts. The claims on behalf of these investors focused on the lack of
	 due diligence performed on the recommended products, as well as misrepresentations
	 of the risks (or lack thereof) involved. The couple’s entire life
	 savings was decimated after they agreed to the investment proposal on
	 the belief that it was suitable for them.

Utah Retiree Recovers $172,500 in Case Involving Illiquid Alternative Investments
A 74-year-old’s savings was wiped out as a result of a highly inappropriate
	 investment plan implemented by his broker in a non-traded equipment leasing
	 fund and a non-traded real estate investment trust. His advisor continued
	 for years to misrepresent the nature and value of the investments, up
	 until the broker was fired from the firm. Meyer Wilson successfully defeated
	 a motion to dismiss by the brokerage firm and negotiated a settlement
	 of $172,500.





Meyer Wilson Settles Case Against Brokerage Firm 30 days After Filing FINRA Arbitration
An investor who suffered a 98% loss of his account while following an investment
	 recommendation to trade on margin recovered $79,000 from the brokerage
	 firm and its owner. The settlement was made within 30 days of filing the
	 FINRA arbitration. The investor had no prior experience investing on margin,
	 nor any knowledge about the risks he was recommended to take.

		Recovering Losses
		Caused By Investment Misconduct





Contingency Fee Basis
No Fee Unless We Win Your Case

	At Meyer Wilson, our
	securities fraud lawyers only work cases on a contingency fee basis, meaning that there is no fee
	 unless a positive recovery is obtained in your case. If and when our legal
	 team is able to win your case and secure financial compensation, attorney
	 fees will be based on an agreed upon percentage or sum. We do not charge
	 a retainer fee or consultation fee and there is no cost for the investigative
	 work we do prior to offering you representation. To put it simply;
	if we don't win, you don't pay.

Why contingent fees?
We choose to work cases on a conditional fee agreement for several reasons,
	 all of which are intended to ultimately benefit the people we serve. As
	 evident by our numerous successful case resolutions and positive client
	 testimonials, our use of contingent fees is another prominent aspect in
	 our firm's ability to satisfy our clients and obtain the results they need.

Focusing on Your Experience 
 We value the trust our clients place in our firm and attorneys, and we
	 reciprocate by doing everything in our power to make their experience
	 with us as smooth and comfortable as possible. We know that when individual
	 and institutional investors come to use after having been bilked by stockbrokers,
	 brokerage firms, and other entities, times can be chaotic. We understand
	 that, in many cases, our clients' livelihoods, professional careers
	 and businesses, and financial futures may be at stake. With these high
	 stakes in mind, we focus on doing our part to alleviate their worries
	 and concerns. At Meyer Wilson, we want you make your legal experience
	 and time with us and rewarding as the results you obtain. Eschewing up-front
	 fees is only one of the ways in which we accomplish this goal.


Leveling the Playing Field 
 From a logistical viewpoint, working your case on a contingency fee basis
	 allows our firm to level the playing field with some of the largest, most
	 financially powerful institutions in the country. Often, our clients'
	 claims involve immensely powerful legal opponents who have access to seemingly
	 limitless resources and powerful legal teams. By pursuing various legal
	 avenues on our own funds, we are not limited by what you are able to pursue
	 had you been required to foot the bill - these powerful entities cannot
	 force you into submission when you have our firm by your side.


Confidence in Our Abilities 
 While we view contingent fees as the ethically and logistically correct
	 avenue to take, we know that they also serve another purpose. They show
	 prospective clients that we are confident in our abilities to
	obtain successful resolutions, recover losses, and win cases. We want our clients to feel that they have the best at work for them
	 and their case, and we believe that our use of contingent fees exemplifies
	 this idea. We put our money where our mouth is and we don't shy away
	 from a challenge.
