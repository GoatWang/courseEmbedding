-Audience Member, Bethesda, Maryland


WOW!! I take to heart your teachings and was astounded to hear an accomplished man cement what I have felt deep down for a long time. You’ve reminded me that what limits us is our own beliefs and mindset. I've always known that I would succeed, but you've helped me in a very motivational way.
-Audience Member, Topeka, Kansas


What a fantastic speaker you are! You are definitely someone who has achieved success and not because of what you have accomplished financially, but what you have provided humanity.
-Audience Member, Chicago, Illinois


Your words and outlook on life are extraordinary. Thank you for sharing your story and insights with all of us.

Leadership
Transforming and Re-culturing In Challenging Times
In six short years, Dr. Qubein led High Point University through a massive transformation that skyrocketed enrollment from 1,450 to 4,100 students, increased the number of faculty from 108 to 260, and expanded the campus from 92 to 310 acres – all in the midst of the worst economic disruption in the last half century. The university invested $700 million in academics (including the founding of three new schools), student life (47 new buildings), scholarships, and athletics. How did they do it? President Qubein insists it’s all about defining a clear vision, planning a solid strategy, employing practical systems, and focusing on consistent execution. In this keynote address, he’ll outline the fundamentals that anyone can use to travel the journey from success to significance, to inspire a team towards extraordinary performance, and to render outstanding value. Come to listen and learn from a national leader with a moving life story.
Strategy/Attitude
From Success to Significance
Out of adversity emerges abundance. Difficult times often are filled with opportunities. Dr. Nido Qubein came to the United States as a teenager with little knowledge of English and only $50 in his pocket, yet ended up a mega-success story. Today, he is president of a leading university, chairman of a national retail company, and a director of two New York Stock Exchange corporations. He will share his own story, and his ideas and strategies for succeeding through even turbulent times. This dynamic, authentic, entertaining speaker delivers a powerful, inspiring message on finding focus, balance and meaning in business, and in life. You’ll leave this presentation entertained, and inspired to be impactfully innovative.
Management
Achieving Peak Performance
This presentation will show you how to prepare your employees for high productivity and your company for maximum profitability. Learn how to grow a well-trained, educated and motivated team. Dr. Nido Qubein makes an important point: Teaching people skills without giving them a vision for a better future—a vision based on common values—is only training. He goes beyond dictionary definitions to show that yesterday’s thinking looks at the tasks people perform today and asks "How can we train our future employees to do these things?” Tomorrow’s thinking looks at the kind of people needed to execute corporate strategy and finds ways to educate employees to become those kind of people.
Sales
How To Sell, Serve and Succeed
To sell effectively in today’s ever-changing, competitive world, one must master sales skills and behavioral knowledge. Dr. Nido Qubein teaches both with humor and audience involvement. He focuses on the Law of Identification (when something becomes personal it becomes important; treat every customer as if you’re about to lose them) and teaches participants to ask penetrating questions (how must this person feel first so that this person will buy from us?). Dr. Nido Qubein emphasizes: Prospects don’t want to buy your product; they want to buy the product of your product. Remember: Your service and product must be better than your competitors and your customer must readily acknowledge that.
Positioning
If I wanted to Buy What You Sell, Would I Buy It From You?
Why should people do business with you? How easily can someone else imitate what you do? Do your customers think of you first? Dr. Nido Qubein shares dynamic principles for personal and corporate achievement. It doesn’t matter how much you know or what you can do. What matters is what your customers and colleagues believe and perceive you can do for them. Do they understand and value what you are offering? Your positioning reflects other people’s confidence in your ability to do whatever you do with professional competence and expertise-how much they trust you to meet their needs. Your positioning is the way people feel about you and your work; it’s about the way you make them feel when doing business with you. Dr. Nido Qubein shows your audience how to "position” for maximum results using a practical approach and a professional strategy.
Communication
Communicate Like a Pro
Communicating effectively with people, inside your company and beyond, is a minimum-requirement skill in our ever-changing global marketplace. This presentation is designed to help your audience develop the communication skills required and to wield them with power and effectiveness. They’ll learn not only the basics, but many of the finer points Dr. Nido Qubein has picked up during a long and successful career as a professional speaker, author, and advisor to top executives and to successful companies, including specific strategies used to "connect” for persuasion and results. To date he has written a dozen books, delivered thousands of speeches, and showed millions the art of effective communication. Entertaining and educational. An audience favorite!
 



“Extraordinary! That’s how I describe your outstanding presentation to our sales associates and staff at our Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices celebration event. Through the years I have had the good fortune to hear many speakers, including both former Presidents Bush, General Norman Schwarzkopf and former Secretary of State Colin Powell. You are without a doubt the best speaker I have ever witnessed. The moment you stepped onto the stage you commanded the room and you captured the hearts of our audience. Your remarks were perfect for the occasion.”
Prudential Carolinas Realty/Berkshire Hathaway
“Nido has mobilized our team members to aspire to act in an uncommonly extraordinary fashion to differentiate ourselves in an industry where doing so has a favorable impact on our customers. When service and relationships distinguish Benco as a value added dental distributor, Nido's message heightens our awareness that it is important to provide a remarkable experience as we uniquely deliver value smile after smile. Team members commented that Nido was the best speaker we have ever had. He did a fantastic job in personalizing his presentation as if he prepared it specifically for Benco. The standing ovation says it all.”
Benco Dental
“Nido’s program was perfect and was exactly the type of program we look for to kick off our conference. It included just the right amount of serious message, humor and motivation. Nido was terrific and really made an impact on our minds and our hearts! His message is thought-provoking and will inspire all that hear him speak.”
Mechanical Service Contractors of America
“Nido did an amazing job and no one moved during his entire presentation. He received a standing ovation and I feel sure our attendees took away valuable information and were motivated to bring new ideas to their businesses. Nido is the consummate professional and a pleasure to work with and I am so glad we were able to share him with our attendees this year!”
North Carolina Association of Realtors

“Nido Qubein was universally dynamic, and the audience was riveted to his every word including his words of wisdom - all delivered with a punch of humor that kept us all laughing. I could hardly control my laughter over his rich, but common sense insight. He received a standing ovation, and I have told my children all about High Point University.”
Advanced Equities Financial Corporation

Program Descriptions

Transforming and Re-culturing In Challenging Times In six short years, Dr. Qubein led High Point University through a massive transformation that skyrocketed enrollment from 1,450 to 4,100 students, increased the number of faculty from 108 to 260, and expanded the campus from 92 to 310 acres – all in the midst of the worst economic disruption in the last half century. The university invested $700 million in academics (including the founding of three new schools), student life (47 new buildings), scholarships, and athletics. How did they do it? President Qubein insists it’s all about defining a clear vision, planning a solid strategy, employing practical systems, and focusing on consistent execution. In this keynote address, he’ll outline the fundamentals that anyone can use to travel the journey from success to significance, to inspire a team towards extraordinary performance, and to render outstanding value. Come to listen and learn from a national leader with a moving life story. From Success to Significance Out of adversity emerges abundance. Difficult times often are filled with opportunities. Dr. Nido Qubein came to the United States as a teenager with little knowledge of English and only $50 in his pocket, yet ended up a mega-success story. Today, he is president of a leading university, chairman of a national retail company, and a director of two New York Stock Exchange corporations. He will share his own story, and his ideas and strategies for succeeding through even turbulent times. This dynamic, authentic, entertaining speaker delivers a powerful, inspiring message on finding focus, balance and meaning in business, and in life. You’ll leave this presentation entertained, and inspired to be impactfully innovative. Dr. Nido Qubein is the President of High Point University and chairman of a national retail company – and one of the most sought-after leadership speakers. Achieving Peak Performance This presentation will show you how to prepare your employees for high productivity and your company for maximum profitability. Learn how to grow a well-trained, educated and motivated team. Dr. Nido Qubein makes an important point: Teaching people skills without giving them a vision for a better future—a vision based on common values—is only training. He goes beyond dictionary definitions to show that yesterday’s thinking looks at the tasks people perform today and asks "How can we train our future employees to do these things?” Tomorrow’s thinking looks at the kind of people needed to execute corporate strategy and finds ways to educate employees to become those kind of people. How To Sell, Serve and Succeed To sell effectively in today’s ever-changing, competitive world, one must master sales skills and behavioral knowledge. Dr. Nido Qubein teaches both with humor and audience involvement. He focuses on the Law of Identification (when something becomes personal it becomes important; treat every customer as if you’re about to lose them) and teaches participants to ask penetrating questions (how must this person feel first so that this person will buy from us?). Dr. Nido Qubein emphasizes: Prospects don’t want to buy your product; they want to buy the product of your product. Remember: Your service and product must be better than your competitors and your customer must readily acknowledge that. If I wanted to Buy What You Sell, Would I Buy It From You? Why should people do business with you? How easily can someone else imitate what you do? Do your customers think of you first? Dr. Nido Qubein shares dynamic principles for personal and corporate achievement. It doesn’t matter how much you know or what you can do. What matters is what your customers and colleagues believe and perceive you can do for them. Do they understand and value what you are offering? Your positioning reflects other people’s confidence in your ability to do whatever you do with professional competence and expertise-how much they trust you to meet their needs. Your positioning is the way people feel about you and your work; it’s about the way you make them feel when doing business with you. Dr. Nido Qubein shows your audience how to "position” for maximum results using a practical approach and a professional strategy. Communicate Like a Pro Communicating effectively with people, inside your company and beyond, is a minimum-requirement skill in our ever-changing global marketplace. This presentation is designed to help your audience develop the communication skills required and to wield them with power and effectiveness. They’ll learn not only the basics, but many of the finer points Dr. Nido Qubein has picked up during a long and successful career as a professional speaker, author, and advisor to top executives and to successful companies, including specific strategies used to "connect” for persuasion and results. To date he has written a dozen books, delivered thousands of speeches, and showed millions the art of effective communication. Entertaining and educational. An audience favorite!

Biography
Would you respect a man who came to the United States as a teenager with little knowledge of English, no contacts and only $50 in his pocket yet ended up a mega success story?  Would you listen to what he has to say about success?

 	Meet Nido Qubein, Ph.D. who is chairman of an international consulting firm and recipient of the highest awards given for professional speakers including the Cavett (known as the Oscar of professional speaking), the Speakers Hall of Fame, and Sales and Marketing International's Ambassador of Free Enterprise.  Toastmasters International named him the Top Business and Commerce Speaker and awarded him the Golden Gavel Medal.
Dr. Qubein served as president of the National Speakers Association that has a membership of 4,000 professionals and is the founder of the National Speakers Association Foundation where the highest award for Philanthropy is named for him.  He has been the recipient of many honors including the Ellis Island Medal of Honor, the Horatio Alger Award for Distinguished Americans, the Order of the Long Leaf Pine (North Carolina's highest civic award), an induction into Beta Gamma Sigma, the honor society for business leadership, and a Doctorate of Laws degree.
Dr. Qubein's business savvy led him to help start a bank in 1986 and today he serves on the board and executive committee of a Fortune 500 financial corporation with 110 billion-dollars in assets.  He is also chairman of a national public relations company, chairman of Great Harvest Bread Company with 218 stores in 41 states, and chairman of Business Life, Inc.  He serves on the boards of several national organizations including La-Z-Boy Corporation and the YMCA of the USA that oversees 2,600 YMCAs across the country.
Dr. Qubein is president of High Point University, an accredited undergraduate and graduate institution with 3,000 students from 33 countries.  He has written numerous books and recorded scores of audio and video learning programs that are translated in many languages.  He is an active speaker and consultant addressing more than 100 business and professional groups around the world each year.  He doesn't just talk business, he lives it.  He is an entrepreneur with active interests in real estate, advertising, and banking.
Nido Qubein's foundation provides scholarships to 48 deserving young people each year.  To-date the Qubein Foundation has granted more than 600 scholarships, worth over three million dollars.
Money magazine claims, 'Qubein puts on a memorable program, gliding from one anecdote to another.  Nearly 70 percent of his business comes from companies that have utilized him before.  His client list is a 'who's who' of blue chip corporations."
Bizlife magazine says, "He coupled his charismatic style and positive nature with his acquired knowledge of human relations and communication ... and built a multi-million dollar, multifaceted consulting enterprise--proving the American dream is still alive and well."

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.
