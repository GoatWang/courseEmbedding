(OTCQB: DIGP), an independent testing laboratory and media firm focused on the developing cannabis market, is pleased to announce that its President, Todd Denkin, will be a presenter at the Southeast Cannabis Conference on June 11, 2017, in Ft.

Mr. Denkin will be presenting at the session entitled, "Cannabis Testing, Safety & Analytics," where he will be discussing the vital role that cannabis testing plays in the emerging cannabis marketplace, the value that testing and analytics provide to cannabis consumers, and the leadership role that Digipath has achieved in the market.

Digipath, Inc. to Present at the Southeast Cannabis Conference in Florida






Jun 7, 2017, 1:49pm EDT














LAS VEGAS, June 7, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Digipath, Inc.

Lauderdale, FL.



Mr. Denkin will be presenting at the session entitled, "Cannabis Testing, Safety & Analytics," where he will be discussing the vital role that cannabis testing plays in the emerging cannabis marketplace, the value that testing and analytics provide to cannabis consumers, and the leadership role that Digipath has achieved in the market.
For more information about this event please click here https://seccexpo.com/.
Mr. Denkin commented, "Cannabis lab testing is evolving from traditional potency and pesticide testing to a focus on strain identification, data analytics and ultimately consumer protection.  Cannabis consumers should have full confidence in the "health" of the cannabis products they are consuming as well as full transparency on the specific strains and products that they are buying."

Digipath Labs began earning substantive revenue in October 2015 and has now tested more than 2,000 cannabis product samples, representing over 8,500 pounds of cured flower from many of the 34 growers licensed by the State of Nevada. 
Emerald Badge Awards
Digipath Labs, a wholly owned subsidiary of Digipath, Inc., has been awarded the Emerald Test Badge for both potency and microbial screening, following administration of the Fall 2016 ring test to 28 cannabis testing labs in the United States. The Emerald Test® uses the standard Inter-laboratory Comparison Proficiency Testing (ILC/PT) program for evaluating how accurately and dependably testing labs perform, by comparing how well the lab measures anonymous samples. ILC/PT programs are common in many testing industries, including environmental, food, pharmaceutical, water and petrochemical, providing a point of reference on how well the testing labs are performing individually and as a group. Individual labs can use their ILC/PT results to either verify proficiency to their customers and state regulatory bodies or to point out analytical tests needing further validation effort.
The Emerald Potency Test requires the quantitative determination of five cannabinoids: THC, THC-A, CBD, CBDA and CBN in methanol between 10-1,000 µg/ml. The Emerald Test Advisory Panel uses a criteria of scoring within 2 standard deviations on cannabinoid analytes to determine which labs receive an Emerald Test Badge, which can be used to demonstrate the lab's proficiency and commitment to a higher standard of excellence in Cannabis Testing.

Recognizing that the legal cannabis industry’s youthfulness has resulted in a lack of structure and oversight, Digipath developed its lab testing solutions and technology to create structure and process and, in the end, ensure maximum cannabis safety through education, testing, and certification.
Digipath Labs Certification



The Company offers comprehensive medical cannabis safety screening and an independent certification system, including the “Digipath Labs Certified” certification seal.
Certification seals are made available to those clients whose products have undergone all of Digipath tests (as applicable), unless the sample in question does not meet local regulatory standards.
Digipath Certified Seals ensure that Digipath has tested the product in question, and influence consumer buying decisions by clearly marking which brands are invested in the products that provide, valuing safety, effectiveness, and overall quality.

Digipath Inc (OTCMKTS:DIGP) is making a highly explosive move up on accelerating volume in recent days after reversing off $0.01 lows earlier this month.
The move up has been marked by steady accumulation and excellent support at every new level achieved. DIGP is being promoted by a number of outfits.
Digipath Inc (OTCMKTS:DIGP) supports the cannabis industry’s best practices for reliable testing, education, and training, and brings unbiased cannabis news coverage to the cannabis industry. Its four business units are DigiPath Labs, TNMNews Corp., DigiPath Corp., and DigiPath U.
DigiPath Corp.’s line of advanced digital pathology and advisory solutions include marketing, product development, sales, outreach, operations, customer service, regulatory, and financial management services for the healthcare industry.
DigiPath Labs™ is gearing up to set the industry standard for testing all forms of cannabis-based products using FDA-compliant laboratory equipment and processes to ensure product—and patient—safety and efficacy.
DigiPath Education and Training is developing a two-day seminar and a modularized six-week, instructor-facilitated online course for people who want to learn more about cannabis or are seeking employment in the new industry.
TNMNews’ balanced and unbiased cannabis news site and talk radio show focus on the political, economic, medicinal, and cultural dimensions of the rapidly evolving—and profoundly controversial—marijuana industry.

Cannabisfn.com is currently promoting DIGP and has listed cash and stock in their disclaimer page on their website. They announced on March 26 that ”DigiPath is a diversified provider of reliable testing, educational programs, and unbiased news coverage focused on the burgeoning cannabis industry through its four business units – DigiPath Labs, TNMNews Corp, DigiPath Corp, and DigiPath University. By leveraging synergies between these various divisions, the company aims to build the industry’s premier conglomerate.”
The press release which is clearly bias in DGIP favor goes on to say ”DigiPath Labs aims to set the industry standard for testing all forms of cannabis-based products using FDA-compliant laboratory equipment and processes to measure safety and efficacy. Since securing a permit from the State of Nevada to open a cannabis-testing laboratory in June of 2014, the company has completed the construction of a $1.4 million facility that’s slated to open in just a few weeks.
“Patient safety starts with adhering to standardized, rigorous analytical techniques,” said DigiPath Inc. Chief Science Officer Dr. Cindy Orser, who heads up the DigiPath Labs subsidiary, in a recent press release. “We believe we have developed best-in-class procedures to test dried plant material and byproducts from the cannabis plant for potency and contaminants.”
The market for cannabis testing services has been consistently growing alongside the medical and recreational marijuana industries. With a growing number of products targeting the space, there’s an increasing need for laboratories designed to screen for potentially harmful contaminants like solvents, pesticides, mold, heavy metals, or microbial contaminants.
On March 18 DIGP announced it has entered into a preferred supplier marketing and resource-sharing agreement with Blue Line Protection Group. The agreement was designed to create synergies between Blue Line’s cannabis industry protection, compliance and transportation services, and DigiPath Labs’ testing and analytical services of cannabis-based products and media distribution.
In this cooperative relationship, DigiPath Labs and Blue Line are expected to share certain resources in Colorado and other states where both companies will operate. Blue Line and DigiPath have also agreed to promote each other as a “preferred vendor” through direct product and service referrals and through advertisements on Blue Line Smart Ads, the revenue-generating interactive displays available for free to marijuana-related businesses.

The Company operates in the red hot cannabis sector and has been making some big moves as of late.
