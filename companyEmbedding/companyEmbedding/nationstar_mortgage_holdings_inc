CHANDLER, AZ

It’s probably the only town in the world named after a Canadian veterinarian. Folley Street is named after the late Zora Folley, a former city councilman and ex- heavyweight contender who once fought Muhammad Ali. Notable past and current residents of Chandler include pro wrestler Shawn Michaels, rapper Ice-T, and legendary NFL player (and Coca-Cola ad star) “Mean Joe” Greene. It was named the 12th best place to run in and the 10th best place to fitness walk in the US. It is a little odd that the walkers finished ahead of the runners.

CHENNAI, INDIA

Chennai is home to Asia’s largest library, the Anna Centenary Library. It has a capacity of 1.2 million books and is built on eight acres of land. Until 1996, Chennai’s official name was Madras. Its bustling modern auto industry has earned it the nickname “The Detroit of South Asia”. Chennai is a beach destination. Its Marina Beach is 3.7 miles long, making it the world’s second-longest urban beach.

IRVINE, CA

LA Fitness and In-N-Out Burger are both headquartered here, making it easy to work off that Double Double and “Animal Style” fries. Irvine is seventh in the nation when it comes to people over twenty-five years old who hold doctorates.   Never, ever get into a Trivial Pursuit game for money if you’re here. It was named as one of the ten best cities to raise kids. Rage Against the Machine frontman Zack de la Rocha, actor Will Ferrell, and Olympic swimmer Amanda Beard were all raised here. (Hmm, there might be something to that great place to raise kids ranking).

HIGHLANDS RANCH, CO

It was once claimed for France as part of Louisiana. Le Oops. It has over seventy miles of trails. Eighty-five percent of all homes here are within a quarter mile of a park. Highlands Ranch has four dog parks. We’re not sure what percentage of dogs lives within a quarter mile of a dog park. They didn’t respond to our email.

DALLAS, TX

Twenty-three of the 100 richest Americans live here. German chocolate cake was invented here. We can’t confirm the rumor that the cowboy hat was invented in Munich. Dallas has the biggest arts district in the country. The microchip was invented here. So was the ATM, which came in handy for the guy who invented the microchip.

Long History of Providing Solutions to Our Customers
   Our Commitment At Nationstar, we believe in keeping the dream of homeownership alive, and we’re on a mission to make the home loan journey more rewarding and less worrisome for our customers. How We’re Helping Homeowners  Over the last year, we helped more than 65,000 customers stay in their homes through modifications and HARP refinances.1 When a payment solution is needed, it’s our goal to find the best option for each customer. Over the last year, we helped customers save an average of $3,550 annually through loan modifications.1 We partner with government and non-profit organizations to find the right solutions to keep our customers in their homes. We’ve participated in 50 community events nationwide meeting face-to-face with more than 700 customers who need help.1   We’re Focused on Preventing Foreclosures  Our goal is to help our customers stay in their homes, and we do everything we can to prevent foreclosures. It’s better for the customer and our business to find ways to modify troubled loans and prevent foreclosures. Keeping customers current on their payments is a win-win for everyone. Over the last year, we helped 39,000 customers transition from delinquent to current on their home loan.1 We aim to be a helpful resource when our customers need us most, so we partner with HUD certified housing counseling agencies to assist with foreclosure prevention, credit repair, budget counseling and pre-purchase counseling.  Customer Service Is In Our DNA  We know that a great customer experience is built by doing a million little things right, so we’re building on our track record of customer service knowing even small improvements can lead to big impacts. We redefined our values and each one of us strives everyday to be Champions for our customers, Challengers of convention and Cheerleaders for our team. Our renewed focus on improving the customer experience is making a big impact. We’ve seen overall customer complaints drop by 50%.2

It purchases closed mortgage loans from community banks, credit unions, mortgage brokers and mortgage bankers.XomeThe Xome segment is a provider of technology and data-enhanced solutions to home buyers, home sellers, real estate professionals and companies engaged in the origination and/or servicing of mortgage loans.

FHA loans can be used to purchase a home or refinance an existing mortgage, and there are many benefits to having an FHA loan. You can purchase a home with low down payment or use a streamline refinance to lower your payment, with less documentation than a traditional loan.
FHA Overview
FHA home loans are mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration. These mortgages are backed by the federal government, which helps FHA-approved lenders extend home financing to buyers who are unable to qualify for a conventional home loan. The FHA doesn’t issue mortgages, the agency provides insurance on mortgage payments, so more borrowers are able to attain home financing.  FHA loans are a type of federal assistance designed to make homeownership more affordable. Though they were originally intended for borrowers with less than perfect credit, they are now popular with a wider group of borrowers.
FHA Refinance Benefits

Less than perfect credit?
Cash-out refinance for any purpose
Finance home improvements like painting or new appliances
Streamline to a lower rate and payment

Call us to see if you qualify.

This is a VA program. Current guidelines for VA Financing can be found at http://www.benefits.va.gov/homeloans/index.asp. The advertised loan is a 5/1 ARM (Adjustable Rate Mortgage) with a 30-year fully amortizing term. The initial interest rate 2.750% for 60 months. The disclosed APR is based on the payment of 0.000 discount points. For a $400,000.00 loan, there is a 3.553% APR with an initial monthly principal and interest payment of $1633.00 for the first 60 months. After the initial 60 month period, the variable interest rate and payment will adjust every year and equal the total of the 1-year Treasury index (1.230% as of 07/20/2017) plus a margin of 2.250%. There is no prepayment penalty. Interest rate quoted assumes a purchase or rate-term refinance with 45 day lock pricing at 100% loan-to-value (LTV), a minimum FICO score of 740 on a primary residence. Interest rates and payments may increase after consummation. Rate is variable and can increase by no more than 5.000 percentage points every year after the initial period expires, with a lifetime maximum adjustment of 5.000% (7.750% for this example). If the interest rate adjusted to the maximum rate, which could not occur until after the fifth year, the maximum monthly payment would be $2866.00. The actual interest rate, APR and payment may vary based on the specific terms of the loan selected, verification of information, your credit history, the location and type of property, and other factors as determined by Lender. Interest rate and APR are variable and subject to increase or decrease. Not available in all states. Rates and terms are effective 07/20/2017 and are subject to change without notice. Payments shown do not include taxes or insurance, actual payment obligations will be greater. Conditions and restrictions apply. Not all applicants will qualify.
