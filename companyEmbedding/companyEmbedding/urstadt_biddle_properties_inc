GREENWICH, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Urstadt 
      Biddle Properties Inc. (NYSE: UBA and UBP) announced today that it 
      has acquired the Waldwick Plaza Shopping Center in Waldwick, NJ. 
      Waldwick Plaza is a 26,500 square foot shopping center, whose tenants 
      include a U.S. Post Office, Supercuts, Verizon, Massage Envy, The Little 
      Gym, and local tenants such as a liquor store, dry cleaner, nail salon, 
      and Italian restaurant.
    


      Waldwick Plaza is located at the traffic-lighted intersection of 
      Franklin Turnpike and Wyckoff Avenue, the most prominent retail location 
      in the town of Waldwick. The property is 2/10ths of a mile from UBP’s 
      Rite Aid Plaza, also on Franklin Turnpike in Waldwick, which affords UBP 
      the benefit of economies of scale for management. Daily traffic counts 
      in front of the center are roughly 23,500. Waldwick is a highly 
      desirable Bergen County town that is a 30 minute drive to Manhattan. 
      Demographically, 80,000 people live within 3 miles of the subject 
      property earning a median household income of $126,000 per year.
    

      Willing Biddle, President and CEO of Urstadt Biddle Properties Inc. 
      said, “Waldwick Plaza is a solid neighborhood property at a great 
      location in a great community that is leased to internet-resistant 
      tenants and is just down the street from another property we own. The 
      property is fully leased and has a long history of high occupancy. We 
      plan to replace the roof, and make other repairs to the property to 
      enhance its value. It will be a solid long-term investment for our 
      company.” Zach Fox, Vice President of Acquisitions added, “This was 
      another very smooth off-market transaction and we’re pleased to continue 
      to grow our footprint in Bergen County and the greater Northern New 
      Jersey trade area.”
    

Urstadt Biddle Properties Inc. is a self-administered equity real 
      estate investment trust which owns or has equity interests in 81 
      properties containing approximately 5.0 million square feet of space.
Listed on the New York Stock Exchange since 1970, it provides 
      investors with a means of participating in ownership of income-producing 
      properties. It has paid 190 consecutive quarters of uninterrupted 
      dividends to its shareholders since its inception and has raised total 
      dividends to its shareholders for the last 23 consecutive years.

      Hayes, CFO, or James Aries, SVP or Zach Fox, VP Urstadt Biddle

Urstadt Biddle Properties Named Top Dividend Stock With Insider Buying and 4.84% Yield
In this series, we look through the most recent Dividend Channel ''DividendRank'' report, and then we cherry pick only those companies that have experienced insider buying within the past six months. The officers and directors of a company tend to have a unique insider's view of the business, and presumably the only reason an insider would choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money — maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both.

Urstadt Biddle Properties Inc. Acquires Waldwick Plaza In Waldwick, NJ






Business Wire




Jul 21, 2017 4:51 PM EDT













 




























































  Urstadt Biddle Properties Inc. (NYSE: UBA and UBP) announced today that it has acquired the Waldwick Plaza Shopping Center in Waldwick, NJ. Waldwick Plaza is a 26,500 square foot shopping center, whose tenants include a U.S. Post Office, Supercuts, Verizon, Massage Envy, The Little Gym, and local tenants such as a liquor store, dry cleaner, nail salon, and Italian restaurant.  Waldwick Plaza is located at the traffic-lighted intersection of Franklin Turnpike and Wyckoff Avenue, the most prominent retail location in the town of Waldwick. The property is 2/10ths of a mile from UBP's Rite Aid Plaza, also on Franklin Turnpike in Waldwick, which affords UBP the benefit of economies of scale for management. Daily traffic counts in front of the center are roughly 23,500. Waldwick is a highly desirable Bergen County town that is a 30 minute drive to Manhattan. Demographically, 80,000 people live within 3 miles of the subject property earning a median household income of $126,000 per year.  Willing Biddle, President and CEO of Urstadt Biddle Properties Inc. said, "Waldwick Plaza is a solid neighborhood property at a great location in a great community that is leased to internet-resistant tenants and is just down the street from another property we own. The property is fully leased and has a long history of high occupancy. We plan to replace the roof, and make other repairs to the property to enhance its value. It will be a solid long-term investment for our company." Zach Fox, Vice President of Acquisitions added, "This was another very smooth off-market transaction and we're pleased to continue to grow our footprint in Bergen County and the greater Northern New Jersey trade area."  Urstadt Biddle Properties Inc. is a self-administered equity real estate investment trust which owns or has equity interests in 81 properties containing approximately 5.0 million square feet of space. Listed on the New York Stock Exchange since 1970, it provides investors with a means of participating in ownership of income-producing properties. It has paid 190 consecutive quarters of uninterrupted dividends to its shareholders since its inception and has raised total dividends to its shareholders for the last 23 consecutive years.  For additional information, please contact Willing L. Biddle, CEO, John Hayes, CFO, or James Aries, SVP or Zach Fox, VP Urstadt Biddle Properties Inc. at 203-863-8200.
