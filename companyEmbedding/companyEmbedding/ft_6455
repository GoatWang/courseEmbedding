Are you considering purchasing a new home? Are you thinking about selling your current home? Or, maybe you're just eager to refinance while interest rates are low?
Whatever the case may be, you'll need to know the value of the property in question. Our home value search can provide you with a wealth of information, and unlike a costly appraisal, it's completely free.
Our home prices are calculated using a proprietary algorithm that takes recent comparable sales, neighborhood data, and specific property information into account when creating a broad property value estimate.
We're not suggesting that you use our home value estimate in lieu of an appraisal from a trained professional when selling, purchasing, or refinancing, but it's the perfect source when you just need a reasonable estimate and you don't want to wait.
In addition to a ballpark value figure, you'll have access to valuable data, incuding transaction histories, home features, mortgage insurance and property tax estimates, and recent local sales.
And if you're looking for mortgage or refinance rates, you'll find them right there, right where you need them: on our price estimate page.
Whether you're just daydreaming or you've started hunting for a home in earnest, we hope you'll find our free home pricing page to be a valuable research tool.

What Will Be the Lasting Impact of Brexit on US Mortgages?
Steve Cook
 Although Britain will not actually implement June’s Brexit referendum to leave the European Union until next March at the earliest, it has already made a major impact on US mortgage rates. Will the long term impact of Brexit be as significant?
Within days of the referendum, uncertainty about the potential impact of Brexit on European economies caused investors to sell riskier global stocks and buy safer...





Home Values & Sold Home Prices

                    One of the events this city prides itself in is the annual Wichita River Festival which runs June 2-10.  There are just too many events available for people of all ages for me to write them all down.  Please go to WichitaRiverfest.com for additional information.  That said, there are a number of places you can buy your Riverfest buttons which gain you entry to the events.  My two favorites are Quiktrip and Dillons grocery stores.   
This year we have a newly developed Riverfest Mobile App for the IPhone and Android designed to coordinate with Riverfest 2017's official artwork. The app, developed by Clutch Studios, will provide attendees with maps, event and concert schedules, notifications of festival updates, and even a scavenger hunt game that encourages Riverfest fans to explore the festival and identify locations with a series of clues.  The Riverfest Mobile App will be available to download for your IPhone and Adroid starting later this month.
Come join the fun, and make this a yearly event for you and yours.

HAPPY SUMMER!
