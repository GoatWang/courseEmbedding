Dear Kemper Investors Life Policyowner:                                         

Zurich Kemper Life is pleased to send you the 1996 Annual Reports for the funds 
underlying your investment choices in the Kemper Advantage III annuity as of    
December 31, 1996.  You should note that there is a separate Annual Report for  
each family of funds.                                                           

1996 was a year of incredible growth in the stock market and for some of the    
funds available in your Kemper Advantage III annuity.  Because your annuity's   
earnings are tax-deferred, they potentially grow at higher rate than if they    
were taxable investments.  Also, with Kemper Advantage III's unique team of     
quality investment managers, you have the ability to diversify your money       
between many different portfolios.  You can also take advantage of the          
opportunity to diversify your accounts through Zurich Kemper Life's unlimited   
tax-free transfer feature.                                                      

Kemper Advantage III also offers you many options when you choose to begin      
receiving payments. You can receive guaranteed payments over a certain period   
of time, for the rest of your life or over the lifetimes of both you and your   
spouse.  Not only does this guarantee that you will always have an income, in   
some cases it can help spread the taxes over all of the payments instead of     
having to pay them all at once.                                                 

As always, please remember to review your Kemper Advantage III Prospectus       
before you invest further or send any additional money.  Zurich Kemper Life is  
committed to helping you satisfy your long-term insurance and financial needs.  
If you have any questions or concerns regarding your Kemper Advantage III       
annuity, please feel free to contact our Client Services Team at 800-621-5001.  
Or, check out our exciting and diverse web site at www.ZurichKemper.com for     
the latest news and information regarding new products, improved technology,    
etc.  Thank you for continuing to be a part of the Zurich Kemper Life family    
and we pledge to assist you in taking care of your financial needs because      
that's the way life should be.                                                  

Sincerely,

Dear Kemper Investors Life Policyowner:                                         

Zurich Kemper Life is pleased to send you the 1996 Annual Report for the funds  
underlying your investment choices in the Kemper Passport annuity as of         
December 31, 1996.

funds available in your Kemper Passport annuity.  Because your annuity's        
earnings are tax-deferred, they potentially grow at a higher rate than if they  
were taxable investments.  Also, with the addition of seven new Kemper          
portfolios on May 1, 1996, you have even more choices than before.  You can     
also take advantage of the opportunity to diversify your accounts through       
Zurich Kemper Life's tax-free transfer feature.
