All-Cap Core




We employ contrarian thinking and a value methodology to construct a 50-60 stock portfolio, diversified by market capitalization and sector exposure. Art and science converge as we conduct our extensive in-house fundamental research. With a 3-5 year time horizon, we look to identify undervalued stocks within under-followed or unloved areas of the market.

Our Process




New Idea Generation: Identify low expectation stocks
We utilize multiple resources to generate new ideas for our portfolios. Many of our new ideas fall into the categories of: special situations, asset plays, busted IPO’s, spin-offs, out of favor stocks and under-appreciated stocks with limited Wall Street coverage. With annual turnover of approximately 20%, our goal is to find up to ten exceptional new investment ideas per year.
Comprehensive Analysis: A process where art and science converge
Our focus is on:
Business Drivers
Understanding a business is not as simple as “what does this company do?”, or as detailed as “how many units will this company sell to the rural markets in western Brazil this quarter?” In the global economy there are many complex forces that determine the success of a business and we seek to truly understand the ones that matter for the long-term. What gives the company competitive advantages over its competition? Why are these advantages sustainable? We use a combination of research and intuition as the foundation of our investment process.
Management
Before investing in a company, we conduct our version of “detective work”  focused on management’s credibility and ability to execute.  We use historical, archived conference calls to gain a  perspective rather than only getting the current “story” from the Investor Relations Department or meeting management for the first time.  Management execution is especially important in small-cap stocks in our opinion, accounting for up to 80% of their success.
Financials
We look to uncover assets trading below our perception of their intrinsic value, based on potential catalysts we expect to develop.  Balance sheet strength, cash flow and sustainable revenue growth are also key ingredients to identifying a Winslow stock.   
Valuation
By eliminating the potential manipulation of earnings, the Price to Sales metric has been a very successful tool for assessing a company’s valuation.  We review Price to Sales as well as other typical metrics and view them relative to a company’s history and the specific sector or industry.  Through our valuation work, we are able to purchase companies at prices with an imbedded margin of safety.  
Portfolio Construction & Risk Controls: Build a diversified portfolio using an incremental approach
Both equity strategies are diversified by sector exposure, yet remain concentrated enough to provide the best chance for outperformance.  The All-Cap strategy invests in 50-60 holdings, with a 5% maximum individual stock weighting risk control, while the Small-Cap strategy invests in 30-40 holdings with a 7% maximum individual stock weighting limit.  While some All-Cap managers merely have the ability to invest across the market capitalization spectrum, our clients benefit by having a minimum of 20% and a maximum of 60% in each market capitalization category at all times. 
Sell Discipline: Sell when expectations are high or investment story has changed
Companies are sold when the position size becomes too large, financial metrics are no longer attractive, price targets have been met, business fundamentals have changed or a better investment idea is identified. In addition, our stocks  have been taken over by larger companies or Private Equity firms.

Customizable Equity and Balanced Strategies for High Net Worth Investors
We manage equity strategies and balanced strategies, which are a blend of holdings based on the risk profile and liquidity needs of each client.  Approximately half of our individual clients utilize Winslow as the sole asset manager for their entire liquid net worth. In these instances, we work with the client to determine the appropriate allocation of stocks, bonds and cash to meet their short and long-term needs. 
The other half of our high net worth clients utilize Winslow in a multi-manager environment where we compliment the investment styles/objectives of their other asset managers, sometimes with the partnership of an outside investment consultant. 
Given the flexible and opportunistic nature of our All-Cap strategy, Winslow provides a well-diversified core equity option.  The Small-Cap strategy is suitable for individuals with a greater risk tolerance and a willingness to withstand additional market volatility while looking  for higher long-term returns.
A Focus on Asset Management
We are not all things to all people. Our team focuses on our niche, which is picking stocks and providing exceptional long term investment performance for our clients.   It is just as important to understand what we don’t do as it is to know what we do best.  Adding non-core functions to a “menu of services” would be a distraction rather than a benefit to our clients.   We understand that a comprehensive financial plan goes beyond asset management.  That is why we collaborate with our clients’ other partners, such as tax and estate attorneys, accountants and family offices or investment consultants to make sure that, together, we bring best in class services to our clients.
A Personal Touch
We provide high quality investment options with the personal touch to high net worth clients.  With an intentionally low client/portfolio manager ratio of 20:1, we, by design, are accessible.  Our clients can tailor the frequency and means of communication. When transitioning an existing equity portfolio to Winslow, we pay careful attention to the potential tax consequences, and partner with the client and their accountants to move forward strategically and therefore personalize portfolios.

We create a customized Balanced portfolio based on your risk tolerance and liquidity needs.  The portfolio contains a combination of the equity positions within our All-Cap Core strategy and Corporate, Government and Municipal bonds, depending on the tax status of your account.  Given our 3-5 year time horizon and resulting low portfolio turnover, this strategy is ideal for both non-taxable and taxable accounts.

Our Philosophy




Research Driven
At Winslow, we have a firm culture which embraces a consistent and repeatable process. We look to identify low expectation stocks that are either under-followed by traditional sell-side firms or  unloved by the market. We strive to understand our companies and what drives them better than our peers. Identifying catalysts before they develop is a key component to our process. Evaluating a management team’s ability to execute is especially critical in the small-cap space.
Contrarian
Our long-term experience investing in value stocks and our contrarian mind-set makes us predisposed to run toward fires, not away from them. Additionally, our 3-5 year investment horizon allows us to arbitrage time and take advantage of  short-term market volatility. We are students of the concepts of Behavioral Finance and utilize this philosophy throughout our research process.
Our Midwest location and roots also provide a unique perspective, avoiding the herd mentality often found on Wall Street.  While we embrace the scientific models and metrics used in evaluating companies,we believe that this approach must be combined with the artistic aspects of picking good investments.
Core with a Value Tilt
We are always looking for good companies or those that can become good companies. We just prefer to buy them when others don’t perceive them favorably, allowing us to opportunistically purchase these mispriced investments with the most upside potential. We firmly believe that, at an inflated price, even the best company is a poor investment, yet at a depressed price even a perceived “junky” company can be a great investment.

Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time. I've been really satisfied for the most part. They report quickly and accurately, remind me when my bill is due, and the customer service has been kind and thorough....show more

The Business Gold Rewards Card from American Express OPEN


                                            Approached at airport to sign up for this card. Already had a few. Signed up anyway as some pressure applied.

Bed Bath & Beyond® Credit Card


                                            The Bed Bath & Beyond Mastercard was purchased from US Bank in October 2016. My advice: If you have been with US Bank and made the transition to Comenity - check your credit report. Comenity reports twice and never reports the old account closed, so it looks like you have 2...show more

Woodforest National Bank


                                            It is my opinion that you would do better to find a different company. In the long run they will charge you plenty and the support is virtually non-existent. They don't even have a working answering system. They are disorganized  and a nightmare to work with.

                                            It's not the worst, but it's certainly deceptive. I can't trust a company that lies to me for two bucks.

Veridian Credit Union


                                            i love banking with veridian, but the new updated online banking is garbage.10x harder to navigate than before staring from the log in page. Making simple transfers or even looking at accounts is harder and more confusing. bring back the old version.

                                            Grange Insurance added a 58% surcharge to our auto policy after a icy bridge weather related accident.  The increase totaled of $1042.00.

Lowe's Store Card


                                            You will never get a credit line increase. I have good credit and zero late payments and get turned down every time. I don't have this problem with any of my other credit accounts. Had my account over a year in good standing. Paid it down to zero twice. What a joke!

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
