Diagnostics





What is it?


What is diagnostic testing?
Diagnostic testing involves tests and procedures to confirm the presence of disease and identify the correct tumor type, location, extent and stage. At Cancer Treatment Centers of America® (CTCA), we use sophisticated diagnostic technology to pinpoint and evaluate tumors, and develop a personalized treatment plan.
Experienced care team
Our diagnostic team includes physicians across many medical specialties, including radiologists, pathologists and geneticists. They have expertise in using advanced, minimally invasive diagnostic tests and procedures to diagnose the disease.
Advanced diagnostics
A thorough and accurate cancer diagnosis is the first step in developing an individualized cancer treatment plan. When you first visit one of our hospitals, we will perform a complete array of diagnostic tests to accurately confirm your diagnosis and plan your individualized treatment. 
This initial diagnostic evaluation typically takes about three to five days. 
The following are some common diagnostic tests:

A review of health history
Physical examination
Laboratory tests (blood, urine, etc.)
Biopsy
Imaging tests (X-ray, PET/CT, MRI, ultrasound, etc.)
Nuclear medicine scans (bone scans, etc.)
Endoscopy
Genetic tests

Diagnostics plays an important role throughout your cancer treatment: 

Before treatment, we will accurately locate tumors, stage the disease, and determine an appropriate combination of cancer treatments for you. Tumor molecular profiling helps us identify the right chemotherapy or targeted therapy drugs before treatment, which reduces unnecessary toxicity and identifies an appropriate treatment approach from the start.
During your treatment, we will track the size of the tumor, progression of the disease, and your response to treatment, and modify your treatment accordingly. Minimally invasive tools like navigational bronchoscopy and endoscopic ultrasound allow us to find and reach very small tumors without the risks of surgery. 
After you complete treatment, we will follow up with you to evaluate any symptoms you may have, and schedule regular check-ups to monitor for any signs of metastasis or recurrence. Technologies like the Discovery™ PET/CT 600 allow us to accurately detect small lesions in areas of the body subject to movement, like the breasts, lungs, colon and prostate.

Genomic testing 
CTCA offers expanded genomic tumor assessment. This tool reveals the DNA alterations that are driving the growth of a cancer. By identifying the mutations that occur in a cancer cell's genome, our physicians can better understand what caused the tumor and provide cancer treatment therapies that specifically target changes in the tumor's genomic profile. 
Because genomic testing is a rapidly developing area of medical science, there are currently only a few cancers where such testing is considered to be routine in the evaluation of possible treatment options. Your oncologist will help determine if you are a good candidate for genomic testing.
Accommodating your needs
We understand that waiting for diagnostic test results can create a great deal of stress. To ease anxiety and help you begin your cancer treatment sooner, we provide reduced wait times for appointments and test results. 
We also want you to be as comfortable as possible during your imaging tests. Our team uses padding and comfort equipment, as well as a variety of positioning devices, to help you feel more relaxed during scans and procedures.

					Cancer Markers	






We developed innovative pre-cancerous diagnostic markers which might have the potential to replace HPV testing for cervical cancer in the future.
These markers are not just saying there is a risk of cancer because of the detection of an HPV virus. Instead it identifies the small fraction of HPV infections that are likely to progress to cancer.
Please see the following study confirming our research strategy from March 5, 2015:
The DNA load of six high-risk human papillomavirus types and its association with cervical lesions.
These results are consistent with those in a number of other recent papers and with some of the things that we have been seeing with our new assay and associated algorithms. One of most important of these for our purposes is that cells that contain high levels of high risk HPV are actually relatively low risk for the development of cervical cancer with the specific type of HR HPV being a secondary factor. What this says is that even the genotyping HPV tests can be misleading unless morphology is also factored in.
MEDITE currently is following the necessary regulatory steps to prepare these new products for market entry.

					Industry Segment	






Definition:
Histology - Cancer Diagnostics based on Tissue/Biopsies
Cytology - Cancer Diagnostics based on Cells
Serious and final diagnostics of cancer or precancerous situations are only possible in using either cells or the tissue. Other diagnostics methods are generally an addition but not a replacement of it. The trend towards more personalized treatment of cancer need the original cell or tissue sample for creating and testing the best alternative. This segment will therefore be increasingly important for future development of strategies to fight the “cancer epidemic” (WHO) with an expected about 50 % increase in cancer cases worldwide within the next 20 years.
The general industry trends are Higher Automation for more throughput in bigger laboratories, Process Standardization, Digitalization of cell and tissue slides and Computer Aided Diagnostic Systems, earlier diagnostics of cancer combined in cost effective solutions. Most governments in the world are planning to increase their investments in better cancer detection but try to keep their health care spendings
MEDITE is a one stop shop for Histology laboratories either as part of a hospital, as part of a chain of laboratories or individually. It is one out of only four companies worldwide offering all equipment and consumables for this kind of laboratories. The MEDITE Brand stand for innovative and high quality products – most equipment made in Germany – and competitive pricing.
For the Cytology market MEDITE offers consumable products and equipment in particular for Liquid Based Cytology which is the important tool in cancer screening and detection in the field of cervical, breast, lung and other cancer types.
Therefore MEDITE products are also the first choice for the growing demand in emerging countries.
This unique combination of advanced technology, cost effective consumables and new cancer markers offers Histology and Cytology laboratories the most innovative tools for an early diagnostic of pre-cancerous or cancerous conditions to help more patients to get the right and gentle treatment to continue a normal life.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Overview  MEDITE Cancer Diagnostics, Inc. (the "Company", "it", "we", or "us"), formerly CytoCore, Inc., specializes in the marketing and selling of MEDITE core products (instruments and consumables), manufacturing, development of new solutions in histology and cytology and marketing of molecular biomarkers. These premium medical devices and consumables are for detection, risk assessment and diagnosis of cancerous and precancerous conditions and related diseases. Depending upon the type of cancer, segments within the current target market of approximately $5.8 billion are growing at annual rates between 10% and 30%. The well-established brand of MEDITE Cancer Diagnostics is well received and remains a professional description of the Company's business. The Company's trading symbol is "MDIT".  In 2016 we focused on implementation of several growth opportunities including enhanced distribution of core products through focused sales and distribution channel(s), newly developed and patent pending assays, new laboratory devices and several marketing projects like the Chinese standardization projects for histology and cytology. The Company is optimistic about recent marketing efforts focusing on larger laboratory chains and other important strategic relationships. The Company has 75 employees in four countries, a distribution network to about 70 countries and a wide range of products for anatomic pathology, histology and cytology laboratories available for sale.  The Company successfully sold more internally developed and manufactured devices in 2016 compared to 2015.  After the successful market entrance into China in 2014, the Company's revenues in this market are approximately $897,000 in 2015 compared to $1 million in 2016. The Company's delayed financing during 2015 and 2016 has impacted the delivery of sales due to availability of raw materials, parts, and work in progress inventory and the needed investment in that inventory. The Company originally anticipated sales in 2016 of approximately $2 million with the assumption that the timing of the scheduled capital raise would happen earlier in the year. Due to the delay in the capital raise, the Company revised its target to $1.3 million. Total sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 were approximately $1 million compared to $897,000 for the same period in 2015. The Chinese market is growing quickly, and the Company expects it will be one of two largest markets for its products. By working with its Chinese distributor, UNIC Medical, the Company has successfully received China Food and Drug Administration ("CFDA") approval for all MEDITE histology laboratory devices at the end of 2014, and for the Cytology device in 2015. The UNIC Medical sales team is selling MEDITE products in China with slightly increasing volumes. Also, together with UNIC, we are part of a government supported project to standardize the histology laboratory process in China. UNIC Medical is using MEDITE equipment and consumables for processing, and launching new assays. UNIC has taken an active role in branding MEDITE Cancer Diagnostics in China. Medite is working through certain product rollout issues which have impacted its anticipated increase in sales.  On May 31, 2016, UNIC received CFDA approval as a Class I in vitro diagnostic reagent for MEDITE's "SureThin" cell preservation solution. As China adopts Cytopathology standards across the country, the Company expects 'Liquid Based Cytology Tests (LBC)' will be used for the majority of Pap collections for cervical cancer screening. We are prepared to sell the complete SureThin product line, including the already approved Processor to this potential market of 485 million women between the ages of 16 and 64 years of age. Management anticipates launching the product in China by the third quarter of 2017 and in the U.S. by the fourth quarter of 2017.  The Company's cytology product line, revenue declined in Europe (non-Gyn and Gyn applications) during 2016 related to a competitive threat that management believes has been alleviated. The Company is in the process of moving forward the submission of an application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") for SureThin Gyn applications. Once approved we can compete with some of the dominant suppliers in this $600 million market and target major strategic lab partners. The impact of the gynecology segment SureThin solution in the US and China market will drive significant new revenue and gross margin improvement opportunities in 2017.  -24- Table of Contents  The developed and U.S. patented self-collection device SoftKit is targeting the growing POC & POP (point of care or point of people care) market. Growth in this area is due to consumer driven health care requirements and the necessity to support and address incremental patient population needs for screening and on-going diagnostic tests. SoftKit serves as just such a product, addressing this market requirement. SoftKit is planned to be sold through various marketing channels that serve the gynecology physician consumer health and emerging post-acute care as the influence of clinical labs are expanded. Initially the SoftKit is targeted at the uterine cancer/HPV screening market. The next phase of testing will include cervical screening.  Management believes that 2017 developments, allows us to more fully leverage the excellent products and biomarker solutions from CytoCore component of MEDITE. The first entry will be the introduction of SureCyte+ (fluorogenic) instant staining, offering tremendous lab efficiencies and enhanced patient care through the use of SureCyte+. SureCyte+ is the first of many new offering under the SureCyte brand.  MEDITE's Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Product is non-invasive, easy, gentle, and highly sensitive, enabling young women between 20 and 45 years of age to obtain their individual breast cancer risk assessment. An automatic and gentle collection device for breast cells together with a newly developed assay is used to determine a woman's risk to develop breast cancer. Knowing the individual breast cancer risk will provide relief to a majority of young women who have no elevated risk of developing breast cancer. For those who have a higher risk, it enables them to monitor that risk closer for earlier treatment, if needed. The earlier a precancerous or cancerous situation is detected, the greater the chance for reducing the fatality rate for these conditions. Product development of BreastPap continued in 2016, reflecting feedback from doctors' test use of prototype units' and doctor's office feedback to continuously improve the product prior to launching. During the third quarter, the Company initiated a co-operation with Leibnitz University of Hannover, Germany, on the final design and usability of the BreastPap. The project is scheduled to begin on February 15, 2017. The delay in market introduction by management is due to additional quality assurance measures being performed by the Company as well as insuring that US feedback from providers are considered. The Company's BreastPap product is a risk assessment tool planned to evaluate the breast cancer risk on certain results based on the treatment. Upon receiving the results, women, based upon their physicians' advice may be candidates for further diagnostic testing. The BreatPap will undergo further customer testing in the US and EU markets.  The Company brought several other innovative products closer to marketability during 2015, and continued during 2016 as listed above. Also, in early 2015, the German priority patent for a fully automated system used in the histology lab, a "Lab-In-One" unit, was granted. This technology, if successfully accepted by the market, has the ability to change the competitive landscape within the industry.  During the first quarter of 2016, the Company opened a second German manufacturing facility with approximately 4,000 square feet in Nussloch. This facility is utilizing the local workforce and their experience for the specialized skills required for manufacturing of the newly developed and updated Microtome product line and the newly developed Cryostat (instruments used for sectioning tissue biopsies). During 2016, the Company manufactured and delivered from order backlog 70 units. The Company began manufacturing the new Cryostat line during the first quarter of 2017 and anticipates the first pre serial series to be available before the end of the second quarter.  The Company operates in one industry segment for cancer diagnostics instruments and consumables for histology and cytology laboratories.  Definition: Histology - Cancer diagnostics based on the structures of cells in tissues  Cancers and precancerous conditions are defined in terms of structural abnormalities in cells. For this reason cytology is widely used for the detection of such conditions while histology is typically used for the confirmation, identification and characterization of the cellular abnormalities detected by cytology. Other diagnostics methods such as marker-based assays provide additional information that can supplement, but which cannot replace cytology and histology. The trend towards more personalized treatment of cancer increases the need for cytology, histology and assays for identifying and testing the best treatment alternatives. We believe that this segment will therefore be increasingly important for future development of strategies to fight the "cancer epidemic" (world health organization:World Cancer Report 2014) which expects about a 50 % increase in cancer cases worldwide within the next 20 years.  -25- Table of Contents  This segment sees a trend toward, and demand for, higher automation for more throughput in bigger laboratories, process standardization, digitalization of cell and tissue slides and computer aided diagnostic systems, while also looking for cost effective solutions. In the US the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is a national example for the industry. More people have health insurance and therefore can afford early cancer screening, while at the same time the payers for health care continue looking for cost reductions.  MEDITE acts as a one-stop-shop for histology (also known as anatomic pathology) laboratories either as part of a hospital, as part of a chain of laboratories or individually. It is one out of only four companies offering all equipment and consumables for these laboratories worldwide. The MEDITE brand stands for innovative and high quality products - most equipment made in Germany - and competitive pricing.  For the cytology market, MEDITE offers a wide range of consumable products and equipment; in particular for liquid-based-cytology which is an important tool in cancer screening and detection in the field of cervical, bladder, breast, lung and other cancer types. It also developed an innovative, easy to use standardized staining solutions, and a very innovative and effective early cancer detection marker-based assays. These new developments are cost effective solutions able to replace more expensive competitive products, and therefore are also becoming the first choice for the growing demand in emerging countries.  All of the Company's operations during the reporting period were conducted and managed within this segment, with management teams reporting directly to our Chief Executive Office. For information on revenues, profit or loss and total assets, among other financial data, attributable to our operations, see the consolidated financial statements included herein. Further during this 2016 period we added key personnel with excellent historical performance in new product commercialization, sales development and internal operations improvement.  Outlook  Due to promising innovative new products for cancer risk assessment and an increasing number of distributions contracts executed in the last years, management believes the profitability and cash-flow of the business will grow and improve. However, significant on-going operating expenditures may be necessary to manufacture and market new and existing products to achieve the accelerated sales growth targets outlined in the Company's business plan. To realize the planned growth potential, management will focus its efforts on 1.) Finishing and gaining approval for the products currently under development and  Currently, the Company's sales primarily are generated in Euro currency. While in 2015 the average USD/Euro exchange rate was approximately 1.1097, it has remained steady to 1.10682 in 2016, a decrease of 0.003, however the end of year conversion rate was 1.05204. MEDITE's sales in USD were lower on a year over year basis as approximately 80% of our sales currently occurs in Euros. The Company is working to lessen the impact of the Euro's decline versus the dollar by increasing the percentage of overall product sales in the U.S. and other countries such as China whose currency is not pegged to the Euro.  The Company believes the combination of MEDITE Enterprise, Inc. with CytoCore, Inc. will expedite the development and marketability of CytoCore's cytology products which include collection devices, image analysis software, special stains and immuno-assays. Currently, the recent launch of new products, the positive impact from several new initiatives, and some recently executed distribution contracts in the U.S., Europe and China are some primary positive factors assisting growth.  -26- Table of Contents  Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates  The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  The Company believes that the critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements under Note 2: Revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, use of estimates and impairments.  Results of Operations  Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2016 as compared to Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2015 (Dollars in thousands) Revenue  Total revenues of $9,238 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared $9,887 for the year ended December 31, 2015, represented a decrease in revenues of $649 or 6.56%. The Company's own manufactured instruments increased $168, an increase of 3.8% in 2016, as compared to 2015 revenues. The related histology consumables revenue declined by $355, or 9.9% in 2016 from 2015 level. Cytology products revenue decline by $466, or 24.4% in 2016 compared to 2015. Cash constraints impacted the delivery of owned manufactured equipment, demo equipment and related lower margin consumable supplies from outside suppliers. Specifically, the Company had a backlog as of December 31, 2016 of approximately $1 million. Cytology products were impacted by a competitive threat in Europe which Management believes has been alleviated however impacted sales for the 2016 period.  Costs and Expenses  Cost of Revenues  Cost of revenues represents the cost of the product sold, freight, and other costs of selling our products. Cost of revenues totaled $5,608 (61% of revenue) for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $6,084 (62% of revenue) for the year ended December 31, 2015. This mainly resulted from a higher share of sales of own manufactured equipment with slightly higher margins versus merchandise supply goods in 2016 compared to 2015.  Research and Development  Research and development expenses are an important part of the Company's business to keep our existing products competitive and to develop new innovative solutions with interesting market potential that will help us grow future revenues. These expenses include research work for cancer marker consumables and developing work, including engineering and industrial design, for histology and cytology laboratories worldwide. Major parts of these expenses are payroll-related costs for in-house scientific research, mechanical and electrical engineering, instrument related software development staff, prototype expenses and material purchased for R&D.  For the 2016 fiscal year, research and development expenses increased to $1,477 compared $1,278 for 2015. The Company continues to expend resources necessary to continue to grow our product offerings. The costs increased during 2016 associated with $206 expensed prototypes for the 2016 period.  Selling, General and Administrative  For the year ended December 31, 2016, SG&A expenses were $3,600 compared to $2,947 in 2015, an increase of $653. Professional fees increased approximately $435 associated with audit and quarterly fees, professional fees for accounting and administrative oversight. Salary, wages, commissions and related payroll taxes increased $168 for the 2016 period.  -27- Table of Contents  Operating Loss  The operating loss of $1,661 for 2016 compared to $599 in 2015 is due to the lower sales due to significant backlogs at December 31, 2016, lower contribution on sales and higher selling, general and administrative, and research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 as discussed above.  Interest Expense, net  Interest expense was $694 for 2016 compared to $204 in 2015, an increase of $490 related to the interest expense of promissory notes issued in December 2015 and May 2016 totaling $231, including debt discount amortization. The year ended December 31, 2015 did not have any related interest expense, loan fees or penalty warrants for secured promissory notes or employee notes.  Income Tax  The income tax expense in 2015 was primarily the result of recording a reduced tax asset for the German Subsidiary MEDITE GmbH for its profit in 2015. Overall the Company is recording income tax (benefit) expense of $(132) for 2016, compared to $78 for the year ended December 31, 2015.  Net Loss  The net loss for the year ended December 31, 2016, was $2,163 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, of $859 is due to the lower net contribution on sales and higher selling, general and administrative and interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016, as discussed above.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  For the year ended December 31, 2016, we used net cash in operations of approximately $1.1 million compared to $388 for the same period in 2015. During 2016, cash used in operations consisted of loss from operations, offset by non-cash transactions for warrants issued related to secured promissory notes. Collections for accounts receivable, higher accounts payable and accrued expense balances offset by increased balances in inventory contributed to the use of funds for the 2016 period. During 2015, cash used in operations consisted of the loss for the period offset by operations comprised of collections on accounts receivable for the period, reductions in inventories offset by higher payments on accounts payable and accrued expenses.  For the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash used in investing activities were $115 compared to $354 for the same period in 2015. The improvement in this activity relates to lower purchases of equipment in 2016 compared to 2015.  For the year ended December 31, 2016, financing activities provided $700 compared $1,712 for the same period in 2015. The Company sold 873,830 shares of common stock for $406 during the fourth quarter of 2016, net of $31 of issuance costs. In May 2016, the Company issued $150 of additional secured promissory notes. In 2015, the Company raised $385 in a second offering. The Company issued 1,086,250 shares of common stock at $1.60 for proceeds of $1,739 to the President of UNIC Medical of China is the Company's distributor in China and other Asian countries. On December 31, 2015, the Company received $500 for secured promissory notes.  In 2016, the Company's lines of credit and term notes funded $135 and in 2015 repaid $802. During 2015, MEDITE GmbH reduced its outstanding indebtedness under its master credit line with Hannoversche Volksbank from Euro 1.8 million ($1.9 million as of December 31, 2016) to Euro 1.3 million ($1.4 million as of December 31, 2016). The remaining line of credit of Euro 1.1 million ($1.2 million as of December 31, 2016) has no maturity date and the Company believes that the bank will continue working with the Company as it attempts to raise additional capital resources through debt or equity. Should the bank look for additional reductions to the Company's line of credit, the Company believes that it can obtain bank financing elsewhere at equivalent terms or if necessary raise the funds needed through operations. The balance at December 31, 2016 of this master credit line is $46 below the required balance.  -28- Table of Contents  The Company must contemplate continuation as a going concern. This contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. At December 31, 2016, the Company's cash balance was $108,000 and its operating losses for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, have used most of the Company's liquid assets and the negative working capital has grown by approximately $1.5 million from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The Company raised additional cash of $1.355 million from the sale of equity subsequent to December 31, 2016 through the date of this filing. Stock subscriptions totaled $25,000 for January 2017, $405,000 for February 2017, $775,000 for March 2017 and $150,000 through the April 10, 2017, a total of $1.355 million to issue 2,710,000 shares of common stock at $0.50. Working capital has improved by approximately $1 million as of the date of this filing.  The Company has settled three of the five employee notes for $330,000 and warrants. The Company has extended the term of the secured promissory notes and has paid $183,000 of the balance outstanding as of the date of this filing and received notice that one noteholder will convert $50,000 into 100,000 shares of common stock at $0.50. Management believes that the remainder of the balance will be settled in some combination of cash and stock.  Management is actively seeking additional equity financing contemplated in the $4.25 million stock purchase agreement. The Company has negotiated with certain parties whose obligations are due in the next twelve months to extend payment terms beyond one year. One lender with an outstanding balance of $789,000 has stated that they will not be able to refinance the debt. The default rate of interest will increase three percent.  Accrued salaries, vacation and related expenses at December 31, 2016, includes amounts owed to the former CFO approximately $1.1 million and amounts owed to both the Michaela and Michael Ott totaling approximately $156,000. Included in advances - related parties are amounts owed to the Company's former CFO and former CEO and Chairman of the Board of $50,000 at December 31, 2016, and 20,000 Euros, ($21,040 as December 31, 2016) and $75,000 related to two short term bridge loans made to the Company by its former CEO and current COO of the Company. The Company is working with the current executives to establish a payment plan. See further discussion regarding the legal proceedings with the Company's former Chief Financial Officer.  The Company's security agreement with its lender has provided borrowings of 35% of our collateralized assets. The Company continues to refinance this debt to provide additional liquidity.  Management continues to expand its product offerings and has also expanded its sales and distribution channels during 2017.  If management is unsuccessful in completing its equity financing, they will begin negotiating with some of their major vendors and lenders to extend the terms of their debt and also evaluate certain expenses that have been implemented for the Company's growth strategy. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in these efforts. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  Apr 14, 2017  (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc.

CytoCore Inc. / MEDITE Cancer Diagnostics, Inc. Reports Record YTD and 3rd Quarter Sales

Nov 21, 2014, 13:16 ET
		  		  					
						 from   MEDITE Cancer Diagnostics, Inc. 











 
















































 

 




















 


ORLANDO, Fla., Nov. 21, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- MEDITE Group acquired by CytoCore, Inc. (OTCBB: CYOE) on April 4, 2014 reported nine months and the 3rd quarter sales ended September 30, 2014 of $8.7 million and $2.8 million. Operating income was $448,000 for the nine months ended September 2014 and a $38,000 loss for the quarter ended September 2014. "Even though our 3rd quarter is usually a seasonable weak period due to the summer vacation period which extends from July into September for many countries worldwide, we are proud to announce record sales for these periods versus comparable periods in prior years. A tripling of US sales was the driving factor for the nine month period," says Michael Ott, President and COO of CytoCore, Inc. soon to become MEDITE Cancer Diagnostics, Inc. an Orlando, Florida based company specializing in Anatomic Pathology and Cytology products used by medical laboratories for the diagnosis of cancer and precancerous conditions. "Robust demand for our products as indicated by our excellent current order backlog supports the general seasonality from past years where the fourth quarter usually has contributed 35 % of annual sales."
The one time increase in Research and Development expenses for the third quarter resulting from the CytoCore purchase establishing our Chicago based research center along with the opening of our new design and engineering center in Poland suppressed our profitability from operations. We are encouraged by the biomarker results for cervical and breast cancer detection emanating from Chicago and the development of a breast cancer risk assessment device currently under way in Poland. 
CytoCore, Inc. going forward is working to become a global force in providing solutions to the world wide cancer epidemic which according to the recently published "World Cancer Report 2014" by the World Health Organization, states that the number of cancer cases will increase by about 57% to 22 million cases in the next two decades. At the same time cancer deaths will rise from 8.2 million to 13 million per year.
As a result of these trends, we expect to achieve record sales and profitability driven by the announced new distribution contracts and new product launches as evidenced by our consumable product sales which are now exceeding 30% of sales and rapidly becoming a larger part of reoccurring sales. In addition, our expanded worldwide distribution and our emerging relationship with our Chinese joint venture partner, UNIC, where we look to establish a standardized Anatomic Pathology Laboratory process using MEDITE devices and consumables addressing the needs of over 20,000 existing Chinese hospitals and up to 500 new hospitals annually, support our growth. 
About CytoCore, Inc. and MEDITE Cancer Diagnostics, Inc.MEDITE Cancer Diagnostic, Inc., Orlando, and its wholly-own MEDITE GmbH a Germany-based company with its subsidiaries has specialized on the development, manufacture and distribution of medical laboratory automation equipment and supplies for anatomic pathology, histology and cytology.

Diagnostics





What is it?


What is diagnostic testing?
Diagnostic testing involves tests and procedures to confirm the presence of disease and identify the correct tumor type, location, extent and stage. At Cancer Treatment Centers of America® (CTCA), we use sophisticated diagnostic technology to pinpoint and evaluate tumors, and develop a personalized treatment plan.
Experienced care team
Our diagnostic team includes physicians across many medical specialties, including radiologists, pathologists and geneticists. They have expertise in using advanced, minimally invasive diagnostic tests and procedures to diagnose the disease.
Advanced diagnostics
A thorough and accurate cancer diagnosis is the first step in developing an individualized cancer treatment plan. When you first visit one of our hospitals, we will perform a complete array of diagnostic tests to accurately confirm your diagnosis and plan your individualized treatment. 
This initial diagnostic evaluation typically takes about three to five days. 
The following are some common diagnostic tests:

A review of health history
Physical examination
Laboratory tests (blood, urine, etc.)
Biopsy
Imaging tests (X-ray, PET/CT, MRI, ultrasound, etc.)
Nuclear medicine scans (bone scans, etc.)
Endoscopy
Genetic tests

Diagnostics plays an important role throughout your cancer treatment: 

Before treatment, we will accurately locate tumors, stage the disease, and determine an appropriate combination of cancer treatments for you. Tumor molecular profiling helps us identify the right chemotherapy or targeted therapy drugs before treatment, which reduces unnecessary toxicity and identifies an appropriate treatment approach from the start.
During your treatment, we will track the size of the tumor, progression of the disease, and your response to treatment, and modify your treatment accordingly. Minimally invasive tools like navigational bronchoscopy and endoscopic ultrasound allow us to find and reach very small tumors without the risks of surgery. 
After you complete treatment, we will follow up with you to evaluate any symptoms you may have, and schedule regular check-ups to monitor for any signs of metastasis or recurrence. Technologies like the Discovery™ PET/CT 600 allow us to accurately detect small lesions in areas of the body subject to movement, like the breasts, lungs, colon and prostate.

Genomic testing 
CTCA offers expanded genomic tumor assessment. This tool reveals the DNA alterations that are driving the growth of a cancer. By identifying the mutations that occur in a cancer cell's genome, our physicians can better understand what caused the tumor and provide cancer treatment therapies that specifically target changes in the tumor's genomic profile. 
Because genomic testing is a rapidly developing area of medical science, there are currently only a few cancers where such testing is considered to be routine in the evaluation of possible treatment options. Your oncologist will help determine if you are a good candidate for genomic testing.
Accommodating your needs
We understand that waiting for diagnostic test results can create a great deal of stress. To ease anxiety and help you begin your cancer treatment sooner, we provide reduced wait times for appointments and test results. 
We also want you to be as comfortable as possible during your imaging tests. Our team uses padding and comfort equipment, as well as a variety of positioning devices, to help you feel more relaxed during scans and procedures.

Take the next step
The best way to learn more about becoming a patient at CTCA® is to contact us. We will guide you every step of the way:





Step 1: Discuss your options with an Oncology Information Specialist
Our Oncology Information Specialists are available 24 hours a day, every day of the year to listen, answer your questions, and help you decide if CTCA is right for you. Call us anytime at (888) 552-6760 or chat now.







Step 2: The insurance verification process
We'll obtain your insurance policy information and contact your insurance provider on your behalf to verify your benefits, which typically takes 24 to 48 hours. Then, we'll contact you to review the details of your insurance plan’s coverage.







Step 3: Scheduling an appointment
If your insurance plan works with CTCA and you're interested in coming to one of our hospitals for a consultation, we will schedule your initial appointment. We’ll coordinate your visit and handle all of the details for you to make the process as easy, stress-free and affordable as possible. If you are newly diagnosed and live within 100 miles of our Chicago hospital, you may be able to see a cancer specialist within as little as 24 hours.







Step 4: Preparing for your visit
We'll mail you out a personalized packet of information and an oncology nurse will call you at home to discuss your medical history and help address any questions or concerns you might have to ease your mind about what to expect in your first visit.







Step 5: Your 3-5 day evaluation
When you arrive, our doctors will review your medical records and healthy history, and perform a complete array of diagnostic tests and procedures. You'll also consult with various members of your care team. It typically takes 3-5 days to tailor a comprehensive treatment plan to your needs. With second opinions, our Tulsa and Philadelphia hospitals may be able to offer one-day evaluations.

Should you decide to treat here, your Oncology Information Specialist will become your initial go-to person to help plan all the details of your first visit.
