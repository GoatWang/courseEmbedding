      ■ Scott T. Ford, the president and chief executive officer of the
      Alltel Corporation, made his first business deal at the age of 12 with his
      father, Joe T. Ford. The two agreed that Scott would never work at Alltel.
      Joe wanted to spare his son what he himself had endured since coming to
      work for his father-inlaw, Hugh Wilbourne Jr., in 1959. After the passage
      of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, however, the Fords rethought their
      agreement, and, at age 35, Scott Ford became executive vice president of
      Alltel. Within two years he was appointed CEO, following in the footsteps
      of his grandfather Wilbourne, who formed Allied Telephone Company in 1943
      in Little Rock, Arkansas. Allied merged with Mid-Continent Corporation in
      1983 to form the Alltel Corporation. Joe T. Ford, married to
      Wilbourne's daughter, became the president of Alltel, while his
      son, Scott, received a finance degree from the University of Arkansas.
    

      After graduating from the Walton College of Business at the University of
      Arkansas, Ford went to work at Merrill Lynch, where he sharpened his
      skills in acquisitions. After two years he moved to the Stephens Group in
      Little Rock. Stephens, an investment firm, was also one of Alltel's
      largest stockholders. Ford continued gaining experience and a reputation
      for his energy and acquisitions acumen. After eight years his boss, the
      legendary Arkansas businessman Jack Stephens, suggested to Ford's
      father that the son should be brought into Alltel to help the company
      handle the changes occurring in the telecommunications industry.
    

      Ford wasted no time acquiring purchases for the rural telecommunications
      company. By 2004 he had been at the forefront of Alltel's most
      lucrative acquisitions, hostile and friendly. Ford eased into the company
      not only at a crucial time in the industry, but also at a time when his
      father began thinking of retirement. Even though many detractors thought
      Ford received the job because of his relationship with the head of the
      company, he soon showed his aggressive and stubborn tenacity in moving
      Alltel into the expanding field of wireless communications.
    

      EARNS REPUTATION IN ACQUISITIONS WITH STEPHENS GROUP
    

      At the Stephens Group, Ford served as the assistant to Stephens, working
      mostly in private wealth management. His experience with mergers and
      acquisitions at Merrill Lynch came in handy at Stephens, where he served
      on the team that managed some of the company's largest mergers.
    

      Ford's first big opportunity came in 1990 when he worked in the
      background on a deal to purchase Holly Farms by Tyson Foods. He learned a
      lesson during this transaction with Tyson when the food powerhouse led
      with a low price. Tyson "led with a twenty-five percent premium,
      and it ended up costing them fifty percent," Ford explained to 
      
        Telephony
      
       (October 15, 2001). "When you start low everyone knows
      you're starting low, so everyone assumes you're going to
      have a series of escalations. When you start high, they have to wonder
      whether there's an escalation at all or whether they're
      running the risk of getting zero."
    

      When the Stephens Group went after the Donrey Media Group in 1993, Ford
      was the point man for the purchase. He said that at the time he was
      perfectly content working in acquisitions, but when Joe Ford asked him to
      come on board at Alltel in 1996, Scott decided that he could not turn down
      the offer. As he said to a writer for 
      
        Arkansas Business
      
      , "How many times does your father come to you, with a real
      belief—and you can see it in his eyes—that you could help
      him?" (July 1, 2002).
    

      ACQUISITIONS WIZARD GROWS COMPANY
    

      Starting as an executive vice president at Alltel, Ford soon began
      climbing the ranks. By 1997 he had been appointed president of the
      company.
    

      Alltel also reported sales of 3.26 billion in computers, wireless, and
      wireline phone service in 1997. Under Ford's leadership, the
      company began aggressively buying smaller telecommunications companies and
      offering a full range of services to customers.
    

      Ford credited the company's competitiveness with the larger markets
      to its decision to offer one-stop phone service. Bundling local phone
      service, long distance, wireless, paging, and Internet access helped bring
      new customers to the company. In 1997 Alltel combined its wireless and
      wireline businesses into a vertical offering for customers. By 1998 the
      company began billing all of its offered services on one bill, something
      most customers appreciated.
    

      Ford cited Alltel's previous track record in acquisitions as his
      reason for continuing that trend. By 1998 Alltel had acquired at least 250
      businesses over its 50 years of existence. The purchase of Cellular Plus
      in Georgia in 1998 brought in more than 23,000 new customers. However, the
      largest purchase of that year came when Alltel successfully bid for 360
      Communications, Sprint's former cellular operation. Th following
      year Alltel merged with Aliant Communications in Nebraska.
    

      FORD MAKES LARGEST ACQUISITION BY STANDING FIRM
    

      From the time Ford took over at Alltel until 2001, he spent $12 billion in
      purchasing smaller competitors. He laid out this money even though the
      revenues for Alltel hovered around $7.5 billion.
    

      In 2001 Ford was ready for the biggest acquisition yet when he bid for
      CenturyTel, a rural carrier in Monroe, Louisiana. The first offer, in
      August 2001, was $6.1 billion, or $43 per share, a 40 percent premium over
      the actual trading price. CenturyTel turned it down because it wanted to
      sell only the wireless portion of the company and retain a strong local
      core of phone business. Ford wanted the whole thing, and when CenturyTel
      refused the offer, Alltel went public with the information that CenturyTel
      wanted to sell their wireless market. In turn, CenturyTel sued Alltel, and
      industry analysts assumed the merger was off forever.
    

      Ford believed that the purchase of CenturyTel would enable Alltel to
      become the dominant rural market, both wireless and wired, and the lawsuit
      did not deter him from his path. Industry insiders praised his move as a
      smart preemptive strike by Alltel before the industry heavyweights
      realized the benefits of developing the rural markets.
    

      But CenturyTel, with its solid base in markets in the rural South, did not
      overlap Alltel's market, and CenturyTel had also achieved its
      success through acquisitions. By October of 2001 the offer from Alltel had
      increased to $9 billion, and again CenturyTel turned it down. Tom Burnett,
      president of Merger Insight, told 
      
        Telephony
      
       that CenturyTel was merely playing hard to get. "Lawsuits are
      fairly standard," said Burnett. "It's the way you
      build a moat around the castle. You discourage Alltel by showing them
      you're going to fight hard and be a pain in the ass, which will
      eventually motivate them to raise the price" (October 15, 2001).
    

      After a standoff of nearly six months, Ford decided to buy only the
      wireless portion of the business, for $1.65 billion, expanding
      Alltel's hold on the southern wireless market.
    

      STRONG PROFITS IN A SHAKY BUSINESS
    

      Even though Ford did not get exactly what he wanted from CenturyTel,
      Alltel continued to exert its presence in the field of telecommunications.
      By the end of 2002, as others in the business suffered, Alltel prospered.
    

      Ford told 
      
        Business Week
      
       in November 2002, after his appointment as CEO, that Alltel's
      success came from fiscally responsible moves and continued acquisitions.
      He noted his family's history of running the company with the
      strategy of maintaining a strong balance sheet. He also credited the
      markets that Alltel had developed. While not going after the major U.S.
      metropolitan centers but staying steady in the smaller cities and rural
      areas, Alltel rode the ups and downs in the business with ease. Ford said
      that both upswings and downswings in the economy greatly affect the large
      urban areas, while the smaller markets do not feel the pinch as swiftly.
      To further solidify its balance sheet, Alltel sold its financial services
      business for $1.05 billion in 2003, giving it earnings of $1.33 billion,
      up from $924 million in 2002.
    

      MANAGEMENT STYLE AND STRATEGIES
    

      Ford's management style included careful and watchful consideration
      of the competition. Although Ford might have been tempted, he resisted the
      urge to jump into the new technologies developing as the new millennium
      began. He told 
      
        Telecommunications Reports
      
       in 1998 that he was concerned about each of his competitors, but he would
      wait before jumping into wireless loops, a newly emerging wireless
      technology.
    

      In order to compete against the industry giants, Ford stressed local
      customer service with a good product and pricing that would take care of
      being swallowed by others, such as BellSouth or AT&T. Even while
      Ford expanded Alltel's services, customer satisfaction remained at
      the forefront of company policy.
    

      Ford's success in these areas did not stop the telecommunications
      union from questioning some labor practices of Alltel. In 1998 the
      Communications Workers of America let Alltel know that employees needed to
      be given the same consideration as customers. Charges against Alltel
      included union breaking and increasing costs of health insurance to
      workers. Not all customers felt that Alltel treated them fairly, either. A
      class-action suit filed in Florida in 2002 accused Alltel of using
      bait-and-switch tactics with new customers. The charges said that the fine
      print in the contract allowed Alltel to raise prices during a one-year
      contract period when most customers believed that they were signing up for
      a set price.
    

      Perhaps mindful of these difficulties, when Ford was appointed CEO of
      Alltel in 2002 he stressed the importance of communication with employees
      and shareholders. He was also vocal in his insistence that the traditional
      long-distance carriers were finished in the telecommunications business,
      and until they were gone, companies like Alltel would be slow to grow.
      Until that happened, Ford said, he would continue Alltel's policy
      of not passing along the cost of competition between too many
      communications companies to the customer. He told 
      
        Arkansas Business
      
      , "You don't charge your best customers your worst business
      price. They switch. You can't build a sustainable business that
      creates jobs, provides good service and really earns a good return for
      shareholders over a long period of time thinking that way" (July 1,
      2002).
    

      An editorial in 
      
        Telephony
      
       portrayed Ford as "articulate and effusive in describing his
      vision of where he planned to take Alltel" (October 15, 2001). And
      even though some insiders suggested that Ford's appointment was a
      form of nepotism, others credited him for bringing new life to the
      company. 
      
        Telephony
      
       called Ford a contradiction because his youth and easygoing manner were
      coupled with the intensity required to be a hard-hitting executive and the
      experience to match—no matter what the reason was for his
      appointment.
    

      A profile of Ford in the same issue of 
      
        Telephony
      
       cited his penchant for participating in team-roping rodeos, which
      explained much about his style of business leadership. He has competed in
      national team-roping finals, with $100,000 of prize money for the winner.
      Ford said the pressure of the money and the competition made the sport all
      the more exciting for him. He practiced the same type of pressure in some
      of his acquisitions for Alltel, while maintaining an assured sense of
      confidence.
    

      Even when the tensions were high between Ford and CenturyTel's
      founder, Clarke Williams, Ford laughed at the sniping going on between the
      two firms. In fact, when Williams made a sarcastic response to one of
      Ford's bids, Ford smiled with admiration for Williams's
      style, according to 
      
        Telephony.
      
       And even though Ford lost the chance to acquire all of CenturyTel in
      2001, industry analysts said his tenacity in the deal sealed his
      reputation as a businessman who could withstand high-stakes risks.
    

      By 2004 Alltel's earnings met Wall Street's expectations,
      but Ford continued to strengthen the balance sheet. He eliminated 600
      positions within the company, while consolidating wireless and wireline
      portions of the business. Even as the wireless industry appeared to be
      ready for more consolidation, Ford announced that Alltel would buy $750
      million of its own shares because there were no major acquisitions on the
      horizon. Ford maintained that there was no better way to invest the
      company's profits than in its own shares.

The plate is good quality, but when I got the plate I was disappointed that you only receive one. Now I have to order a second one to match. Nothing in the add mentions that you only get one. Could have bought a set like this on eBay for 3.99.
