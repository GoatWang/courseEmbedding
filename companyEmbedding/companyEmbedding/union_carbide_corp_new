Products


Union Carbide both produces and purchases ethylene, a basic building-block chemical, from components of crude oil and natural gas. We convert ethylene to polyethylene or react it with oxygen to produce ethylene oxide, the precursor to many of the products we sell: ethylene glycol and hundreds of solvents, alcohols, surfactants, amines and specialty products.


Some of the chemicals we make go directly into products used every day: polyethylene and polypropylene into food containers or toys; ethylene glycol into automotive antifreeze, and isopropanol into rubbing alcohol. Others are used in manufacturing processes to enhance quality and performance: ethyleneamines for wet-strength in paper towels; biocides as bacteria-growth inhibitors in cosmetics, and surfactants for soil removal in industrial cleaning. Other essential products include: deicing and anti-icing fluids to remove or prevent ice buildup on airplanes; amines for removing impurities in oil and gas refining processes; solution vinyl resins for industrial coatings to prevent corrosion, and polyethylene glycols to make tablets and pills easier to swallow.

Whether they are adding strength to stretch wrap, or smoothness to paint, removing static from laundry or simply making a teddy bear more cuddly, the products of Union Carbide make great chemistry a part of daily life.

About Us























Union Carbide Corporation













About Us

Union Carbide Corporation is a chemical and polymers company with more than 2,300 employees. The company possesses some of the industry's most advanced process and catalyst technologies, and operates some of the most cost-efficient, large-scale production facilities in the world.

Union Carbide primarily produces chemicals and polymers that undergo one or more further conversions by customers before reaching consumers. Some of these materials are high-volume commodities, while others are specialty products meeting the needs of smaller market niches. The end-uses served include paints and coatings, packaging, wire and cable, household products, personal care, pharmaceuticals, automotive, textiles, agriculture and oil and gas.

The hallmark of Union Carbide's leadership in the chemical industry is a sustained tradition of technological innovation. In 1920 our researchers developed an economical way to make ethylene from natural gas, giving birth to the modern petrochemicals industry. A significant day in Union Carbide’s recent history was August 4, 1999, when it was announced that Union Carbide would become a subsidiary of The Dow Chemical Company ("TDCC") as part of a transaction valued at $11.6 billion. This transaction closed on February 6, 2001. Since Union Carbide's acquisition by TDCC, Union Carbide sells most of the products it manufactures to TDCC and is an important part of the Dow family of companies.

Bhopal Gas Tragedy Information


Print

    In the early hours of December 3,1984, methylisocyanate (MIC) gas leaked from a plant owned, managed and operated by Union Carbide India Limited (UCIL) in the central India city of Bhopal. According to government figures, approximately 5,200 people died and several thousand other individuals suffered permanent or partial disabilities. Click here to view the 2006 affidavit of the Union of India in the Supreme Court.


    A great deal has been written and/or broadcast about the tragedy in the past 32 years, some of it factual, but much of it inaccurate or misleading. The information presented on this website is supported by facts and documentation, and will help those seeking information gain an accurate and balanced perspective of the Bhopal tragedy and Union Carbide's (UCC) efforts.



Union Carbide Statement Regarding The Tragedy

    The 1984 gas leak in Bhopal was a terrible tragedy that continues to evoke strong emotions even 32 years later. In the wake of the gas release, UCC and its then-chairman Warren Anderson worked diligently to provide aid to the victims and attempted to set up a process to resolve their claims. All claims arising out of the release were settled in 1989 at the explicit direction and with the approval of the Supreme Court of India by means of a settlement agreement between the Government of India (GOI) and UCC and UCIL. In 1991, and again in 2007, the Supreme Court upheld the fairness and adequacy of the settlement in response to court challenges from non-governmental organizations.


    The Bhopal plant was owned and operated by UCIL, an Indian company in which UCC held just over half the stock. Other stockholders included Indian financial institutions and thousands of private investors in India. UCIL designed, built, managed and operated the plant using Indian consultants and workers. In 1994, UCC sold its entire stake in UCIL to Mcleod Russel India Limited of Calcutta, and UCIL was renamed Eveready Industries India Limited (EIIL). As a result of the sale of its shares in UCIL, UCC retained no interest in the Bhopal site. With the approval of the India Supreme Court, the proceeds of the UCIL sale were placed in a trust and exclusively used to fund a hospital in Bhopal, which now provides specialist care to victims of the tragedy.


    Because the government closed off the site from any and all operations following the gas release, UCIL was only able to undertake clean-up work in the years just prior to the UCC's sale of its stock in 1994, and spent some $2 million on that effort. The central and state government authorities approved, monitored and directed every step of the clean-up work. Following the sale, we understand that EIIL continued some clean-up work. In 1998, the Madhya Pradesh State Government (MPSG), which owned and had been leasing the property to EIIL -- and still owns the property today -- cancelled EIIL's lease, took over the facility and assumed all accountability for the site, including the completion of any additional remediation. The media reported that a trial incineration of some waste from the Bhopal plant site was conducted in August 2015. For additional information, please see the page on this site entitled "Remediation (Clean Up) of the Bhopal Plant Site." Specific questions regarding that work, or any other site remediation work, are best directed to Madhya Pradesh State Government and/or the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).


    Late in 1986, Union Carbide filed a lengthy court document in India detailing the findings of its scientific and legal investigations into the cause of the gas release. Click here to view the Jackson Browning Report.


    Engineering consulting firm, Arthur D. Little, Inc., conducted a thorough investigation and reached the same conclusion. Click here to view the Arthur D. Little Report. 

    Please see "Cause of the Bhopal Tragedy" pages on this website for complete details.


    Together with the rest of the chemical industry, Union Carbide has worked to develop and globally implement Responsible Care® to help prevent such an event in the future by improving process safety standards, community awareness and emergency preparedness, as well as protecting workers and communities by working with governmental bodies to assure that industry best practices are implemented through regulations.

Union Carbide Corporation is a wholly owned subsidiary (since 2001) of Dow Chemical Company. It currently employs more than 2,400 people.[2] Union Carbide produces chemicals and polymers that undergo one or more further conversions by customers before reaching consumers. Some are high-volume commodities and others are specialty products meeting the needs of smaller markets. Markets served include paints and coatings, packaging, wire and cable, household products, personal care, pharmaceuticals, automotive, textiles, agriculture, and oil and gas. The company is a former component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.[3] Union Carbide was 50.9% stakeholder in Union Carbide India Limited, the company responsible for the Bhopal disaster.[4]
Founded in 1917, as the Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation from a merger with National Carbon Company, the company's researchers developed an economical way to make ethylene from natural gas liquids, such as ethane and propane, giving birth to the modern petrochemical industry. Before divesting them, the chemical giant owned consumer products Eveready and Energizer batteries, Glad bags and wraps, Simoniz car wax, and Prestone antifreeze. The company divested other businesses before being acquired by Dow Chemical on February 6, 2001, including electronic chemicals, polyurethane intermediates, industrial gases and carbon products.[5]

History[edit]
The Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation was formed on November 1, 1917, from the merger of the Union Carbide Company founded in 1898, the National Carbon Company founded in 1886, Linde Air Products Company, maker of liquid oxygen, and the Prest-O-Lite company, manufacturer of calcium carbide. In 1920 the company set up a chemicals division which manufactured ethylene glycol for use as automotive antifreeze. The company continued to acquire related chemical producers, including the Bakelite Corporation in 1939. The company changed its name to "Union Carbide Corporation" in 1957 and was often referred to as Carbide. It operated Oak Ridge National Laboratory from 1947 until the late 1970s.[6]
During the Cold war era the company was active in the field of rocket propulsion research & development for aerospace and guided missile applications, particularly in the field of chemicals and plastics, solid rocket motors, storable liquid fuels. R&D activities has been centered at the Technical Center near Charleston, West Virginia.[7] The Aerospace Materials Department was established for the mentioned purposes within the company's Carbon Products Division.[8]
Ucar batteries was Carbide's industrial and consumer zinc chloride battery business. The business including Energizer alkaline batteries was sold to Ralston Purina in 1986, following a hostile takeover operation.
After the Bhopal disaster, Union Carbide was the subject of repeated takeover attempts. In order to pay off its debt, Carbide sold many of its most familiar brands such as Glad Trashbags and Eveready Batteries. Dow Chemical announced the purchase of Carbide in 1999 for $8.89 billion in stock.[9]
Hawks Nest Tunnel disaster[edit]
Main article: Hawks Nest Tunnel Disaster
The Hawks Nest Tunnel disaster took place between 1927 and 1932 in a West Virginia tunnel project led by Union Carbide. During the construction of the tunnel, workers found the mineral silica and were asked to mine it for use in electroprocessing steel. The workers were not given masks or breathing equipment to use while mining. Due to silica dust exposure, many workers developed silicosis, a debilitating lung disease. According to a marker on site, there were 109 admitted deaths. A congressional hearing placed the death toll at 476.[10]
Asbestos mining and 'Calidria' brand fibers[edit]
In the early 1960s, Union Carbide Corporation began mining a newly identified outcrop of chrysotile asbestos fibers near King City and New Idria, California. The fibers were sold under the brand name "Calidria", a combination of "Cal" and "Idria." These fibers were sold in large quantities for a wide variety of purposes, including addition into joint compound or drywall accessory products.[11] Union Carbide sold the mine to its employees under the name KCAC ("King City Asbestos Mine") in the 1980s, but it only operated for a few more years.[citation needed]
Bhopal disaster[edit]
Main article: Bhopal disaster
Union Carbide India Limited, owned by Union Carbide (50.9%) and Indian investors (49.1%), operated a pesticide plant in the Indian city of Bhopal.[4] Around midnight on 3 December 1984, methyl isocyanate (MIC) gas was accidentally released from the plant, exposing more than 500,000 people to MIC and other chemicals. The government of Madhya Pradesh confirmed a total of 3,787 deaths related to the gas release. It left an estimated 40,000 individuals permanently disabled, maimed, or suffering from serious illness, making it one of the world's worst industrial disasters. Union Carbide was sued by the Government of India and agreed to an out-of-court settlement of US$470 million in 1989. The plant site has not yet been cleaned up. Warren Anderson, CEO at the time of the disaster, and Carbide refused to answer to homicide charges and remained fugitives from India's courts. The U.S. denied several extradition requests. Anderson died on 29 September 2014 in Florida. Seven Indian employees of Union Carbide were convicted of criminal negligence in 2010 and fined $2,000 each. In 1982, Carbide's auditors warned of a possible 'runaway reaction'. Carbide didn't supply an antidote, maintained that MIC was "nothing more than a potent tear gas". Carbide insisted the accident was an act of sabotage by a rogue worker.
Union Carbide in Australia[edit]
Union Carbide's operations in Australia commenced in 1957 when they purchased the plant of the Australian owned company Timbrol Ltd. The Timbrol factory was on the shore of Homebush Bay in the Sydney suburb of Rhodes. Homebush Bay is on the Parramatta River which flows into Sydney Harbour. Tibrol produced phenol, the insecticides chlorobenzene/chlorophenol/DDT, and the herbicides 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T. Union Carbide continued the production of the 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T until 1976 and chlorobenzene/chlorophenol/DDT until 1983. Union Carbide also commenced the production of Bisphenol A in 1960 and Phenol Formaldehyde resins in 1964.[12]:9
Union Carbide reclaimed land on neighboring properties by depositing spent lime and ash into the adjacent marshes in Homebush Bay. This practice, which had been approved by the Maritime Services Board, ceased in 1970.
Union Carbide ceased operations in Australia in 1985.[13] In 1987 the New South Wales Pollution Control Commission ordered Union Carbide to remediate the site. This work, which cost Union Carbide $30 million, was conducted between 1988 and 1993. The work involved excavation and encapsulation of the contaminated soil.[14]
In 2004 the minister for planning granted consent for additional remediation of the former Union Carbide site to proceed including parts of Homebush Bay.[15] Approximately 900,000 tons of soil were excavated from the Union Carbide site, 190,000 tons of soil from the adjacent Allied Feeds site and approximately 50,000 tons of sediment from the bay. Remediation of the Allied Feeds Site was completed in August 2009, Homebush Bay sediments in August 2010, and the Union Carbide site in March 2011. The value of the remediation work was $35M for the Allied Feeds site and $100 million for Union Carbide site and Homebush Bay sediments.[16][17]

Union Carbide Corporation is a wholly owned subsidiary (since 2001) of Dow Chemical Company. It currently employs more than 2,400 people.[2] Union Carbide produces chemicals and polymers that undergo one or more further conversions by customers before reaching consumers. Some are high-volume commodities and others are specialty products meeting the needs of smaller markets. Markets served include paints and coatings, packaging, wire and cable, household products, personal care, pharmaceuticals, automotive, textiles, agriculture, and oil and gas. The company is a former component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.[3] Union Carbide was 50.9% stakeholder in Union Carbide India Limited, the company responsible for the Bhopal disaster.[4]
Founded in 1917, as the Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation from a merger with National Carbon Company, the company's researchers developed an economical way to make ethylene from natural gas liquids, such as ethane and propane, giving birth to the modern petrochemical industry. Before divesting them, the chemical giant owned consumer products Eveready and Energizer batteries, Glad bags and wraps, Simoniz car wax, and Prestone antifreeze. The company divested other businesses before being acquired by Dow Chemical on February 6, 2001, including electronic chemicals, polyurethane intermediates, industrial gases and carbon products.[5]

History[edit]
The Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation was formed on November 1, 1917, from the merger of the Union Carbide Company founded in 1898, the National Carbon Company founded in 1886, Linde Air Products Company, maker of liquid oxygen, and the Prest-O-Lite company, manufacturer of calcium carbide. In 1920 the company set up a chemicals division which manufactured ethylene glycol for use as automotive antifreeze. The company continued to acquire related chemical producers, including the Bakelite Corporation in 1939. The company changed its name to "Union Carbide Corporation" in 1957 and was often referred to as Carbide. It operated Oak Ridge National Laboratory from 1947 until the late 1970s.[6]
During the Cold war era the company was active in the field of rocket propulsion research & development for aerospace and guided missile applications, particularly in the field of chemicals and plastics, solid rocket motors, storable liquid fuels. R&D activities has been centered at the Technical Center near Charleston, West Virginia.[7] The Aerospace Materials Department was established for the mentioned purposes within the company's Carbon Products Division.[8]
Ucar batteries was Carbide's industrial and consumer zinc chloride battery business. The business including Energizer alkaline batteries was sold to Ralston Purina in 1986, following a hostile takeover operation.
After the Bhopal disaster, Union Carbide was the subject of repeated takeover attempts. In order to pay off its debt, Carbide sold many of its most familiar brands such as Glad Trashbags and Eveready Batteries. Dow Chemical announced the purchase of Carbide in 1999 for $8.89 billion in stock.[9]
Hawks Nest Tunnel disaster[edit]
Main article: Hawks Nest Tunnel Disaster
The Hawks Nest Tunnel disaster took place between 1927 and 1932 in a West Virginia tunnel project led by Union Carbide. During the construction of the tunnel, workers found the mineral silica and were asked to mine it for use in electroprocessing steel. The workers were not given masks or breathing equipment to use while mining. Due to silica dust exposure, many workers developed silicosis, a debilitating lung disease. According to a marker on site, there were 109 admitted deaths. A congressional hearing placed the death toll at 476.[10]
Asbestos mining and 'Calidria' brand fibers[edit]
In the early 1960s, Union Carbide Corporation began mining a newly identified outcrop of chrysotile asbestos fibers near King City and New Idria, California. The fibers were sold under the brand name "Calidria", a combination of "Cal" and "Idria." These fibers were sold in large quantities for a wide variety of purposes, including addition into joint compound or drywall accessory products.[11] Union Carbide sold the mine to its employees under the name KCAC ("King City Asbestos Mine") in the 1980s, but it only operated for a few more years.[citation needed]
Bhopal disaster[edit]
Main article: Bhopal disaster
Union Carbide India Limited, owned by Union Carbide (50.9%) and Indian investors (49.1%), operated a pesticide plant in the Indian city of Bhopal.[4] Around midnight on 3 December 1984, methyl isocyanate (MIC) gas was accidentally released from the plant, exposing more than 500,000 people to MIC and other chemicals. The government of Madhya Pradesh confirmed a total of 3,787 deaths related to the gas release. It left an estimated 40,000 individuals permanently disabled, maimed, or suffering from serious illness, making it one of the world's worst industrial disasters. Union Carbide was sued by the Government of India and agreed to an out-of-court settlement of US$470 million in 1989. The plant site has not yet been cleaned up. Warren Anderson, CEO at the time of the disaster, and Carbide refused to answer to homicide charges and remained fugitives from India's courts. The U.S. denied several extradition requests. Anderson died on 29 September 2014 in Florida. Seven Indian employees of Union Carbide were convicted of criminal negligence in 2010 and fined $2,000 each. In 1982, Carbide's auditors warned of a possible 'runaway reaction'. Carbide didn't supply an antidote, maintained that MIC was "nothing more than a potent tear gas". Carbide insisted the accident was an act of sabotage by a rogue worker.
Union Carbide in Australia[edit]
Union Carbide's operations in Australia commenced in 1957 when they purchased the plant of the Australian owned company Timbrol Ltd. The Timbrol factory was on the shore of Homebush Bay in the Sydney suburb of Rhodes. Homebush Bay is on the Parramatta River which flows into Sydney Harbour. Tibrol produced phenol, the insecticides chlorobenzene/chlorophenol/DDT, and the herbicides 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T. Union Carbide continued the production of the 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T until 1976 and chlorobenzene/chlorophenol/DDT until 1983. Union Carbide also commenced the production of Bisphenol A in 1960 and Phenol Formaldehyde resins in 1964.[12]:9
Union Carbide reclaimed land on neighboring properties by depositing spent lime and ash into the adjacent marshes in Homebush Bay. This practice, which had been approved by the Maritime Services Board, ceased in 1970.
Union Carbide ceased operations in Australia in 1985.[13] In 1987 the New South Wales Pollution Control Commission ordered Union Carbide to remediate the site. This work, which cost Union Carbide $30 million, was conducted between 1988 and 1993. The work involved excavation and encapsulation of the contaminated soil.[14]
In 2004 the minister for planning granted consent for additional remediation of the former Union Carbide site to proceed including parts of Homebush Bay.[15] Approximately 900,000 tons of soil were excavated from the Union Carbide site, 190,000 tons of soil from the adjacent Allied Feeds site and approximately 50,000 tons of sediment from the bay. Remediation of the Allied Feeds Site was completed in August 2009, Homebush Bay sediments in August 2010, and the Union Carbide site in March 2011. The value of the remediation work was $35M for the Allied Feeds site and $100 million for Union Carbide site and Homebush Bay sediments.[16][17]

The Timbrol factory was on the shore of Homebush Bay in the Sydney suburb of Rhodes. Homebush Bay is on the Parramatta River which flows into Sydney Harbour. Tibrol produced phenol, the insecticides chlorobenzene/chlorophenol/DDT, and the herbicides 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T. Union Carbide continued the production of the 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T until 1976 and chlorobenzene/chlorophenol/DDT until 1983. Union Carbide also commenced the production of Bisphenol A in 1960 and Phenol Formaldehyde resins in 1964.[12]:9
Union Carbide reclaimed land on neighboring properties by depositing spent lime and ash into the adjacent marshes in Homebush Bay. This practice, which had been approved by the Maritime Services Board, ceased in 1970.
Union Carbide ceased operations in Australia in 1985.[13] In 1987 the New South Wales Pollution Control Commission ordered Union Carbide to remediate the site. This work, which cost Union Carbide $30 million, was conducted between 1988 and 1993. The work involved excavation and encapsulation of the contaminated soil.[14]
In 2004 the minister for planning granted consent for additional remediation of the former Union Carbide site to proceed including parts of Homebush Bay.[15] Approximately 900,000 tons of soil were excavated from the Union Carbide site, 190,000 tons of soil from the adjacent Allied Feeds site and approximately 50,000 tons of sediment from the bay. Remediation of the Allied Feeds Site was completed in August 2009, Homebush Bay sediments in August 2010, and the Union Carbide site in March 2011. The value of the remediation work was $35M for the Allied Feeds site and $100 million for Union Carbide site and Homebush Bay sediments.[16][17]

Union Carbide Corporation is a wholly owned subsidiary (since 2001) of Dow Chemical Company. It currently employs more than 2,400 people.[2] Union Carbide produces chemicals and polymers that undergo one or more further conversions by customers before reaching consumers. Some are high-volume commodities and others are specialty products meeting the needs of smaller markets. Markets served include paints and coatings, packaging, wire and cable, household products, personal care, pharmaceuticals, automotive, textiles, agriculture, and oil and gas. The company is a former component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.[3] Union Carbide was 50.9% stakeholder in Union Carbide India Limited, the company responsible for the Bhopal disaster.[4]
Founded in 1917, as the Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation from a merger with National Carbon Company, the company's researchers developed an economical way to make ethylene from natural gas liquids, such as ethane and propane, giving birth to the modern petrochemical industry. Before divesting them, the chemical giant owned consumer products Eveready and Energizer batteries, Glad bags and wraps, Simoniz car wax, and Prestone antifreeze. The company divested other businesses before being acquired by Dow Chemical on February 6, 2001, including electronic chemicals, polyurethane intermediates, industrial gases and carbon products.[5]

History[edit]
The Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation was formed on November 1, 1917, from the merger of the Union Carbide Company founded in 1898, the National Carbon Company founded in 1886, Linde Air Products Company, maker of liquid oxygen, and the Prest-O-Lite company, manufacturer of calcium carbide. In 1920 the company set up a chemicals division which manufactured ethylene glycol for use as automotive antifreeze. The company continued to acquire related chemical producers, including the Bakelite Corporation in 1939. The company changed its name to "Union Carbide Corporation" in 1957 and was often referred to as Carbide. It operated Oak Ridge National Laboratory from 1947 until the late 1970s.[6]
During the Cold war era the company was active in the field of rocket propulsion research & development for aerospace and guided missile applications, particularly in the field of chemicals and plastics, solid rocket motors, storable liquid fuels. R&D activities has been centered at the Technical Center near Charleston, West Virginia.[7] The Aerospace Materials Department was established for the mentioned purposes within the company's Carbon Products Division.[8]
Ucar batteries was Carbide's industrial and consumer zinc chloride battery business. The business including Energizer alkaline batteries was sold to Ralston Purina in 1986, following a hostile takeover operation.
After the Bhopal disaster, Union Carbide was the subject of repeated takeover attempts. In order to pay off its debt, Carbide sold many of its most familiar brands such as Glad Trashbags and Eveready Batteries. Dow Chemical announced the purchase of Carbide in 1999 for $8.89 billion in stock.[9]
Hawks Nest Tunnel disaster[edit]
Main article: Hawks Nest Tunnel Disaster
The Hawks Nest Tunnel disaster took place between 1927 and 1932 in a West Virginia tunnel project led by Union Carbide. During the construction of the tunnel, workers found the mineral silica and were asked to mine it for use in electroprocessing steel. The workers were not given masks or breathing equipment to use while mining. Due to silica dust exposure, many workers developed silicosis, a debilitating lung disease. According to a marker on site, there were 109 admitted deaths. A congressional hearing placed the death toll at 476.[10]
Asbestos mining and 'Calidria' brand fibers[edit]
In the early 1960s, Union Carbide Corporation began mining a newly identified outcrop of chrysotile asbestos fibers near King City and New Idria, California. The fibers were sold under the brand name "Calidria", a combination of "Cal" and "Idria." These fibers were sold in large quantities for a wide variety of purposes, including addition into joint compound or drywall accessory products.[11] Union Carbide sold the mine to its employees under the name KCAC ("King City Asbestos Mine") in the 1980s, but it only operated for a few more years.[citation needed]
Bhopal disaster[edit]
Main article: Bhopal disaster
Union Carbide India Limited, owned by Union Carbide (50.9%) and Indian investors (49.1%), operated a pesticide plant in the Indian city of Bhopal.[4] Around midnight on 3 December 1984, methyl isocyanate (MIC) gas was accidentally released from the plant, exposing more than 500,000 people to MIC and other chemicals. The government of Madhya Pradesh confirmed a total of 3,787 deaths related to the gas release. It left an estimated 40,000 individuals permanently disabled, maimed, or suffering from serious illness, making it one of the world's worst industrial disasters. Union Carbide was sued by the Government of India and agreed to an out-of-court settlement of US$470 million in 1989. The plant site has not yet been cleaned up. Warren Anderson, CEO at the time of the disaster, and Carbide refused to answer to homicide charges and remained fugitives from India's courts. The U.S. denied several extradition requests. Anderson died on 29 September 2014 in Florida. Seven Indian employees of Union Carbide were convicted of criminal negligence in 2010 and fined $2,000 each. In 1982, Carbide's auditors warned of a possible 'runaway reaction'. Carbide didn't supply an antidote, maintained that MIC was "nothing more than a potent tear gas". Carbide insisted the accident was an act of sabotage by a rogue worker.
Union Carbide in Australia[edit]
Union Carbide's operations in Australia commenced in 1957 when they purchased the plant of the Australian owned company Timbrol Ltd. The Timbrol factory was on the shore of Homebush Bay in the Sydney suburb of Rhodes. Homebush Bay is on the Parramatta River which flows into Sydney Harbour. Tibrol produced phenol, the insecticides chlorobenzene/chlorophenol/DDT, and the herbicides 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T. Union Carbide continued the production of the 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T until 1976 and chlorobenzene/chlorophenol/DDT until 1983. Union Carbide also commenced the production of Bisphenol A in 1960 and Phenol Formaldehyde resins in 1964.[12]:9
Union Carbide reclaimed land on neighboring properties by depositing spent lime and ash into the adjacent marshes in Homebush Bay. This practice, which had been approved by the Maritime Services Board, ceased in 1970.
Union Carbide ceased operations in Australia in 1985.[13] In 1987 the New South Wales Pollution Control Commission ordered Union Carbide to remediate the site. This work, which cost Union Carbide $30 million, was conducted between 1988 and 1993. The work involved excavation and encapsulation of the contaminated soil.[14]
In 2004 the minister for planning granted consent for additional remediation of the former Union Carbide site to proceed including parts of Homebush Bay.[15] Approximately 900,000 tons of soil were excavated from the Union Carbide site, 190,000 tons of soil from the adjacent Allied Feeds site and approximately 50,000 tons of sediment from the bay. Remediation of the Allied Feeds Site was completed in August 2009, Homebush Bay sediments in August 2010, and the Union Carbide site in March 2011. The value of the remediation work was $35M for the Allied Feeds site and $100 million for Union Carbide site and Homebush Bay sediments.[16][17]

Union Carbide Corporation, major American manufacturer of chemicals, petrochemicals, and related products. It became a subsidiary of the Dow Chemical Company in 2001.The company was formed in 1917 as Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation, acquiring four earlier companies: Linde Air Products Company (established 1907), National Carbon Company (1899), Prest-O-Lite Company, Inc. (1913), and Union Carbide Company (1898). It assumed the name Union Carbide Corporation in 1957.Formed during wartime, the company immediately took on the manufacture of new diversified products, providing helium, ferrozirconium, and activated carbon for the U.S. military, thus setting the pattern for the company’s future development. After World War I, it retained its chemicals business and moved into the consumer field, becoming one of the first companies to use market research to discover potential consumer needs and creating products to fill them. Early products of this type were the first antifreeze, Prestone (introduced in 1927), and the first batteries for portable radios, under the Eveready brand (introduced in 1959).World War II further expanded the company’s research and development activities. Union Carbide was a major contributor to the development of the first atomic bomb. Union Carbide had already become a pioneer in the manufacture of petrochemicals. It also produced plastics, industrial gases, metals and carbon products, and electronics and medical products. In 1986–87, however, it sold many of its home and automobile products businesses (such as those for batteries, waxes, and antifreeze).On Dec. 3, 1984, Union Carbide’s pesticide plant in Bhopal, India, was the scene of one of the worst industrial accidents in history when methyl isocyanate gas leaked from the plant and spread over a populated area, killing at least 2,000 people at the time of the accident and causing an estimated 15,000 to 20,000 subsequent deaths. Many thousands more sustained lifelong injuries. Suits for damages were brought against the company, and in 1989 India’s Supreme Court ordered Union Carbide to pay $470 million in compensation to the victims of the accident. After its merger with Dow, Union Carbide remained a leading producer of chemicals and polymers for use in a variety of industrial and consumer products, including paints, solvents, antifreeze, and coatings.

Wholly Owned Subsidiary of The Dow Chemical Company
Incorporated: 1917 as Union Carbide & Carbon
Corporation 
Employees: 3,800

NAIC: 3251 Basic Chemical Manufacturing
Union Carbide Corporation is the world's largest producer of ethylene glycol, commonly used as antifreeze, and is a leading manufacturer of the world's most widely used plastic, polyethylene. In spite of a disaster at its Bhopal, India, pesticide plant in 1984 that resulted in numerous deaths and serious health problems for people living in the region, as well as a devastating takeover attempt that followed, the corporation remained one of top 20 exporters in the United States in the early 1990s. Union Carbide pioneered the petrochemicals industry and introduced the first two modern plastics. The company became known as "chemist to the chemical industry and metal-lurgist to the metals industry" because of its production of many of the building blocks of those two industries.
Origins
The Union Carbide & Carbon Corporation (UCC) was formed in 1917 from the combination of four companies: Union Carbide Co. (incorporated 1898), Linde Air Products Co. (incorporated 1907), National Carbon Co., Inc. (incorporated 1899), and Prest-O-Lite Co., Inc. (incorporated 1913). The new entity was organized as a holding company, with its four members acting relatively autonomously and cooperating where their businesses converged.
The merger combined what had often been competing interests to form an industrial chemicals powerhouse. The oldest member of the quartet, Union Carbide, had been formed to manufacture calcium carbide, which was used in the production of metal alloys. A by-product of alloying calcium carbide with aluminum was acetylene, a gas that company executives hoped would prove useful for street and household lighting. When Thomas Edison's electric incandescent light bulbs proved more practical for most lighting, however, it looked as if Union Carbide's acetylene lighting business was obsolete. Luckily, a French researcher discovered that acetylene could be burned in oxygen to produce a hot, metal-cutting flame. A whole new market for the gas emerged, and UCC was ready to take advantage of it.
The company continued to manufacture calcium carbide at plants in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, and Niagara Falls, New York, and by 1900 the Union Carbide's capital stock stood at $6 million. Union Carbide combined America's first commercial high-carbon ferrochrome process, which had been developed by company founder Major James T. Moorhead in the late 1890s, with a metal alloying business acquired in 1906. The subsidiary created a line of metals composed of iron and one or more other metals, known in the industry as ferroalloys. Ferroalloys made the production of alloy steels more efficient because they could be incorporated more easily with steel to create new metals with specific properties. Union Carbide's low-carbon ferrochrome, for example, was a precursor of modern stainless steel.
Union Carbide had been involved with the Linde Air Products Co. through joint acetylene experiments for about six years before the formation of the UCC holding company. As one of America's first oxygen-producing concerns and, after 1917, part of one of the country's largest chemical companies, Linde soon became the world's largest producer of industrial gases such as acetylene, hydrogen, and nitrogen. These gases formed the foundation of the petrochemical industry. The Prest-O-Lite Company had been one of Union Carbide's primary competitors for most of the two companies' histories, but three years of cooperative acetylene experiments among UCC, Prest-O-Lite, and Linde made the merger smoother. Before the turn of the 20th century, National Carbon Co. had produced the first commercial dry cell battery and offered it under the Eveready trademark. The well-known brand would be a UCC staple for the next seven decades.
With combined research efforts and a national push for new technologies to help win World War I, further developments came in rapid succession at Union Carbide. New products included batteries for portable radios and corrosion and heat-resistant ferroalloys that strengthened the steel used to build skyscrapers, bridges, and automobiles. The government's need for ethylene during the "Great War" also generated interest in hydrocarbon byproducts. These substances were made from calcium carbide and would later become the raw materials for the production of plastics, synthetic rubber, fibers, solvents, explosives, and industrial chemicals. In 1919, the first production of synthetic ethylene began. Ethylene would develop into the industry's most important industrial hydrocarbon, eventually used in polyethylene (plastics), polystyrene (Styrofoam), and antifreeze, among other products. Union Carbide's Prestone brand ethylene glycol soon became the top-selling antifreeze, a position it held throughout the 20th century.
The new corporate structure enabled UCC to leverage the combined assets of its four primary subsidiaries and embark on an acquisitions spree that was not halted even by the Great Depression. In 1919 alone, the company acquired an acetylene manufacturer, created Canadian subsidiaries of National Carbon Co. and Prest-O-Lite, and purchased a new headquarters at 42nd Street and Madison Avenue in New York City. This new home served the company until the late 1970s. During the 1920s, Union Carbide expanded its overseas interests with the acquisition of a Norwegian hydroelectric plant in 1925 and a calcium carbide/ferroalloy plant in that same country in 1929. The holding company added to its battery business with the purchase of Manhattan Electrical Supply Co. in 1926. UCC annexed two domestic industrial gas interests in 1928 and strengthened its industrial electric furnace business with the acquisition of the Acheson Graphite Corporation in 1928.
U.S. Vanadium Co. Acquired


One of the most vital acquisitions UCC made during the 1920s was that of U.S. Vanadium Co.'s Colorado mine, mill, and reduction plant in 1926. Carbide's subsequent vanadium research was a truly corporate venture that coordinated several of the company's subsidiaries and eventually involved the company in the government's atomic energy program. Uranium-bearing materials were located and provided by U.S. Vanadium. UCC scientists demonstrated that gaseous diffusion could be used to separate quantities of uranium-235 and contracted with the federal government in 1943 to operate the Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant. After intensive research, UCC's Linde Company perfected a refining process for treating uranium concentrates. A plant was built and operated by the Electro Metal-lurgical Company (acquired in 1922) to provide extensive metallurgical research and manufacture uranium. Finally, Union Carbide and Carbon Research Laboratories contributed to the development of the atomic weapon itself.
In 1939, UCC acquired the Bakelite Corporation, which developed the first modern plastic, phenol formaldehyde. In 1941, Carbide made permanent-press fabrics possible with its development of glyoxal.
Union Carbide earned a reputation for developing raw materials for the chemical and metals industries during World War II. Since natural rubber was in very short supply during the war, the company resumed its experiments with butene, a hydrocarbon that was developed into a synthetic rubber. Modern neoprene is a familiar example of butene's application.
Postwar prosperity camouflaged nagging problems at UCC: the company was chalking up a bad track record of discovering new substances and processes but not capitalizing on them. For example, UCC pioneered urethanes, but did not commit enough financial resources to the new field in time to profit. The company also made permanent-press fabrics possible with its development of glyoxal, but could not come up with a consumer product that maximized its profit potential. It often ended up riding the coattails of movements it had spawned. Union Carbide's program of internal promotion engendered company loyalty, but it also stifled creativity. The company started a slide into relative mediocrity that, with few exceptions, would consume the next three decades.
Company Perspectives:
Union Carbide Corporation is a chemical and polymers company with over 3,800 employees. The company possesses some of the industry's most advanced process and catalyst technologies, and operates some of the most cost-efficient, large-scale production facilities in the world. Union Carbide primarily produces chemicals and polymers that undergo one or more further conversions by customers before reaching consumers. Some of these materials are high-volume commodities, while others are specialty products meeting the needs of smaller market niches. The end-uses served include paints and coatings, packaging, wire and cable, household products, personal care, pharmaceuticals, automotive, textiles, agriculture and oil and gas. 
A succession of well-meaning chief executives kept UCC in "turnaround mode." Under the direction of CFO Morse G. Dial, Carbide absorbed its major operating subsidiaries and formally relinquished its holding company status in 1949. Dial hoped to reverse the excessive autonomy at UCC by creating a "President's Office" composed of the corporation's division heads. The company name was changed to Union Carbide Corporation in 1957 to reflect its reorganization from a holding company to a diversified corporation. By that time, Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation had established some 400 plants in the United States and Canada, in addition to overseas affiliates. The company went from having 18 autonomous divisions to just four primary domestic groups: Union Carbide Chemicals Co., Linde Co., Union Carbide Plastics Co., and Union Carbide Consumer Products Co. Even though these corporate segments were technically divisions, the retention of the word "company" in each section's name represented the perpetuation of the decentralized management structure of a holding company, and its detrimental effect on Union Carbide continued.
UCC Develops Polyethylene
Polyethylene, a plastic used in squeeze bottles (high-density polyethylene), as well as in films and sheeting (low-density polyethylene), became Union Carbide's largest dollar-volume product after World War II. An olefins division was set up in the 1950s to supply low-cost raw materials for the chemicals and plastics industry in the 1950s. For several years, the company sold these plastics to other manufacturers. However, Carbide finally did capitalize on this discovery in 1964, when Glad branded plastic wraps, bags, and straws were introduced. Within just four years, Glad became the leading brand in its market.
By the 1960s, Union Carbide occupied the top spot in many of its primary fields, including industrial gases, carbon electrodes for industrial electric furnaces, batteries, atomic energy, polyethylene plastic, and ferroalloys. In 1965, the conglomerate's sales topped $2 billion for the first time. From 1956 to 1966, Union Carbide parlayed a few plants in a dozen countries into 60 major subsidiary and associated companies with plants in 30 countries serving over 100 markets. International operations of the conglomerate contributed 29 percent of its annual sales, and by mid-decade the company name was changed to Union Carbide International Co. to reflect its increased global presence.
In spite of consistently rising sales, which doubled from 1960 to 1970 to $3 million, Union Carbide's profits plummeted and stayed low from 1966 to 1971. Carbide could claim leading market shares, but top shares of low-margin commodities still equaled low profits. Industry-wide overcapacity in ferroalloys ran as high as 70 percent in the early 1960s, and prices for these products fell 25 percent. The company was compelled to cut its ferroalloys work force by 40 percent and close a major plant at Niagara Falls. To make matters worse, the market for low-density polyethylene stagnated for the first time in over 20 years.


Union Carbide was still the second-largest chemical producer in the United States, but it invariably lagged behind most of its competitors in terms of growth and profitability during this period. Misguided investments in petroleum, pharmaceuticals, semi-conductors, mattresses, and undersea equipment, combined with a $1 billion petrochemicals complex at Taft, Louisiana, which ran in the red for the last three years of the 1960s, further tarnished Union Carbide's standing. Not surprisingly, the conglomerate's stock dropped from $75 in 1965 to $45 in 1968 as the company "earned a reputation for aimless fumbling," according to Business Week. 
Unfortunately for Union Carbide, environmental complaints about the company's Marietta, Ohio, ferroalloy plant came to a head in 1971, when consumer champion Ralph Nader brought a decade of local residents' complaints into the national spotlight. For four years, the conglomerate had largely ignored public and government efforts to make it clean up several plants that were polluting the air over West Virginia. Union Carbide's resistance to outside influence gave it the public image of a reactionary bully concerned only with profits and scornful of the environment, a stigma that the company would bear for years to come. In 1971, UCC capitulated to federal orders that it immediately use more expensive low-sulphur coal to reduce noxious sulfur dioxide emissions by 40 percent. The company was given a fall 1974 deadline to install $8 million in advanced emissions scrubbers.
The bad news continued, as the recession of 1970 and 1971 hammered commodities companies like UCC, with the chemicals and plastics markets entering another cycle of overcapacity. From 1968 to 1973, UCC's sales grew by only 4 percent annually, well below the industry average. CFO and president F. Perry Wilson, who had been promoted to those offices in 1971, made his bid to turn Union Carbide around. His restructuring plan included three primary changes. First, he tried to pare back peripheral activities and focus on plastics and chemicals. Among the businesses sold were a bedding company, most of UCC's oil and gas interests, a pollution-monitoring devices business, a plastic container line, a fibers business, a jewelry line, and an insect repellant business. Second, he worked to shift the corporate focus from market share to profitability. Finally, Wilson tried to plan capital and capacity investments so that UCC could avoid the inefficiencies and plummeting prices that had accompanied industry-wide overcapacity in the past.

A New Business Development department was formed in 1970 to coordinate the three areas outside of chemicals and plastics that Wilson did not sell: Biomedical Systems, Marine Foods, and Agricultural Systems. Another key organizational change was the disbanding of the Consumer & Related Products Division, which had contributed 22 percent of UCC's annual revenues. The Eveready business was split off into a Battery Products Division, while Glad and Prestone were coordinated in a division with the production of their raw materials. Despite the fragmentation of the Consumer Products Division, Wilson said that he hoped that consumer products would contribute 50 percent of UCC's revenues in the future. He recognized that these relatively stable, high-margin product lines sustained Union Carbide through economic downturns.
For a few years, it looked as if the new strategy was working. From 1973 to 1981, earnings per share rose 100 percent. UCC increased productivity dramatically during the late 1960s and early 1970s to keep its corporate head above water. From 1967 to 1973, physical output of chemicals and plastics rose 60 percent, while per-pound production costs were cut by one-third. William S. Sneath continued these trends when he became chairman and CEO in 1977. Still, the company found itself increasingly strapped for cash. Steadily rising expenses in Europe resulted in a $32 million loss in 1978, which forced Carbide to divest virtually all of its European petrochemicals and plastics operations. That same year, UCC was forced by its creditors to retire $292 million in long-term debt, which forced it to borrow another $300 million in 1979. That year, Carbide's Standard & Poor's credit rating fell from AA to A+, and its stock fell as low as 42 percent below its $61 book value.
Chairman Sneath embarked on another round of cost-cutting in 1980, pruning the executive staff by 1,000 and divesting a total of 39 businesses. Sneath retained five primary businesses: graphite electrodes, batteries, agricultural products, polyethylene, and industrial gases. By 1980, Carbide had 116,000 employees at over 500 plants, mines, and laboratories in 130 countries, bringing in over $9 billion in annual sales. Sneath embarked on a plan to invest profits into high-margin consumer goods and specialty chemicals.
Disaster Strikes in India
The disaster at Union Carbide's pesticide plant in Bhopal, India, in December 1984 struck the corporation just as it was beginning to make lasting strides toward profitability. UCC had established battery plants in India as early as the mid-1920s and had seven plants with 5,000 employees there by 1967. India's chronic food shortages precipitated a government-sponsored "Green Revolution" in the 1960s, with the country's socialist government eager to join Union Carbide in establishing pesticide and fertilizer plants. In 1975, the Indian government granted Union Carbide a license to manufacture pesticides, and a plant was built on the sparsely populated outskirts of the regional capital of Bhopal. The plant drew more than 900,000 people to Bhopal by 1984. This plant was built, owned, and operated by Union Carbide India, Limited (UCIL), in which Union Carbide Corporation held just over half the stock.
In December 1984, at least five tons of methyl isocyanate gas (MIC) seeped out of the plant over a 30 minute period. Union Carbide maintained that the accident, which killed 3,800 people and permanently injured another 10,000, was sabotage. Newsweek magazine called the incident "the worst industrial accident in history." According to a statement posted on the Union Carbide Web site, "An initial investigation by Union Carbide experts reported that a large volume of water had apparently been introduced into the MIC tank, causing a chemical reaction forcing the chemical release valve to open and allowed the gas to leak. A committee of experts working on behalf of the Indian government conducted its own investigation and reached the same conclusion. An independent investigation by the engineering consulting firm Arthur D. Little determined that the water could only have been introduced into the tank deliberately, since safety systems were in place and operational that would have prevented water from entering the tank by accident."
Five senior Indian executives of Union Carbide were arrested. The Indian government charged Warren Anderson, chairman of Union Carbide's board, with "corporate and criminal liability" and accused the Union Carbide management of "cruel and wanton negligence." Many class action suits were filed against Union Carbide on behalf of the victims. In April 1988, a court in India ordered Carbide to pay $192 million in "interim" damages. Union Carbide and the Indian government reached a much-criticized settlement for $470 million in 1989. In 1994, Carbide sold its share of the Bhopal plant to MacLeod Russell (India) Limited. Proceeds of the sale were used to fund a hospital in Bhopal for victims of the tragedy.


In addition to the human toll, the incident set off a chain reaction at Carbide. By 1985, the company's market value dropped by two-thirds to less than $3 billion, and GAF Corporation's Samuel Heyman accumulated enough stock to mount a hostile takeover bid of $5.3 billion. After working for two decades to expand its consumer products lines, Carbide was forced to sell off its Consumer Products Division, a profitable group that included Glad trash bags, Eveready batteries, Prestone, and STP automotive products, for $840 million. The corporation borrowed $2.8 billion, raised a total of $3.6 billion in asset sales, and repurchased $4.4 billion in stock to repulse Heyman's attack.
Carbide scaled back to the three main business lines (chemicals and plastics, industrial gases, and carbon products) that were once its strength and benefited from sharply reduced interest rates and falling costs of petrochemical feedstocks. Nevertheless, the company had lost the safety net provided by its consumer products. Union Carbide's debt stood at 63 percent of capital, and its equity was cut to a quarter of its former value. Income rose 78 percent in 1987 to $232 million, but high debt service made it hard for the company to develop and introduce new products. In 1988, UCC reduced its debt by more than $400 million and increase equity by almost $600 million.
By 1988, Union Carbide's corporate identity had begun to take clearer shape. Sales hit $8.3 billion (one-third below the 1981 peak), profits were up to more than $300 million, and the company had a new CEO, Robert D. Kennedy. His goals for the company included growth, an ambitious prospect in the face of depleted finances. His solution was to trim operating expenses and generate profits. Between 1984 and 1988, payroll was reduced from 98,000 employees to 43,000, while Carbide set up joint ventures with British Petroleum Co. and Allied-Signal Corporation and made a few modest acquisitions.
In 1989, Carbide advanced slightly on its long journey toward financial recovery. Net income was $573 million. Profits in the chemicals and plastics divisions put Carbide in the number two spot on the list of the top ten publicly traded companies in America. The company succeeded in reducing its debt-to-capital ratio to below 50 percent and invested $181 million in research and development. That year, the company introduced its proprietary LIHDE Oxygen Combustion System, which used pure oxygen to burn organic wastes.
Carbide's fate was far from settled. A $3.3 billion debt stymied both diversification and overseas expansion. Carbide's sales were dependent on cyclical commodities such as polyethylene, and as the chemical industry stumbled, earnings declined. Net income decreased 46 percent from 1990. The brightest prospects were in the industrial gas unit: Carbide remained number one in North America in that industry, with $2.4 billion in sales.
The company launched a "work simplification program" in the early 1990s. The program had a cost reduction goal of $400 million a year by the end of 1994. Carbide progressed toward this goal by repurchasing 20 million shares, spinning off two small businesses, and selling 50 percent of its carbon business in 1990.
As a fitting mark to Union Carbide's 75th anniversary in 1992, the company had the year's best-performing stock on the Dow Jones list of 30 industrials. Carbide was half way to achieving its $400 million cost reduction goal and had endured a loss of $187 million. The dramatically smaller corporation had shifted its focus from diversification to becoming a low-cost leader in basic chemicals. This strategy included uncharacteristic environmentalism: Carbide anticipated "inevitable government mandates on waste reduction and recycling" when it started reprocessing plastic bottles in 1992. After Bhopal, UCC's efforts helped raise industry performance standards and levels worldwide, and the company was praised for its "responsible care" efforts.
Expansion through Joint Ventures
During the 1990s, Union Carbide expanded its business worldwide by engaging in joint ventures with both American and foreign companies. In 1994, Carbide announced a joint venture with EniChem, a European chemicals company, to develop, manufacture, and sell polyethylene under the name Polimeri Europa. Each company would own 50 percent of the new firm. The arrangement would make Carbide and EniChem the largest producers of polyethylene in western Europe. EniChem's existing polyethylene plants in Germany, France, and Italy were made part of the new company, while a new 400,000-tons-a-year plant in Brindisi, Italy, was planned.
The year 1996 saw further expansion internationally when Carbide announced a joint venture with China's Shanghai Petrochemical Co., Ltd. to manufacture and sell latex polymer emulsions under the name Shanghai Petrochemical Union Car-bide Emulsion Systems Co., Ltd. The new company would construct a plant in Jinshanwei, China, near Shanghai. A second expansion into the Chinese market came later in 1996 with Carbide's subsidiary Amerchol Corp. announcing that it would be constructing a plant in Guangdong Province, China.


Carbide teamed with Exxon Chemical Company in 1997 to create the joint venture company Univation Technologies. Combining both Carbide's and Exxon's patented polyethylene manufacturing processes, Univation would manufacture polyethylene using these processes and license the technologies. Univation would also license the super condensed mode technology, which doubles polyethylene production.
Carbide expanded its presence in Asia with the 1999 announcement of a joint venture with Petronas, the national oil company of Malaysia. The two firms would build a petrochemical complex in Malaysia focusing on ethylene oxide and its derivatives and oxo alcohols and oxo derivatives. In 2001, the Kerteh Integrated Petrochemicals Complex opened, with Union Carbide owning 24 percent of the project.
Another joint venture was announced in 1999. Carbide and Tosco Corp. joined in a 50–50 venture to combine their polypropylene business. The deal was expected to take Carbide, ranked eighth in North America among makers of polypropylene, into the top five producers. Under the agreement, Tosco would build a 775 million-pound-per-year plant in Linden, New Jersey, while Carbide would contribute its two plants in Seadrift, Texas, and Norco, Louisiana.
Acquisition by Dow Chemical
On August 4, 1999, it was announced that Union Carbide would become a subsidiary of The Dow Chemical Company. The next two years saw negotiations between the two firms on the terms of the deal. Negotiations were also held with the European Commission and the Federal Trade Commission to get government approval of such a large merger. As part of the agreement, Dow was obliged to divest some of its holdings, including its gas-phase polyethylene metallocene technology, while Carbide had to divest its 50 percent ownership in Polimeri Europa, its joint venture with EniChem. Finally, all discussion was over and Dow acquired Carbide for $11.6 billion on February 6, 2001. The deal created the world's second-largest chemical company, just behind DuPont. According to Michael Parker, chairman and CEO of Dow, quoted by Robert Brown in Chemical Market Reporter: "While the negotiations took longer than first imagined, we are pleased with the outcome and consider it a win-win for everyone involved." Union Carbide chairman and CEO William H. Joyce called the deal, according to Joseph Chang in Chemical Market Reporter, "the right move at a good time. In a consolidating chemical industry where fewer, more powerful companies will exist, the combination of Dow and Union Carbide now sets the standard for the industry."
Since the acquisition, Carbide has seen generally positive financial growth. In 1999, the company posted net sales of $5.87 billion and a profit of $291 million. In 2000, net sales were $6.52 billion with a profit of $162 million. The next two years saw losses on lower net sales. 2001 sales were $5.4 billion with a loss of $699 million, while 2002 sales were $4.78 billion with a loss of $510 million. In 2003, however, Carbide moved into the black again with net sales of $5.16 billion and a profit of $313 million. This trend continued in 2004 with net sales of $5.86 billion and a profit of $687 million. For the first quarter of 2005, Carbide reported net sales of $1.68 billion and a profit of $280 million. As Union Carbide faced the 21st century with rising sales and profits, its chemical products continued to be essential to the manufacturing of countless other products throughout the world.

Union Carbide Corporation is the world’s largest producer of ethylene glycol, commonly used as antifreeze, and is a leading manufacturer of the world’s most widely used plastic, polyethylene. In spite of a massive fatal disaster at its Bhopal, India, pesticide plant in 1984 and a devastating takeover attempt that followed, the corporation remained one of top twenty exporters in the United States in the early 1990s. Union Carbide pioneered the petrochemicals industry and introduced the first two modern plastics. The company became known as “chemist to the chemical industry and metallurgist to the metals industry” because of its production of many of the building blocks of those two industries.
The Union Carbide & Carbon Corp. (UCC) was formed in 1917 from the combination of four companies: Union Carbide Co. (incorporated 1898), Linde Air Products Co. (incorporated 1907), National Carbon Co., Inc. (incorporated 1899), and Prest-O-Lite Co., Inc. (incorporated 1913). The new entity was organized as a holding company, with its four members acting relatively autonomously and cooperating where their businesses converged.
The merger combined what had often been competing interests to form an industrial chemicals powerhouse. The oldest member of the quartet, Union Carbide, had been formed to manufacture calcium carbide, which was used in the production of metal alloys. A by-product of alloying calcium carbide with aluminum was acetylene, a gas that company executives hoped would prove useful for street and household lighting. But when Thomas Edison’s electric incandescent light bulbs proved more practical for most lighting, it looked as if Union Carbide’s acetylene lighting business was obsolete. Luckily, a French researcher discovered that acetylene could be burned in oxygen to produce a hot, metal-cutting flame. A whole new market for the gas emerged, and UCC was ready to take advantage of it.
The company continued to manufacture calcium carbide at plants in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, and Niagara Falls, New York, and by 1900 the Union Carbide’s capital stock stood at $6 million. Union Carbide combined America’s first commercial high-carbon ferrochrome process, which had been developed by company founder Major James T. Moorhead in the late 1890s, with a metal alloying business acquired in 1906. The subsidiary created a line of metals composed of iron and one or more other metals, known in the industry as ferroalloys. Ferroalloys made the production of alloy steels more efficient, because they could be incorporated more easily with steel to create new metals with specific properties. Union Carbide’s low-carbon ferrochrome, for example, was a precursor of modern stainless steel.
Union Carbide had been involved with the Linde Air Products Co. through joint acetylene experiments for about six years before the formation of the UCC holding company. As one of America’s first oxygen-producing concerns and (after 1917) part of one of the country’s largest chemical companies, Linde soon became the world’s largest producer of industrial gases like acetylene, hydrogen and nitrogen. These gases formed the foundation of the petrochemical industry. The Prest-O-Lite Company had been one of Union Carbide’s primary competitors for most of the two companies’ histories, but three years of cooperative acetylene experiments among UCC, Prest-O-Lite, and Linde made the merger more smooth. Before the turn of the century, National Carbon Co. had produced the first commercial dry cell battery and offered it under the Eveready trademark. The well-known brand would be a UCC staple for the next seven decades.
With combined research efforts and a national push for new technologies to help win World War I, new developments came in rapid succession at Union Carbide. New products included batteries for portable radios and corrosion and heat-resistant ferroalloys that strengthened the steel used to build skyscrapers, bridges, and automobiles. The government’s need for ethylene during “the great war” also generated interest in hydrocarbon byproducts. These substances were made from calcium carbide and would later become the raw materials for the production of plastics, synthetic rubber, fibers, solvents, explosives, and industrial chemicals. In 1919 the first production of synthetic ethylene began. Ethylene would develop into the industry’s most important industrial hydrocarbon, eventually used in polyethylene (plastics), polystyrene (styrofoam), and antifreeze, among other products. Union Carbide’s Prestone brand ethylene glycol soon became the top-selling antifreeze, a position it held throughout the twentieth century.
The new corporate structure enabled UCC to leverage the combined assets of its four primary subsidiaries and embark on an acquisitions spree that wasn’t even halted by the Great Depression. In 1919 alone, the company acquired an acetylene manufacturer, created Canadian subsidiaries of National Carbon Co. and Prest-O-Lite, and purchased a new headquarters at 42nd 
Street and Madison Avenue in New York City. This new home served the company until the late 1970s. During the 1920s, Union Carbide expanded its overseas interests with the acquisition of a Norwegian hydroelectric plant in 1925 and a calcium carbide/ferroalloy plant in that same country in 1929. The holding company added to its battery business with the purchase of Manhattan Electrical Supply Co. in 1926. UCC annexed two domestic industrial gases interests in 1928 and strengthened its industrial electric furnace business with the acquisition of the Acheson Graphite Corporation in 1928.


One of UCC’s most vital acquisitions of the 1920s was the purchase of U.S. Vanadium Co.’s Colorado mine, mill, and reduction plant in 1926. Carbide’s subsequent vanadium research was a truly corporate venture that coordinated several of the company’s subsidiaries and eventually involved the company in the government’s atomic energy program. Uranium-bearing materials were located and provided by U.S. Vanadium. UCC scientists demonstrated that gaseous diffusion could be used to separate quantities of uranium-235 and contracted with the federal government in 1943 to operate the Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant. After intensive research, UCC’s Linde Company perfected a refining process for treating uranium concentrates. A plant was built and operated by the Electro Metallurgical Company (acquired in 1922) to provide extensive metallurgical research, and manufacture uranium. Finally, Union Carbide and Carbon Research Laboratories contributed to the development of the atomic weapon itself.
In 1939 UCC acquired the Bakelite Corporation, which developed the first modern plastic, phenol formaldehyde. And in 1941, Carbide made permanent-press fabrics possible with its development of glyoxal.
Union Carbide earned a reputation for developing raw materials for the chemical and metals industries during World War II. Since natural rubber was in very short supply during the war, the company resumed its experiments with butene, a hydrocarbon that was developed into a synthetic rubber. Modern neoprene is a familiar example of butene’s application.
Postwar prosperity camouflaged nagging problems at UCC: the company was chalking up a bad track record of discovering new substances and processes, but not capitalizing on them. For example, UCC pioneered urethanes, but didn’t commit enough financial resources to the new field in time to profit. The company also made permanent-press fabrics possible with its development of glyoxal, but couldn’t come up with a consumer product that maximized its profit potential. It often ended up riding the coattails of movements it had spawned. Union Carbide’ s program of internal promotion engendered company loyalty, but also stifled creativity. The company started a slide into relative mediocrity that, with few exceptions, would consume the next three decades.
A succession of well-meaning chief executives kept UCC in “turnaround mode.” Under the direction of CFO Morse G. Dial, Carbide absorbed its major operating subsidiaries and formally relinquished its holding company status in 1949. Dial hoped to reverse the excessive autonomy at UCC by creating a “President’s Office” composed of the corporation’s division heads. The company name was changed to Union Carbide Corporation in 1957 to reflect its reorganization from a holding company to a diversified corporation. By that time, Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation had established some 400 plants in the United States and Canada, in addition to overseas affiliates. The company went from having 18 autonomous divisions to just four primary domestic groups: Union Carbide Chemicals Co., Linde Co., Union Carbide Plastics Co., and Union Carbide Consumer Products Co. Even though these corporate segments were technically divisions, the retention of the word “company” in each section’s name represented the perpetuation of the decentralized management structure of a holding company, and its detrimental effect on Union Carbide continued.
Polyethylene, a plastic used in squeeze bottles (high-density polyethylene), as well as in films and sheeting (low-density polyethylene), became Union Carbide’s largest dollar-volume product after World War II. An olefins division was set up in the 1950s to supply low-cost raw materials for the chemicals and plastics industry in the 1950s. For several years the company sold these plastics to other manufacturers. But Carbide finally capitalized on this discovery in 1964, when Glad branded plastic wraps, bags, and straws were introduced. Within just four years, Glad became the leading brand in its market.
By the 1960s, Union Carbide occupied the top spot in many of its primary fields, including industrial gases, carbon electrodes for industrial electric furnaces, batteries, atomic energy, polyethylene plastic, and ferroalloys. In 1965 the conglomerate’s sales topped $2 billion for the first time. And from 1956 to 1966, Union Carbide parlayed a few plants in a dozen countries into 60 major subsidiary and associated companies with plants in 30 countries serving over 100 markets. International operations of the conglomerate contributed 29 percent of its annual sales, and mid-decade the company name was changed to Union Carbide International Co. to reflect its increased global presence.
But in spite of consistently rising sales (which doubled from 1960 to 1970 to $3 million) Union Carbide’s profits plummeted and stayed low from 1966 to 1971. Carbide could claim leading market shares, but top shares of low-margin commodities still equaled low profits. Industry-wide overcapacity in ferroalloys ran as high as 70 percent in the early 1960s, and prices for these products fell 25 percent. The company was compelled to cut its ferroalloys work force by 40 percent and close a major plant at Niagara Falls. To make matters worse, the market for low-density polyethylene stagnated for the first time in over 20 years.
Union Carbide was still the United States’ second-largest chemical producer, but it invariably lagged behind most of its competitors in terms of growth and profitability during this period. Misguided investments in petroleum, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, mattresses, and undersea equipment, combined with a $1 billion petrochemicals complex at Taft, Louisiana, which ran in the red for the last three years of the 1960s, further tarnished Union Carbide’s standing. Not surprisingly, the conglomerate’s stock dropped from $75 in 1965 to $45 in 1968 as the company “earned a reputation for aimless fumbling,” according to Business Week.


Unfortunately for Union Carbide, environmental complaints about the company’s Marietta, Ohio, ferroalloy plant came to a 
head in 1971, when consumer champion Ralph Nader brought a decade of local residents’ complaints into the national spotlight. For four years, the conglomerate had largely ignored public and government efforts to make it clean up several plants that were polluting the air over West Virginia. Union Carbide’s resistance to outside influence gave it the public image of a reactionary bully concerned only with profits and scornful of the environment, a stigma that would haunt the company for years to come. In 1971, UCC capitulated to federal orders that it immediately use more expensive low-sulphur coal to reduce noxious sulfur dioxide emissions by 40 percent. The company was given a fall 1974 deadline to install $8 million in advanced emissions scrubbers.
The bad news continued, as the recession of 1970-71 hammered commodities companies like UCC, with the chemicals and plastics markets entering another cycle of overcapacity. From 1968 to 1973, UCC’s sales grew by only 4 percent annually, well below the industry average. CFO and president F. Perry Wilson, who had been promoted to those offices in 1971, made his bid to turn Union Carbide around. His restructuring plan included three primary changes. First, he tried to pare back peripheral activities and focus on plastics and chemicals. Among the businesses sold were a bedding company, most of UCC’s oil and gas interests, a pollution-monitoring devices business, a plastic container line, a fibers business, a jewelry line, and an insect repellant business. Second, he worked to shift the corporate focus from market share to profitability. Finally, Wilson tried to plan capital and capacity investments so that UCC could avoid the inefficiencies and plummeting prices that had accompanied industry-wide overcapacity in the past.
A New Business Development Department was formed in 1970 to coordinate the three areas outside of chemicals and plastics that Wilson didn’t sell: Biomedical Systems, Marine Foods, and Agricultural Systems. Another key organizational change was the disbanding of the Consumer & Related Products Division, which had contributed 22 percent of UCC’s annual revenues. The Eveready business was split off into a Battery Products Division, while Glad and Prestone were coordinated in a division with the production of their raw materials. Despite the fragmentation of the Consumer Products Division, Wilson said that he hoped that consumer products would contribute 50 percent of UCC’s revenues in the future. He recognized that these relatively stable, high-margin product lines sustained Union Carbide through economic downturns.
For a few years, it looked as if the new strategy was working. From 1973 to 1981, earnings per share rose 100 percent. UCC increased productivity dramatically during the late 1960s and early 1970s to keep its corporate head above water. From 1967 to 1973, physical output of chemicals and plastics rose 60 percent, while per-pound production costs were cut by one-third. William S. Sneath continued these trends when he became chairman and CEO in 1977. Still, the company found itself increasingly strapped for cash. Steadily rising expenses in Europe resulted in a $32 million loss in 1978, which forced Carbide to divest virtually all of its European petrochemicals and plastics operations. That same year, UCC was forced by its creditors to retire $292 million in long-term debt, which forced it to borrow another $300 million in 1979. That year, Carbide’s Standard & Poor’s credit rating fell from A A to A +, and its stock fell as low as 42 percent below its $61 book value.
Chairman Sneath embarked on another round of cost-cutting in 1980, pruning the executive staff by 1,000 and divesting a total of 39 businesses. Sneath retained six primary businesses: graphite electrodes, batteries, agricultural products, polyethylene, and industrial gases. By 1980, Carbide had 116,000 employees at over 500 plants, mines, and laboratories in 130 countries, bringing in over $9 billion in annual sales. Sneath embarked on a plan to invest profits into high-margin consumer goods and specialty chemicals.
The massive disaster at Union Carbide’s pesticide plant in Bhopal, India, in December 1984 struck the corporation just as it was beginning to make lasting strides toward profitability. UCC had established battery plants in India as early as the mid-1920s, and had seven plants with 5,000 employees there by 1967. India’s chronic food shortages precipitated a government-sponsored “Green Revolution” in the 1960s, with the country’s socialist government eager to join Union Carbide in establishing pesticide and fertilizer plants. In 1975 the Indian government granted Union Carbide a license to manufacture pesticides, and a plant was built on the sparsely populated outskirts of the regional capital of Bhopal. The plant drew more than 900,000 people to Bhopal by 1984. Union Carbide officials estimated that at least five tons of methyl isocyanate (MIC) seeped out of the plant in just 30 minutes one day in December 1984. The accident killed over 2,300 people and permanently injured another 10,000. Newsweek magazine called the incident “the worst industrial accident in history.”
Five senior Indian executives of Union Carbide were arrested. The Indian government charged Warren Anderson, chairman of Union Carbide’s board, with “corporate and criminal liability” and accused the Union Carbide management of “cruel and wanton negligence.” Many class action suits were filed against Union Carbide on behalf of the victims. In April 1988, a court in India ordered Carbide to pay $192 million in “interim” damages. Union Carbide and the Indian government reached a much-criticized settlement for $470 million in 1989.
In addition to the human toll, the tragedy set off a chain reaction at Carbide: by 1985, the company’s market value dropped by two-thirds to less than $3 billion, and GAP Corp.’s Samuel Heyman accumulated enough stock to mount a hostile takeover bid of $5.3 billion. After working for two decades to expand its consumer products lines, Carbide was forced to sell off its Consumer Products Division, a profitable group that included Glad trash bags, Eveready batteries, Prestone, and STP automotive products, for $840 million. The corporation borrowed $2.8 billion, raised a total of $3.6 billion in asset sales, and repurchased $4.4 billion in stock to repulse Heyman’s attack.
Carbide scaled back to the three main business lines— chemicals and plastics, industrial gases, and carbon products— that were once its strength, and benefitted from sharply reduced interest rates and falling costs of petrochemical feedstocks. But the company had lost the safety net provided by its consumer products. Union Carbide’s debt stood at 63 percent of capital and its equity was cut to a quarter of its former value. Income rose 78 percent in 1987 to $232 million, but high debt service 
made it hard for the company to develop and introduce new products. In 1988 UCC reduced its debt by more than $400 million and increase equity by almost $600 million.


By 1988, Union Carbide’s corporate identity had begun to take clearer shape. Sales hit $8.3 billion (one-third below the 1981 peak), profits were up to more than $300 million, and the company had a new CEO, Robert D. Kennedy. His goals for the company included growth—an ambitious prospect in the face of depleted finances. His solution was to trim operating expenses and generate profits. Between 1984 and 1988, payroll was reduced from 98,000 employees to 43,000, while Carbide set up joint ventures with British Petroleum Co. and Allied-Signal Corp. and made a few modest acquisitions.
In 1989 Carbide advanced slightly on its long journey toward financial recovery. Net income was $573 million. Profits in the chemicals and plastics divisions put Carbide in the number two spot on the list of the top ten publicly traded companies in America. The company succeeded in reducing its debt-to-capital ratio to below 50 percent, and invested $181 million in research and development. That year, the company introduced its proprietary LIHDE Oxygen Combustion System, which used pure oxygen to burn organic wastes.
Carbide’s fate was far from settled. A $3.3 billion debt stymied both diversification and overseas expansion. Carbide’s sales were dependent on cyclical commodities such as polyethylene, and as the chemical industry stumbled, earnings declined. Net income decreased 46 percent from 1990. The brightest prospects were in the industrial gas unit—Carbide remained number one in North America in that industry, with $2.4 billion in sales.
The company launched a “work simplification program” in the early 1990s. The program had a cost reduction goal of $400 million a year by the end of 1994. Carbide progressed toward this goal by repurchasing 20 million shares, spinning off two small businesses, and selling 50 percent of its carbon business in 1990.
As a fitting mark to Union Carbide’s 75th anniversary in 1992, the company had the year’s best-performing stock on the Dow Jones list of 30 industrials. Carbide was half way to achieving its $400 million cost reduction goal, and had endured a loss of $187 million. The dramatically smaller corporation had shifted its focus from diversification to becoming a low-cost leader in basic chemicals. This strategy included uncharacteristic environmentalism: Carbide anticipated “inevitable government mandates on waste reduction and recycling” when it started reprocessing plastic bottles in 1992. After Bhopal, UCC’s efforts helped raise industry performance standards and levels worldwide, and the company was praised for its “Responsible Care” efforts.
Sales showed a slight gain in the 1993 first quarter, closing at $1.19 billion. The sale of Union Carbide’s OrganoSilicon business for $220 million completed Kennedy’s program to divest $500 million in assets. Although some Wall Street analysts predicted that Union Carbide Corporation would be subsumed by another firm, others characterized it as a “surprisingly potent company.”

Union Carbide Corporation
39 Old Ridgebury RoadDanbury, Connecticut 06817U.S.A.(203) 794-2000
Public CompanyIncorporated: November 1, 1917Employees: 91,459Sales: $6.343 billionMarket value: $3.703 billionStock Index: New York Amsterdam Basle BrusselsFrankfurt Geneva Lausanne London Paris Zurich
In 1876, the first carbon arc street light changed light into day in Cleveland, Ohio with the help of Charles F. Brush. As a result of this invention, a company was formed in 1886 to make street light carbons and later carbon electrodes for electric furnaces. Soon the Eveready trademark became a part of this company. Four years later, it produced the first commercial dry cell battery and then, in 1894, built one of the first industrial research laboratories in the United States.
Meanwhile in North Carolina in 1892 two men attempted to make aluminum in an electric furnace. Thomas L. Willson and Major James T. Morehead produced calcium carbide, resulting in acetylene. These two chemicals were considered mere laboratory curiosities at the time, but Morehead convinced several Chicago entrepreneurs in the use of acetylene for city and home lighting, and the Union Carbide Company was formed in 1898 to manufacture calcium carbide. Morehead didn’t give up hope for his electric furnace idea. In fact, in 1897, he, with the help of Guillaume de Chalmot, produced America’s first commercial high-carbon ferrochrome and furnished ferrochrome for armorplate during the Spanish-American War.
Electric lighting became practical during this time, eliminating any expansion for Union Carbide’s acetylene lighting business. But their calcium carbide plants continued to operate in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan and Niagara Falls, New York. In 1900 their capital stock was $6,000,000, par value $100. Dividends were at 4 percent, with Charles F. Dieterich as president, George O. Knapp as vice president, and A.B. Proal as secretary and treasurer. Their main office was located in Chicago, Illinois. In 1906 the company purchased an alloys business and a metals research laboratory, and established a separate division to produce alloys for steelmaking. Under the direction of Dr. Fredrick M. Becket, its chief metallurgist, the new company began a line of alloying metals that were respected in the field. One example is their creation of low-carbon ferrochrome, resulting in the development of modern stainless steels.
The discovery in France of a hot metal-cutting flame resulting from burning acetylene in oxygen, created a high demand for such resources. Charles Brush interested several electrode producers in forming the first oxygen-producing company in 1907. This company later became the Corporation’s present Linde Division. In 1911, Union Carbide bought interest in the oxygen company, therefore bringing together for the first time the carbon and carbide interests.
Union Carbide’s major competitor during this period was the Prest-O-Lite Company, the largest single purchaser of calcium carbide for acetylene lamps for automobiles. When an alternative form of acetylene was requested, Dr. George O. Curme, Jr. was hired by Prest-O-Lite in 1914 to find it. He consulted scientists from the Linde Company and Union Carbide to conduct research on the gas. The cooperative efforts resulted in the formation of the Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation in 1917.
The government’s need for ethylene during the World War I regenerated interest in hydrocarbon byproducts. In 1919 the first production of synthetic ethylene began. Dr. Curme and his associate, James A. Rafferty, predicted a future need for synthetic organic chemicals, and America’s petrochemical industry and the Corporation’s chemicals business were established in 1920. With combined research efforts, new developments occurred rapidly. New products included ethylene glycol (today’s Presione anti-freeze and coolant), batteries for portable radios, quiet flickerless carbons used for the first sound movies, and ferroalloys to improve the steels used to build skyscrapers, bridges, and automobiles. The company’s technology included the production of corrosion- and heat-resistant alloys. Six years later it acquired vanadium interests on the Colorado Plateau, which eventually supplied the uranium for atomic energy. Graphite skills were added to the Corporation’s carbon activities in 1928 with the Acheson Graphite Corporation. The Chicago World’s Fair in 1933 enabled Union Carbide to exhibit more than half of the known chemical elements to the public. Today, Union Carbide works with more than 90 of the 107 chemical elements named by scientists.
With the advent of World War II Union Carbide focused its attention on developing raw material resources and utilization of by-products. Carbide resumed its butadiene studies, begun years before, to succeed in developing a synthetic rubber, and soon acquired the Bakelike Corporation, increasing its technology in the field of plastics. Carbide was also responsible for research on vanadium that eventually involved the Corporation in the government’s atomic energy program. Scientists demonstrated that gaseous diffusion could be used to separate quantities of uranium-235. Union Carbide and the Manhattan Engineer District entered into a contract on 18 January 1943 to operate the Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant. After intensive research, Linde perfected 
a refining process for treating uranium concentrates. A plant was built and operated by the Electro Metallurgical Company, presently the Metals Division, to provide extensive emergency metallurgical research, and to manufacture uranium. Graphite products and special carbons were developed and manufactured by National Carbon, presently Carbon products. Uranium-bearing materials were located and provided by the United States Vanadium, now part of the Metals Division, also constructing three plants for treating uranium ores with newly developed processes. Finally, Union Carbide and Carbon Research Laboratories contributed to the development of the atomic weapon itself.


Following World War II, Union Carbide expanded. Polyethylene, a plastic used in squeeze bottles, as well as in films and sheeting, became its largest dollar-volume product. Other materials such as gases and carbon products also continued to succeed.
Restructuring of the Union Carbide Company began during the 1950’s. Interest in new fields of technology emerged. The Metals Division was established to handle worldwide ore procurement, and a food casings business, formally the Visking Company, was also established. By 1957 Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation had established some 400 plants in the United States and Canada, in addition to overseas affiliates. The public was becoming increasingly aware of its activities, so the company decided to change its name to the Union Carbide Corporation in 1957. Consumer products such as Eveready batteries and Presione anti-freeze continued to increase in sales. To accommodate this, a separate division strictly for consumer products was established in 1959. Then in the early 1960’s the Glad line of plastic wraps, bags, and straws was introduced and became a leading brand in its field.
International operations of Union Carbide was restructured in 1966 to accommodate new subsidiaries, including Union Carbide Pan America, Inc., Union Carbide Europe, Inc., Union Carbide Eastern, Inc., Union Carbide Africa and Middle East, Inc., and Union Carbide Canada Limited (a 75-% owned subsidiary). A new division was named in 1969—Films-Packaging Division (previously the Visking casings business), consolidating activities in food casings and related products. During the late 1960’s and early 1970’s, Union Carbide decided to sell and dissolve some of its businesses in order to concentrate on further expansion of certain industries. Among the businesses sold were Neisler Laboratories (acquired in 1965), the Stellite, or Materials Systems Division, Ocean Systems, Inc., a subsidiary underwater work, The Englander Company, Inc. (a bedding company acquired in 1964), most of its oil and gas interests, a pollution-monitoring devices business, a plastic container line, a fibers business, a jewelry line, and an insect repel-lant business. Other organizational changes came about during this period as well. The New Business Development Department, formed in 1970, merged with the Corporate Technology Department in 1971. Two years later, the Consumer Products Division was elminiated to form a Battery Products Division. Preston and Glad products acquired the Home and Automotive Products Division. The Agricultural Products Division, developed in 1976, began producing Sevin insecticide, Temik pesticide, and similar materials.
In 1972 a comprehensive long-term program was established by Union Carbide with the following objectives: “Strengthening the assignment of individual responsibilities and accountabilities, strengthening business management methods, allocating resources selectively in strategic planning units, and practicing good corporate citizenship at home and abroad.” With the advent of new strategies came new materials and processes, including molecular sieve adsorbents and catalysts, specialized electronic materials, foamed plastics, biomedical systems, pollution abatement systems, energy (converting coal to gases and liquids for fuel), miniature batteries, food (chemicals to increase food yield, raising salmon, trout, and other fish species, shrimp fishing off the coast of India), Thornel carbon-graphite fibers (used in aerospace, gold club shafts, tennis rackets, and fishing rods).
In addition to these developments, Union Carbide had established additional pesticide and fertilizer producing plants in particular, Bhopal, India. During the mid-1960’s India was experiencing a chronic food shortage. The central government’s “Green Revolution” included increasing use of pesticides. When Union Carbide approached New Delhi authorities with an offer to build a plant in Bhopal, they were gladly accepted. In 1975 the Indian government granted Union Carbide a license to manufacture pesticides, and the plant was built, Union Carbide owning 51 percent and India’s private companies owning 49 percent. The plant was built on the outskirts of the city, not densely populated at that time. But with construction came more residents: more than 900,000 people eventually lived in this capital of Madhya Pradesh. Union Carbide increased its ties with the local government and helped the city to build a park. The company also hired local residents for management positions.
By the late 1970’s, Union Carbide had established itself as having one of the better safety records in the chemical industry throughout all its subsidaries, including India. But a massive disaster at the Bhopal plant in December 1984 led to the deaths of some 2500 people, with a huge additional number possibly permanently disabled. It has been called “the worst industrial accident in history” (Newsweek ).
After the incident, Bhopal police arrested five senior Indian executives of Union Carbide. In a written statement, Arjun Singh, chief minister of Madhya Pradesh state, charged Warren Anderson, chairman of Union Carbide’s board, with “corporate and criminal liability,” and accused the Union Carbide management of “cruel and wanton negligence.” Many class action suits were filed against Union Carbide on behalf of all the victims by two Florida attorneys, Michael Tobin and Jack Thompson, in association with the San Francisco lawyer Melvin Belli. According to the Cook County Municipal Law Library, these suits were later filed in India. Union officials claim that at least five tons of methyl isocyanate (MIC) seeped out in the 30 minutes before the leaking tank was sealed. The effects of the chemical on humans resemble those of nerve gas (Newsweek ).
In addition to the human toll, the tragedy halted 
business at the $9 billion company, and Union Carbide shut down production and distribution of methyl isocyanate at their plant in Institute, West Virginia. Stock prices plunged 12 points. Union Carbide may never be able to recover from the 1984 Bhopal disaster. As Chairman Warren Anderson concedes, “We have a stigma and we can’t avoid it.”

Chronology of the Union Carbide Corporation
 
September 1999: Dow Chemical to buy Union Carbide
Click here for news from Dow Chemical

Click here for a separate chronology of toxic chemical accidents
 
1897. Major James T. Morehead and Guillaume de Chalmont produced America's first commercial high-carbon ferrochrome, and furnished ferrochrome for Spanish-American War armorplating. In 1898 the Union Carbide Company was created in Virginia to manufacture calcium carbide for acetylene lighting.
1899. National Carbon Company formed in New Jersey; it was succeeded by the National Carbon Company in New York in 1917; its stock eventually was acquired by the Union Carbide & Carbon Company.
1900. Union Carbide was capitalized at $6 million; its calcium carbide plants operated in Sault Sainte Marie, Michigan and Niagara Falls, New York; its main office was in Chicago.
1917. Union Carbide & Carbon Corporation incorporated in New York. It acquired the stock of four companies: Linde Air Products (begun in Ohio in 1907), National Carbon Company (New Jersey, 1899 and New York, 1917), Prest-O-Lite (New York, 1913), and Union Carbide Company (Virginia, 1898). The name was changed to Union Carbide Corporation in May 1957.
1920. Union Carbide's chemicals business (Carbide & Carbon Chemical Company) established. New products included ethylene glycol (antifreeze), batteries, carbon for film, and ferroalloys for steel construction.
1930. Several hundred Union Carbide workers died of acute silica poisoning while constructing a tunnel for hydroelectric power for Union Carbide near Hawk's Nest, West Virginia. Almost 400 lawsuits resulted in an out-of-court settlement of $130,000, after the victims' attorneys received secret payments to take no further legal action.
World War II. Union Carbide developed raw materials and by-products; resumed butadiene studies to synthesize rubber; acquired the Bakelite Corporation and developed plastics; began operating Oak Ridge facilities; Linde perfected uranium refining; Electro Metallurgical Company (later Union Carbide's Metals Division) created for wartime metallurgical research and uranium manufacturing; National Carbon (later Carbon Products) developed special carbon products; United States Vanadium (later part of Metals Division) mined uranium and constructed three plants for treating uranium ores; Union Carbide and Carbon research laboratories contributed to atomic weapons research.

1984 December 2-3. Bhopal, India disaster killed thousands of people.
1984 CORPORATE STATEMENT ON BHOPAL: Company statements in its 1984 Annual Report included the following: "Bhopal was a shocking tragedy, but Union Carbide was well served by our quick and compassionate response, and by the way the situation was managed. We moved swiftly to provide emergency relief while concentrating management of the crisis among a small group of executives, so that unaffected businesses could proceed with their normal routines. Many were shocked that the accident had happened to Union Carbide, a company with an excellent safety record. Expressions of support for Carbide poured in from customers, suppliers, and friends around the world. Carbide was also sustained by the performance of our employees, who never faltered throughout the December crisis." "Numerous lawsuits have been brought... alleging, among other things, personal injuries or wrongful death from exposure to a release of gas... Some of these actions are purported class actions in which plaintiffs claim to represent large numbers of claimants alleged to have been killed or injured as a result of such exposure..."
In its 1984 Form 10-K (written in early 1985), the only mention of Bhopal was the following statement: "In part because of the accident in Bhopal, India, chemical companies, including Union Carbide, have had difficulty renewing their public liability insurance for the same coverage that had been in effect. In March 1985 Union Carbide renewed its personal injury and property damage insurance and now has substantially less of such insurance with broader exclusions and a substantially larger deductible than in 1984. Union Carbide is continuing to seek additional coverage."
1985. CORPORATE STATEMENT ON BHOPAL: "A settlement for $350 million has been proposed for the lawsuits seeking recovery for personal injuries, death, property damages and economic losses from the release of gas at Union Carbide India Limited's Bhopal, India plant in December 1984... The tentative settlement agreement is supported by the U.S. attorneys for the individual plaintiffs, but is subject to the approval of Judge John Keenan and of the Corporation's Board of Directors, and in addition, the Union of India must either agree to the settlement or a portion of the settlement must be reasonably identified and allocated for the Union of India's claims for its expenses from the release. The Corporation does not intend to conclude a settlement unless all claims arising out of the Bhopal gas release can be resolved with finality or provided for in the settlement process."
1985. "Union Carbide and its affiliated companies operate[d] approximately 700 plants, factories, laboratories, mines, and mills around the world. Some of the facilities will be divested under the announced restructuring program and the sale of the Consumer Products business [batteries, lighting products, plastic wrap and bags, antifreeze, and automotive specialty products, in 1986]."
1985. The National Institutes for Chemical Studies (NICS) was established; see the 1992 entry for NICS' Kanawha cancer study, and the June 1994 entry for the "Safety Street" event sponsored by NICS. West Virginia donated $150,000 of state money to fund the organization.
1985. Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals (New Orleans) dismissed 28 suits by chemical manufacturers attempting to challenge EPA regulations on plastic and synthetic fiber wastewaters.

1985. Lawsuit filed by the family of Joe Harding, an employee at the Union Carbide-run uranium enrichment plant in Paducah, Kentucky owned by the U.S. Department of Energy, charging that his fatal cancer was due to exposure to low-level radiation. Harding had claimed that exposure to uranium hexafluoride was routine, and that Union Carbide had encouraged workers to falsify radiation tests. The Kentucky Department of Workers' Claims was to decide in 1994 whether to award workers' compensation benefits to the family.
1985 January 15. The chemical industry announced the formation of a special committee of the West Virginia Manufacturers Association to lobby the state legislature "so that those regulations [in response to the Bhopal disaster] are reasonable and do not unnecessarily harm the industry."
1985 January 23. The U.S. EPA announced that Union Carbide records showed that there had been 28 leaks of MIC at the Institute, West Virginia plant in the years 1980 through 1984. MIC production at the Institute plant was halted after the disaster at Bhopal until May 1985, but in the six weeks following the disaster, 1.4 million pounds of MIC at Institute were converted to pesticide, and shipments of MIC to France and Brazil were returned to the company's Woodbine, Georgia facility. See also the February 1985, August 1985, and February 1990 entries.
1985 February. Union Carbide notified the U.S. EPA that since 1980, 190 chemical leaks had occured at its Institute, West Virginia plant, including 61 leaks of methyl isocynate (MIC), 107 leaks of phosgene, and 22 leaks of both.
1985 February. Union Carbide employees in the United States had raised more than $100,000 to help victims in Bhopal; the money was distributed through the Missionaries of Charity (New York), the Lions Club International Foundation (Oak Brook, Illinois), and Share and Care Foundation for India (Ramsey, New Jersey).
1985 March 1. The U.S. EPA filed a civil administrative complaint against Union Carbide under TSCA Section 8(e), seeking a civil penalty of $3.9 million for delayed reporting of skin cancer tests involving diethyl sulfate. The tests, which had been conducted at the Carnegie Mellon Institute of Research in 1976-1978, showed a high rate of skin cancer in mice treated with the chemical; Union Carbide did not notify the EPA until September 1983.
1985 March. 5,700 pounds of acetone and mesityl oxide leaked from a Union Carbide distillation column at its plant in South Charleston, West Virginia; dozens of area residents became ill after breathing the fumes.

Goodrich's Tremco subsidiary) more than $6.9 million dollars for failing to notify the EPA before manufacturing new chemicals; the names and uses of the chemicals were withheld by the EPA because the manufacturers claimed that was confidential business information protected by law. Union Carbide was fined $212,500 for producing a new chemical at its Sisterville, West Virginia plant.
1985 August 11. The Institute, West Virginia facility leaked methylene chloride and aldicarb oxime, chemicals used to manufacture the pesticide Temik; six workers were injured, and more than a hundred residents were sent to the hospital. Thirty people filed two lawsuits seeking $88 million in damages, but hundreds of people marched in support of the company. OSHA proposed fines of $32,100 for endangering workers, though later agreed to having Union Carbide pay $4,400 if it bought an accident simulator for training workers. Union Carbide spent $5 million to improve safety systems, but two more leaks occurred in February 1990. See also the January 23, 1985, February 1985, and February 1990 entries.
1985 November. Union Carbide charged that employee sabotage caused the disaster at Bhopal, India.
1985 November. A U.S. EPA study lists 403 highly toxic chemicals, being used by at least 577 companies at thousands of locations, which pose serious health dangers to the public in the event of a chemical accident; only about twenty percent of the thousands of chemicals in commercial use had even been tested. The previous month, it was revealed that a draft EPA report revealed that there had been 6,928 toxic chemical accidents since 1980, killing 135 people and injuring almost 1,500.
1986. Severance agreement between Union Carbide and former chairman Warren Anderson.
1986. In response to the Bhopal disaster, the U.S. Congress enacted the Emergency Planning & Community Right-to-Know Act. EPCRA (or the Superfund Amendment & Reauthorization Act, SARA III) is a compromised and largely procedural law entailing no major reductions in toxic chemicals. EPCRA requires that inventories of hazardous chemicals be provided; the Toxic Release Inventory and Local Emergency Planning Committees are results of EPCRA.
1986 January. Hostile takeover attempt by GAF Corporation; GAF soon withdrew its bid, but profited $81 million from sales of Union Carbide stock. 
RECAPITALIZATION/BANK CREDIT AGREEMENT/DEBT TENDER OFFER: To defend itself against the takeover attempt, Union Carbide repurchased 116,400,000 shares [out of 128 million total shares?] of its common stock (38,800,000 shares, adjusted for the March 1986 stock split) for $776 million in cash and $2.521 billion in debt securities "under an indenture which contained covenants that imposed significant restrictions upon the Corporation", one of which was the agreement to sell the consumer products division by March 1986; see the June 1986 entry for the cost of failing to do so. Funds to finance the repurchase were obtained through: loans of $2 billion and $976 million; proceeds from the sale of the agricultural products business for $800 million; sale and leaseback of the corporate headquarters in Connecticut for $340 million; the December 1986 sale of 30 million shares of common stock for $650 million; the 1987 sale of the electronic capacitor business to Kemet for $150 million; the sale of $249 million receivables to the new subsidiary, Union Carbide Finance Corporation; and other transactions.
1986. The mayor of La Mesa, California asked Union Carbide to relocate its arsine-phosphine-ethylene oxide production facility. An attempt to locate it in Washougal, Washington failed. Amidst citizen protest in 1988-1989, the arsine-phosphine facility was relocated outside Kingman, Arizona. The plants were later transferred to Praxair, and one of them was sold to Allied Signal.

1986 April. The U.S. OSHA, after a September 1985 inspection of five of 18 plant units at Institute, West Virginia, alleged 221 violations of 55 health and safety laws, and proposed $1.4 million in fines. OSHA classified 72 of the 221 violations "serious," where there is substantial probability of death or substantial physical harm. OSHA had earlier given the Institute plant a "clean bill of health" after Union Carbide spent $5 million in safety repairs after the disaster at Bhopal.
1986 May. Federal district judge dismissed Bhopal suits in the United States.

The consumer products division was to have been sold by March 1986, or shareholders were to receive special cash distributions; since the sale did not occur by then (see also the July 1986 entry for the sale of home and automotive products), the corporation distributed $951 million in July 1986 and $102 million in October 1986, and in September 1988, a tentative settlement of class actions cost another $31.7 million ("In re Union Carbide Corporation Consumer Products Business Securities Litigation").
1986 June. Explosion injures employee at Institute, West Virginia.
1986 July. In a highly-leveraged buy-out, Union Carbide sold its Home & Automotive Products to the newly-created First Brands Corporation, completing the sale of its home and automotive products business.

1987. BHOPAL: "... [M]anagement believes that adequate provisions have been made for probable losses with respect [to litigation]... The Corporation is vigorously defending the pending litigation... The Union of India alleged in [the November 17, 1986] proceeding [in Bhopal district court] that damages and losses arising from the Bhopal gas emission exceed $3 billion, which the Corporation strongly denies... The Corporation has appealed to the High Court in Jabalpur to set the order aside [for $270 million in interim compensation, of $15,400 for each death and $7,700 for each case of total disability]. The Corporation maintains that interim compensation for personal injuries cannot be allowed when the evidence as to liability is in dispute and the claimants' right to compensation has not been established. Given the Corporation's numerous defenses and the evidence that the tragedy was caused by employee sabotage, liability is in dispute... The Corporation believes that the [homicide] charges [against former Union Carbide chairman Warren Anderson] are without merit, and that Mr. Anderson, UCE [Union Carbide Eastern] and the Corporation are not subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of India in respect to criminal charges."
1987. "As for South Africa, dividends so far totaling $3.5 million from Union Carbide's investments there have been set aside to aid South African blacks. The goal is a permanent fund earmarked for college scholarships for blacks at mixed-race universities, for legal aid, tutoring, and for training in business and civic affairs. Seventy-five students are currently participating in the scholarship program."
1987. Union Carbide Corporation operated a uranium mine in Uravan, Colorado from the 1930s to 1984. In 1987, UC signed an agreement to pay $40 million to clean up its Uravan uranium contamination, and to pay the state $2.8 million in legal costs. Yet UC subsidiary Umetco planned to transport low-level radioactive waste from other sites to Uravan.
1987 July 24. Union Carbide Corporation agreed to pay $408,500 to settle 556 alleged health and safety regulations violations at its Institute and South Charleston, West Virginia plants; OSHA had originally proposed $1.4 million in fines for 462 willful violations.
1988. More than 170 members of the Chemical Manufacturers Association, a tax-free lobbying organization, established their "Responsible Care: a Public Commitment" program of ten pledges to manufacture and use their products in a safe manner. Responsible Care "is an ongoing process, and a call for action, to achieve these primary goals: improved chemical processes; enhanced practices and procedures; reduction of every kind of waste, accident, incident and emission; reliable communication and dialogue; and heightened publlic scrutiny and input."
1988 April. Union Carbide Corporation sued 115 insurance companies to recover the costs of cleaning up its hazardous waste sites.

1989. VOLUNTARY CORPORATION DISSOLVING & RESTRUCTURING: A new holding company, UCC Holdings, was incorporated in New York, and then renamed Union Carbide Corporation (UCC). The former UCC became the Union Carbide Chemicals & Plastics Company (UCC&P), and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the new holding company. Union Carbide Industrial Gases and UCAR Carbon Company became wholly-owned subsidiaries of UCC&P. In July 1990, UCC&P distributed its shares in UCAR Carbon to the holding company. [So Union Carbide, the new holding company, owned Union Carbide Chemicals & Plastics (UCC&P), which had two segments: Chemicals & Plastics and Industrial Gases.] In 1991, Union Carbide sold half of UCAR, which thus became a joint venture with Mitsubishi. In 1992, Union Carbide Corporation spun off its industrial gases operations into a new corporation called Praxair (see June 1992 entry).
1989. "The Corporation and its subsidiaries operate[d] approximately 483 plants, factories, and laboratories around the world."
1989. CORPORATE DEBT: By the end of 1989, Union Carbide had reduced its debt-to-capital ratio from a high in 1986 of almost 80 percent to 47.8 percent.

We have also been an active participant in the Community Awareness and Emergency Response program of the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA)." 
1989-1990. GAF-Boyd Jeffries-Union Carbide stock manipulation case.
1989 January. Incorporated its U.S. industrial gases and carbon products businesses as separate subsidiaries. The carbon business became UCAR Carbon Company; the gases operations became Union Carbide Industrial Gases, which continued under the Linde trademark. See also the June 1992 entry for the spin-off of the Linde industrial gases operations into a new corporation, Praxair.
1989 BHOPAL: In February, the Supreme Court of India ordered a full and final Bhopal settlement of $470 million, and dismissed charges against Warren Anderson (the charges were revived in 1991). UCC&P and Union Carbide India Limited (UCIL) paid the $470 million in a "final settlement of all civil claims." "Our goal from the beginning has been to get fair compensation to the victims as rapidly as possible." The Indian government, and the victims, contested the settlement.
UNION CARBIDE CORPORATION STATEMENT ON BHOPAL: "On February 14, 1989, the Supreme Court of India ordered a $470 million final settlement of all litigation with respect to the December 3, 1984 methyl isocyanate gas release at the Union Carbide India Limited ("UCIL") plant at Bhopal, India. The Corporation is a 50.9% shareholder of UCIL. The Union of India and Union Carbide Corporation accepted the Court's order. The Court stated that its order was just, equitable and reasonable based on the facts and circumstances of the case, including the pleadings, the data placed before the Court, the proceedings in the litigation in the United States, the settlement offers and counter-offers made by the parties, the complex issues if law and fact, the enormity of human suffering and the pressing urgency to provide immediate and substantial relief to the victims. The Court also quashed all criminal proceedings related to the gas release. Although the civil suit was filed by the Union of India against the Corporation alone, on February 15, 1989 the Supreme Court of India made UCIL party to the suit. The Court directed that the Corporation pay $425 million of the settlement and that UCIL pay the Rupee equivalent of $45 million. The $5 million payment previously made by the Corporation to the Red Cross at the suggestion of U.S. Judge John F. Keenan was credited to the Corporation, leaving a balance due of $420 million. The Court specified that the $470 million total be paid by March 23, 1989 to the Union of India for the benefit of all the victims of the gas release under the Bhopal Gas Leak Disaster (Processing of Claims) Act. "Effective upon full payment of the settlement, the Court discharged the previous undertaking of the Corporation in the District Court at Bhopal to maintain unencumbered assets having a fair market value of $3 billion. The Supreme Court proceedings also provide that the accused in the criminal proceedings are deemed acquitted. On February 24, 1989, the Corporation and UCIL delivered their respective payments to the Supreme Court of India, which payments were accepted by the Court." [On February 24, 1989, Union Carbide paid $420 million, and UCIL paid $45 million; "the payment was funded through proceeds from drawdowns of existing standby credit facilities. It is anticipated that these borrowings will be reduced during 1989 by application of insurance proceeds as well as internally generated funds."] "Various applications have been filed in the Supreme Court of India to set aside the settlement. The Corporation believes that those applications are without merit. At the time the settlement occurred, all of the suits that were brought in the United States with respect to the gas release had been dismissed. except a civil suit in the state court in Connecticut. The settlement will be placed before the Connecticut court. Also, plaintiffs in a civil suit in the state court in Texas that was dismissed have attempted to appeal the dismissal. If the appellate process proceeds, the settlement will be placed before the appellate court."
1989 April. Shareholders at Union Carbide's annual meeting rejected a plan to increase compensation to victims of the Bhopal gas leak.
1989 December. U.S. EPA conditionally proposed a civil penalty of $325,000 jointly against Union Carbide Corporation and Rhone-Poulenc Ag Company for violations of the Clean Water Act at the Institute, West Virginia facility.
1989 December 22. Supreme Court of India upheld the Bhopal Act, under which India represented the victims.
1990. UNION CARBIDE CORPORATE STATEMENT ON HAZARDOUS WASTE SITES: "The Company has received requests for information, notices and/or claims with respect to approximately 150 waste sites at which the Company has no ownership interest. At a substantial majority of these sites, it is our belief that the Company will incur no liability or a small liability, since, in general, final allocation of responsibility is made based on each PRP's relative contribution of hazardous waste to the site. Environmental investigatory and remediation projects are also being undertaken at waste sites located on property presently owned by the Company."
1990. BHOPAL: Union Carbide recorded "a charge of $58 million, representing litigation accruals principally related to resolution of the Bhopal litigation."
1990. Federal appeals court rejected a challenge by Union Carbide and the Chemical Manufacturers Association to overrule EPA regulations from 1989 on hazardous waste landfill liners and leak detection systems.

1991. The Canadian government cancelled the registration for personal insect repellants containing ethylhexanediol (EHX); the U.S. EPA issued a customer warning that the product posed a risk of birth defects to pregnant women; and Union Carbide withdrew its registration to manufacture it.
1991. The U.S. Department of Energy's Clean Coal Technology Program gave Union Carbide $32.7 million for its Cansolv process for reducing sulfur dioxide emissions from coal-burning power plants.
1991. BHOPAL: In January, the Indian government again said the $470 million Bhopal settlement was inadequate, and said it would support the victims' petitions challenging it. By February, Union Carbide had collected $200 million from its insurance companies to cover Bhopal claims. In October, the Supreme Court of India rejected the victims petitions, upheld $470 million settlement, and lifted the company's immunity from criminal prosecution. A Bhopal court then revived culpable homicide charges against former chairman Warren Anderson (a warrant for him was originally issued in November 1988) and eight other Union Carbide officials. UCC&P and UCIL, at the request of the Supreme Court of India, announced that they would provide the government of India with up to $16 million for a hospital to be built in Bhopal, but by May 1992, with Anderson still not appearing in court, the government ordered the confiscation of Union Carbide Corporation's 50.9 percent share in Union Carbide India Limited (UCIL). 
1991 January. The U.S. EPA issued a complaint against McGhan Nusil (which UCC&P acquired in March 1991), alleging that McGhan had violated the Toxic Substances Control Act by manufacturing TSCA inventory chemicals without notifying EPA; the EPA proposed a penalty of $384,000. See also the June 1992 entry.
1991 March 12. An explosion at Union Carbide's No. 1 ethylene oxide and derivative production unit Seadrift plant near Port Lavaca, Texas killed John Resendez, a contract worker, and injured 26 others. The plant shutdown cost Union Carbide $50 million in net income.

1992. The National Institutes for Chemical Studies (NICS), established in 1985, released its five-year study of cancer rates in the Kanawha Valley, West Virginia. The study was funded by Union Carbide and other chemical corporations, the U.S. EPA, and environmental groups. The study, which listed the top 23 polluters in West Virginia, showed a link between children's health and their proximity to chemical plants emitting volatile organic compounds. UC and other companies challenged the report's findings.
1992. UCC&P pledged its shares in UCIL to an English charitable trust established by UCIL and UCC&P to provide funding for the hospital; the magistrate in pending criminal proceedings ordered the attachment of the shares of UCIL held by UCC&P.

1993. For the second year, Union Carbide rejected a shareholder resolution calling for the corporation to sign the CERES (Valdez) Principles of environmental conduct. The corporation also rejected another resolution calling for it to disclose information on the risks of, and its procedures for, toxic chemical accidents.
1993. Union Carbide Corporation's Responsible Care Progess Report shows:
(a) the number of fires and explosions per year (6 in 1988, 3 in 1989, 3 in 1990, 2 in 1991, and 2 in 1992);
(b) the cancer rates of its employees compared to the U.S. average (less than average);

1994 February. UCC&P and UCIL agreed to increase the funding for the Bhopal hospital to $19.3 million; the Supreme Court of India ordered that the attachment be lifted to permit sales of the UCIL shares, together with blocked dividends and UCIL's contribution, to provide the agreed funding. The remainder of the proceeds from the sale of UCIL shares would be subject to the attachment.
1994 February 23. The U.S. EPA issued a complaint and compliance order to UCC&P, alleging violations of federal hazardous waste regulations at the South Charleston, West Virginia plant, and seeking a civil penalty of $320,000. The EPA charged Union Carbide with failure to perform regular leak detection testing, and with failure to maintain records of boiler wastes such as mercury, lead, and beryllium; the charges stemmed from a December 1992 surprise inspection of the plant.
1994 March 16. The U.S. EPA fined Union Carbide $75,000 for not reporting a leak of ethylene oxide at its Institute, West Virginia plant.

1994 April 5. The Free Press reported that India's Central Bureau of Investigation had taken steps to have former Union Carbide chairman Warren Anderson extradited to India for his failure to appear in court in connection with the 1984 Bhopal disaster. See also November 1988 and 1991 entries.
1999 September. Dow Chemical is buying Union Carbide for about $11.6 billion. The Dow-Carbide merger is a tax-free, stock-for-stock pooling of interests with the resulting corporation to be owned 75 percent by Dow shareholders and 25 percent by Union Carbide shareholders. Two Union Carbide directors will join the board of Dow. The new corporation expects to save $500 million by consolidating.
1999 November. Lawsuit Seeks Compensation For 1984 Disaster Victims. A federal lawsuit filed Nov. 15 is seeking unspecified damages from Union Carbide Corp. for the "world's worst" industrial accident that killed at least 7,000 people in Bhopal, India, in 1984. The class-action suit accuses the company, which owned 50.9 percent of the plant, of "unlawful, reckless and depraved indifference to human life." The suit says the company and its former CEO, Warren Anderson, failed to comply with court orders in the United States and India after the accident. Union Carbide paid $470 million in a 1989 out-of-court settlement that gave company executives immunity from prosecution, but India's supreme court later struck down the immunity clause while letting the settlement stand. Many victims and their relatives are still waiting for compensation. Union Carbide accepted "moral responsibility" for the disaster but blamed a "disgruntled" employee (Greenwire, Nov. 18, 1999, citing Larry Neumeister, AP/New Jersey online, Nov. 16, 1999).
March 2000. Former Union Carbide Official Avoids Summons "A top executive at Union Carbide Corp. during the 1984 chemical disaster at Bhopal, India, has apparently gone into seclusion to avoid a summons to appear in a Manhattan federal court for civil proceedings against him and the company. Warren M. Anderson, who was the company's chairman, has vacated his last known address in Florida and Union Carbide officials have declined to help track him down, said Kenneth F. McCallion, the lawyer who initiated the civil case. Union Carbide says the settlement it reached with the Indian government in 1989 exempts it and Anderson from further proceedings. Union Carbide spokesman Sean Clancy: "Based on that settlement, we see no reason to encourage any disturbance of Mr. Anderson, who retired as chairman 12 years ago." But the Indian Supreme Court and a federal judge have ruled that the company must "submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of India." The company and Anderson, in absentia, are facing criminal charges in India. And a lawsuit filed in New York charges Union Carbide and Anderson with violating international law." (Greenwire, March 6, 2000, citing Chris Hedges, New York Times, March 5).

Union Carbide



 Founded:
1917 



Years Operated:
1917-2001 



Headquarters:
Houston, Texas 



Business:
Manufactured chemicals including industrial gases, Calidria chrysotile asbestos and ethylene-based chemicals. 



Asbestos Trust:
No 



Bankruptcy Status:
Not bankrupt 


History
Union Carbide was established in 1917 as Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation. The ethylene producer and purchaser filed its first patent to prepare the chemical in 1919. In 1920, the company established Carbide and Carbon Chemicals Corporation. Shortly after, the company opened the first commercial ethylene plant in Clendenin, West Virginia. This marked the beginning of the petrochemical industry.
The Clendenin commercial plant manufactured a variety of ethylene-based chemicals such as ethylene glycol, which was used for automotive antifreeze.
Between 1920 and 1957, Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation continued to grow. It merged with Bakelite Corporation and began a lucrative chemical production business in Texas. The company also purchased Plant Institute, which was a plant the company operated at the start of World War II for the U.S. government. The plant produced butadiene and styrene. In 1957, the company became Union Carbide Corporation and proceeded to grow and pursue various acquisitions and business opportunities.
Union Carbide became a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Dow Chemical Company on February 6, 2001 during a transaction valued at $11.6 billion.

Compensation for Mesothelioma Victims




Litigation & Specific Lawsuits
Asbestos-related personal injury claims have been filed by individuals that were exposed to asbestos in Union Carbide plants from 1945 to 1980 and to the company’s products containing Calidria chrysotile asbestos from 1964 to 1972.
Union Carbide was ordered to pay millions of dollars in asbestos claims. Many have been settled but some remain unpaid. Because of the latency period of asbestos-related disease, many more will likely be filed in the future.
Unlike other companies that produce asbestos, Union Carbide has not set up a trust for claims or filed for bankruptcy. The companies have decided instead to continue to defend themselves in court against current and future claims.
On June 14, 2012 a jury in Los Angeles awarded $48 million dollars to a California plaintiff and his wife; $37.5 million of that verdict is to be paid by Union Carbide. The plaintiff worked with many of Union Carbide’s asbestos-containing products as a general contractor in the 1960s and ‘70s and was diagnosed with mesothelioma in 2011.
During the trial, one key piece of evidence was a 1967 Union Carbide internal memo that proved the company knew that asbestos exposure caused cancer. An attorney for Union Carbide claims the company, “clearly did not cause [the plaintiff’s] disease,” and “the verdict in this case is outrageous and unsupported by the facts.”
An attorney for Parex USA, Inc., another named defendant in the case, commented that the jury “was being ruled by passion and prejudice. There was little evidence that [the plaintiff’s] quality of life has been affected so far, other than the fact he knew he had cancer.”
Because asbestos-related disease does not develop for 20 to 50 years or more after exposure, the company will continue to receive lawsuit claims for injuries ranging from asbestosis to lung cancer and mesothelioma.
Industry & Occupations
Union  Carbide has 2,400 employees in seven locations across the United States. Since  Union Carbide’s acquisition by TDCC, Union Carbide sells most of the products  it manufactures to TDCC. According to the official Union Carbide website, the  company primarily produces chemicals and polymers that undergo one or more  further conversions by customers before reaching consumers.
Union  Carbide products were used in the following industries:

Agriculture
Automotive
Construction
Oil and Gas
Pharmaceuticals
Textiles

The main asbestos product manufactured by Union Carbide is Calidria chrysotile asbestos. The company mined and milled Calidria near King City, California in the 1960s. Reportedly, its own scientists indicated that Calidria asbestos caused more damage to the lungs of rats than other types of asbestos.
Union Carbide officials knew that any health effects from asbestos would not surface for up to 50 years. In one internal memo, Union Carbide officials decided to “make hay while the sun shines” and seize the opportunity for profit before the public learned about the effects of this toxic product.
Products
Union Carbide manufactured Calidria chrysotile asbestos. It sold this product to other companies who used it in products including cement, paint, sheet packing and household products.
Union Carbide & the Bhopal Disaster
On December 3, 1984, a Union Carbide plant in Bhopal, India leaked toxic methyl isocyanate (MIC) gas into the air. In a few hours, almost 4,000 people died along with hundreds of animals in the streets surrounding the plant. It was later discovered that the gas leak safety system had been off for three months prior.  In the days following the initial gas leak, 10,000 more people died, and as many as 20,000 premature deaths occurred in the next two decades. Over half a million people suffered from permanent disabilities as a result of the gas leak. The Indian Supreme Court mediated a settlement with Union Carbide and forced them to pay $470 million.

Asbestos Exposure






Help Us Raise Awareness


Get a Free Wristband 




Asbestos Exposure
Asbestos exposure can lead to a myriad of serious health problems, including asbestosis, lung cancer and mesothelioma, a rare, aggressive and incurable cancer. 
Asbestos exposure can happen wherever asbestos is present: At home, a public building such as a school or government office, a war fought on foreign soil or on the job.




Click to expand

In fact, occupational exposure is the No. 1 cause of asbestos disease. That means roofers, carpenters, electricians, plumbers, firefighters, auto mechanics, insulators, factory workers and many others are at a high risk of exposure.
Those who worked in construction, shipyards, power plants, oil refineries and steel mills also faced the likelihood of high asbestos exposure on the job.
U.S. military veterans were the most vulnerable of all — accounting for almost a third of all cases — because of the military’s past reliance on asbestos products, especially on Navy ships.
For much of the 20th century, until its long-term toxicity became well known, thousands of everyday products used asbestos because it was coveted for its heat resistance, versatility and tensile strength.

How Exposure Happens
Asbestos disease starts with the unknowing inhalation or ingestion of microscopic asbestos fibers. While no level of asbestos exposure is considered safe, most problems arise after repeated and long-term exposures to the carcinogen. 
Environmental and secondhand exposure to asbestos is rarer, but it still happens regularly. Most everyone in their lifetime has inhaled some quantity of asbestos, but these trace amounts rarely cause health problems.







"Asbestos-related disease is 100 percent preventable. That fact motivates me. It should motivate all of us. If we stopped using asbestos, by definition, we could stop asbestos disease." — Dr. Ken Takahashi, director of the Asbestos Diseases Research Institute


Harmful exposures occur in a wide range of occupational settings. Home and commercial renovation or remodeling can be especially hazardous because many common building materials already contain asbestos. When asbestos products start to deteriorate or are cut, sanded, drilled or disturbed in any way, microscopic fibers enter the air.
For example, the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (ADEC) took issue with the sandblasting practices of Alaska-based shipbuilding and repair facility Seward Ship's Drydock. The ADEC issued Seward a notice of violation for uncontrolled "fugitive particulate emissions" at its sandblasting operations.
If workers sandblasted asbestos-containing materials, such as paint, insulation or joint compounds, off of a vessel, the asbestos fibers released would no longer be confined to the sandblasted area, and people elsewhere in the shipyard could inhale them.
Fibers can remain airborne for hours, placing anyone nearby in danger. Once inhaled, they can become trapped in the respiratory tract, where they may stay for life.
Health Risks of Exposure
Once inhaled, asbestos fibers can become lodged in the thin lining surrounding the lungs and cause inflammation, making breathing increasingly difficult.
They eventually will cause scarring, which can lead to genetic mutations and cancer. In the early stages, symptoms of these diseases often mirror those of less serious illnesses and may not be diagnosed until 20 to 50 years after the initial exposure.
Each year, approximately 2,000 to 3,000 Americans are diagnosed with mesothelioma, a rare cancer caused almost exclusively by asbestos exposure. An estimated 10,000 Americans die annually from an asbestos-related disease. 
Currently, an estimated 200,000 people in the country are diagnosed with some form of asbestos-related illness.

Pleural plaques: These are the most common indication of asbestos exposure. They are characterized by fibrous thickening of the lining around the lungs.
Asbestosis: Asbestosis is characterized by inflammation and scarring of the lung tissue, which prevents the lungs from expanding and relaxing normally.
COPD: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is not directly caused by asbestos, but exposure increases the risk of developing the disease.
Mesothelioma: This is a rare, aggressive and incurable asbestos-caused cancer.
Lung Cancer: Asbestos-related lung cancer accounts for approximately 4 percent of all lung cancer cases. Asbestos exposure also increases the chances of developing lung cancer. 

Where Exposure Occurs
Exposure can occur while living near job sites or contaminated environments, using asbestos-containing products or working in certain occupations, including the U.S. military. Exposure can also occur during natural or manmade disasters.


Military
Every branch of the U.S. Armed Forces incorporated asbestos. People on U.S. Navy ships and operators of military vehicles and aircraft from the early 1900s to the 1970s were most at risk. Since that time, thousands of veterans who worked in the following vessels have suffered illnesses related to asbestos exposure during their service.

Battleships
Aircraft Carriers
Cruisers
Auxiliary Vessels
Submarines
Destroyers
Frigates

Learn more about veterans and mesothelioma


Products
Thousands of products were manufactured using asbestos fibers. Asbestos may be found in insulation, drywall, ceiling and floor tiles, cements, paint and more. Most homes and commercial buildings built before 1980 contain asbestos products.
Search our asbestos products index


Occupations
Workers from practically all trades were likely exposed to asbestos fibers while on the job. Drywall tapers, electricians, firefighters, auto mechanics and many other occupations may be at risk. While asbestos regulation was more relaxed in the past, today the law requires all employers to protect workers from asbestos and other job-related health risks.
See if your occupation was at risk for exposure


Job Sites
Asbestos exposure may occur while on the job. Many workplaces utilized the mineral in their products and facilities, placing millions of workers at risk for exposure.

Shipyards
Power Plants
Metal Works
Schools
Chemical Plants
Oil Refineries



Environmental exposure occurs when asbestos fibers are released into the air through mining, the disturbance of a natural asbestos deposit or the result of natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes and earthquakes.
In 2016, the Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health published a study that showed occupational exposure to asbestos has declined in recent years, but there has been a rise in environmental exposure in specific geographic areas. 
The study also used the findings to explain why the percentage of women and younger patients with asbestos disease has been rising.
Researchers at the University of Hawaii Cancer Center conducted a similar study in 2015 that highlighted the need to be more aware of environmental exposure in Nevada.
Northern California is also home to some of the largest naturally occurring deposits of asbestos. 
9/11 Attack on the World Trade Center
The terrorist attack at the World Trade Center in New York City on Sept. 11, 2001, released more than 2,000 tons of asbestos into the air, causing a sudden and very serious exposure problem for rescue, recovery and cleanup workers who remained at the site for months.
According to a 2002 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, about 70 percent of those workers suffered new or worsened respiratory problems. It found that 28 percent of workers tested had abnormal lung function tests. Researchers continue to closely monitor those who worked in the rubble, along with nearby residents, for long-term health consequences related to asbestos and other toxic building materials.

A 2009 study tested the effects of environmental exposure in a population living near an asbestos manufacturing plant. The study examined rates of malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) and other asbestos-related conditions in Shubra El-Kheima, Egypt, an industrial city containing the Sigwart Company asbestos plant. It compared disease rates in individuals working in the plant, those living near the plant and those in a control group with no known asbestos exposure. In total, the study had more than 4,000 participants.
The rate of MPM was highest in the group with environmental asbestos exposure, with 2.8 percent of this group having the cancer. The group with occupational exposure had a strikingly lower rate of only 0.8 percent. As expected, the control group had the fewest incidences, with a rate of 0.1 percent.
These rates varied for other illnesses such as diffuse pleural thickening. Overall, the study found a slightly higher, but still comparable, rate of asbestos-related illnesses in asbestos workers than in nearby residents.
Improper Abatement
If asbestos materials are removed from a home or structure, there is a high risk of exposure to airborne fibers if proper abatement procedures are not followed. It is important to adhere to federal safety regulations regarding the removal and disposal of the materials to minimize health risks.
Secondhand Exposure
People can get an asbestos-related disease without ever working with or around the toxic mineral. Secondhand exposure, or indirect exposure, can be just as dangerous as firsthand exposure.
While any kind of exposure is much less common today than even 20 years ago, women faced an increased risk for secondhand exposure when asbestos use was high during the mid-20th century.
At that time, men comprised the majority of the industrial working class. The occupations within these industrial settings often required workers to handle asbestos-containing products. Workers returning home might carry fibers on their hair, skin and clothes and indirectly expose their families and others living with them.
Occurrences of Secondhand Exposure
Secondhand exposure is the cause for a significant portion of mesothelioma cases among women and children. If children are exposed to asbestos indirectly at an early age, they may develop an asbestos-related disease in their adult years. There are four common forms of secondhand asbestos exposure.



Laundry
The clothing of workers who handled asbestos products provided a significant risk for secondhand exposure. Because of the jagged structure of the fibers, the microscopic particles could easily attach to clothing. Anyone handling or washing these work clothes likely experienced indirect exposure.





Furniture
If a worker didn’t change out of asbestos contaminated clothing before returning home, fibers could have become embedded in the couch, chairs, carpet, bed and other pieces of furniture.





Hugs
If a worker came home with fibers attached to their hair, skin or clothes and later hugged their children or spouse, family members were likely indirectly exposed to the carcinogen. Some mesothelioma cases have developed from children sitting on the lap of their father or grandfather after he came home from work.
While family members didn't have any direct contact with asbestos-containing products, the amount of dust brought home was enough to cause mesothelioma or a related disease later in life.
Between 1941 and 1954, researchers at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City studied the health of 679 family members from the 1,664 workers employed at a factory in Patterson, New Jersey. Researchers discovered five cases of mesothelioma among factory workers' family members. Sources of asbestos dust were also found in the homes of former Patterson factory workers 20 years after the factory shut down.

Legal Claims for Secondhand Exposure 
Like plaintiffs who are directly exposed to asbestos, claimants indirectly injured by asbestos may be eligible for compensation. In order to bring a successful legal claim, they must be able to trace their exposure to a defendant who is liable for failure to warn or protect against the dangers. This usually involves investigating the work history of a family member who was exposed on the job.


John Panza Jr., diagnosed with mesothelioma in 2012.

For example, John Panza Jr., a 40-year-old English professor, was diagnosed with mesothelioma in 2012. For more than 30 years, his father worked at a brake plant where National Friction Products Corp. products were drilled and abraded. As a child, Panza helped his father wash his work clothes. In 2012, Panza filed a lawsuit against National Friction alleging he inhaled fibers from the company's products that contaminated his father's clothes.
In 2013, an Ohio jury found National Friction liable for Panza's illness. It ordered the company to pay Panza and his wife $27.5 million. The award included $515,000 in economic damages, $12 million in noneconomic damages and $15 million for the wife's loss of consortium claim. 
Protecting Yourself and Loved Ones
Despite the continued presence of asbestos in the workplace and in everyday life, people can protect themselves by being vigilant. 
Workers should use protective equipment provided by employers. It is important to follow proper safety procedures and workplace practices. Approved respirators should be worn when working around asbestos fibers.
It also is important to take precautions against bringing home any asbestos from work and endangering a family. Any clothing or shoes worn on the job should be left and cleaned at the job site. Showers should be taken before returning home.
Safety equipment and good practices today protect you against future asbestos exposure problems.
If you think your work conditions are unsafe or your employer isn’t adequately protecting you from asbestos, file an anonymous complaint with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).

Asbestos Products Manufacturers
Even with cries to ban the mining and production of asbestos resounding across the world, the industry continues to thrive. Concerns about the diseases caused by asbestos exposure prompted more than 50 nations — including the entire European Union — to ban or severely restrict asbestos use. Strict U.S. regulations took hold in the 1970s. Yet countries like Russia, China, Brazil and Kazakhstan still mine and sell massive quantities of the toxic mineral on a global scale.

At the heart of this disparity is the industry’s notion that corporate profits outweigh good health and the value of life. Since the late 1800s, American companies like the Johns Manville Corporation amassed great wealth by mining, manufacturing and selling asbestos-containing products. Centuries later, medical evidence revealed Johns Manville and numerous other companies not only knew about the potentially deadly effects of exposure but also went to great lengths to conceal the information from workers and consumers.
In decades past, asbestos use was far more pervasive in the United States. Contaminated materials were prevalent in industries like shipbuilding, construction, power generation and heavy manufacturing. Since an initial wave of personal injury claims emerged in the 1970s, asbestos liabilities drove hundreds of companies to bankruptcy. In many cases, companies overwhelmed by these claims establish mesothelioma and asbestos trust funds to cover the costs of current and future lawsuits.

While medical evidence indicates that even brief exposure to asbestos can cause life-threatening respiratory illnesses such as lung cancer, asbestosis and mesothelioma, the consumption of contaminated products in the United States and many other countries continues. According to a 2011 inventory of more than 60,000 asbestos-laden products, approximately 600 companies and suppliers operated worldwide that year.

Fast Fact: In 1963, Crown Cork & Seal acquired Mundet Cork, inheriting more than $700 million current and future asbestos liabilities.

History of Manufacturing

Although asbestos mining existed for thousands of years, it was only during the Industrial Revolution of the late 1800s that the industry flourished. A natural resistance to heat, chemicals and electricity made the fiber desirable for innumerable industrial applications. Soon enough, manufacturers incorporated asbestos insulation into steam engines, piping and locomotives. Thousands of other uses later emerged, and manufacturers began putting it in products like boilers, gaskets, cement, roofing materials and automotive brake pads.


By the early 20th century, some companies realized that their primary source of income was severely injuring employees and consumers. But rather than making efforts to improve workplace safety standards, some companies chose to ignore or bury information that would undoubtedly damage their business and reputation. Internal documents indicate that Johns Manville executives were aware of the risks as early as 1934. The company conducted private medical studies around this time, and the negative results remained confidential for decades.


Asbestos use increased throughout World War II, largely because of military shipbuilding contracts. The U.S. government required asbestos insulation be used in U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard vessels. For several decades after the war, hundreds of companies grew and prospered by incorporating asbestos materials into thousands of industrial and household products.

In addition to Johns Manville, other leading asbestos manufacturers include:

Owens Corning/Fibreboard Corp.
Raybestos-Manhattan Co.
National Gypsum Corporation
W.R. Grace & Co.
Celotex Corp.


By the 1960s, scientists had gathered ample evidence of asbestos's harmful effects. One landmark occupational study conducted by Dr. Irving Selikoff in 1964 showed a clear link between the mineral and various cancers. Results indicated that between 1943 and 1962, an excessive number of insulation workers died of asbestosis and cancer, including lung cancer, mesothelioma, stomach cancer and colorectal cancer. Selikoff's findings were bolstered by medical evidence gathered in the wake of a subsequent decline in asbestos use. The result was a significant downturn for America's asbestos industry.


The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) dealt another blow to the industry with the Clean Air Act of 1970. It established the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP), which placed stringent restrictions on the use of asbestos and other harmful airborne contaminants. Several new regulations directly affected the industry, specifically companies that milled, sprayed or disposed of asbestos materials. By the late 1970s, many companies began phasing the mineral out of their products.


Although the U.S. Geological Survey asserts that U.S. asbestos use has fallen 99.9 percent since 1973, it is not yet banned in the United States. Limited amounts of chrysotile asbestos remain in brake pads and other friction materials, building materials like cement and in various textiles.

Fast Fact: A C & S stated it would no longer use materials made with friable asbestos in 1974, but bankruptcy documents revealed it may have been used for at least another decade.

Products

During the peak era of asbestos consumption, it was incorporated into approximately 3,000 types of products. One of the most common commercial applications was within insulation products, a use that spanned industries including construction, shipbuilding and industrial manufacturing.


Countless other types of building materials were manufactured with asbestos, including ceiling tiles, joint compounds, cement, drywall and roofing materials. These products have a high potential to expose workers during building renovations and demolitions, as many related activities release toxic fibers into the air.


The toxic fibers have also been spun into various textile products such as rope, cloth and garments. Shipyard workers who installed tainted insulation often wore protective gloves and aprons that also contained the dangerous ingredient.


Another leading sector that continues to use asbestos materials is the automotive industry. Many car parts that withstand high temperatures and friction, such as gaskets and brake pads, contained some percentage of asbestos.

Industries & Occupations

According to the World Health Organization, about 125 million people experience workplace exposure worldwide. By far, the most dangerous occupations involved mining and processing the mineral. These activities released massive amounts of toxic fibers into the air.


Another industry at high risk for exposure is that of construction. While drywall hangers and insulation workers faced constant exposure risks, many other professions in carpentry may have been exposed simply by working on the same project.


Shipyard workers, especially during the World War II era, experienced heavy exposure as well. Tainted insulation was once a staple aboard seafaring vessels, and cramped working conditions made its installation especially hazardous. Also at risk were pipefitters, boiler workers and electricians who serviced U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard ships.


Litigation & Specific Lawsuits


A staggering number of related lawsuits surfaced over the past four decades, jeopardizing assets of any company associated with asbestos. According to one litigation report from 2002, an estimated 730,000 people filed related claims against at least 8,400 corporations.


Some mesothelioma lawsuits resulted in multimillion-dollar verdicts or out-of-court settlements. When courts find companies liable for a person’s injury or death, they must provide compensatory damages including pain and suffering, medical expenses, lost income and loss of consortium. Many times courts also demand additional punitive damages from companies for their wrongdoings.


In one standout 2005 case, U.S. Steel was ordered to pay $250 million to Roby Whittington, the wife of a former U.S. Steel employee who died of mesothelioma. Several other manufacturers defended the case, but U.S. Steel was found 100 percent liable for Whittington’s death. Georgia-Pacific settled out of court for an undisclosed amount, and the jury awarded Mrs. Whittington $50 million in damages and $200 million in punitive damages.


A San Francisco jury awarded another landmark verdict to Alfred Todak, holding more than 25 firms liable for his mesothelioma diagnosis. A former electrician, Todak was exposed while servicing boilers aboard Navy vessels from 1960 to 1976. Eighteen firms settled with Todak out of court for a total of $4.2 million, and Foster Wheeler Ltd. contributed 30 percent of the jury’s $22.7 million verdict. Todak’s wife also received $11 million for related losses.


More recently, a 2011 lawsuit ended with a combined verdict of $22 million for two steamfitters exposed to asbestos gaskets. The gasket manufacturers, Goodyear Tire and Rubber and Goodyear Canada, were found partially liable for the lung cancer deaths of Walter Koczur and Eugene McCarthy, despite both being longtime smokers.

Fast Fact: Pittsburgh Corning announced in 2009 that it would pay out $825 million in cash over the next 15 years to cover asbestos-related claims.


Trust Funds


With multibillion-dollar liabilities looming, many companies chose to file for bankruptcy to help defer the uncertain, yet steadily rising, costs of legal compensation. The U.S. government estimates that more than 100 companies filed for bankruptcy because of asbestos litigation, including industry giants like National Gypsum, Dana Corporation and EaglePicher Industries.


As part of their reorganization plans, companies often create personal injury trusts. Forming a trust prevents claimants from taking a company to court, designating the trust as the company’s only source for providing compensation. Bankrupt companies funnel their remaining assets into these trusts to fund current and future liabilities.


Since Johns Manville created the first trust in 1987, nearly every major asbestos manufacturer has declared bankruptcy and established a personal injury trust. By 2011, these trusts had awarded a total of $17.5 billion. Some of the largest trusts include:

Prepare & File the Articles of Organization



We will review the information, prepare your incorporation documents, and send them to the
state of formation.


























Certified Copy - Articles of Organization




That Certified Copy is an additional document that will be included with the filed Articles
for your company. It is from the Colorado Secretary of State and it is electronically signed and affixed with the Colorado State Seal and the signature of the Secretary. This provides additional supporting documentation as to the official nature of the filing.


























Certified Copy - Articles of Organization




That Certified Copy is an additional document that will be included with the filed Articles
for your company. It is from the California Secretary of State and it is electronically signed and affixed with the California State Seal and the signature of the Secretary. This provides additional supporting documentation as to the official nature of the filing.


























CL-1 Preparation & filing of the Initial Annual Report.




When filing for a corporation in South Carolina, the SC Secretary of State requires that an initial annual report be filed along with the necessary corporate charter documents. This initial report is the Form CL-1, and the state charges a fee of $25 for this in addition to the standard state corporate filing fee. We prepare and submit the Form CL-1 along with the Articles of Incorporation and all fees as required by the state for your new corporation.


























Preparation & filing of the Initial Annual Report




When filing for a new business in Washington, the WA Secretary of State requires that an initial annual report be filed along with the necessary corporate charter documents. The state charges a fee of $10 for this in addition to the standard state filing fee. We prepare and submit the initial Annual Report along with the Articles of Incorporation and all fees as required by the state for your new business entity.


























IRS Form 2553 Preparation



The 2553 Form, known as the Subchapter S election (or Election for Small Business), is required to be filed with the IRS to obtain S-Corporation status for purposes of federal taxation. Filing this Form with the IRS is used to convert a C-Corporation into an S-Corporation. IncFile.com will prepare the form and forward it to you (as it requires the signatures of the initial shareholders), along with instructions that include where to sign and submit the form.

IMPORTANT: Please note the Form 2553 is time sensitive and must be filed with the IRS within 75 days of your corporation filing date in order to obtain S-corporation tax status for the current year.



























NYS Form CT-6 Preparation



Unlike most states, New York has a state level of S-Corporation tax status, similar to the Federal S-corporation tax status. A Federal S-corporation may (but is not required to) elect to be taxed as a New York S-corporation by filing Form CT‑6 . When S-corporation is selected as the entity type, IncFile.com will also prepare the form CT-6 for your corporation, along with the Federal S-corporation election, free of charge. NOTE: The form will require the signature(s) of the initial shareholders. IncFile.com will prepare this form and return it to you with your filed corporation, and it will just need to be signed and dated where indicated, and submitted to the state (included with the instructions).

IMPORTANT: Please note the Form CT-6 is time sensitive and must be filed with the the state within 75 days of your corporation filing date in order to obtain the NYS S-corporation tax status for the current year.


























Unlimited Name Availability Searches



We conduct a thorough name search with the state corporation database and will work with you
as
long as needed to find an available company
name.

Frequently Asked Questions






Does the price quoted include the state filing fee?

Yes, the price you see at the bottom of the page includes the state prescribed fee that is

Yes, although we offer 1 free year of Registered Agent service you will be permitted to
provide your own Registered Agent.



Will I need to sign anything?

Union Carbide Corporation is a wholly owned subsidiary (since 2001) of Dow Chemical Company. It currently employs more than 2,400 people.[2] Union Carbide produces chemicals and polymers that undergo one or more further conversions by customers before reaching consumers. Some are high-volume commodities and others are specialty products meeting the needs of smaller markets. Markets served include paints and coatings, packaging, wire and cable, household products, personal care, pharmaceuticals, automotive, textiles, agriculture, and oil and gas. The company is a former component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.[3] Union Carbide was 50.9% stakeholder in Union Carbide India Limited, the company responsible for the Bhopal disaster.[4]
Founded in 1917, as the Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation from a merger with National Carbon Company, the company's researchers developed an economical way to make ethylene from natural gas liquids, such as ethane and propane, giving birth to the modern petrochemical industry. Before divesting them, the chemical giant owned consumer products Eveready and Energizer batteries, Glad bags and wraps, Simoniz car wax, and Prestone antifreeze. The company divested other businesses before being acquired by Dow Chemical on February 6, 2001, including electronic chemicals, polyurethane intermediates, industrial gases and carbon products.[5]

History[edit]
The Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation was formed on November 1, 1917, from the merger of the Union Carbide Company founded in 1898, the National Carbon Company founded in 1886, Linde Air Products Company, maker of liquid oxygen, and the Prest-O-Lite company, manufacturer of calcium carbide. In 1920 the company set up a chemicals division which manufactured ethylene glycol for use as automotive antifreeze. The company continued to acquire related chemical producers, including the Bakelite Corporation in 1939. The company changed its name to "Union Carbide Corporation" in 1957 and was often referred to as Carbide. It operated Oak Ridge National Laboratory from 1947 until the late 1970s.[6]
During the Cold war era the company was active in the field of rocket propulsion research & development for aerospace and guided missile applications, particularly in the field of chemicals and plastics, solid rocket motors, storable liquid fuels. R&D activities has been centered at the Technical Center near Charleston, West Virginia.[7] The Aerospace Materials Department was established for the mentioned purposes within the company's Carbon Products Division.[8]
Ucar batteries was Carbide's industrial and consumer zinc chloride battery business. The business including Energizer alkaline batteries was sold to Ralston Purina in 1986, following a hostile takeover operation.
After the Bhopal disaster, Union Carbide was the subject of repeated takeover attempts. In order to pay off its debt, Carbide sold many of its most familiar brands such as Glad Trashbags and Eveready Batteries. Dow Chemical announced the purchase of Carbide in 1999 for $8.89 billion in stock.[9]
Hawks Nest Tunnel disaster[edit]
Main article: Hawks Nest Tunnel Disaster
The Hawks Nest Tunnel disaster took place between 1927 and 1932 in a West Virginia tunnel project led by Union Carbide. During the construction of the tunnel, workers found the mineral silica and were asked to mine it for use in electroprocessing steel. The workers were not given masks or breathing equipment to use while mining. Due to silica dust exposure, many workers developed silicosis, a debilitating lung disease. According to a marker on site, there were 109 admitted deaths. A congressional hearing placed the death toll at 476.[10]
Asbestos mining and 'Calidria' brand fibers[edit]
In the early 1960s, Union Carbide Corporation began mining a newly identified outcrop of chrysotile asbestos fibers near King City and New Idria, California. The fibers were sold under the brand name "Calidria", a combination of "Cal" and "Idria." These fibers were sold in large quantities for a wide variety of purposes, including addition into joint compound or drywall accessory products.[11] Union Carbide sold the mine to its employees under the name KCAC ("King City Asbestos Mine") in the 1980s, but it only operated for a few more years.[citation needed]
Bhopal disaster[edit]
Main article: Bhopal disaster
Union Carbide India Limited, owned by Union Carbide (50.9%) and Indian investors (49.1%), operated a pesticide plant in the Indian city of Bhopal.[4] Around midnight on 3 December 1984, methyl isocyanate (MIC) gas was accidentally released from the plant, exposing more than 500,000 people to MIC and other chemicals. The government of Madhya Pradesh confirmed a total of 3,787 deaths related to the gas release. It left an estimated 40,000 individuals permanently disabled, maimed, or suffering from serious illness, making it one of the world's worst industrial disasters. Union Carbide was sued by the Government of India and agreed to an out-of-court settlement of US$470 million in 1989. The plant site has not yet been cleaned up. Warren Anderson, CEO at the time of the disaster, and Carbide refused to answer to homicide charges and remained fugitives from India's courts. The U.S. denied several extradition requests. Anderson died on 29 September 2014 in Florida. Seven Indian employees of Union Carbide were convicted of criminal negligence in 2010 and fined $2,000 each. In 1982, Carbide's auditors warned of a possible 'runaway reaction'. Carbide didn't supply an antidote, maintained that MIC was "nothing more than a potent tear gas". Carbide insisted the accident was an act of sabotage by a rogue worker.
Union Carbide in Australia[edit]
Union Carbide's operations in Australia commenced in 1957 when they purchased the plant of the Australian owned company Timbrol Ltd. The Timbrol factory was on the shore of Homebush Bay in the Sydney suburb of Rhodes. Homebush Bay is on the Parramatta River which flows into Sydney Harbour. Tibrol produced phenol, the insecticides chlorobenzene/chlorophenol/DDT, and the herbicides 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T. Union Carbide continued the production of the 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T until 1976 and chlorobenzene/chlorophenol/DDT until 1983. Union Carbide also commenced the production of Bisphenol A in 1960 and Phenol Formaldehyde resins in 1964.[12]:9
Union Carbide reclaimed land on neighboring properties by depositing spent lime and ash into the adjacent marshes in Homebush Bay. This practice, which had been approved by the Maritime Services Board, ceased in 1970.
Union Carbide ceased operations in Australia in 1985.[13] In 1987 the New South Wales Pollution Control Commission ordered Union Carbide to remediate the site. This work, which cost Union Carbide $30 million, was conducted between 1988 and 1993. The work involved excavation and encapsulation of the contaminated soil.[14]
In 2004 the minister for planning granted consent for additional remediation of the former Union Carbide site to proceed including parts of Homebush Bay.[15] Approximately 900,000 tons of soil were excavated from the Union Carbide site, 190,000 tons of soil from the adjacent Allied Feeds site and approximately 50,000 tons of sediment from the bay. Remediation of the Allied Feeds Site was completed in August 2009, Homebush Bay sediments in August 2010, and the Union Carbide site in March 2011. The value of the remediation work was $35M for the Allied Feeds site and $100 million for Union Carbide site and Homebush Bay sediments.[16][17]

Union Carbide Corporation is a wholly owned subsidiary (since 2001) of Dow Chemical Company. It currently employs more than 2,400 people.[2] Union Carbide produces chemicals and polymers that undergo one or more further conversions by customers before reaching consumers. Some are high-volume commodities and others are specialty products meeting the needs of smaller markets. Markets served include paints and coatings, packaging, wire and cable, household products, personal care, pharmaceuticals, automotive, textiles, agriculture, and oil and gas. The company is a former component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.[3] Union Carbide was 50.9% stakeholder in Union Carbide India Limited, the company responsible for the Bhopal disaster.[4]
Founded in 1917, as the Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation from a merger with National Carbon Company, the company's researchers developed an economical way to make ethylene from natural gas liquids, such as ethane and propane, giving birth to the modern petrochemical industry. Before divesting them, the chemical giant owned consumer products Eveready and Energizer batteries, Glad bags and wraps, Simoniz car wax, and Prestone antifreeze. The company divested other businesses before being acquired by Dow Chemical on February 6, 2001, including electronic chemicals, polyurethane intermediates, industrial gases and carbon products.[5]

History[edit]
The Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation was formed on November 1, 1917, from the merger of the Union Carbide Company founded in 1898, the National Carbon Company founded in 1886, Linde Air Products Company, maker of liquid oxygen, and the Prest-O-Lite company, manufacturer of calcium carbide. In 1920 the company set up a chemicals division which manufactured ethylene glycol for use as automotive antifreeze. The company continued to acquire related chemical producers, including the Bakelite Corporation in 1939. The company changed its name to "Union Carbide Corporation" in 1957 and was often referred to as Carbide. It operated Oak Ridge National Laboratory from 1947 until the late 1970s.[6]
During the Cold war era the company was active in the field of rocket propulsion research & development for aerospace and guided missile applications, particularly in the field of chemicals and plastics, solid rocket motors, storable liquid fuels. R&D activities has been centered at the Technical Center near Charleston, West Virginia.[7] The Aerospace Materials Department was established for the mentioned purposes within the company's Carbon Products Division.[8]
Ucar batteries was Carbide's industrial and consumer zinc chloride battery business. The business including Energizer alkaline batteries was sold to Ralston Purina in 1986, following a hostile takeover operation.
After the Bhopal disaster, Union Carbide was the subject of repeated takeover attempts. In order to pay off its debt, Carbide sold many of its most familiar brands such as Glad Trashbags and Eveready Batteries. Dow Chemical announced the purchase of Carbide in 1999 for $8.89 billion in stock.[9]
Hawks Nest Tunnel disaster[edit]
Main article: Hawks Nest Tunnel Disaster
The Hawks Nest Tunnel disaster took place between 1927 and 1932 in a West Virginia tunnel project led by Union Carbide. During the construction of the tunnel, workers found the mineral silica and were asked to mine it for use in electroprocessing steel. The workers were not given masks or breathing equipment to use while mining. Due to silica dust exposure, many workers developed silicosis, a debilitating lung disease. According to a marker on site, there were 109 admitted deaths. A congressional hearing placed the death toll at 476.[10]
Asbestos mining and 'Calidria' brand fibers[edit]
In the early 1960s, Union Carbide Corporation began mining a newly identified outcrop of chrysotile asbestos fibers near King City and New Idria, California. The fibers were sold under the brand name "Calidria", a combination of "Cal" and "Idria." These fibers were sold in large quantities for a wide variety of purposes, including addition into joint compound or drywall accessory products.[11] Union Carbide sold the mine to its employees under the name KCAC ("King City Asbestos Mine") in the 1980s, but it only operated for a few more years.[citation needed]
Bhopal disaster[edit]
Main article: Bhopal disaster
Union Carbide India Limited, owned by Union Carbide (50.9%) and Indian investors (49.1%), operated a pesticide plant in the Indian city of Bhopal.[4] Around midnight on 3 December 1984, methyl isocyanate (MIC) gas was accidentally released from the plant, exposing more than 500,000 people to MIC and other chemicals. The government of Madhya Pradesh confirmed a total of 3,787 deaths related to the gas release. It left an estimated 40,000 individuals permanently disabled, maimed, or suffering from serious illness, making it one of the world's worst industrial disasters. Union Carbide was sued by the Government of India and agreed to an out-of-court settlement of US$470 million in 1989. The plant site has not yet been cleaned up. Warren Anderson, CEO at the time of the disaster, and Carbide refused to answer to homicide charges and remained fugitives from India's courts. The U.S. denied several extradition requests. Anderson died on 29 September 2014 in Florida. Seven Indian employees of Union Carbide were convicted of criminal negligence in 2010 and fined $2,000 each. In 1982, Carbide's auditors warned of a possible 'runaway reaction'. Carbide didn't supply an antidote, maintained that MIC was "nothing more than a potent tear gas". Carbide insisted the accident was an act of sabotage by a rogue worker.
Union Carbide in Australia[edit]
Union Carbide's operations in Australia commenced in 1957 when they purchased the plant of the Australian owned company Timbrol Ltd. The Timbrol factory was on the shore of Homebush Bay in the Sydney suburb of Rhodes. Homebush Bay is on the Parramatta River which flows into Sydney Harbour. Tibrol produced phenol, the insecticides chlorobenzene/chlorophenol/DDT, and the herbicides 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T. Union Carbide continued the production of the 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T until 1976 and chlorobenzene/chlorophenol/DDT until 1983. Union Carbide also commenced the production of Bisphenol A in 1960 and Phenol Formaldehyde resins in 1964.[12]:9
Union Carbide reclaimed land on neighboring properties by depositing spent lime and ash into the adjacent marshes in Homebush Bay. This practice, which had been approved by the Maritime Services Board, ceased in 1970.
Union Carbide ceased operations in Australia in 1985.[13] In 1987 the New South Wales Pollution Control Commission ordered Union Carbide to remediate the site. This work, which cost Union Carbide $30 million, was conducted between 1988 and 1993. The work involved excavation and encapsulation of the contaminated soil.[14]
In 2004 the minister for planning granted consent for additional remediation of the former Union Carbide site to proceed including parts of Homebush Bay.[15] Approximately 900,000 tons of soil were excavated from the Union Carbide site, 190,000 tons of soil from the adjacent Allied Feeds site and approximately 50,000 tons of sediment from the bay. Remediation of the Allied Feeds Site was completed in August 2009, Homebush Bay sediments in August 2010, and the Union Carbide site in March 2011. The value of the remediation work was $35M for the Allied Feeds site and $100 million for Union Carbide site and Homebush Bay sediments.[16][17]

The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
