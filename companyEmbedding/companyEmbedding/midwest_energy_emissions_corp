Midwest Energy Emissions Corp. Launches New Mercury Control Product








01/17/2017









































 LEWIS CENTER, OH--(Marketwired - January 17, 2017) - Midwest Energy Emissions Corp. (OTCQB: MEEC) ("ME2C" or the "Company"), a leader in mercury emissions control in North America, announced today that it is adding a new product to its proven, cost-effective mercury capture program that will reduce mercury emissions by preventing scrubber reemission events. The product is specifically designed for coal-fired power utilities with wet scrubbers to help remove mercury, as well as other metals, from the scrubber. "This new product has been successfully demonstrated at several large coal-burning power facilities," said John Pavlish, ME2C's Chief Technology Officer. "The additive has consistently proven to reduce mercury reemission from wet flue gas desulfurization systems achieving greater than 95% mercury control, resulting in stack mercury emissions well below MATS compliance limits.""The addition of the scrubber reemission product to our Total Mercury Control product line-up complements our existing patented technologies and further improves the effectiveness and cost savings of the ME2C Mercury Capture Programs," said Marc Sylvester, ME2C's Vice President of Sales. "The non-hazardous additive has proven to be very effective; allowing ME2C to offer to utility plants another cost-saving option for mercury compliance." A simple injection system can be tailored to each plant configuration which allows for a completely "hands free" operation at the plant, which can be maintained by ME2C's technicians.Richard MacPherson, President and CEO of ME2C, concluded: "The development of new products and techniques, such as this, is what continues to position ME2C as the leading technology firm in the mercury control industry. This product, along with others that are currently in development, are fueling our growth and competitive advantage."About Midwest Energy Emissions Corp. (ME2C) Midwest Energy Emissions Corp. (OTCQB: MEEC) delivers patented and proprietary solutions to the global coal-power industry to remove mercury from power plant emissions, providing performance guarantees, and leading-edge emissions services. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) MATS rule, which has been subject to legal challenges, requires that all coal- and oil-fired power plants in the U.S., larger than 25 mega-watts, must remove roughly 90% of mercury from their emissions starting April 15, 2015. ME2C has developed patented technology and proprietary products that have been shown to achieve mercury removal levels compliant with MATS at a significantly lower cost and with less operational impact than currently used methods, while preserving the marketability of fly-ash for beneficial use.

Enhanced International Patent Portfolio Licensed From The Energy & Environmental Research Center Foundation; Proprietary flu-gas treatment product for multi-pollutant mitigation
LEWIS CENTER, OH / ACCESSWIRE / May 7, 2015 / Midwest Energy Emissions Corp. (ME2C) (OTCQB:MEEC) announced today that the Energy & Environmental Research Center Foundation (EERCF) has successfully been awarded two new patents for emissions control. The two newest issued patents are U.S. Patent 9,011,805 issued on April 21, 2015, and Europe Patent # 1 931 449 issued on March 25, 2015. ME2C now has 21 patents under its exclusive patent-licensing agreement with the EERCF, with an additional 8 patents pending, across key international markets in the US, Canada, Europe, and China.
Additionally, the Company has announced the full commercialization of a critical product offering for customers, which is offered as part of its patented SEA Technology for mercury air emissions control. In its pursuit of continued innovation across its product suite, the Company now has a fully commercialized product for high SO3 environments, with co-benefits of improved particulate control and acid-gas mitigation, important for both proper system management and regulated emissions.
Midwest Energy Emissions Corp. develops and employs patented and proprietary solutions for mercury emissions control. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Mercury and Air Toxic Standards (MATS) rule requires that all coal- and oil-fired power plants in the U.S., larger than 25 mega-watts, must remove roughly 90% of mercury from their stack emissions. ME2C's patented technology, and performance guarantee, has been shown to achieve mercury removal levels compliant with MATS at a significantly lower cost and with less operational impact than currently used methods, while preserving the ability for customers to recycle and sell fly-ash for beneficial use.
CEO Richard MacPherson stated, "This is a very powerful development for our company, and our shareholders, today. The rewards of our investments are continuing to unfold in the form of our IP, and the products that we are offering to our customers. The patents that the EERCF has successfully been issued are the result of over two decades of exhaustive research on air emissions in coal power plants, and specifically, mercury emissions. The robust IP that we have invested into offers the coal-power industry the very best means for tackling intense regulations that demand the most cost-effective solutions. Atop this, our very core philosophy on holistic solutions provisions for our customers has manifested in a wonderful solution for SO3 and acid-gasses, which can be very problematic for maximizing power plant efficiency, and cost-effective regulatory compliance. We trialed the product over the last two years, and have successfully sold it into the market to great success at a customer who saw dramatic reduction in SO3, which raised the power production at the plant, increasing revenues, while drastically reducing their costs for mercury emissions control. Our SEA Technology platform is constantly being improved with new products, with the mindset of offering our customers the very best in mercury emissions control, and we'll guarantee the results. "
Stated CTO, John Pavlish, "Continuing and evolving developments in our products and licensed IP demonstrate our ongoing efforts to provide the most effective cutting-edge solutions to our customers. I am very proud of the work that our team has put into the development and testing of this solution for SO3, as this form of sulfur in the plant gas stream greatly impacts effective mercury control, and can be very problematic for maintaining emissions and efficiency for a power plant. This product can reduce mercury emissions control costs, and increase the revenues for a customer in certain environments where SO3 is limiting power output. Regarding the patents, we have grown the European reach of an existing US patent, which continues to play to the global expansion of mercury emissions regulations, and in the US, we are pushing into the increased efficacy of smaller, nano-particle carbon products that will continue to enhance the capability of power plants to recycle their fly ash for beneficial use. In all, this news today demonstrates the real-time development of products that our customers can use now, and patented processes that will benefit them for many years to come."
