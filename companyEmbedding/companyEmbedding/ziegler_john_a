 Custom Marie Ziegler of John Deere Essay
The features of sustainable business practices include the ability of a leader to foresee final objectives of the company, to evaluate the process of achievement of these objectives and to provide steps to attain the goal. The effective leadership begins with understanding the process and development of the appropriate steps.
Marie Ziegler, Vice President and Treasurer for Deere & Company, joined the company in 1978. Holding different positions, from consolidation accountant to vice president, she studied carefully the requirements of the world market and business capabilities and had managed her company in a way it became a global leader in its field. She took responsibility in making heavy equipment and other products conform to the standards of the industry.
While working out steps of business sustainability strategy, Marie Ziegler reviewed several key factors which are an integral part of effective leadership: multidisciplinary teams, cross-cutting approach, encouraging learning. She organized communication and transparency of business, chose appropriate tools and skilled actors. She defined roles and responsibilities.She faced requirements and successfully fulfilled them.
In 2011 United States Environmental Protection Agencies (EPA) worked out emission regulations for equipment. New requirements set reducing particular matter by 90%. Emissions of NOx are reduced to 50%.  According to the tests, John Deere products meet these standards.
John Deere has always been ahead of the game when it comes to meeting emissions regulations. We pioneered the use of many advanced technologies with our engines and proved their performance in off-highway applications. This gives us a head start for fuel economy as well as delivering higher power bulge, more torque rise, and faster transient response time.
Marie Ziegler is a leader Deere & Company was waiting for. Good education and personal traits helped her to become a strong leader who made company grow and remain profitable. She possesses all qualities of effective leader: strong-minded, purpose-oriented, wise and smart. She understood that “sustainability can stimulate technological innovation, advance competitiveness, and improve the quality of life”. That is why her strategic plan was oriented towards the improvement of product and life quality.
The company’s slogan “Nothing runs like a Deere” has determined a plan of actions for the world market. First, the company needed to meet EPA standards in order to be competitive member of the industry. Thus, Marie Ziegler’s goal was to improve John Deere products and have them approved by EPA. This step stipulated progress of the company.  “Two years ago we were not generating adequate returns,” Ziegler says. “Frankly, we did not have a business that was as great as our products”.
The way Marie Ziegler implemented a culture of sustainability in Deere & Company included such important features as values, vision, strategy and systems. According to Beemer, “Deere & Company’s policy will ensure that our environmental efforts support our corporate goals of profitable growth and continuous improvement”.
Thus, values should be considered as ideas and practices used in business to be successful. Marie Ziegler was a task-oriented leader. Nevertheless, she paid sufficient attention to the employees and considered them as one big team with a common goal. Her strategic plan for the company also included deferential relationship among the employees and their motivation as well as respectful attitude to the customers. A company can exist until it has its customers. Meanwhile, quality of the products depends on the relationship within the company. And the relationship between workers and CEO reveals its real values. Marie Ziegler discovered this ‘happy medium’ and built the strategy of the company’s development keeping these factors balanced.
Vision is also important, since without this feature it is impossible to evaluate market demands, competitiveness of the company, the way of improvement in order to meet issued standards and the level of progress while applying particular business strategies.
Strategy is the main component of company’s success. Business is a complicated system which requires clean scheme. For big success no improvisation can be acquired. Marie Ziegler’s strategy was quite effective, since sustainability level in the company is relatively high. When officials from John Deere discussed sustainability in Germany at the official meeting they provided the essential information concerning energy saving issues and environmental protection measures. As Ziegler says, “To ensure a successful future, we’ve got to be strong globally”. System is a feature which makes Ziegler’s management strategy distinguish from the others. Once she said, “I like working with creative people. I'm not creative myself”.
To my way of thinking, the general management strategies must be applied in agricultural sphere: investments, smart management, clear scheme and innovative technologies. Investments are necessary to begin business: build facilities, buy equipment and hire employees. Smart management determines successful strategy of the development and leads business in a way to obtain a good profit as well as to provide work satisfaction for the workers. Clear scheme stipulates progressive implementation of the task and helps to avoid misunderstandings among the members of senior management. Innovative technologies allow to accelerate production process as well as to improve quality of the product. Moreover, they help to save energy and costs which is important in business.
To conclude, it is worth noting that culture of sustainability is an integral part of business nowadays. Marie Ziegler is a talented successful leader who achieved considerable results in this issue. She had enough talent to lead business in a serious branch of industry and to succeed.

Discover The $5 Solution to a Wrinkle Free Face - ALL EXPOSED TODAY!





Various sources across the internet have exposed a HUGE celebrity secret to erase wrinkles - without botox or surgery!

How do Hollywood starlets look so radiant and youthful well into 
thier 40's, 50's, and even 60's? Is it always expensive botox and 
dangerous  plastic surgery? According to various sources, the answer is NO! So if
 they aren't all using surgery to stay looking great, what is their 
secret? Keep reading, it's excitingly effective, safe, and cheap!
 
It is rumoured that some celebrities are aiming to look 10 to 15 years younger fast, but are scared of the potential risks of surgery or botox. Many online sources have expressed suprise over how shockingly simple, cheap, and effective his technique was! Read on...
 
“Countless aging celebs are reported to have admitted they avoided surgery and look 20 years younger thanks to the simple advice.”


The Best Skin Solution You’ve Never Heard Of

The wrinkle secret has been reserved for high paying celebrity clients...until now. Consumers have reported throwing away thousands of dollars on expensive anti aging products or dangerous surgical procedures that make big promises that often do far more harm than good. As a result, a few weeks ago this simple solution was shared!
 
This anti aging miracle was reportedly found when multiple celebrity friends were hoping for a solution to look younger to prolong their career without going in for surgery.






“She looked 15 years younger in literally 2 weeks!”

 
They were reported to have been thrilled when after months and months of pain staking tests and research, the team came across 2 products that when combined supposedly took 10 to 20 years off women’s appearance in just a month. More shockingly it is safe, and  costs next to nothing to try! The two products are Oveena Anti Aging Cream and Lumaglow Instant Lifting Cream.
  

“Possbily the best anti aging discovery of the decade.”
 
 
So what is it?



 2 Key Ingredients For Anti Aging:

1.  Vitamin C
  2.  Hyaluronic Acid



These are both natural ingredients that work together to erase 
wrinkles and fine lines at the cellular level – below the surface of the
 skin – which is why they’re so effective.
 
Vitamin C, The 1st Youth Discovery:
  The first piece of the anti aging puzzle discovered was Vitamin C.

 "Vitamin C is a secret anti aging trick”
Vitamin C penetrates deep into damaged skin and stimulates new 
collagen – a protein which makes skin appear plump and firm. It's all 
the rage in beauty circles, much in part because of a 2009 study 
stating, applying non-prescription  Vitamin C to your skin  caused a large reduction in fine lines and wrinkles. This is why Oveena Anti Aging Cream is so effective. It was one of the few products on the market that had Vitamin C in the right consistency and dosage.




Hyaluronic Acid:
  The second piece, when combined properly with Vitamin C, can make your face look two decades younger in weeks! Hyaluronic 
Acid works by binding to moisture. It can hold up to 1,000 times its 
weight in water, making it an excellent natural skin plumper. Hyaluronic
 acid helps your skin repair and regenerate itself after suffering from 
dryness, environmental stresses, or irritation. Products you can buy over the counter with an effective 
concentration of Hyaluronic Acid was found in Lumaglow Instant Lifting Cream . 





 




 
“What Vitamin C & Hyaluronic Acid do is get rid of all the old, dead layers of skin and help your skin 
    generate fresh new ones. Our research shows that you can erase almost 10 to 
    20 years off your face in less than 14 days. But the key is to choose 
    the creams and serums that contain the highest and purest quality 
    ingredients, since they’re not all the same. The only two we found during our research was Oveena Anti Aging Cream and Lumaglow Instant Lifting Cream. This is what my wife uses. This is what I recommend to all my celebrity clients.”



"How do I do it?"


It's actually very simple. You simply use both products before bed. Oveena Anti Aging Cream and Lumaglow Instant Lifting Cream.
    These two products both contain high concentrations of pure Vitamin C 
    and Hyaluronic Acid in just the right concentrations. His team is also reported to have discovered 
    that they contain all sorts of anti-oxidants, an ingredient called 
    Dermaxyl (also known as facelift in a jar) and Ester-C (the active 
    anti-aging compound in Vitamin C). 




“Getting older is rough for an actress. I feel like a new woman!”




Put to the Test!
As excited as we were, we wanted to find an example of real usage of these type of products. We found one test where a volunteer from the office was used. A 57 year old mother of 3 jumped at the chance to test this combo and the results were pulished online. Here is her story...
 
Brenda's Story & 14 Day Cell Revival Results:
"Brenda is a 57 year old mother of 3 from here in Chicago. Like most 
women her age, the years have started to give her unwanted lines and 
wrinkles. Brenda said she volunteered because she is so frustrated that 
nothing she has tried seems to work. She was even considered highly 
risky and very expensive facelift procedure. This was somewhat of a last
 resort for her." 

Here are the reported results from the source....
 




 


Day 1:

"After the first day of using Oveena Anti Aging Cream and Lumaglow Instant Lifting Cream together,
 I was surprised at how wonderful they both made my skin feel. It felt 
like every last pore on my face was being tightened and pulled by a 
gigantic vacuum cleaner.
 
I don't know how else to describe it! I could feel a warm tingling 
sensation on my cheeks, around my eyes, and on my forehead. I looked in 
the mirror and saw that my face looked a bit rosy - the result of 
revitalizing blood rushing to the surface of my skin to renew my face. 
 
After both products were absorbed into my skin, my face looked firmer and had a beautiful glow to it."



day 5:
 
"After five days of using Oveena Anti Aging Cream and Lumaglow Instant Lifting Cream, I was shocked at the drastic results.
The lines, dark spots, and wrinkles - without question - were visibly reduced in size right before my eyes!
I was astonished by the results, and literally felt 15 years younger 
again. It was like watching all my wrinkles and fine lines vanish right off!"




day 14:
 "After 14 days, not only had all my doubts and scepticism absolutely vanished - SO DID MY WRINKLES!

  The lines on my forehead, the loose, sagging skin on my neck, my crows’ feet – even the age spots on my face had 
COMPLETELY disappeared. I've never felt or seen anything tighten my skin
 with this kind of force before, no matter how expensive the product!
 
After the 2 weeks, my skin not only stayed that
way, it actually improved every day until it became as beautiful and 
radiant as it was 20 years ago. By this point, all my 
friends and family were shocked. They couldn't believe the difference, 
and were convinced I was lying about not getting botox!"
