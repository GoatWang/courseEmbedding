Red Oak Partners, LLC Clarifies another Misleading Press Release from Dynacor

Agrees that Shareholders have sent a Powerful Message -- to the Board
NEW YORK, June 25, 2015 /PRNewswire/ --
Dear Fellow Shareholders,
In an ongoing and much needed effort to promote transparency to fellow shareholders, Red Oak Partners, LLC ("Red Oak") wishes to clarify yet another misleading and promotional press release issued by Dynacor Gold Mines Inc. (TSX: DNG)(OTC: DNGDF) ("Dynacor" or the "Company") on June 23, 2015.  Specifically, Dynacor's Board has made incorrect claims about the level of support shown for its Directors at the June 22 election.  Dynacor's Board is well aware that only two voting options exist in Canada for the election of Directors:  FOR or WITHHOLD.  There exists no AGAINST vote concept.  Accordingly, WITHHOLD votes represent votes opposing re-election.  Despite knowing this, Dynacor's Board ignored a significant number of votes specifically marked as WITHHOLD regarding the re-election of its Chairman as well as certain other Directors.  In yet another instance of misleading and cherry-picking of facts, Dynacor's Board has taken a path to skew information in its favor by promoting a fictitious level of support.  We have confirmation that the WITHHOLD votes regarding the election of the non-independent Chairman, Rene Branchaud, represented an amount greater than eighty percent of ALL shares which voted at the 2014 election and at least seventy times the number of shares which the eighteen year affiliated Director owns personally.  This is a far cry from the laughable 99.83% support which Dynacor's Chairman-led Board claimed was voted in support of its conflicted Chairman Branchaud.  
Additionally, because of Red Oak's concern about a fair election, Red Oak voted on Dynacor's proxy card to ensure Dynacor could not find ways to exclude such votes.  Despite taking such precautions, Dynacor's Board and representatives conducted the meeting in the absence of an independent inspector of elections.  Despite the Dynacor insiders speaking English fluently, they conducted the meeting entirely in French (which was fine) but did not ask (in English) for Red Oak's representative (who was present at the meeting) to propose Red Oak's nominees.  A fairly run election would never have seen such a conflicted and intentionally unfair process, and only confirms our concerns about Dynacor's Chairman and Board's alignment with shareholders and vs. its desperation to entrench itself at literally any cost.
Stated David Sandberg, Red Oak's founder and managing member, "Red Oak's goal was to bring important issues to light.  We did not actively solicit shareholders and I did not make a single outbound call, and we expect we spent less than 20% vs. the shareholder monies which Dynacor's Board so readily wasted (Dynacor's Board should publicly disclose what it spent even if shareholders will be outraged at the amount).  Ultimately we even voted on the Company's proxy card.  Through this managed effort, we were successful in confirming that the largest shareholders of the Company expect significant change as a result of this process, we forced Dynacor's Board to publicly confirm it will address all of the issues we raised (although it did recant in a recent press release regarding adopting policies related to Director tenure, but we will almost assuredly contest next year's election in a significant way if tenure as well as tenure-based ownership requirements are not adopted), and we gave a much needed wake up call to the Board and to shareholders, including those who have fiduciary duties to their own investors.  In the interim, we – along with all shareholders – anxiously await the Governance Committee's new policies as well as the next nominating process, one which we expect will not be led by the non-independent Chairman and in which shareholder candidates will be strongly considered, if not favored.  Until then, we ask that Dynacor's Board require Director training for its less experienced Directors who have not had such training as well as those (such as the CEO and some of the newer Directors not named Depatie) whose only meaningful experience has been at Dynacor and who therefore would not have exposure to public company governance and standard Board processes."   
Continued Mr. Sandberg, "We remain excited about the business and continue to increase our investment, and believe our group is currently the largest shareholder of the Company.  As long-term holders, we continue to require strong governance and meaningful alignment and representation by shareholders because these are necessary to ensure that shareholders see optimal value and dodge a recurrence of the Malaga bankruptcy (Dynacor's predecessor) which so many of these same insiders played a key role in."

Red Oak Partners, LLC Announces Resignation of Red Oak's Designees from the Board of Directors of RF Industries, Ltd.

Mar 25, 2013, 16:01 ET
		  		  					
						 from   Red Oak Partners, LLC 











 
















































 

 




















 


NEW YORK, March 25, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Red Oak Partners, LLC ("Red Oak"), today announced that its two designees entitled to serve as Directors on the Board of RF Industries Ltd ("RF") (NASDAQ:   RFIL), David Sandberg and J. Randall Waterfield, have resigned effective immediately and in accordance with the terms of the agreement reached between RF and Red Oak on August 29, 2011.  Under that agreement, upon Red Oak's ownership falling below a threshold level as defined in the agreement, its designees shall no longer be entitled to serve on RF's Board of Directors.  After significant appreciation in RF's share price in recent months and largely via sales effected under a 10b5-1 plan, Red Oak's current ownership level is now below the required threshold as defined in the agreement.  Although Red Oak has no influence over whether its second designee, Mr. Waterfield, will resign or not, Mr. Waterfield has agreed to honor the agreement and resign effective immediately as well. 
Stated David Sandberg, Red Oak's Founder and Managing Member, "RF has been a successful investment for Red Oak, more than doubling over a sub two and one-half year investment time-frame with such return excluding additional capital returned to shareholders via dividends (and we recently proposed to the Board and achieved a sharp increase in the regular quarterly dividend).  Red Oak and RF initially established ownership terms in its 2011 agreement to ensure Directors had sufficient skin in the game.  Given Mr. Waterfield and I no longer have the levels of share ownership which we believe Directors of public companies should have in order to be aligned with shareholder's best interests, we are resigning effective immediately.  Despite my resignation, I have offered to assist RF, if requested, to evaluate new Directors, to improve its governance policies towards making RF more shareholder friendly, and to assist with certain strategic and other transition issues over the next few months, all at no compensation.  Mr. Waterfield has indicated that he too is willing to assist the company on such matters upon request and at no compensation as well."  
Continued Mr. Sandberg, "The timing of our resignations allows RF to add other independent Directors before the upcoming annual meeting.  To optimize shareholder value going forward, I strongly suggest that RF's Board also: 

add more independent Directors (noting that two independent Directors worked at Teledyne with RF's CEO), and that such Director nominees be referred by RF's large shareholders to ensure true independence; 
adopt Board rotation policies to ensure that fresh perspective exists and that current Directors represent current shareholders; 
ensure that current Directors retain sufficient share ownership in correlation to their years of tenure (ie., the longer you serve the more you should own) so as to be aligned with shareholders, and retain at least the ownership levels defined in the August 29, 2011 agreement; 
pursue formal and professional processes, including regarding the evaluation of several candidates with requisite past CFO experience for the vacant CFO position; 
and consider retaining a credible banker to oversee a strategic alternatives process, which is something I believe all business should do periodically to ensure that shareholder value is optimized.
"We believe RF has a strong niche and should continue to generate positive cash flows going forward.  Red Oak wishes RF the best of luck going forward.  It's been a pleasure to serve as a Director and to witness the dramatic recent growth and share appreciation."
