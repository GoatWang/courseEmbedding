Bergio International, Inc. (PC) Description



Bergio is entering into our 20th year of operations and concentrates sales on boutique, upscale jewelry stores. We currently sell our jewelry to approximately 150 independent jewelry retailers across the United States and have spent over $3 million in branding the Bergio name through tradeshows, trade advertising, national advertising and billboard advertising since launching the line in 1995. We have manufacturing control over our line as a result of having a manufacturing facility in New Jersey as well as subcontracts with facilities in Italy and Bangkok.It is our intention to establish Bergio International as a holding company for the purpose of acquiring established jewelry design and manufacturing firms who possess branded product lines. Branded product lines are products and/or collections whereby the jewelry manufacturers have established their products within the industry through advertising in consumer and trade magazines as well as possibly obtaining federally registered trademarks of their products and collections. This is in line with our strategy and belief that a brand name can create an association with innovation, design and quality which helps add value to the individual products as well as facilitate the introduction of new products.We intend to acquire design and manufacturing firms throughout the United States and Europe. If and when we pursue any potential acquisition candidates, we intend to target the top 10% of the world?s jewelry manufactures that have already created an identity and brand in the jewelry industry. We intend to locate potential candidates through our relationships in the industry and expect to structure the acquisition through the payment of cash, which will most likely be provided from third party financing, as well as our common stock but not cash generated from our operations. In the event we obtain financing from third parties for any potential acquisitions, Bergio International may agree to issue our common stock in exchange for the capital received. However, as of the date of this Current Report, we do not have any binding agreements with any potential acquisition candidates or arrangements with any third parties for financing.Principal Products and ServicesWe have historically sold our products directly to distributors, retailers and other wholesalers, who then in turn sell their products to consumers through retail stores. Independent retail jewelers that offer the current Bergio line are not under formal contracts and most sell competing products.Our products consist of a wide range of unique styles and designs made from precious metals such as gold, platinum and Karat gold, as well as other precious stones. We continuously innovate and change our designs based upon consumer trends and as a result of new designs being created we believe we are able to differentiate ourselves and strengthen our brands. We sell our products to our customers at price points that reflect the market price of the base material plus a markup reflecting our design fee and processing fees.Each year, most jewelry manufacturers bring new products to market. We believe that we are a trendsetter in jewelry manufacturing. As a result, we come out with a variety of products throughout the year that we believe have commercial potential to meet what we feel are new trends within the industry. The ?Bergio? designs consist of upscale jewelry that includes white
