ECC - Oral Mucositis
Intervening on Oral Mucositis with Intrexon’s Technology
On June 10, 2015, we entered into a new exclusive channel collaboration with Intrexon to pursue development of biotherapeutics for oral mucositis (OM) and other diseases and conditions of the oral cavity, throat and esophagus, including clinical advancement of the ActoBiotic™ AG013 for the treatment of OM. OM results in the painful inflammation and ulceration of the membranes lining the oral cavity, throat and esophagus, and is among the most frequently reported adverse events associated with cancer therapy affecting up to 500,000 patients annually. At present there is no drug approved to prevent the condition broadly and therapies are primarily palliative, alleviating symptoms without addressing the underlying pathology, resulting in a significant unmet medical need. 
Access to Intrexon's technologies and expertise
Under the terms of the agreement, we will have access to Intrexon's technologies and expertise to develop products for the treatment of oral mucositis or products containing genetically modified Lactococcus lactis expressing trefoil factors in the oral cavity, throat and esophagus for a technology access fee and will reimburse Intrexon for the research and development costs. 



Developing Treatments to Combat Resistant Infectious Diseases
We possess and develop technologies and product candidates that originate from the discoveries of our scientific team. Learn More  »

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
