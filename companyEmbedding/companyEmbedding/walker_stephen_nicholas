(4)� Pursuant to the Plan, in the event that The Cronos Group (the "Issuer") pays any cash or other dividend or makes any other distribution in respect of its common shares, then each Director's Account will be credited with an additional number of director's stock units determined by dividing (A) the amount of cash, or the value (as determined by the Board) of any securities or other property, paid or distributed in respect of one outstanding common share by (B) the Fair Market Value of a common share for the first date on which the common shares of the Issuer trade "ex dividend" with respect to the dividend or distribution by the Issuer with respect to its common shares, and multiplying the result of such division by (C) the number of director's stock units that were credited to the Director's Account immediately prior to the date of the dividend or other distribution. Credits shall be made effective as of the date of the dividend or other distribution in respect of the common shares.

The article is called Global Sources Ltd Bermuda Walker Stephen Nicholas Bought New Stake and is was published by Octafinance.com at http://www.octafinance.com/global-sources-ltd-bermuda-walker-stephen-nicholas-bought-new-stake/87173/.CaptchaSubmitWalker Stephen Nicholas New Position in Global Sources Ltd. (Bermuda) (NASDAQ:GSOL)
Walker Stephen Nicholas has filled a SC 13G form regarding Global Sources Ltd Bermuda  19.80 -0.10 -0.50%. Filing Link: 000119312515239082.  Per Walker Stephen Nicholas’s filing, the filler now owns 5.01% of the company, holding 1,514,475 shares.
 Global Sources Ltd. (Bermuda) (NASDAQ:GSOL) is a newly disclosed equity position  and the filing was required due to activity on June 18, 2015. This most probably shows Walker Stephen Nicholas’s confidence and optimism in the future of the company.
Form 13G is used when the filer owns between 5% and 20% of the company and plans to hold it only as a passive investor. If the filler intend to exert control and if the stake’s size exceeds 20%, then a 13D must be filed. Therefore, activist investors and practices such as: hostile takeovers, company breakups, and other “change of control” events, are not permitted by 13G filers.
