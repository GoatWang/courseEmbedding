 Zartex Inc. (Form: 424B3, Received: 01/26/2017 06:06:43) 

















	Filed Pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3)


	SEC File No. 333-214122 





	PROSPECTUS







	THE INFORMATION IN THIS PROSPECTUS MAY BE CHANGED. THESE SECURITIES MAY NOT BE SOLD UNTIL THE REGISTRATION STATEMENT FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION IS EFFECTIVE. THIS PROSPECTUS IS NOT AN OFFER TO SELL THESE SECURITIES AND IT IS NOT SOLICITING AN OFFER TO BUY THESE SECURITIES IN ANY STATE WHERE THE OFFER OR SALE IS NOT PERMITTED. THERE IS NO MINIMUM PURCHASE REQUIREMENT FOR THE OFFERING TO PROCEED.



	 



	ZARTEX INC.




	5,000,000 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK




	$0.02 PER SHARE






	This is the initial offering of common stock of Zartex Inc. and no public market currently exists for the securities being offered. We are registering for sale a total of 5,000,000 shares of common stock at a fixed price of $0.02 per share to the general public in best efforts offering. We estimate our total offering registration costs to be approximately $8,000. There is no minimum number of shares that must be sold by us for the offering to proceed, and we will retain the proceeds from the sale of any of the offered shares. The offering is being conducted on a self-underwritten, best efforts basis, which means our President, Aleksandr Zausaev, will attempt to sell the shares. We are making this offering without the involvement of underwriters or broker-dealers.





	This Prospectus will permit our President to sell the shares directly to the public, with no commission or other remuneration payable to him for any shares he may sell. Mr. Zausaev will sell all the shares registered herein. In offering the securities on our behalf, he will rely on the safe harbor from broker-dealer registration set out in Rule 3a4-1 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. The shares will be offered at a fixed price of $0.02 per share for a period of two hundred and forty (240) days from the effective date of this prospectus. The offering shall terminate on the earlier of (i) when the offering period ends (240 days from the effective date of this prospectus), (ii) the date when the sale of all 5,000,000 shares is completed, (iii) when the Board of Directors decides that it is in the best interest of the Company to terminate the offering prior the completion of the sale of all 5,000,000 shares registered under the Registration Statement of which this Prospectus is part. 







	Zartex Inc. is a development stage company and has recently started its operations. To date we have been involved primarily in organizational activities. We do not have sufficient capital to commence operations. Any investment in the shares offered herein involves a high degree of risk. You should only purchase shares if you can afford the loss of your investment. Our independent registered public accountant has issued an audit opinion which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.





	There has been no market for our securities and a public market may never develop, or, if any market does develop, it may not be sustained. Our common stock is not traded on any exchange or on the over-the-counter market. After the effective date of the registration statement relating to this prospectus, we hope to have a market maker file an application with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) for our common stock to be eligible for trading on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. To be eligible for quotation, issuers must remain current in their quarterly and annual filings with the SEC. If we are not able to pay the expenses associated with our reporting obligations we will not be able to apply for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board. We do not yet have a market maker who has agreed to file such application. There can be no assurance that our common stock will ever be quoted on a stock exchange or a quotation service or that any market for our stock will develop.





	We are an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (JOBS Act).








	THE PURCHASE OF THE SECURITIES OFFERED THROUGH THIS PROSPECTUS INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK. YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY READ AND CONSIDER THE SECTION OF THIS PROSPECTUS ENTITLED RISK FACTORS ON PAGES 7 THROUGH 12 BEFORE BUYING ANY SHARES OF ZARTEX INC.S COMMON STOCK.









	NEITHER THE SEC NOR ANY STATE SECURITIES COMMISSION HAS APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED OF THESE SECURITIES OR PASSED UPON THE ADEQUACY OR ACCURACY OF THIS PROSPECTUS. ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE.







	THE INFORMATION IN THIS PROSPECTUS IS NOT COMPLETE AND MAY BE CHANGED. WE MAY NOT SELL THESE SECURITIES UNTIL THE REGISTRATION STATEMENT FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION IS EFFECTIVE. THIS PROSPECTUS IS NOT AN OFFER TO SELL THESE SECURITIES AND IT IS NOT SOLICITING AN OFFER TO BUY THESE SECURITIES IN ANY STATE WHERE THE OFFER OR SALE IS NOT PERMITTED.

	PROSPECTUS SUMMARY



	 



	AS USED IN THIS PROSPECTUS, UNLESS THE CONTEXT OTHERWISE REQUIRES, WE, US, OUR, AND ZARTEX INC. REFERS TO ZARTEX INC. THE FOLLOWING SUMMARY DOES NOT CONTAIN ALL OF THE INFORMATION THAT MAY BE IMPORTANT TO YOU. YOU SHOULD READ THE ENTIRE PROSPECTUS BEFORE MAKING AN INVESTMENT DECISION TO PURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK.



	 



	ZARTEX INC.



	 


	Zartex Inc. was incorporated in Nevada on August 17, 2016. We are development stage company and commence operations in the business of software development. We are a software company that delivers services for garment distribution industry. Our main service is the IT product for garment retailers. We plan to deliver a software product (to which we may refer as a program, a web-engine or an application), the visible part of which we plan to design in a form of a web catalogue. With many offers in the garment industry producers and retailers might experience difficulties in delivering their offer to their potential customers. Customers might feel insecure about how their actual size matches to the size of clothing displayed on the retailers or producers website. We expect that employment of our program can make it easier to advertize and sell garment items, for retailers, select and buy, for garment buyers.





	We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to develop our business operations (See Description of Business and Use of Proceeds). To implement our plan of operations we require a minimum of $42,000 for the next twelve months as described in our Plan of Operations. There is no assurance that we will generate sufficient revenue in the first 12 months after completion our offering or ever generate significant revenue.





	Being a development stage company, we have very limited operating history. If we do not generate sufficient revenue we may need a minimum of $10,000 of additional funding to pay for ongoing SEC filing requirements. We do not currently have any arrangements for additional financing. Our principal executive offices are located at 4760 South Pecos Rd. Suite 103, Las Vegas, NV 89121. Our phone number is (775) 391-8588.



	From inception (August 17, 2016) until the date of this filing, we have had limited operating activities. Our financial statements from inception (August 17, 2016) through November 30, 2016, reports $5,000 of revenue and a net loss of $1,733. Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit opinion for Zartex Inc., which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. To date, we have developed our business plan and developed business-model of our company, we have developed our software and started our sales. On November 1, 2016, we signed agreement with Ken Fregt Shoping, LLC. As a result of this agreement we have generated $2,800 of revenue. We sold our software called Match Me in format of application. We also provided the service of software customization. Ken Fregt Shoping, LLC plans to use our software engine in stores electronocal catalog. On November 16, 2016, we signed the second Software Acquisition Agreement and as the result of this agreement we generated $2,200 of revenue.





	As of the date of this prospectus, there is no public trading market for our common stock and no assurance that a trading market for our securities will ever develop.





	Proceeds from this offering are required for us to proceed with your business plan over the next twelve months. We require minimum funding of approximately $42,000 to conduct our proposed operations and pay all expenses for a minimum period of one year including expenses associated with this offering and maintaining a reporting status with the SEC. If we are unable to obtain minimum funding of approximately $42,000, our business may fail. Since we are presently in the development stage of our business, we can provide no assurance that we will successfully sell any products or services related to our planned activities.

	RISK FACTORS



	 



	AN INVESTMENT IN OUR COMMON STOCK INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK. YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE RISKS DESCRIBED BELOW AND THE OTHER INFORMATION IN THIS PROSPECTUS BEFORE INVESTING IN OUR COMMON STOCK. IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS OCCUR, OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE SERIOUSLY HARMED. THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK, WHEN AND IF WE TRADE AT A LATER DATE, COULD DECLINE DUE TO ANY OF THESE RISKS, AND YOU MAY LOSE ALL OR PART OF YOUR INVESTMENT.









	RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS









	BECAUSE OUR AUDITORS HAVE RAISED A GOING CONCERN, THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL UNCERTAINTY THAT WE WILL CONTINUE OPERATIONS IN WHICH CASE YOU COULD LOSE YOUR INVESTMENT.






	Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the uncertainty about our ability to continue in business. As such we may have to cease operations and you could lose your investment.






	WE ARE SOLELY DEPENDENT UPON THE FUNDS TO BE RAISED IN THIS OFFERING TO START OUR BUSINESS, THE PROCEEDS OF WHICH MAY BE INSUFFICIENT TO ACHIEVE REVENUES AND PROFITABLE OPERATIONS. WE MAY NEED TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING WHICH MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE.



	 


	Our current operating funds are less than necessary to complete our intended operations. We need the proceeds from this offering to start our operations as described in the Plan of Operation section of this prospectus. As of November 30, 2016, we generated $5,000 in revenues, had $6,187 in cash and liabilities of $3,114. The proceeds of this offering may not be sufficient for us to achieve revenues and profitable operations. We need additional funds to achieve a sustainable sales level where ongoing operations can be funded out of revenues. There is no assurance that any additional financing will be available or if available, on terms that will be acceptable to us.





	We require minimum funding of approximately $42,000 to conduct our proposed operations for a period of one year. If we are not able to raise this amount, or if we experience a shortage of funds prior to funding we may utilize funds from Aleksandr Zausaev, our sole officer and director, who has informally agreed to advance funds to allow us to pay for professional fees, including fees payable in connection with the filing of this registration statement and operation expenses. However, Mr. Zausaev has no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company. After one year, we may need additional financing. If we do not generate significant revenue, we may need a minimum of $10,000 of additional funding to pay for ongoing SEC filing requirements. We do not currently have any arrangements for additional financing.

	Page
















	If we are successful in raising the funds from this offering, we plan to commence activities to continue our operations. We cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funds to continue our business plan according to our plan of operations.






	WE MAY CONTINUE TO LOSE MONEY, AND IF WE DO NOT ACHIEVE PROFITABILITY, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO CONTINUE OUR BUSINESS.






	We are company with limited operations, have incurred expenses and have losses. In addition, we expect to continue to incur significant operating expenses. As a result, we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability, which may not occur. We expect our operating expenses to increase as a result of our planned expansion. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may be unable to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. We expect to have quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in revenues, expenses, losses and cash flow, some of which could be significant. Results of operations will depend upon numerous factors, some beyond our control, including regulatory actions, market acceptance of our products and services, new products and service introductions, and competition.






	WE ARE A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY AND HAVE COMMENCED LIMITED OPERATIONS IN OUR BUSINESS. WE EXPECT TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT OPERATING LOSSES FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

	 





	We were incorporated on August 17, 2016 and to date have been involved primarily in organizational activities. We have commenced limited business operations. Accordingly, we have no way to evaluate the likelihood that our business will be successful. Potential investors should be aware of the difficulties normally encountered by new companies and the high rate of failure of such enterprises. The likelihood of success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays encountered in connection with the operations that we plan to undertake. These potential problems include, but are not limited to, unanticipated problems relating to the ability to generate sufficient cash flow to operate our business, and additional costs and expenses that may exceed current estimates. We anticipate that we will incur increased operating expenses without realizing any revenues. We expect to incur significant losses into the foreseeable future. We recognize that if the effectiveness of our business plan is not forthcoming, we will not be able to continue business operations. There is no history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that we will prove successful, and it is doubtful that we will generate any operating revenues or ever achieve profitable operations. If we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks, our business will most likely fail.








	WE HAVE LIMITED SALES AND MARKETING EXPERIENCE, WHICH INCREASES THE RISK THAT OUR BUSINESS WILL FAIL.




	 



	We have no experience in the marketing of software development business and have only nominal sales and marketing experience. Our future success will depend, among other factors, upon whether our products and services can be sold at a profitable price and the extent to which consumers acquire, adopt, and continue to use them. There can be no assurance that our business will gain wide acceptance in its targeted markets or that we will be able to effectively market our services.






	WE ARE IN A COMPETITIVE MARKET WHICH COULD IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO GAIN MARKET SHARE WHICH COULD HARM OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.





	 




	The business of niche of softwared development services is very competitive. Barriers to entry are relatively low, and we face competitive pressures from companies anxious to join this niche. There are a number of successful companies that offer similar niche services, which may prevent us from gaining enough market share to become successful.  These competitors have existing customers that may form a large part of our targeted client base, and such clients may be hesitant to switch over from already established competitors to our service.  If we cannot gain enough market share, our business and our financial performance will be adversely affected.









	6 |

	Page

















	SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS MAY BE ABLE TO USE THEIR FINANCIAL STRENGTH TO DOMINATE THE MARKET, WHICH MAY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE REVENUES.






	Some of our competitors may be much larger companies than us and very well capitalized. They could choose to use their greater resources to finance their continued participation and penetration of this market, which may impede our ability to generate sufficient revenue to cover our costs. Their better financial resources could allow them to significantly out spend us on research and development, as well as marketing and production. We might not be able to maintain our ability to compete in this circumstance.






	WE CANNOT GUARANTEE FUTURE CUSTOMERS. EVEN IF WE OBTAIN CUSTOMERS, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO GENERATE A PROFIT. IF THAT OCCURS WE WILL HAVE TO CEASE OPERATIONS.






	We have not identified any customers and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to attract future customers. Even if we obtain new customers for our service, there is no guarantee that we will make a profit. If we are unable to attract enough customers to operate profitably, we will have to suspend or cease operations.






	BECAUSE WE ARE SMALL AND DO NOT HAVE MUCH CAPITAL, OUR MARKETING CAMPAIGN MAY NOT BE ENOUGH TO ATTRACT SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS TO OPERATE PROFITABLY. IF WE DO NOT MAKE A PROFIT, WE WILL SUSPEND OR CEASE OPERATIONS.






	Due to the fact we are small and do not have much capital, we must limit our marketing activities and may not be able to make our services known to potential customers. Because we will be limiting our marketing activities, we may not be able to attract enough customers to operate profitably. If we cannot operate profitably, we may have to suspend or cease operations.






	BECAUSE OUR SOLE OFFICER AND DIRECTOR WILL OWN MORE THAN 50% OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK, HE WILL MAKE AND CONTROL CORPORATE DECISIONS THAT MAY BE DISADVANTAGEOUS TO MINORITY SHAREHOLDERS.






	Mr. Zausaev, our sole officer and director, will own more than 50% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Accordingly, he will have significant influence in determining the outcome of all corporate transactions or other matters, including the election of directors, mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, and also the power to prevent or cause a change in control. The interests of Mr. Zausaev may differ from the interests of the other stockholders and may result in corporate decisions that are disadvantageous to other shareholders.






	WE DEPEND TO A SIGNIFICANT EXTENT ON CERTAIN KEY PERSON, THE LOSS OF WHOM MAY MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COMPANY.






	Currently, we have only one employee who is also our sole officer and director. We depend entirely on Aleksandr Zausaev for all of our operations. The loss of Mr. Zausaev would have a substantial negative effect on our company and may cause our business to fail. Mr. Zausaev has not been compensated for his services since our incorporation, and it is highly unlikely that he will receive any compensation unless and until we generate substantial revenues. There is intense competition for skilled personnel and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel on acceptable terms. The loss of Mr. Zausaevs services could prevent us from completing the development of our plan of operation and our business. In the event of the loss of services of such personnel, no assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain the services of adequate replacement personnel.





	We do not have any employment agreements or maintain key person life insurance policies on our officer and director. We do not anticipate entering into employment agreements with him or acquiring key man insurance in the foreseeable future.

	Page























	OUR SOLE OFFICER AND DIRECTOR HAS NO EXPERIENCE MANAGING A PUBLIC COMPANY WHICH IS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN DISCLOSURE CONTROL AND PROCEDURES AND INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.






	We have never operated as a public company. Aleksandr Zausaev, our sole officer and director has no experience managing a public company which is required to establish and maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. As a result, we may not be able to operate successfully as a public company, even if our operations are successful. We plan to comply with all of the various rules and regulations, which are required for a public company that is reporting company with the Securities and Exchange Commission. However, if we cannot operate successfully as a public company, your investment may be materially adversely affected.






	WE ARE AN EMERGING GROWTH COMPANY UNDER THE JOBS ACT, AND WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN IF THE REDUCED DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO EMERGING GROWTH COMPANIES WILL MAKE OUR COMMON STOCK LESS ATTRACTIVE TO INVESTORS.






	We qualify as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to:





	-


	have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;


	-


	provide an auditor attestation with respect to managements report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting;


	-


	comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditors report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis);


	-


	submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes, such as say-on-pay and say-on-frequency; and


	-


	disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the Chief Executives compensation to median employee compensation.


	 


	In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.





	We will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues is $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a large accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates is $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.





	Until such time, however, we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.

	RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS OFFERING









	BECAUSE THE OFFERING PRICE HAS BEEN ARBITRARILY SET BY THE COMPANY, YOU MAY NOT REALIZE A RETURN ON YOUR INVESTMENT UPON RESALE OF YOUR SHARES.



	 


	The offering price and other terms and conditions relative to the Companys shares have been arbitrarily determined by us and do not bear any relationship to assets, earnings, book value or any other objective financial criteria. Additionally, as the Company was formed on August 17, 2016, and has only a limited operating history with no earnings, the price of the offered shares is not based on its past earnings, and no investment banker, appraiser, or other independent third party, has been consulted concerning the offering price for the shares or the fairness of the offering price used for the shares, as such our stockholders may not be able to receive a return on their investment when they sell their shares of common stock.






	WE ARE SELLING THIS OFFERING WITHOUT AN UNDERWRITER AND MAY BE UNABLE TO SELL ANY SHARES.



	 


	This offering is self-underwritten, that is, we are not going to engage the services of an underwriter to sell the shares; we intend to sell our shares through our President, who will receive no commissions. There is no guarantee that he will be able to sell any of the shares. Unless he is successful in receiving the proceeds in the amount of $100,000 from this offering, we may have to seek alternative financing to implement our business plan.






	THE REGULATION OF PENNY STOCKS BY THE SEC AND FINRA MAY DISCOURAGE THE TRADABILITY OF THE COMPANY'S SECURITIES.



	 


	The shares being offered are defined as a penny stock under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and rules of the Commission. The Exchange Act and such penny stock rules generally impose additional sales practice and disclosure requirements on broker-dealers who sell our securities to persons other than certain accredited investors who are, generally, institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 ($300,000 jointly with spouse), or in transactions not recommended by the broker-dealer. For transactions covered by the penny stock rules, a broker dealer must make certain mandated disclosures in penny stock transactions, including the actual sale or purchase price and actual bid and offer quotations, the compensation to be received by the broker-dealer and certain associated persons, and deliver certain disclosures required by the Commission. Consequently, the penny stock rules may make it difficult for you to resell any shares you may purchase, if at all.






	OUR PRESIDENT, MR. ZAUSAEV DOES NOT HAVE ANY PRIOR EXPERIENCE OFFERING AND SELLING SECURITIES , AND OUR OFFERING DOES NOT REQUIRE A MIMIMUM AMOUNT TO BE RAISED. AS A RESULT OF THIS WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RAISE ENOUGH FUNDS TO COMMENCE AND SUSTAIN OUR BUSINESS AND INVESTORS MAY LOSE THEIR ENTIRE INVESTMENT.






	Mr. Zausaev does not have any experience conducting a securities offering. Consequently, we may not be able to raise any funds successfully. Also, the best effort offering does not require a minimum amount to be raised. If we are not able to raise sufficient funds, we may not be able to fund our operations as planned, and our business will suffer and your investment may be materially adversely affected. Our inability to successfully conduct a best-effort offering could be the basis of your losing your entire investment in us.








	DUE TO THE LACK OF A TRADING MARKET FOR OUR SECURITIES, YOU MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY SELLING ANY SHARES YOU PURCHASE IN THIS OFFERING.






	We are not registered on any market or public stock exchange. There is presently no demand for our common stock and no public market exists for the shares being offered in this prospectus. We plan to contact a market maker immediately following the completion of the offering and apply to have the shares quoted on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board (OTCBB). The OTCBB is a regulated quotation service that displays real-time quotes, last sale prices and volume information in over-the-counter securities.






	9 |

	Page
















	The OTCBB is not an issuer listing service, market or exchange. Although the OTCBB does not have any listing requirements, to be eligible for quotation on the OTCBB, issuers must remain current in their filings with the SEC or applicable regulatory authority. If we are not able to pay the expenses associated with our reporting obligations we will not be able to apply for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board. Market makers are not permitted to begin quotation of a security whose issuer does not meet this filing requirement. Securities already quoted on the OTCBB that become delinquent in their required filings will be removed following a 30 to 60 day grace period if they do not make their required filing during that time. We cannot guarantee that our application will be accepted or approved and our stock listed and quoted for sale. As of the date of this filing, there have been no discussions or understandings between Zartex Inc. and anyone acting on our behalf, with any market maker regarding participation in a future trading market for our securities. If no market is ever developed for our common stock, it will be difficult for you to sell any shares you purchase in this offering. In such a case, you may find that you are unable to achieve any benefit from your investment or liquidate your shares without considerable delay, if at all. In addition, if we fail to have our common stock quoted on a public trading market, your common stock will not have a quantifiable value and it may be difficult, if not impossible, to ever resell your shares, resulting in an inability to realize any value from your investment.






	WE WILL INCUR ONGOING COSTS AND EXPENSES FOR SEC REPORTING AND COMPLIANCE. WITHOUT REVENUE WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REMAIN IN COMPLIANCE, MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR INVESTORS TO SELL THEIR SHARES, IF AT ALL.



	 


	The estimated cost of this registration statement is $8,000 which will be paid from offering proceeds. If the offering proceeds are less than registration cost, we will have to utilize funds from Aleksandr Zausaev, our sole officer and director, who has verbally agreed to loan the company funds to complete the registration process. Mr. Zausaevs verbal agreement to provide us loans for registration costs is non- binding and discretionary. After the effective date of this prospectus, we will be required to file annual, quarterly and current reports, or other information with the SEC as provided by the Securities Exchange Act. We will voluntarily continue reporting in the absence of an SEC reporting obligation. We plan to contact a market maker immediately following the close of the offering and apply to have the shares quoted on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board. To be eligible for quotation, issuers must remain current in their filings with the SEC. In order for us to remain in compliance we will require future revenues to cover the cost of these filings, which could comprise a substantial portion of our available cash resources. The costs associated with being a publicly traded company in the next 12 month will be approximately $10,000. If we are unable to generate sufficient revenues to remain in compliance it may be difficult for you to resell any shares you may purchase, if at all. Also, if we are not able to pay the expenses associated with our reporting obligations we will not be able to apply for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board.











	THE COMPANY'S INVESTORS MAY SUFFER FUTURE DILUTION DUE TO ISSUANCES OF SHARES FOR VARIOUS CONSIDERATIONS IN THE FUTURE.






	Our Articles of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of 75,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of which 5,000,000 shares are currently issued and outstanding. If we sell the 5,000,000 shares being offered in this offering, we would have 5,000,000 shares issued and outstanding. As discussed in the Dilution section below, the issuance of the shares of common stock described in this prospectus will result in substantial dilution in the percentage of our common stock held by our existing shareholders. The issuance of common stock for future services or acquisitions or other corporate actions may have the effect of diluting the value of the shares held by our investors, and might have an adverse effect on any trading market for our common stock.

	FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS



	 


	This prospectus contains forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties. We use words such as anticipate, believe, plan, expect, future, intend, and similar expressions to identify such forward-looking statements. Investors should be aware that all forward-looking statements contained within this filing are good faith estimates of management as of the date of this filing. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the risks faced by us as described in the Risk Factors section and elsewhere in this prospectus.



	 







	USE OF PROCEEDS



	 


	Our offering is being made on a self-underwritten and best-efforts basis: no minimum number of shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed. The offering price per share is $0.02. The following table sets forth the uses of proceeds assuming the sale of 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%, respectively, of the securities offered for sale by the Company.

	The above figures represent only estimated costs. The estimated cost of this registration statement is $8,000 which will be paid from offering proceeds. If the offering proceeds are less than registration costs, Aleksandr Zausaev, our president and director, has verbally agreed to loan the Company funds to complete the registration process. Mr. Zausaevs verbal agreement to provide us loans for registration costs is non- binding and discretionary. Also, these loans would be necessary if the proceeds from this offering will not be sufficient to implement our business plan and maintain reporting status and quotation on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board when and if our common stocks become eligible for trading on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. Mr. Zausaev will not be paid any compensation or anything from the proceeds of this offering. There is no due date for the repayment of the funds advanced by Mr. Zausaev. Mr. Zausaev will be repaid from revenues of operations if and when we generate revenues to pay the obligation.






	DETERMINATION OF OFFERING PRICE



	 


	The offering price of the shares has been determined arbitrarily by us. The price does not bear any relationship to our assets, book value, earnings, or other established criteria for valuing a privately held company. In determining the number of shares to be offered and the offering price, we took into consideration our cash on hand and the amount of money we would need to implement our business plan. Accordingly, the offering price should not be considered an indication of the actual value of the securities.








	DILUTION



	 


	Dilution represents the difference between the Offering price and the net tangible book value per share immediately after completion of this Offering. Net tangible book value is the amount that results from subtracting total liabilities and from total assets. Dilution arises mainly as a result of our arbitrary determination of the Offering price of the shares being offered. Dilution of the value of the shares you purchase is also a result of the lower book value of the shares held by our existing stockholder.





	The historical net tangible book value as of November 30, 2016 was $3,103 or $0,0007 per share. Historical net tangible book value per share of common stock is equal to our total tangible assets less total liabilities, divided by the number of shares of common stock outstanding as of November 30, 2016. The following table sets forth as of November 30, 2016, the number of shares of common stock purchased from us and the total consideration paid by our existing stockholders and by new investors in this offering if new investors purchase 25%, 50%, 75% or 100% of the offering, after deduction of offering expenses payable by us, assuming a purchase price in this offering of $0.02 per share of common stock.

	MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATION






	You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this prospectus. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this prospectus, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the Risk Factors section of this prospectus for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.





	We qualify as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to:


	 











	 




	




	 




	have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;
















	




	 




	provide an auditor attestation with respect to managements report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting;

















	 




	




	 




	comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditors report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis);





	 











	 




	




	 




	submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes, such as say-on-pay and say-on-frequency; and





	 











	 




	




	 




	disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEOs compensation to median employee compensation.





	 


	In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.

	We will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues is $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a large accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates is $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.


	 


	We had $6,187 in cash as of November 30, 2016. We believe our cash balance is not sufficient to fund our operations for any period of time. We have been utilizing and may utilize funds from Aleksandr Zausaev, our Chairman and President, who has informally agreed to advance funds to allow us to pay for offering costs, filing fees, and professional fees. As of November 30, 2016, Mr. Zausaev has advanced to us $3,114. Mr. Zausaev, however, has no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company. In order to implement our plan of operations for the next twelve month period, we require a minimum of $42,000 of funding from this offering. Being a development stage company, we have very limited operating history we do not currently have any arrangements for additional financing. Our principal executive offices are located at 4760 South Pecos Rd. Suite 103, Las Vegas, NV 89121. Our phone number is (775) 391-8588.





	We are a development stage company. To date, we signed two agreements and generetaed $5,000 of revenue as a result of these agreements. Our operating expenses for the three months ended November 30, 2016 were $6,733. We have sold our Match Me software on November 8, 2016 and on November 18, 2016 accordingly. Our product and service includes: "Match Me" e-catalog (software) for client's retailer stores, maintenance and technical support. There were no direct costs for software development. Our president and director, Aleksandr Zausaev, was responsible for the software developed and spent his time only for software coding, software designing and software implementation. Our full business plan entails activities described in the Plan of Operation section below. Long term financing beyond the maximum aggregate amount of this offering may be required to expand our business. The exact amount of funding will depend on the scale of our development and expansion. We do not currently have planned our expansion, and we have not decided yet on the scale of our development and expansion and on exact amount of funding needed for our long term financing. If we do not generate sufficient revenue we may need a minimum of $10,000 of additional funding at the end of the twelve month period described in our Plan of Operation below to maintain a reporting status.





	Our independent registered public accountant has issued a going concern opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills. This is because we have not generated significant revenues and no additional revenues are anticipated until we complete our initial business development. There is no assurance we will ever reach that stage.





	To meet our need for cash we are attempting to raise money from this offering. If we are unable to successfully find customers we may quickly use up the proceeds from this offering and will need to find alternative sources. At the present time, we have not made any arrangements to raise additional cash, other than through this offering.





	If we need additional cash and cannot raise it, we will either have to suspend operations until we do raise the cash, or cease operations entirely. Even if we raise $100,000 from this offering, we may need more funds for ongoing business operations after the first year, and would have to obtain additional funding.






	PLAN OF OPERATION






	We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on August 17, 2016. We have never declared bankruptcy, have never been in receivership, and have never been involved in any legal action or proceedings. Since incorporation, we have not made any significant purchase or sale of assets. We are a development stage company that has not generated sufficient revenue and just recently started our operations. If we are unable to successfully find clients who will use our service, we may quickly use up the proceeds from this offering.





	We are a company at the stage of the development but we plan to employ modern technologies to attract our customers by gaining interest to their offers through our web catalogue. To successfully complete several stages we might apply to the third parties who, we believe, perform the jobs needed in a more professional way that we could do it ourselves. We expect to be of interest to garment buyers as we do not plan to charge them. Instead, we expect to charge the retailers, who wish to be listed in the catalogue with their offers (by which we mean the range of items, the prices and special offers such as, season discounts, limited editions of clothing collections). We also plan to offer our customers to combine their offers, that users see in the web catalogue, into an automatically generated PDF catalogue (based on the users request) to be downloaded by the users for offline use.





	We intend to spend money on research and development when our business plan is complete in order to develop our business. We do not expect to purchase or sell plant or significant equipment. Further we do not expect significant changes in the number of employees.

	Our plan of operations is as follows:







	Complete Our Public Offering







	We expect to complete our public offering within 240 days after the effectiveness of our registration statement by the Securities and Exchange Commissions. We intend to concentrate our efforts on raising capital during this period. Our operations will be limited due to the limited amount of funds on hand. Upon completion of our public offering, our specific goal is to profitably sell our services. If we are unable to obtain minimum funding of approximately $42,000 (If 50% of the shares sold), our business may fail.





	Our plan of operations following the completion is as follows:














	Office Leasing






	Time Frame: 1st-12th months


	Min Costs: $2,000




	We are leasing the office at 4760 South Pecos Rd. Suite 103, Las Vegas, NV 89121 since September 8, 2016. We expect that our yearly leasing fees will be approximately $2,000.











	Office Establishing and Equipmnet




	Time Frame: 1st-3d months


	Costs: $2,000-$9,000







	As a company involved mostly in software production we do not require large office spaces. In fact, if it turns more profitable, we may rent or obtain several small offices, possibly remote from each other, because our staff can interact via the Internet. In this case each office has to be equipped accordingly to the needs of the department. In other case, the office has to be equipped as follows:


	Our basic needs are two computers (for the director and the customers support manager) connected to the Internet, a phone, a fax, printer, scanner, basic furniture, basic stationery. Our data of the web catalogue and Match Me engine are likely to be stored on a rented web server of a third party, which is less desirable as we will have limited control of the server in case of urgent maintenance. All the mentioned above we may obtain in case we sell 50% shares.


	In case we succeed in selling 75% of shares we, additionally, can obtain a server to store and to process the web catalogue data. In case, the amount of data increases we, probably, might obtain additional Hard Drive Disks for the server, or rent a third partys server, depending on what turns more efficient.


	In case we succeed in selling 100% of shares we may possess an office with space enough for all staff, including the conference room to conduct staff meetings or presentations for customers, rooms with the space for the servers, additional equipment for the servers (rails to hold hard disks, HDDs and other), order to have a chatting bot for Telegram, Viber, Whatsapp messengers which may help our client's customers stay informed about the updates of the catalogue.


	In case we sell 25% of the shares issued we plan to buy only one PC for our director. It will cost us approximately $2,000.











	Website Development




	Time Frame: 1st-12th months


	Costs: $9,000-$21,000







	As our software is build to sustain the needs of the website holding the web catalogue, our website is one of our primary investments. To be attractive for users and show better user oriented performance it has to come as a fully functional website with all our software features employed.


	In case we succeed only in selling 50% share, we, probably, design a landing page to demonstrate the features of the catalogue. The landing page will be connected to the official retailers pages which is less desirable as it may steer away the customers from our project, as Match Me feature will not be able to operate within the limitations of the landing page.


	In case we sell 75% of share we might possess a simple website with the web catalogue fully operating on, redirecting customers to the official retailers page only in case of payment by proceeding with pay on the official site button. We also plan to mount the Match Me feature on the website. This sum looks insufficient to invest into the mobile application, as the application requires cross-platform adaptation in order to show the same result on all mobile devices. As the mobile application is expected to employ the Rule of Perspective algorithm, which also requires tweaking for different devices. So, in this case we may choose to invest into a better website design with a proper user interface.


	In case we sell 100% we can come up with a fully-functional website with all the features performing without limitations, where customers can choose and order from any retailers online outlet or real outlet. It also makes investing in our mobile application possible, which means not only programming the algorithms but designing the friendly users interface as well.











	Marketing Campaign




	Time Frame: 5st-12th months


	Costs: $3,000-$28,000







	We plan to advertise our services on the world wide web, as we are the company which was established to deliver software for the purposes of online use. World web also gives the impression of a bigger advertizing space with many users who may turn our potential customers.


	We plan to begin our advertising campaign once we manage to design the website performing as planned, with at least the web catalogue feature.


	In case we sell only 50% of shares we may be able only to buy small advertising spaces for web banners on popular websites offering garment of various brands, such as Amazon, or Etsy etc.


	In order to get better publicity with at least 75% of shares sold we may be able to advertise our web catalogue via social networks by employing a content writer whose duty is to describe the competitive advantages of our website. We expect it also to attract people interested in buying garment with the help of innovation we offer, thus attracting our potential customers with their clients already attracted.


	To make larger publicity and expand into related markets, to attract customers from other industries we need to have 100% shares sold. We see this sum as sufficient to advertise duly with larger target audience reached. To carry out our advertising campaign successfully we plan to:


	- improve SEO (Search Engine Optimization) in order to be exposed in the search inquiries of different search engines, such as Google, Bing and Yandex. We expect that this optimization might result in attracting customers from across the world.


	- improve our SMM performance (Social Media Marketing) by hiring content writers and administrators for our social web pages. We plan to share the information concerning our project, the features of our web catalogue and additional services to have our customers, and broad public interested in our offers;


	- be exposed to garment industry by taking part in fashion events, or events specifically for garment retailers, where we expect to demonstrate the performance of our Match Me engine and the Match Me Box and explain the beneficial of installing this equipment in the stores, and explain the beneficial sides of our web catalogue;


	- additionally, if we find it efficient, we may spend on advertisements in printed periodicals for entrepreneurs, focusing on garment retailers. As well as, invest in video advertisements which may appear both on TV, or on the Internet.


	In case we sell 25% of the shares issued we plan to to spend approximately $3,000 for the marketing campaign.











	Employees




	Time Frame: 8st-12th months


	Costs: $7,000-$22,000







	As a software company we do not require large staff, because our main focus is to build the program and the website for it.


	In case we manage to sell 50% of shares, we expect director to manage the main workload.


	In case we manage to sell 75% of shares the director keeps the duties of programming, and a customers support manager keeps in contact with our customers, and the functions of the sales agent with the duty to find customers. In this case we might order the website users interface design from a freelancer, though freelancer are notorious for often failing to keep deadlines, or perform duly.


	In case of 100% of shares sold we expect to employ additional staff to maintain the servers and the website performance, a sales manager to search for the customers and issue contracts with them.  We would like several jobs to be performed by third parties, such as the work on designing of the website. We expect the website from a professional designing agency to give us more professional look of a reliable company. We also might employ third parties such as, photographers to take photos of the garment pieces our customers wish to display on the website, models to demonstrate clothes.

	OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS



	 


	We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.






	LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY; NEED FOR ADDITIONAL CAPITAL



	 


	There is no historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are in the start-up stage of operations and have not generated significant revenues. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases in services and products.


	We have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to continue, develop or expand our operations. Equity financing could result in additional dilution to existing shareholder.






	Results of operations








	From Inception on August 17, 2016 to August 31, 2016.







	During the period we incorporated the company, prepared a business plan. Our loss since inception is $164. We have just recently started our business operations, however, will not start significant operations until we have completed this offering.







	For the three months ended November 30, 2016.







	We have prepared our business plan and signed two software aquisitons agreements. As the result of these agreements we generated $5,000 of revenue. Our loss for the period was $1,733, total current assets was $6,217 and our liabilities was $3,114.











	LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES



	 


	As of November 30, 2016, the we had $6,187 in cash and our liabilities were $3,114, comprising $3,114 owed to Aleksandr Zausaev, our sole officer and director. The available capital reserves of the Company are not sufficient for the Company to remain operational. We require minimum funding of approximately $42,000 to conduct our proposed operations and pay all expenses for a minimum period of one year including expenses associated with this offering and maintaining a reporting status with the SEC.





	Since inception, we have sold 5,000,000 shares of common stocks to our sole officer and director, at a price of $0.001 per share, for net proceeds of $5,000.





	We are attempting to raise funds to proceed with our plan of operations. We will have to utilize funds from Aleksandr Zausaev, our sole officer and director, who has verbally agreed to loan the company funds to complete the registration process if offering proceeds are less than registration costs. However, Mr. Zausaev has no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company. Mr. Zausaevs verbal agreement to provide us loans for registration costs is non- binding and discretionary. To proceed with our operations within 12 months, we need a minimum of $42,000. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to sell all the shares required to satisfy our 12 month financial requirements. If we are successful, any money raised will be applied to the items set forth in the Use of Proceeds section of this prospectus. We will attempt to raise at least the minimum funds necessary to proceed with our plan of operations. In the long term we may need additional financing. We do not currently have any arrangements for additional financing. Obtaining additional funding will be subject to a number of factors, including general market conditions, investor acceptance of our business plan and initial results from our business operations. These factors may impact the timing, amount, terms or conditions of additional financing available to us. There is no assurance that any additional financing will be available or if available, on terms that will be acceptable to us.









	15 |

	Page
















	Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion, meaning that there is substantial doubt if we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital. No substantial revenues are anticipated until we have completed the financing from this offering and implemented our plan of operations. Our only source for cash at this time is investments by others in this offering. We must raise cash to implement our strategy and stay in business. The amount of the offering will likely allow us to operate for at least one year and have the capital resources required to cover the material costs with becoming a publicly reporting. The Company anticipates over the next 12 months the cost of being a reporting public company will be approximately $10,000.







	The Company will have to meet all the financial disclosure and reporting requirements associated with being a publicly reporting company. The Companys management will have to spend additional time on policies and procedures to make sure it is compliant with various regulatory requirements, especially that of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This additional corporate governance time required of management could limit the amount of time management has to implement is business plan and impede the speed of its operations.





	Should the Company fail to raise a minimum of $42,000 under this offering the Company would be forced to scale back or abandon the implementation of its 12-month plan of operations.












	DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS



	 


	We are a software company and deliver the services for garment distribution industry. Our main service is the IT product for garment retailers. We deliver a software product (to which we may refer as a program, a web-engine or an application), the visible part of which we plan to design in a form of a web catalogue. With many offers in the garment industry producers and retailers might experience difficulties in delivering their offer to their potential customers. Customers might feel insecure about how their actual size matches to the size of clothing displayed on the retailers or producers website. We expect that employment of our program can make it easier to advertize and sell garment items, for retailers, select and buy, for garment buyers.





	Our main customers are online and real stores involved in clothing distribution to whom we plan to sell our software and customize precisely to their needs. The users of the application who are the retailers customers are our indirect customers whom we do not charge for using the software. We deliver our software together with the buyers aligned website which holds a catalogue of various brands clothing items listed in it. For the users, our application within the website will perform only informing functions with the possibility to reserve the items chosen in the most convenient outlet, with the most reasonable price (to the users mind). Our software has programming engine which can be used many times for our customers. We sell the softfare and the service of software customization for every potential client. The software can not be used separately from software customization because of garment retailers have their individual products, prices, servisec etc. Our software is an application which can be used in our customers web-catalogs or on any supported devices. We retain the rights to use our software with to use the Match Me software and its feature in our future product offerings.





	We plan the website operating on our software to possess the following main options:


	1 - different viewing options (a gallery with big or small thumbnail photos);


	2 - an option to select clothes or put it onto a hold (which automatically reserves the same piece of clothes in the store where the user plans to receive it);


	3 - combine several orders to see how they match;


	4 - pay directly to the retailer beforehand through a payment form, or choose to pay upon receiving the order;


	5 - sort items by the brand names, prices, nearest stores.





	In order to gain our customers awareness, we come to the market with highly adaptive web engine which might be tweaked to the needs of the end user. We expect that coding a mobile application might give our software wider popularity among customers. The mobile application might be used as both a mobile version of the web catalogue and a measuring device. The mobile application will use the algorithm of the Rule of Perspective to compare clothing sizes on the store to those of the customers. Provided that a customer takes a photo of a real size object, adjusts it to fit the marked frame in the application it displays if the chosen garment can fit the customer.





	Our application users may also enable Match Me feature which we plan to deliver within the application. Match Me is expected to use the algorithm of analyzing the data provided by user in order to make lists of clothing styles (with actual items from the stores that we plan to partner up with), and the information concerning the price, the brand, the store to be on display. It is quite obvious that people stick to a clothing style due to the preferences in music (for instance, rock listeners are likely to wear leather), movies (some people might copy the styles of the favorite actors in certain films) healthstyle (people involved in yoga might prefer natural materials to synthetic ones) and other preferences. Enabling Match Me feature, a user goes through a simple multiple choice questionnaire including the questions about the preferences, actual season and mood in order to receive the possible clothing combinations.

	The engine of our web catalogue is supposed to be built in the way that it displays garment items regardless the brand awareness, which may help small brands and individual designers to make their way to general public. We expect that our program can also inspire the competition between retailers, which may result in a number of various offers for clothing buyers, thus helping us to receive awareness and to involve as many retailers in our project as possible.





	Provided that retailers show their interest in our program, we may come to a certain retailers outlet with an additional item - Match Me Box, a computerized installment. We plan to configure the Match Me Box in a similar way that Match Me feature of the application works. This Match Me Box is schemed to be installed in shopping centres for the customers, who have a certain idea (or no ideas) of of what to acquire, but feel disoriented by the overwhelming number of outlets in a store.





	Our principal office address is located at 4760 South Pecos Rd. Suite 103, Las Vegas, NV 89121. Our telephone number is (775) 391-8588. Our plan of operation is forward-looking and there is no assurance that we will ever reach profitable operations. We are a development stage company and have not earned significant revenue. It is likely that we will not be able to achieve profitability and would be forced to cease operations due to the lack of funding.





	The software we are about to market has to undergo the following process:





	1. The initial stage of general planning, in other words realizing the structure, outlining the user interface, gathering the concept of the program core to follow, estimating the amount of work to be performed and its direction. All the mentioned above are likely to be performed solely by the director who he will retain all the copyright of the software.





	2. The development stage, which involves coding of the software itself and designing the user interface. In case funds are sufficient to employ additional staff as contractors to perform coding as planned under Mr. Zausaevs supervision, we are likely to do so. The contractors will be credited for their job, but all the rights will belong to Mr. Zausaev, which we are about to mention in the contract. As for the users interface (UI) development, it is likely to be outsourced to a third-party company, in case if we have a sufficient sum to do so.  According to Mr. Zausaevs guidelines and modern trends, we expect the third party to design only the elements of the UI, such as icons, menu bars, additional bars, login screens, error screens buttons etc. We plan to issue a contract reserving us the right to use the mentioned interface for the commercial purposes, with the third partys name to be credited as the UI developer for the software owned by Mr. Zausaev.

To carry out our advertising campaign successfully we plan to:

	5,000,000 shares of common stock (direct)




	100









	(1) A beneficial owner of a security includes any person who, directly or indirectly, through any contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship, or otherwise has or shares: (i) voting power, which includes the power to vote, or to direct the voting of shares; and (ii) investment power, which includes the power to dispose or direct the disposition of shares. Certain shares may be deemed to be beneficially owned by more than one person (if, for example, persons share the power to vote or the power to dispose of the shares). In addition, shares are deemed to be beneficially owned by a person if the person has the right to acquire the shares (for example, upon exercise of an option) within 60 days of the date as of which the information is provided. In computing the percentage ownership of any person, the amount of shares outstanding is deemed to include the amount of shares beneficially owned by such person (and only such person) by reason of these acquisition rights. As of November 30, 2016, there were 5,000,000 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding.








	Future sales by existing stockholders






	A total of 5,000,000 shares of common stock were issued to our sole officer and director, all of which are restricted securities, as defined in Rule 144 of the Rules and Regulations of the SEC promulgated under the Securities Act. Under Rule 144, the shares can be publicly sold, subject to volume restrictions and restrictions on the manner of sale. Such shares can only be sold after six months provided that the issuer of the securities is, and has been for a period of at least 90 days immediately before the sale, subject to the reporting requirements of section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. Shares purchased in this offering, which will be immediately resalable, and sales of all of our other shares after applicable restrictions expire, could have a depressive effect on the market price, if any, of our common stock and the shares we are offering.





	There is no public trading market for our common stock. To be quoted on the OTCBB a market maker must file an application on our behalf to make a market for our common stock. As of the date of this Registration Statement, we have not engaged a market maker to file such an application, that there is no guarantee that a market marker will file an application on our behalf, and that even if an application is filed, there is no guarantee that we will be accepted for quotation.









	PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION



	 


	We are registering 5,000,000 shares of our common stock for sale at the price of $0.02 per share.





	This is a self-underwritten offering, and Mr. Zausaev, our sole officer and director, will sell the shares directly to family, friends, business associates and acquaintances, with no commission or other remuneration payable to him for any shares they may sell. There are no plans or arrangements to enter into any contracts or agreements to sell the shares with a broker or dealer. In offering the securities on our behalf, he will rely on the safe harbor from broker dealer registration set out in Rule 3a4-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Mr. Zausaev will not register as a broker-dealer pursuant to Section 15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, in reliance upon Rule 3a4-1, which sets forth those conditions, as noted herein, under which a person associated with an Issuer may participate in the offering of the Issuers securities and not be deemed to be a broker-dealer:






	21 |

	Page




















	1.


	Our sole officer and director is not subject to a statutory disqualification, as that term is defined in Section 3(a)(39) of the Act, at the time of his participation; and,



	2.


	Our sole officer and director will not be compensated in connection with his participation by the payment of commissions or other remuneration based either directly or indirectly on transactions in securities; and



	3.


	Our sole officer and director is not, nor will he be at the time of his participation in the offering, an associated person of a broker-dealer; and



	4.


	Our sole officer and director meets the conditions of paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of Rule 3a4-1 of the Exchange Act, in that he (A) primarily perform, or intend primarily to perform at the end of the offering, substantial duties for or on behalf of our company, other than in connection with transactions in securities; and (B) he is not a broker or dealer, or been an associated person of a broker or dealer, within the preceding twelve months; and (C) has not participated in selling and offering securities for any issuer more than once every twelve months other than in reliance on Paragraphs (a)(4)(i) or (a)(4)(iii). Under Paragraph 3a4-1(a)(4)(iii), our sole officer and director must restricts his participation to any one or more of the following activities:



	A.


	Preparing any written communication or delivering such communication through the mails or other means that does not involve oral solicitation by his of a potential purchaser; provided, however, that the content of such communication is approved by our sole officer and director;



	B.


	Responding to inquiries of a potential purchaser in a communication initiated by the potential purchaser; provided, however, that the content of such responses are limited to information contained in a registration statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933 or other offering document; or



	C.


	Performing ministerial and clerical work involved in effecting any transaction.





	Our sole officer and director does not intend to purchase any shares in this offering.





	This offering is self-underwritten, which means that it does not involve the participation of an underwriter or broker, and as a result, no broker for the sale of our securities will be used. In the event a broker-dealer is retained by us to participate in the offering, we must file a post-effective amendment to the registration statement to disclose the arrangements with the broker-dealer, and that the broker-dealer will be acting as an underwriter and will be so named in the prospectus. Additionally, FINRA must approve the terms of the underwriting compensation before the broker-dealer may participate in the offering.





	To the extent required under the Securities Act, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement will be filed disclosing the name of any broker-dealers, the number of shares of common stock involved, the price at which the common stock is to be sold, the commissions paid or discounts or concessions allowed to such broker-dealers, where applicable, that such broker-dealers did not conduct any investigation to verify the information set out or incorporated by reference in this prospectus and other facts material to the transaction.





	We are subject to applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations under it, including, without limitation, Rule 10b-5 and a distribution participant under Regulation M. All of the foregoing may affect the marketability of the common stock.All expenses of the registration statement including, but not limited to, legal, accounting, printing and mailing fees are and will be borne by us. 






	Penny Stock Regulations






	You should note that our stock is a penny stock. The SEC has adopted Rule 15g-9 which generally defines "penny stock" to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Our securities are covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and "accredited investors". The term "accredited investor" refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse.






	22 |

	Page
















	The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the SEC which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer's confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities. We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of our common stock.

	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM


	To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of


	Zartex Inc.


	We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Zartex Inc as of August 31, 2016, and the related statements of operations, stockholders deficit, and cash flows for the period from August 17, 2016 (Inception) to August 31, 2016. Zartex Incs management is responsible for these financial statements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.


	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.


	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Zartex Inc as of August 31, 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the period from August 17, 2016 (Inception) to August 31, 2016, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.


	We were not engaged to examine managements assertion about the effectiveness of Zartex Incs internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2016 included in the accompanying report and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion thereon.


	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that Zartex Inc will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, these conditions raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

	NOTES TO THE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	FOR THE PERIOD FROM INCEPTION (AUGUST 17, 2016) TO AUGUST 31, 2016










	NOTE 1  ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION



	 


	ZARTEX INC. (the Company) is a corporation established under the corporation laws in the State of Nevada on August 17, 2016.





	The company intends to commence operations in the business of software development. The company seeks to deliver services for garment distribution industry. The main service is the IT product for garment retailers.





	The Companys activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including failure to secure additional funding to properly execute the companys business plan.





	The Company has adopted August 31 fiscal year end.









	NOTE 2  GOING CONCERN






	The Companys financial statements as of August 31, 2016 been prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern. The Company has incurred a cumulative net loss from inception (August 17, 2016) to August 31, 2016 of $164. These factors among others raise substantial doubt about the ability of the company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.  





	In order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Managements plan is to obtain such resources for the Company by obtaining capital from management and significant shareholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses and seeking third party equity and/or debt financing. However, management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. These financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.






	NOTE 3  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES







	Basis of Presentation



	 


	The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.






	Development Stage Company






	The Company is a development stage company as defined in ASC 915 Development Stage Entities.. The Company is devoting substantially all of its efforts on establishing the business and its planned principal operations have not commenced.  All losses accumulated since inception have been considered as part of the Company's development stage activities.





	The Company has elected to adopt early application of Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-10, Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements.  Upon adoption, the Company no longer presents or discloses inception-to-date information and other remaining disclosure requirements of Topic 915.


	F-6






	31 |

	Page























	Use of Estimates






	Preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Actual results and outcomes may differ from managements estimates and assumptions.






	Cash and Equivalents






	The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.






	Basic and Diluted Loss Per Share






	Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period. Diluted loss per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period.  Dilutive loss per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.






	Income Taxes






	Income taxes are provided in accordance with ASC No. 740, Accounting for Income Taxes.  A deferred tax asset or liability is recorded for all temporary differences between financial and tax reporting and net operating loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax expense (benefit) results from the net change during the year of deferred tax assets and liabilities.





	Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion of all of the deferred tax assets will be realized.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.


	New Accounting Pronouncements






	New Accounting Pronouncements






	There were various accounting standards and interpretations issued recently, none of which are expected to a have a material impact on our financial position, operations or cash flows.









	NOTE 4  CAPTIAL STOCK






	The Company has 75,000,000 shares of common stock authorized with a par value of $0.001 per share.





	On September 12, 2016, the Company issued 5,000,000 shares of common stock at $0.001 per share for a proceed of $5,000






	NOTE 5  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS



	 


	In support of the Companys efforts and cash requirements, it may rely on advances from related parties until such time that the Company can support its operations or attains adequate financing through sales of its equity or traditional debt financing. There is no formal written commitment for continued support by officers, directors, or shareholders. Amounts represent advances or amounts paid in satisfaction of liabilities. The advances are considered temporary in nature and have not been formalized by a promissory note.  





	Since August 17, 2016 (Inception) through August 31, 2016, the Companys sole officer and director loaned the Company $164 to pay for incorporation costs and operating expenses.  As of August 31, 2016, the amount outstanding was $164. The loan is non-interest bearing, due upon demand and unsecured.


	 



	NOTE 6  INCOME TAX






	As of August 31, 2016 the Company had net operating loss carry forwards of $164 that may be available to reduce future years taxable income through 2036. Future tax benefits which may arise as a result of these losses have not been recognized in these financial statements, as their realization is determined not likely to occur and accordingly, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset relating to these tax loss carry-forwards.






	NOTE 7 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS






	On September 12, 2016, the Company issued 5,000,000 shares of common stock at $0.001 per share for a proceed of $5,000

	ZARTEX INC.




	(A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY)




	NOTES TO THE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	FOR THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2016










	NOTE 1  ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION



	 


	ZARTEX INC. (the Company) is a corporation established under the corporation laws in the State of Nevada on August 17, 2016.





	The company commences operations in the business of software development. The company seeks to deliver services for garment distribution industry. The main service is the IT product for garment retailers.





	The Companys activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including failure to secure additional funding to properly execute the companys business plan.





	The Company has adopted August 31 fiscal year end.









	NOTE 2  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES







	Basis of Presentation



	 


	The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.





	Interim Financial Information


	 


	The unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) applicable to interim financial information and the requirements of Form 10-Q and Rule 8-03 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and disclosure required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete financial statements. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and the results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods have been included.


	 


	These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements as of and for the year ended August 31, 2016, as not all disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles for annual financial statements are presented. The interim financial statements follow the same accounting policies and methods of computations as the audited financial statements as of and for the year ended August 31, 2016.






	Development Stage Company






	The Company is a development stage company as defined in ASC 915 Development Stage Entities.. The Company is devoting substantially all of its efforts on establishing the business and its planned principal operations have not commenced.  All losses accumulated since inception have been considered as part of the Company's development stage activities.





	The Company has elected to adopt application of Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-10, Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements.  Upon adoption, the Company no longer presents or discloses inception-to-date information and other remaining disclosure requirements of Topic 915.

	Use of Estimates





	Preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Actual results and outcomes may differ from managements estimates and assumptions.






	Cash and Equivalents






	The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.






	Basic and Diluted Loss Per Share






	Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period. Diluted loss per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period.  Dilutive loss per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.






	Revenue Recognition






	The Company follows the guidance of the Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 605, "Revenue Recognition." It records revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the selling price to the customer is fixed or determinable and collectability of the revenue is reasonably assured.






	Income Taxes






	Income taxes are provided in accordance with ASC No. 740, Accounting for Income Taxes.  A deferred tax asset or liability is recorded for all temporary differences between financial and tax reporting and net operating loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax expense (benefit) results from the net change during the year of deferred tax assets and liabilities.





	Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion of all of the deferred tax assets will be realized.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.


	New Accounting Pronouncements






	New Accounting Pronouncements






	There were various accounting standards and interpretations issued recently, none of which are expected to a have a material impact on our financial position, operations or cash flows.






	NOTE 3  GOING CONCERN






	The Companys financial statements as of November 30, 2016, been prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.





	The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues and cash flows sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern. The Company has accumulated net loss of $1,897 since inception and incurred net loss of $1,733 for the three months ended November 30, 2016. These factors among others raise substantial doubt about the ability of the company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.





	In order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management s plan is to obtain such resources for the Company by obtaining capital from management and significant shareholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses and seeking third party equity and/or debt financing. However, management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. These financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

	NOTE 4  CAPTIAL STOCK






	The Company has 75,000,000 shares of common stock authorized with a par value of $0.001 per share.





	On September 12, 2016, the Company issued 5,000,000 shares of common stock at $0.001 per share for a proceed of $5,000






	NOTE 5  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS



	 


	In support of the Companys efforts and cash requirements, it may rely on advances from related parties until such time that the Company can support its operations or attains adequate financing through sales of its equity or traditional debt financing. There is no formal written commitment for continued support by officers, directors, or shareholders. Amounts represent advances or amounts paid in satisfaction of liabilities. The advances are considered temporary in nature and have not been formalized by a promissory note.  





	Since August 17, 2016 (Inception) through November 30, 2016 the Companys sole officer and director loaned the Company $3,114 to pay for incorporation costs and operating expenses.  As of November 30, 2016, the amount outstanding was $3,114. The loan is non-interest bearing, due upon demand and unsecured.


	 



	NOTE 6  INCOME TAX






	As of November 30, 2016, the Company had net operating loss carry forwards of $1,897 that may be available to reduce future years taxable income through 2036. Future tax benefits which may arise as a result of these losses have not been recognized in these financial statements, as their realization is determined not likely to occur and accordingly, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset relating to these tax loss carry-forwards.






	NOTE 7  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES






	The Company has executed a lease agreement for its office space for $99 per month with a month-to-month term lease, terminable upon thirty days written notice.

	5,000,000 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK




	$0.02 PER SHARE






	This is the initial offering of common stock of Zartex Inc. and no public market currently exists for the securities being offered. We are registering for sale a total of 5,000,000 shares of common stock at a fixed price of $0.02 per share to the general public in best efforts offering. We estimate our total offering registration costs to be approximately $8,000. There is no minimum number of shares that must be sold by us for the offering to proceed, and we will retain the proceeds from the sale of any of the offered shares. The offering is being conducted on a self-underwritten, best efforts basis, which means our President, Aleksandr Zausaev, will attempt to sell the shares. We are making this offering without the involvement of underwriters or broker-dealers.





	This Prospectus will permit our President to sell the shares directly to the public, with no commission or other remuneration payable to him for any shares he may sell. Mr. Zausaev will sell all the shares registered herein. In offering the securities on our behalf, he will rely on the safe harbor from broker-dealer registration set out in Rule 3a4-1 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. The shares will be offered at a fixed price of $0.02 per share for a period of two hundred and forty (240) days from the effective date of this prospectus.

Our common stock is not traded on any exchange or on the over-the-counter market. After the effective date of the registration statement relating to this prospectus, we hope to have a market maker file an application with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) for our common stock to be eligible for trading on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. To be eligible for quotation, issuers must remain current in their quarterly and annual filings with the SEC. If we are not able to pay the expenses associated with our reporting obligations we will not be able to apply for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board. We do not yet have a market maker who has agreed to file such application. There can be no assurance that our common stock will ever be quoted on a stock exchange or a quotation service or that any market for our stock will develop.

	PROSPECTUS SUMMARY



	 



	AS USED IN THIS PROSPECTUS, UNLESS THE CONTEXT OTHERWISE REQUIRES, WE, US, OUR, AND ZARTEX INC. REFERS TO ZARTEX INC. THE FOLLOWING SUMMARY DOES NOT CONTAIN ALL OF THE INFORMATION THAT MAY BE IMPORTANT TO YOU. YOU SHOULD READ THE ENTIRE PROSPECTUS BEFORE MAKING AN INVESTMENT DECISION TO PURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK.



	 



	ZARTEX INC.



	 


	Zartex Inc. was incorporated in Nevada on August 17, 2016. We are development stage company and intend to commence operations in the business of software development. We are a software company that seeks to deliver services for garment distribution industry. Our main service is the IT product for garment retailers. We plan to deliver a software product (to which we may refer as a program, a web-engine or an application), the visible part of which we plan to design in a form of a web catalogue. With many offers in the garment industry producers and retailers might experience difficulties in delivering their offer to their potential customers. Customers might feel insecure about how their actual size matches to the size of clothing displayed on the retailers or producers website. We expect that employment of our program can make it easier to advertize and sell garment items, for retailers, select and buy, for garment buyers.





	We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to develop our business operations (See Description of Business and Use of Proceeds). To implement our plan of operations we require a minimum of $42,000 for the next twelve months as described in our Plan of Operations. There is no assurance that we will generate any revenue in the first 12 months after completion our offering or ever generate any revenue.





	Being a development stage company, we have very limited operating history. If we do not generate any revenue we may need a minimum of $10,000 of additional funding to pay for ongoing SEC filing requirements. We do not currently have any arrangements for additional financing. Our principal executive offices are located at 4760 South Pecos Rd. Suite 103, Las Vegas, NV 89121. Our phone number is (775) 391-8588.



	From inception (August 17, 2016) until the date of this filing, we have had limited operating activities. Our financial statements from inception (August 17, 2016) through August 31, 2016, reports no revenue and a net loss of $164. Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit opinion for Zartex Inc., which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. To date, we have developed our business plan and developed business-model of our company.





	As of the date of this prospectus, there is no public trading market for our common stock and no assurance that a trading market for our securities will ever develop.





	Proceeds from this offering are required for us to proceed with your business plan over the next twelve months. We require minimum funding of approximately $42,000 to conduct our proposed operations and pay all expenses for a minimum period of one year including expenses associated with this offering and maintaining a reporting status with the SEC. If we are unable to obtain minimum funding of approximately $42,000, our business may fail. Since we are presently in the development stage of our business, we can provide no assurance that we will successfully sell any products or services related to our planned activities.

	AN INVESTMENT IN OUR COMMON STOCK INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK. YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE RISKS DESCRIBED BELOW AND THE OTHER INFORMATION IN THIS PROSPECTUS BEFORE INVESTING IN OUR COMMON STOCK. IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS OCCUR, OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE SERIOUSLY HARMED. THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK, WHEN AND IF WE TRADE AT A LATER DATE, COULD DECLINE DUE TO ANY OF THESE RISKS, AND YOU MAY LOSE ALL OR PART OF YOUR INVESTMENT.









	RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS









	BECAUSE OUR AUDITORS HAVE RAISED A GOING CONCERN, THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL UNCERTAINTY THAT WE WILL CONTINUE OPERATIONS IN WHICH CASE YOU COULD LOSE YOUR INVESTMENT.






	Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the uncertainty about our ability to continue in business. As such we may have to cease operations and you could lose your investment.






	WE ARE SOLELY DEPENDENT UPON THE FUNDS TO BE RAISED IN THIS OFFERING TO START OUR BUSINESS, THE PROCEEDS OF WHICH MAY BE INSUFFICIENT TO ACHIEVE REVENUES AND PROFITABLE OPERATIONS. WE MAY NEED TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING WHICH MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE.



	 


	Our current operating funds are less than necessary to complete our intended operations. We need the proceeds from this offering to start our operations as described in the Plan of Operation section of this prospectus. As of October 13, 2016, we had $1,232 in cash and liabilities of $164. As of this date, we have no income and just recently started our operation. The proceeds of this offering may not be sufficient for us to achieve revenues and profitable operations. We need additional funds to achieve a sustainable sales level where ongoing operations can be funded out of revenues. There is no assurance that any additional financing will be available or if available, on terms that will be acceptable to us.





	We require minimum funding of approximately $42,000 to conduct our proposed operations for a period of one year. If we are not able to raise this amount, or if we experience a shortage of funds prior to funding we may utilize funds from Aleksandr Zausaev, our sole officer and director, who has informally agreed to advance funds to allow us to pay for professional fees, including fees payable in connection with the filing of this registration statement and operation expenses. However, Mr. Zausaev has no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company. After one year we may need additional financing. If we do not generate any revenue we may need a minimum of $10,000 of additional funding to pay for ongoing SEC filing requirements. We do not currently have any arrangements for additional financing.

	If we are successful in raising the funds from this offering, we plan to commence activities to continue our operations. We cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funds to continue our business plan according to our plan of operations.






	WE MAY CONTINUE TO LOSE MONEY, AND IF WE DO NOT ACHIEVE PROFITABILITY, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO CONTINUE OUR BUSINESS.






	We are company with limited operations, have incurred expenses and have losses. In addition, we expect to continue to incur significant operating expenses. As a result, we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability, which may not occur. We expect our operating expenses to increase as a result of our planned expansion. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may be unable to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. We expect to have quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in revenues, expenses, losses and cash flow, some of which could be significant. Results of operations will depend upon numerous factors, some beyond our control, including regulatory actions, market acceptance of our products and services, new products and service introductions, and competition.






	WE ARE A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY AND HAVE COMMENCED LIMITED OPERATIONS IN OUR BUSINESS. WE EXPECT TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT OPERATING LOSSES FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

	 





	We were incorporated on August 17, 2016 and to date have been involved primarily in organizational activities. We have commenced limited business operations. Accordingly, we have no way to evaluate the likelihood that our business will be successful. Potential investors should be aware of the difficulties normally encountered by new companies and the high rate of failure of such enterprises. The likelihood of success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays encountered in connection with the operations that we plan to undertake. These potential problems include, but are not limited to, unanticipated problems relating to the ability to generate sufficient cash flow to operate our business, and additional costs and expenses that may exceed current estimates. We anticipate that we will incur increased operating expenses without realizing any revenues. We expect to incur significant losses into the foreseeable future. We recognize that if the effectiveness of our business plan is not forthcoming, we will not be able to continue business operations. There is no history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that we will prove successful, and it is doubtful that we will generate any operating revenues or ever achieve profitable operations. If we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks, our business will most likely fail.








	WE HAVE LIMITED SALES AND MARKETING EXPERIENCE, WHICH INCREASES THE RISK THAT OUR BUSINESS WILL FAIL.




	 



	We have no experience in the marketing of software development business and have only nominal sales and marketing experience. Our future success will depend, among other factors, upon whether our products and services can be sold at a profitable price and the extent to which consumers acquire, adopt, and continue to use them. There can be no assurance that our business will gain wide acceptance in its targeted markets or that we will be able to effectively market our services.






	WE ARE IN A COMPETITIVE MARKET WHICH COULD IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO GAIN MARKET SHARE WHICH COULD HARM OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.





	 




	The business of niche of softwared development services is very competitive. Barriers to entry are relatively low, and we face competitive pressures from companies anxious to join this niche. There are a number of successful companies that offer similar niche services, which may prevent us from gaining enough market share to become successful.  These competitors have existing customers that may form a large part of our targeted client base, and such clients may be hesitant to switch over from already established competitors to our service.  If we cannot gain enough market share, our business and our financial performance will be adversely affected.

	Page

















	SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS MAY BE ABLE TO USE THEIR FINANCIAL STRENGTH TO DOMINATE THE MARKET, WHICH MAY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE REVENUES.






	Some of our competitors may be much larger companies than us and very well capitalized. They could choose to use their greater resources to finance their continued participation and penetration of this market, which may impede our ability to generate sufficient revenue to cover our costs. Their better financial resources could allow them to significantly out spend us on research and development, as well as marketing and production. We might not be able to maintain our ability to compete in this circumstance.






	WE CANNOT GUARANTEE FUTURE CUSTOMERS. EVEN IF WE OBTAIN CUSTOMERS, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO GENERATE A PROFIT. IF THAT OCCURS WE WILL HAVE TO CEASE OPERATIONS.






	We have not identified any customers and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to attract future customers. Even if we obtain new customers for our service, there is no guarantee that we will make a profit. If we are unable to attract enough customers to operate profitably, we will have to suspend or cease operations.






	BECAUSE WE ARE SMALL AND DO NOT HAVE MUCH CAPITAL, OUR MARKETING CAMPAIGN MAY NOT BE ENOUGH TO ATTRACT SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS TO OPERATE PROFITABLY. IF WE DO NOT MAKE A PROFIT, WE WILL SUSPEND OR CEASE OPERATIONS.






	Due to the fact we are small and do not have much capital, we must limit our marketing activities and may not be able to make our services known to potential customers. Because we will be limiting our marketing activities, we may not be able to attract enough customers to operate profitably. If we cannot operate profitably, we may have to suspend or cease operations.






	BECAUSE OUR SOLE OFFICER AND DIRECTOR WILL OWN MORE THAN 50% OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK, HE WILL MAKE AND CONTROL CORPORATE DECISIONS THAT MAY BE DISADVANTAGEOUS TO MINORITY SHAREHOLDERS.






	Mr. Zausaev, our sole officer and director, will own more than 50% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Accordingly, he will have significant influence in determining the outcome of all corporate transactions or other matters, including the election of directors, mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, and also the power to prevent or cause a change in control. The interests of Mr. Zausaev may differ from the interests of the other stockholders and may result in corporate decisions that are disadvantageous to other shareholders.






	WE DEPEND TO A SIGNIFICANT EXTENT ON CERTAIN KEY PERSON, THE LOSS OF WHOM MAY MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COMPANY.






	Currently, we have only one employee who is also our sole officer and director. We depend entirely on Aleksandr Zausaev for all of our operations. The loss of Mr. Zausaev would have a substantial negative effect on our company and may cause our business to fail. Mr. Zausaev has not been compensated for his services since our incorporation, and it is highly unlikely that he will receive any compensation unless and until we generate substantial revenues. There is intense competition for skilled personnel and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel on acceptable terms. The loss of Mr. Zausaevs services could prevent us from completing the development of our plan of operation and our business. In the event of the loss of services of such personnel, no assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain the services of adequate replacement personnel.





	We do not have any employment agreements or maintain key person life insurance policies on our officer and director. We do not anticipate entering into employment agreements with him or acquiring key man insurance in the foreseeable future.

	Page

















	BECAUSE OUR SOLE OFFICER AND DIRECTOR WILL ONLY BE DEVOTING LIMITED TIME TO OUR OPERATIONS, OUR OPERATIONS MAY BE SPORADIC WHICH MAY RESULT IN PERIODIC INTERRUPTIONS OR SUSPENSIONS OF OPERATIONS. THIS ACTIVITY COULD PREVENT US FROM ATTRACTING ENOUGH CUSTOMERS AND RESULT IN A LACK OF REVENUES WHICH MAY CAUSE US TO CEASE OPERATIONS.






	Aleksandr Zausaev, our sole officer and director will only be devoting limited time to our operations. He will be devoting approximately 20 hours a week to our operations. Because our sole office and director will only be devoting limited time to our operations, our operations may be sporadic and occur at times which are convenient to him. As a result, operations may be periodically interrupted or suspended which could result in a lack of revenues and a possible cessation of operations.






	OUR SOLE OFFICER AND DIRECTOR HAS NO EXPERIENCE MANAGING A PUBLIC COMPANY WHICH IS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN DISCLOSURE CONTROL AND PROCEDURES AND INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.






	We have never operated as a public company. Aleksandr Zausaev, our sole officer and director has no experience managing a public company which is required to establish and maintain disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. As a result, we may not be able to operate successfully as a public company, even if our operations are successful. We plan to comply with all of the various rules and regulations, which are required for a public company that is reporting company with the Securities and Exchange Commission. However, if we cannot operate successfully as a public company, your investment may be materially adversely affected.






	WE ARE AN EMERGING GROWTH COMPANY UNDER THE JOBS ACT, AND WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN IF THE REDUCED DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS APPLICABLE TO EMERGING GROWTH COMPANIES WILL MAKE OUR COMMON STOCK LESS ATTRACTIVE TO INVESTORS.






	We qualify as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to:





	-


	have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;


	-


	provide an auditor attestation with respect to managements report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting;


	-


	comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditors report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis);


	-


	submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes, such as say-on-pay and say-on-frequency; and


	-


	disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the Chief Executives compensation to median employee compensation.


	 


	In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.





	We will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues is $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a large accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates is $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.





	Until such time, however, we cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.

	RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS OFFERING









	BECAUSE THE OFFERING PRICE HAS BEEN ARBITRARILY SET BY THE COMPANY, YOU MAY NOT REALIZE A RETURN ON YOUR INVESTMENT UPON RESALE OF YOUR SHARES.



	 


	The offering price and other terms and conditions relative to the Companys shares have been arbitrarily determined by us and do not bear any relationship to assets, earnings, book value or any other objective financial criteria. Additionally, as the Company was formed on August 17, 2016, and has only a limited operating history with no earnings, the price of the offered shares is not based on its past earnings, and no investment banker, appraiser, or other independent third party, has been consulted concerning the offering price for the shares or the fairness of the offering price used for the shares, as such our stockholders may not be able to receive a return on their investment when they sell their shares of common stock.






	WE ARE SELLING THIS OFFERING WITHOUT AN UNDERWRITER AND MAY BE UNABLE TO SELL ANY SHARES.



	 


	This offering is self-underwritten, that is, we are not going to engage the services of an underwriter to sell the shares; we intend to sell our shares through our President, who will receive no commissions. There is no guarantee that he will be able to sell any of the shares. Unless he is successful in receiving the proceeds in the amount of $100,000 from this offering, we may have to seek alternative financing to implement our business plan.






	THE REGULATION OF PENNY STOCKS BY THE SEC AND FINRA MAY DISCOURAGE THE TRADABILITY OF THE COMPANY'S SECURITIES.



	 


	The shares being offered are defined as a penny stock under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and rules of the Commission. The Exchange Act and such penny stock rules generally impose additional sales practice and disclosure requirements on broker-dealers who sell our securities to persons other than certain accredited investors who are, generally, institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 ($300,000 jointly with spouse), or in transactions not recommended by the broker-dealer. For transactions covered by the penny stock rules, a broker dealer must make certain mandated disclosures in penny stock transactions, including the actual sale or purchase price and actual bid and offer quotations, the compensation to be received by the broker-dealer and certain associated persons, and deliver certain disclosures required by the Commission. Consequently, the penny stock rules may make it difficult for you to resell any shares you may purchase, if at all.






	OUR PRESIDENT, MR. ZAUSAEV DOES NOT HAVE ANY PRIOR EXPERIENCE OFFERING AND SELLING SECURITIES , AND OUR OFFERING DOES NOT REQUIRE A MIMIMUM AMOUNT TO BE RAISED. AS A RESULT OF THIS WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RAISE ENOUGH FUNDS TO COMMENCE AND SUSTAIN OUR BUSINESS AND INVESTORS MAY LOSE THEIR ENTIRE INVESTMENT.






	Mr. Zausaev does not have any experience conducting a securities offering. Consequently, we may not be able to raise any funds successfully. Also, the best effort offering does not require a minimum amount to be raised. If we are not able to raise sufficient funds, we may not be able to fund our operations as planned, and our business will suffer and your investment may be materially adversely affected. Our inability to successfully conduct a best-effort offering could be the basis of your losing your entire investment in us.








	DUE TO THE LACK OF A TRADING MARKET FOR OUR SECURITIES, YOU MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY SELLING ANY SHARES YOU PURCHASE IN THIS OFFERING.






	We are not registered on any market or public stock exchange. There is presently no demand for our common stock and no public market exists for the shares being offered in this prospectus. We plan to contact a market maker immediately following the completion of the offering and apply to have the shares quoted on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board (OTCBB). The OTCBB is a regulated quotation service that displays real-time quotes, last sale prices and volume information in over-the-counter securities.






	11 |

	Page
















	The OTCBB is not an issuer listing service, market or exchange. Although the OTCBB does not have any listing requirements, to be eligible for quotation on the OTCBB, issuers must remain current in their filings with the SEC or applicable regulatory authority. If we are not able to pay the expenses associated with our reporting obligations we will not be able to apply for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board. Market makers are not permitted to begin quotation of a security whose issuer does not meet this filing requirement. Securities already quoted on the OTCBB that become delinquent in their required filings will be removed following a 30 to 60 day grace period if they do not make their required filing during that time. We cannot guarantee that our application will be accepted or approved and our stock listed and quoted for sale. As of the date of this filing, there have been no discussions or understandings between Zartex Inc. and anyone acting on our behalf, with any market maker regarding participation in a future trading market for our securities. If no market is ever developed for our common stock, it will be difficult for you to sell any shares you purchase in this offering. In such a case, you may find that you are unable to achieve any benefit from your investment or liquidate your shares without considerable delay, if at all. In addition, if we fail to have our common stock quoted on a public trading market, your common stock will not have a quantifiable value and it may be difficult, if not impossible, to ever resell your shares, resulting in an inability to realize any value from your investment.






	WE WILL INCUR ONGOING COSTS AND EXPENSES FOR SEC REPORTING AND COMPLIANCE. WITHOUT REVENUE WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REMAIN IN COMPLIANCE, MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR INVESTORS TO SELL THEIR SHARES, IF AT ALL.



	 


	The estimated cost of this registration statement is $8,000 which will be paid from offering proceeds. If the offering proceeds are less than registration cost, we will have to utilize funds from Aleksandr Zausaev, our sole officer and director, who has verbally agreed to loan the company funds to complete the registration process. Mr. Zausaevs verbal agreement to provide us loans for registration costs is non- binding and discretionary. After the effective date of this prospectus, we will be required to file annual, quarterly and current reports, or other information with the SEC as provided by the Securities Exchange Act. We will voluntarily continue reporting in the absence of an SEC reporting obligation. We plan to contact a market maker immediately following the close of the offering and apply to have the shares quoted on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board. To be eligible for quotation, issuers must remain current in their filings with the SEC. In order for us to remain in compliance we will require future revenues to cover the cost of these filings, which could comprise a substantial portion of our available cash resources. The costs associated with being a publicly traded company in the next 12 month will be approximately $10,000. If we are unable to generate sufficient revenues to remain in compliance it may be difficult for you to resell any shares you may purchase, if at all. Also, if we are not able to pay the expenses associated with our reporting obligations we will not be able to apply for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board.











	THE COMPANY'S INVESTORS MAY SUFFER FUTURE DILUTION DUE TO ISSUANCES OF SHARES FOR VARIOUS CONSIDERATIONS IN THE FUTURE.






	Our Articles of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of 75,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of which 5,000,000 shares are currently issued and outstanding. If we sell the 5,000,000 shares being offered in this offering, we would have 5,000,000 shares issued and outstanding. As discussed in the Dilution section below, the issuance of the shares of common stock described in this prospectus will result in substantial dilution in the percentage of our common stock held by our existing shareholders. The issuance of common stock for future services or acquisitions or other corporate actions may have the effect of diluting the value of the shares held by our investors, and might have an adverse effect on any trading market for our common stock.

	FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS



	 


	This prospectus contains forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties. We use words such as anticipate, believe, plan, expect, future, intend, and similar expressions to identify such forward-looking statements. Investors should be aware that all forward-looking statements contained within this filing are good faith estimates of management as of the date of this filing. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the risks faced by us as described in the Risk Factors section and elsewhere in this prospectus.



	 







	USE OF PROCEEDS



	 


	Our offering is being made on a self-underwritten and best-efforts basis: no minimum number of shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed. The offering price per share is $0.02. The following table sets forth the uses of proceeds assuming the sale of 50%, 75% and 100%, respectively, of the securities offered for sale by the Company. There is no assurance that we will raise the full $100,000 as anticipated and there is no guarantee that we will receive any proceeds from the offering.

	The above figures represent only estimated costs. The estimated cost of this registration statement is $8,000 which will be paid from offering proceeds. If the offering proceeds are less than registration costs, Aleksandr Zausaev, our president and director, has verbally agreed to loan the Company funds to complete the registration process. Mr. Zausaevs verbal agreement to provide us loans for registration costs is non- binding and discretionary. Also, these loans would be necessary if the proceeds from this offering will not be sufficient to implement our business plan and maintain reporting status and quotation on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board when and if our common stocks become eligible for trading on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. Mr. Zausaev will not be paid any compensation or anything from the proceeds of this offering. There is no due date for the repayment of the funds advanced by Mr. Zausaev. Mr. Zausaev will be repaid from revenues of operations if and when we generate revenues to pay the obligation.






	DETERMINATION OF OFFERING PRICE



	 


	The offering price of the shares has been determined arbitrarily by us. The price does not bear any relationship to our assets, book value, earnings, or other established criteria for valuing a privately held company. In determining the number of shares to be offered and the offering price, we took into consideration our cash on hand and the amount of money we would need to implement our business plan. Accordingly, the offering price should not be considered an indication of the actual value of the securities.








	DILUTION



	 


	Dilution represents the difference between the Offering price and the net tangible book value per share immediately after completion of this Offering. Net tangible book value is the amount that results from subtracting total liabilities and from total assets. Dilution arises mainly as a result of our arbitrary determination of the Offering price of the shares being offered. Dilution of the value of the shares you purchase is also a result of the lower book value of the shares held by our existing stockholder.





	The historical net tangible book value as of August 31, 2016 was negative $164 or $0 per share. Historical net tangible book value per share of common stock is equal to our total tangible assets less total liabilities, divided by the number of shares of common stock outstanding as of October 13, 2016. The following table sets forth as of August 31, 2016, the number of shares of common stock purchased from us and the total consideration paid by our existing stockholders and by new investors in this offering if new investors purchase 50%, 75% or 100% of the offering, after deduction of offering expenses payable by us, assuming a purchase price in this offering of $0.02 per share of common stock.

	MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATION






	You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this prospectus.

	In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.

	We will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues is $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a large accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates is $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.


	 


	We had $1,232 in cash as of October 13, 2016. We believe our cash balance is not sufficient to fund our operations for any period of time. We have been utilizing and may utilize funds from Aleksandr Zausaev, our Chairman and President, who has informally agreed to advance funds to allow us to pay for offering costs, filing fees, and professional fees. As of August 31, 2016, Mr. Zausaev has advanced to us $164. Mr. Zausaev, however, has no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company. In order to implement our plan of operations for the next twelve month period, we require a minimum of $42,000 of funding from this offering. Being a development stage company, we have very limited operating history we do not currently have any arrangements for additional financing. Our principal executive offices are located at 4760 South Pecos Rd. Suite 103, Las Vegas, NV 89121. Our phone number is (775) 391-8588.





	We are a development stage company and we have generated no revenue to date. Our full business plan entails activities described in the Plan of Operation section below. Long term financing beyond the maximum aggregate amount of this offering may be required to expand our business. The exact amount of funding will depend on the scale of our development and expansion. We do not currently have planned our expansion, and we have not decided yet on the scale of our development and expansion and on exact amount of funding needed for our long term financing. If we do not generate any revenue we may need a minimum of $10,000 of additional funding at the end of the twelve month period described in our Plan of Operation below to maintain a reporting status.





	Our independent registered public accountant has issued a going concern opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills. This is because we have not generated revenues and no revenues are anticipated until we complete our initial business development. There is no assurance we will ever reach that stage.





	To meet our need for cash we are attempting to raise money from this offering. If we are unable to successfully find customers we may quickly use up the proceeds from this offering and will need to find alternative sources. At the present time, we have not made any arrangements to raise additional cash, other than through this offering.





	If we need additional cash and cannot raise it, we will either have to suspend operations until we do raise the cash, or cease operations entirely. Even if we raise $100,000 from this offering, we may need more funds for ongoing business operations after the first year, and would have to obtain additional funding.






	PLAN OF OPERATION






	We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on August 17, 2016. We have never declared bankruptcy, have never been in receivership, and have never been involved in any legal action or proceedings. Since incorporation, we have not made any significant purchase or sale of assets. We are a development stage company that has not generated any revenue and just recently started our operations. If we are unable to successfully find clients who will use our service, we may quickly use up the proceeds from this offering.





	We are a company at the stage of the development but we plan to employ modern technologies to attract our customers by gaining interest to their offers through our web catalogue. To successfully complete several stages we might apply to the third parties who, we believe, perform the jobs needed in a more professional way that we could do it ourselves. We expect to be of interest to garment buyers as we do not plan to charge them. Instead, we expect to charge the retailers, who wish to be listed in the catalogue with their offers (by which we mean the range of items, the prices and special offers such as, season discounts, limited editions of clothing collections). We also plan to offer our customers to combine their offers, that users see in the web catalogue, into an automatically generated PDF catalogue (based on the users request) to be downloaded by the users for offline use.





	We intend to spend money on research and development when our business plan is complete in order to develop our business. We do not expect to purchase or sell plant or significant equipment. Further we do not expect significant changes in the number of employees.

	Our plan of operations is as follows:







	Complete Our Public Offering







	We expect to complete our public offering within 240 days after the effectiveness of our registration statement by the Securities and Exchange Commissions. We intend to concentrate our efforts on raising capital during this period. Our operations will be limited due to the limited amount of funds on hand. Upon completion of our public offering, our specific goal is to profitably sell our services. If we are unable to obtain minimum funding of approximately $42,000 (If 50% of the shares sold), our business may fail.





	Our plan of operations following the completion is as follows:














	Office Leasing




	Time Frame: 1st-12th months




	Min Costs: $2,000




	We are leasing the office at 4760 South Pecos Rd. Suite 103, Las Vegas, NV 89121 since September 8, 2016. Our yearly leasing fees are approximately $2,000.











	Office Establishing and Equipmnet




	Time Frame: 1st-3d months


	Costs: $4,000-$9,000







	As a company involved mostly in software production we do not require large office spaces. In fact, if it turns more profitable, we may rent or obtain several small offices, possibly remote from each other, because our staff can interact via the Internet. In this case each office has to be equipped accordingly to the needs of the department. In other case, the office has to be equipped as follows:


	Our basic needs are two computers (for the director and the customers support manager) connected to the Internet, a phone, a fax, printer, scanner, basic furniture, basic stationery. Our data of the web catalogue and Match Me engine are likely to be stored on a rented web server of a third party, which is less desirable as we will have limited control of the server in case of urgent maintenance. All the mentioned above we may obtain in case we sell 50% shares.


	In case we succeed in selling 75% of shares we, additionally, can obtain a server to store and to process the web catalogue data. In case, the amount of data increases we, probably, might obtain additional Hard Drive Disks for the server, or rent a third partys server, depending on what turns more efficient.


	In case we succeed in selling 100% of shares we may possess an office with space enough for all staff, including the conference room to conduct staff meetings or presentations for customers, rooms with the space for the servers, additional equipment for the servers (rails to hold hard disks, HDDs and other), order to have a chatting bot for Telegram, Viber, Whatsapp messengers which may help our client's customers stay informed about the updates of the catalogue.











	Website Development




	Time Frame: 1st-12th months


	Costs: $9,000-$21,000







	As our software is build to sustain the needs of the website holding the web catalogue, our website is one of our primary investments. To be attractive for users and show better user oriented performance it has to come as a fully functional website with all our software features employed.


	In case we succeed only in selling 50% share, we, probably, design a landing page to demonstrate the features of the catalogue. The landing page will be connected to the official retailers pages which is less desirable as it may steer away the customers from our project, as Match Me feature will not be able to operate within the limitations of the landing page.


	In case we sell 75% of share we might possess a simple website with the web catalogue fully operating on, redirecting customers to the official retailers page only in case of payment by proceeding with pay on the official site button. We also plan to mount the Match Me feature on the website. This sum looks insufficient to invest into the mobile application, as the application requires cross-platform adaptation in order to show the same result on all mobile devices. As the mobile application is expected to employ the Rule of Perspective algorithm, which also requires tweaking for different devices. So, in this case we may choose to invest into a better website design with a proper user interface.


	In case we sell 100% we can come up with a fully-functional website with all the features performing without limitations, where customers can choose and order from any retailers online outlet or real outlet. It also makes investing in our mobile application possible, which means not only programming the algorithms but designing the friendly users interface as well.











	Marketing Campaign




	Time Frame: 5st-12th months


	Costs: $10,000-$28,000







	We plan to advertise our services on the world wide web, as we are the company which was established to deliver software for the purposes of online use. World web also gives the impression of a bigger advertizing space with many users who may turn our potential customers.


	We plan to begin our advertising campaign once we manage to design the website performing as planned, with at least the web catalogue feature.


	In case we sell only 50% of shares we may be able only to buy small advertising spaces for web banners on popular websites offering garment of various brands, such as Amazon, or Etsy etc.


	In order to get better publicity with at least 75% of shares sold we may be able to advertise our web catalogue via social networks by employing a content writer whose duty is to describe the competitive advantages of our website. We expect it also to attract people interested in buying garment with the help of innovation we offer, thus attracting our potential customers with their clients already attracted.


	To make larger publicity and expand into related markets, to attract customers from other industries we need to have 100% shares sold. We see this sum as sufficient to advertise duly with larger target audience reached. To carry out our advertising campaign successfully we plan to:


	- improve SEO (Search Engine Optimization) in order to be exposed in the search inquiries of different search engines, such as Google, Bing and Yandex. We expect that this optimization might result in attracting customers from across the world.


	- improve our SMM performance (Social Media Marketing) by hiring content writers and administrators for our social web pages. We plan to share the information concerning our project, the features of our web catalogue and additional services to have our customers, and broad public interested in our offers;


	- be exposed to garment industry by taking part in fashion events, or events specifically for garment retailers, where we expect to demonstrate the performance of our Match Me engine and the Match Me Box and explain the beneficial of installing this equipment in the stores, and explain the beneficial sides of our web catalogue;


	- additionally, if we find it efficient, we may spend on advertisements in printed periodicals for entrepreneurs, focusing on garment retailers. As well as, invest in video advertisements which may appear both on TV, or on the Internet.











	Employees




	Time Frame: 8st-12th months


	Costs: $7,000-$22,000







	As a software company we do not require large staff, because our main focus is to build the program and the website for it.


	In case we manage to sell 50% of shares, we expect director to manage the main workload.


	In case we manage to sell 75% of shares the director keeps the duties of programming, and a customers support manager keeps in contact with our customers, and the functions of the sales agent with the duty to find customers. In this case we might order the website users interface design from a freelancer, though freelancer are notorious for often failing to keep deadlines, or perform duly.


	In case of 100% of shares sold we expect to employ additional staff to maintain the servers and the website performance, a sales manager to search for the customers and issue contracts with them.  We would like several jobs to be performed by third parties, such as the work on designing of the website. We expect the website from a professional designing agency to give us more professional look of a reliable company. We also might employ third parties such as, photographers to take photos of the garment pieces our customers wish to display on the website, models to demonstrate clothes.

	OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS



	 


	We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.






	LIMITED OPERATING HISTORY; NEED FOR ADDITIONAL CAPITAL



	 


	There is no historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are in the start-up stage of operations and have not generated any revenues. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases in services and products.


	We have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to continue, develop or expand our operations. Equity financing could result in additional dilution to existing shareholder.






	Results of operations








	From Inception on August 17, 2016 to August 31, 2016.







	During the period we incorporated the company, prepared a business plan. Our loss since inception is $164. We have just recently started our business operations, however, will not start significant operations until we have completed this offering.








	LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES



	 


	As of October 13, 2016, the Company $1,232 in cash and our liabilities were $164, comprising $164 owed to Aleksandr Zausaev, our sole officer and director. The available capital reserves of the Company are not sufficient for the Company to remain operational. We require minimum funding of approximately $42,000 to conduct our proposed operations and pay all expenses for a minimum period of one year including expenses associated with this offering and maintaining a reporting status with the SEC.





	Since inception, we have sold 5,000,000 shares of common stocks to our sole officer and director, at a price of $0.001 per share, for net proceeds of $5,000.





	We are attempting to raise funds to proceed with our plan of operations. We will have to utilize funds from Aleksandr Zausaev, our sole officer and director, who has verbally agreed to loan the company funds to complete the registration process if offering proceeds are less than registration costs. However, Mr. Zausaev has no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company. Mr. Zausaevs verbal agreement to provide us loans for registration costs is non- binding and discretionary. To proceed with our operations within 12 months, we need a minimum of $42,000. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to sell all the shares required to satisfy our 12 month financial requirements. If we are successful, any money raised will be applied to the items set forth in the Use of Proceeds section of this prospectus. We will attempt to raise at least the minimum funds necessary to proceed with our plan of operations. In the long term we may need additional financing. We do not currently have any arrangements for additional financing. Obtaining additional funding will be subject to a number of factors, including general market conditions, investor acceptance of our business plan and initial results from our business operations. These factors may impact the timing, amount, terms or conditions of additional financing available to us. There is no assurance that any additional financing will be available or if available, on terms that will be acceptable to us.

	Page
















	Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion, meaning that there is substantial doubt if we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital. No substantial revenues are anticipated until we have completed the financing from this offering and implemented our plan of operations. Our only source for cash at this time is investments by others in this offering. We must raise cash to implement our strategy and stay in business. The amount of the offering will likely allow us to operate for at least one year and have the capital resources required to cover the material costs with becoming a publicly reporting. The Company anticipates over the next 12 months the cost of being a reporting public company will be approximately $10,000.







	The Company will have to meet all the financial disclosure and reporting requirements associated with being a publicly reporting company. The Companys management will have to spend additional time on policies and procedures to make sure it is compliant with various regulatory requirements, especially that of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This additional corporate governance time required of management could limit the amount of time management has to implement is business plan and impede the speed of its operations.





	Should the Company fail to raise a minimum of $42,000 under this offering the Company would be forced to scale back or abandon the implementation of its 12-month plan of operations.












	DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS



	 


	We are a software company that seeks to deliver services for garment distribution industry. Our main service is the IT product for garment retailers. We plan to deliver a software product (to which we may refer as a program, a web-engine or an application), the visible part of which we plan to design in a form of a web catalogue. With many offers in the garment industry producers and retailers might experience difficulties in delivering their offer to their potential customers. Customers might feel insecure about how their actual size matches to the size of clothing displayed on the retailers or producers website. We expect that employment of our program can make it easier to advertize and sell garment items, for retailers, select and buy, for garment buyers.





	Our main customers are online and real stores involved in clothing distribution to whom we plan to sell our software and customize precisely to their needs. The users of the application who are the retailers customers are our indirect customers whom we do not charge for using the software. We plan to deliver our software together with the buyers aligned website which holds a catalogue of various brands clothing items listed in it. For the users, our application within the website will perform only informing functions with the possibility to reserve the items chosen in the most convenient outlet, with the most reasonable price (to the users mind).





	We plan the website operating on our software to possess the following main options:


	1 - different viewing options (a gallery with big or small thumbnail photos);


	2 - an option to select clothes or put it onto a hold (which automatically reserves the same piece of clothes in the store where the user plans to receive it);


	3 - combine several orders to see how they match;


	4 - pay directly to the retailer beforehand through a payment form, or choose to pay upon receiving the order;


	5 - sort items by the brand names, prices, nearest stores.





	In order to gain our customers awareness, we plan to come to the market with highly adaptive web engine which might be tweaked to the needs of the end user. We expect that coding a mobile application might give our software wider popularity among customers. The mobile application might be used as both a mobile version of the web catalogue and a measuring device. The mobile application will use the algorithm of the Rule of Perspective to compare clothing sizes on the store to those of the customers. Provided that a customer takes a photo of a real size object, adjusts it to fit the marked frame in the application it displays if the chosen garment can fit the customer.





	Our application users may also enable Match Me feature which we plan to deliver within the application. Match Me is expected to use the algorithm of analyzing the data provided by user in order to make lists of clothing styles (with actual items from the stores that we plan to partner up with), and the information concerning the price, the brand, the store to be on display. It is quite obvious that people stick to a clothing style due to the preferences in music (for instance, rock listeners are likely to wear leather), movies (some people might copy the styles of the favorite actors in certain films) healthstyle (people involved in yoga might prefer natural materials to synthetic ones) and other preferences. Enabling Match Me feature, a user goes through a simple multiple choice questionnaire including the questions about the preferences, actual season and mood in order to receive the possible clothing combinations.

	Page
















	The engine of our web catalogue is supposed to be built in the way that it displays garment items regardless the brand awareness, which may help small brands and individual designers to make their way to general public. We expect that our program can also inspire the competition between retailers, which may result in a number of various offers for clothing buyers, thus helping us to receive awareness and to involve as many retailers in our project as possible.





	Provided that retailers show their interest in our program, we may come to a certain retailers outlet with an additional item - Match Me Box, a computerized installment. We plan to configure the Match Me Box in a similar way that Match Me feature of the application works. This Match Me Box is schemed to be installed in shopping centres for the customers, who have a certain idea (or no ideas) of of what to acquire, but feel disoriented by the overwhelming number of outlets in a store.





	Our principal office address is located at 4760 South Pecos Rd. Suite 103, Las Vegas, NV 89121. Our telephone number is (775) 391-8588. Our plan of operation is forward-looking and there is no assurance that we will ever reach profitable operations. We are a development stage company and have not earned any revenue. It is likely that we will not be able to achieve profitability and would be forced to cease operations due to the lack of funding.






	Customers






	We expect garment retailers, who are interested in expanding their sales area and delivering their offers to broader general public, to be our potential customers. With the software we offer and duly website performance we also expect that our services may be of interest both large retailers of famous brands, as well as small retailers and individual garment producers, who search for publicity.






	Marketing






	We plan to advertise our services on the world wide web, as we are the company which was established to deliver software for the purposes of online use. World web also gives the impression of a bigger advertizing space with many users who may turn our potential customers. We plan to begin our advertising campaign once we manage to design the website performing as planned, with at least the web catalogue feature. To carry out our advertising campaign successfully we plan to:


	- improve SEO (Search Engine Optimization) in order to be exposed in the search inquiries of different search engines, such as Google, Bing and Yandex. We expect that this optimization might result in attracting customers from across the world.


	- improve our SMM performance (Social Media Marketing) by hiring content writers and administrators for our social web pages. We plan to share the information concerning our project, the features of our web catalogue and additional services to have our customers, and broad public interested in our offers;


	- be exposed to garment industry by taking part in fashion events, or events specifically for garment retailers, where we expect to demonstrate the performance of our Match Me engine and the Match Me Box and explain the beneficial of installing this equipment in the stores, and explain the beneficial sides of our web catalogue;


	- additionally, if we find it efficient, we may spend on advertisements in printed periodicals for entrepreneurs, focusing on garment retailers. As well as, invest in video advertisements which may appear both on TV, or on the Internet.








	Competition






	With the innovative features of our application we expect to gain interest in and response to our customers offers attracting more potential buyers to them.





	We see our main competitive features as follows:


	- use of innovations;


	- possibility to adapt our program to the needs of different industries;


	- attractive for small businesses;

	Revenue






	We plan to make revenues by:


	- charging our customers for the possibility to be listed on the web catalogue with their offers;


	- selling additional features or equipment, such as Match Me box;


	- selling advertising spaces;


	- selling our technologies to different industries;






	Insurance






	We do not maintain any insurance and do not intend to maintain insurance in the future. Because we do not have any insurance, if we are made a party of a products liability action, we may not have sufficient funds to defend the litigation. If that occurs a judgment could be rendered against us that could cause us to cease operations.






	Employees; Identification of Certain Significant Employees.






	We are a development stage company and currently have only one employee  our director and sole officer  Mr. Aleksandr Zausaev. We intend to hire employees on an as needed basis.






	Offices






	Our business office is located at 4760 South Pecos Rd. Suite 103, Las Vegas, NV 89121. We are leasing this office since September 8, 2016. Our phone number is (775) 391-8588.  






	Government Regulation






	We will be required to comply with all regulations, rules, and directives of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to our business in any jurisdiction which we would conduct activities. We do not believe that regulation will have a material impact on the way we conduct our business.









	LEGAL PROCEEDINGS






	During the past ten years, none of the following occurred with respect to the President of the Company: (1) any bankruptcy petition filed by or against any business of which such person was a general partner or executive officer either at the time of the bankruptcy or within two years prior to that time; (2) any conviction in a criminal proceeding or being subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses); (3) being subject to any order, judgment or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any court of any competent jurisdiction, permanently or temporarily enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise limiting his involvement in any type of business, securities or banking activities; and (4) being found by a court of competent jurisdiction (in a civil action), the SEC or the commodities futures trading commission to have violated a federal or state securities or commodities law, and the judgment has not been reversed, suspended or vacated.

Had our Board of Directors made these determinations, our board of directors would have reviewed and discussed information provided by the directors and us with regard to each directors business and personal activities and relationships as they may relate to us and our management.










	COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

	CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS



	 


	Aleksandr Zausaev will not be paid for any underwriting services that he performs on our behalf with respect to this offering.





	Other than Mr. Zausaev purchase of founders shares from the Company as stated below, there is nothing of value (including money, property, contracts, options or rights of any kind), received or to be received, by Mr. Zausaev, directly or indirectly, from the Company.





	On September 12, 2016, we issued a total of 5,000,000 shares of restricted common stock to Aleksandr Zausaev, our sole officer and director in consideration of $5,000. Further, Mr. Zausaev has advanced funds to us. As of August 31, 2016, Mr. Zausaev has advanced to us $164. Mr. Zausaev will not be repaid from the proceeds of this offering. There is no due date for the repayment of the funds advanced by Mr. Zausaev. Mr. Zausaev will be repaid from revenues of operations if and when we generate revenues to pay the obligation. There is no assurance that we will ever generate revenues from our operations. The obligation to Mr. Zausaev does not bear interest. There is no written agreement evidencing the advancement of funds by Mr. Zausaev or the repayment of the funds to Mr. Zausaev. The entire transaction was oral. We have a verbal agreement with Mr. Zausaev that, if necessary, he will loan the company funds to complete the registration process.

	SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT



	 


	The following table sets forth certain information concerning the number of shares of our common stock owned beneficially as of August 31, 2016 by: (i) each person (including any group) known to us to own more than five percent (5%) of any class of our voting securities, (ii) our director, and or (iii) our officer. Unless otherwise indicated, the stockholder listed possesses sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares shown.

	(1) A beneficial owner of a security includes any person who, directly or indirectly, through any contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship, or otherwise has or shares: (i) voting power, which includes the power to vote, or to direct the voting of shares; and (ii) investment power, which includes the power to dispose or direct the disposition of shares. Certain shares may be deemed to be beneficially owned by more than one person (if, for example, persons share the power to vote or the power to dispose of the shares). In addition, shares are deemed to be beneficially owned by a person if the person has the right to acquire the shares (for example, upon exercise of an option) within 60 days of the date as of which the information is provided. In computing the percentage ownership of any person, the amount of shares outstanding is deemed to include the amount of shares beneficially owned by such person (and only such person) by reason of these acquisition rights. As of August 31, 2016, there were 5,000,000 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding.








	Future sales by existing stockholders






	A total of 5,000,000 shares of common stock were issued to our sole officer and director, all of which are restricted securities, as defined in Rule 144 of the Rules and Regulations of the SEC promulgated under the Securities Act. Under Rule 144, the shares can be publicly sold, subject to volume restrictions and restrictions on the manner of sale. Such shares can only be sold after six months provided that the issuer of the securities is, and has been for a period of at least 90 days immediately before the sale, subject to the reporting requirements of section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. Shares purchased in this offering, which will be immediately resalable, and sales of all of our other shares after applicable restrictions expire, could have a depressive effect on the market price, if any, of our common stock and the shares we are offering.





	There is no public trading market for our common stock. To be quoted on the OTCBB a market maker must file an application on our behalf to make a market for our common stock. As of the date of this Registration Statement, we have not engaged a market maker to file such an application, that there is no guarantee that a market marker will file an application on our behalf, and that even if an application is filed, there is no guarantee that we will be accepted for quotation.









	PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION



	 


	We are registering 5,000,000 shares of our common stock for sale at the price of $0.02 per share.





	This is a self-underwritten offering, and Mr. Zausaev, our sole officer and director, will sell the shares directly to family, friends, business associates and acquaintances, with no commission or other remuneration payable to him for any shares they may sell. There are no plans or arrangements to enter into any contracts or agreements to sell the shares with a broker or dealer. In offering the securities on our behalf, he will rely on the safe harbor from broker dealer registration set out in Rule 3a4-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Mr. Zausaev will not register as a broker-dealer pursuant to Section 15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, in reliance upon Rule 3a4-1, which sets forth those conditions, as noted herein, under which a person associated with an Issuer may participate in the offering of the Issuers securities and not be deemed to be a broker-dealer:






	23 |

	Page




















	1.


	Our sole officer and director is not subject to a statutory disqualification, as that term is defined in Section 3(a)(39) of the Act, at the time of his participation; and,



	2.


	Our sole officer and director will not be compensated in connection with his participation by the payment of commissions or other remuneration based either directly or indirectly on transactions in securities; and



	3.


	Our sole officer and director is not, nor will he be at the time of his participation in the offering, an associated person of a broker-dealer; and



	4.


	Our sole officer and director meets the conditions of paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of Rule 3a4-1 of the Exchange Act, in that he (A) primarily perform, or intend primarily to perform at the end of the offering, substantial duties for or on behalf of our company, other than in connection with transactions in securities; and (B) he is not a broker or dealer, or been an associated person of a broker or dealer, within the preceding twelve months; and (C) has not participated in selling and offering securities for any issuer more than once every twelve months other than in reliance on Paragraphs (a)(4)(i) or (a)(4)(iii). Under Paragraph 3a4-1(a)(4)(iii), our sole officer and director must restricts his participation to any one or more of the following activities:



	A.


	Preparing any written communication or delivering such communication through the mails or other means that does not involve oral solicitation by his of a potential purchaser; provided, however, that the content of such communication is approved by our sole officer and director;



	B.


	Responding to inquiries of a potential purchaser in a communication initiated by the potential purchaser; provided, however, that the content of such responses are limited to information contained in a registration statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933 or other offering document; or



	C.


	Performing ministerial and clerical work involved in effecting any transaction.





	Our sole officer and director does not intend to purchase any shares in this offering.





	This offering is self-underwritten, which means that it does not involve the participation of an underwriter or broker, and as a result, no broker for the sale of our securities will be used. In the event a broker-dealer is retained by us to participate in the offering, we must file a post-effective amendment to the registration statement to disclose the arrangements with the broker-dealer, and that the broker-dealer will be acting as an underwriter and will be so named in the prospectus. Additionally, FINRA must approve the terms of the underwriting compensation before the broker-dealer may participate in the offering.





	To the extent required under the Securities Act, a post-effective amendment to this registration statement will be filed disclosing the name of any broker-dealers, the number of shares of common stock involved, the price at which the common stock is to be sold, the commissions paid or discounts or concessions allowed to such broker-dealers, where applicable, that such broker-dealers did not conduct any investigation to verify the information set out or incorporated by reference in this prospectus and other facts material to the transaction.





	We are subject to applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations under it, including, without limitation, Rule 10b-5 and a distribution participant under Regulation M. All of the foregoing may affect the marketability of the common stock.All expenses of the registration statement including, but not limited to, legal, accounting, printing and mailing fees are and will be borne by us. 






	Penny Stock Regulations






	You should note that our stock is a penny stock. The SEC has adopted Rule 15g-9 which generally defines "penny stock" to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Our securities are covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and "accredited investors". The term "accredited investor" refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse.






	24 |

	Page
















	The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the SEC which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer's confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities. We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of our common stock.

With respect to a derivative action, indemnity may be made only for expenses actually and reasonably incurred in defending the proceeding, and if the officer or director is judged liable, only by a court order. The indemnification is intended to be to the fullest extent permitted by the laws of the State of Nevada.


	Regarding indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933, which may be permitted to directors or officers under Nevada law, we are informed that, in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, indemnification is against public policy, as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.

	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM


	To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of


	Zartex Inc.


	We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Zartex Inc as of August 31, 2016, and the related statements of operations, stockholders deficit, and cash flows for the period from August 17, 2016 (Inception) to August 31, 2016. Zartex Incs management is responsible for these financial statements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.


	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.


	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Zartex Inc as of August 31, 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the period from August 17, 2016 (Inception) to August 31, 2016, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.


	We were not engaged to examine managements assertion about the effectiveness of Zartex Incs internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2016 included in the accompanying report and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion thereon.


	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that Zartex Inc will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, these conditions raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

	(A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY)






	NOTES TO THE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	FOR THE PERIOD FROM INCEPTION (AUGUST 17, 2016) TO AUGUST 31, 2016










	NOTE 1  ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION



	 


	ZARTEX INC. (the Company) is a corporation established under the corporation laws in the State of Nevada on August 17, 2016.





	The company intends to commence operations in the business of software development. The company seeks to deliver services for garment distribution industry. The main service is the IT product for garment retailers.





	The Companys activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including failure to secure additional funding to properly execute the companys business plan.





	The Company has adopted August 31 fiscal year end.









	NOTE 2  GOING CONCERN






	The Companys financial statements as of August 31, 2016 been prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern. The Company has incurred a cumulative net loss from inception (August 17, 2016) to August 31, 2016 of $164. These factors among others raise substantial doubt about the ability of the company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.  





	In order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Managements plan is to obtain such resources for the Company by obtaining capital from management and significant shareholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses and seeking third party equity and/or debt financing. However, management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. These financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.






	NOTE 3  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES







	Basis of Presentation



	 


	The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.






	Development Stage Company






	The Company is a development stage company as defined in ASC 915 Development Stage Entities.. The Company is devoting substantially all of its efforts on establishing the business and its planned principal operations have not commenced.  All losses accumulated since inception have been considered as part of the Company's development stage activities.





	The Company has elected to adopt early application of Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-10, Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements.  Upon adoption, the Company no longer presents or discloses inception-to-date information and other remaining disclosure requirements of Topic 915.


	F-6

	Page























	Use of Estimates






	Preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Actual results and outcomes may differ from managements estimates and assumptions.






	Cash and Equivalents






	The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.






	Basic and Diluted Loss Per Share






	Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period. Diluted loss per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period.  Dilutive loss per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.






	Income Taxes






	Income taxes are provided in accordance with ASC No. 740, Accounting for Income Taxes.  A deferred tax asset or liability is recorded for all temporary differences between financial and tax reporting and net operating loss carry-forwards. Deferred tax expense (benefit) results from the net change during the year of deferred tax assets and liabilities.





	Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion of all of the deferred tax assets will be realized.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.


	New Accounting Pronouncements






	New Accounting Pronouncements






	There were various accounting standards and interpretations issued recently, none of which are expected to a have a material impact on our financial position, operations or cash flows.









	NOTE 4  CAPTIAL STOCK






	The Company has 75,000,000 shares of common stock authorized with a par value of $0.001 per share.





	On September 12, 2016, the Company issued 5,000,000 shares of common stock at $0.001 per share for a proceed of $5,000






	NOTE 5  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS



	 


	In support of the Companys efforts and cash requirements, it may rely on advances from related parties until such time that the Company can support its operations or attains adequate financing through sales of its equity or traditional debt financing. There is no formal written commitment for continued support by officers, directors, or shareholders. Amounts represent advances or amounts paid in satisfaction of liabilities. The advances are considered temporary in nature and have not been formalized by a promissory note.  





	Since August 17, 2016 (Inception) through August 31, 2016, the Companys sole officer and director loaned the Company $164 to pay for incorporation costs and operating expenses.  As of August 31, 2016, the amount outstanding was $164. The loan is non-interest bearing, due upon demand and unsecured.


	 



	NOTE 6  INCOME TAX






	As of August 31, 2016 the Company had net operating loss carry forwards of $164 that may be available to reduce future years taxable income through 2036. Future tax benefits which may arise as a result of these losses have not been recognized in these financial statements, as their realization is determined not likely to occur and accordingly, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset relating to these tax loss carry-forwards.






	NOTE 7 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS






	On September 12, 2016, the Company issued 5,000,000 shares of common stock at $0.001 per share for a proceed of $5,000

	ITEM 17. UNDERTAKINGS



	 


	The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes:





	1)


	To file, during any period in which offers or sales of securities are being made, a post-    effective amendment to this registration statement to:





	(i)


	Include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933;



	(ii)


	To reflect in the prospectus any facts or events arising after the effective date of the registration statement (or the most recent post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered (if the total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low or high end of the estimated maximum offering range may be reflected in the form of prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) (§230.424(b) of this chapter) if, in the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more than 20% change in the maximum aggregate offering price set forth in the Calculation of Registration Fee table in the effective registration statement.



	(iii)


	To include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement or any material change to such information in the registration statement;


	2)


	That, for the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.





	3)


	To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering.





	4)


	That, for the purpose of determining liability under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser:





	(i)


	If the registrant is subject to Rule 430C, each prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) as part of a registration statement relating to an offering, other than registration statements relying on Rule 430B or other than prospectuses filed in reliance on Rule 430A, shall be deemed to be part of and included in the registration statement as of the date it is first used after effectiveness. Provided, however, that no statement made in a registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement or made in a document incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference into the registration statement or prospectus that is part of the registration statement will, as to a purchaser with a time of contract of sale prior to such first use, supersede or modify any statement that was made in the registration statement or prospectus that was part of the registration statement or made in any such document immediately prior to such date of first use.





	5)


	That, for the purpose of determining liability of the registrant under the Securities Act of 1933 to any purchaser in the initial distribution of the securities: The undersigned registrant undertakes that in a primary offering of securities of the undersigned registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser:


	 


	(i)


	Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424;


	 


	(ii)


	Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant or used or referred to by the undersigned registrant;


	 


	(iii)


	The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned registrant or our securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant; and





	(iv)


	Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrant to the purchaser.


	 


	Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 (the Act) may be permitted to our directors, officers and controlling persons pursuant to the provisions above, or otherwise, we have been advised that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act, and is, therefore, unenforceable.


	 


	In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities, other than the payment by us of expenses incurred or paid by one of our directors, officers, or controlling persons in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding, is asserted by one of our directors, officers, or controlling persons in connection with the securities being registered, we will, unless in the opinion of our counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act, and we will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

	part thereof, he or she shall so state and shall state the rules under which the meeting or appropriate part thereof shall be conducted.





	(b)    If disorder should arise which prevents the continuation of the legitimate business of the meeting, the chairman may quit the chair and announce the adjournment of the meeting, and upon so doing, the meeting will immediately be adjourned.





	(c)   The chairman may ask or require that anyone not a bona fide shareholder or proxy leave the meeting.





	(d)   The resolution or motion shall be considered for vote only if proposed by a shareholder or a duly authorized proxy and seconded by a shareholder or duly authorized proxy other than the individual who proposed the resolution or motion.





	(e)   Except as the chairman may permit, no matter shall be presented to the meeting which has not been submitted for consideration in accordance with the terms and provisions of Section 2.5.

	Except as may be otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation, each shareholder shall be entitled to one vote for each share of capital stock held by such shareholder. At any meeting of shareholders (at which a quorum is present to organize the meeting), all matters, except as otherwise provided by statute, by the articles of incorporation or by these bylaws, shall be decided by the majority of the votes cast at such meeting by the holders of shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote thereon, whether or not a quorum is present when the vote is taken.






	SECTION 2.11



	Waiver of Notice



	.






	Whenever notice is required to be given under any provision of the Nevada General Corporation Law or of the articles of incorporation or these bylaws, a written waiver, signed by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the shareholders, directors, or members of a committee of directors need be specified in any written waiver of notice unless so required by the articles of incorporation or these bylaws.






	SECTION 2.12

	or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the board of directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not be more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting, nor more than sixty (60) days prior to any other action.





	If the board of directors does not so fix a record date:





	(i)   The record date for determining shareholders entitled to notice of or


	to vote at a meeting of shareholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held.





	(ii)    The record date for determining shareholders for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the board of directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.





	A determination of shareholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of shareholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the board of directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.
















	SECTION 2.13



	Proxies



	.






	Each shareholder entitled to vote at a meeting of shareholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for such shareholder by a written proxy, signed by such shareholder and filed with the secretary of the corporation, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after six (6) months from its date, unless the proxy is coupled with an interest or the proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy shall be deemed signed if such shareholder's name is placed on the proxy by any reasonable means including, but not limited to, by facsimile signature, manual signature, typewriting, telegraphic transmission or otherwise, by such shareholder or such shareholder's attorney-in-fact.

The list shall also be produced and kept at


	the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any shareholder who is present. Such list shall presumptively determine the identity of


	the shareholders entitled to vote at the meeting and the number of shares held by each of them.

	year term. A director shall hold office until the annual shareholder meeting for the year in which his term expires and until his successor shall be elected and shall qualify, subject, however, to prior death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal from office.


	If the number of directors is changed, any additional director elected to fill a vacancy resulting from an increase in the number of directors shall hold office for a term that shall coincide with the remaining term of the directors, but in no case will a decrease in the number of directors shorten the term of any incumbent director.





	No reduction of the authorized number of directors shall have the effect of removing any director before that director's term of office expires.






	SECTION 3.3



	Election and Qualification of Directors



	.

	Unless otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation or these bylaws: (i)


	Vacancies and newly created directorships resulting from any


	increase in the authorized number of directors elected by all of the shareholders having the right to vote as a single class may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director.





	(ii)    Whenever the holders of any class or classes of stock or series thereof are entitled to elect one or more directors by the articles of incorporation, vacancies and newly created directorships of such class or classes or series may be filled by a majority of the directors elected by


	such class or classes or series thereof then in office, or by a sole remaining director so elected.





	If at any time, by reason of death or resignation or other cause, the corporation should have no directors in office, then any officer or any shareholder or an executor,













	administrator, trustee or guardian of a shareholder, or other fiduciary entrusted with like responsibility for the person or estate of a shareholder, may call a special meeting of shareholders in accordance with the provisions of the articles of incorporation or these bylaws.

	persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and such participation in a meeting pursuant to this section shall constitute presence in person at the meeting.

	Regular Meetings



	.






	Regular meetings of the board of directors may be held without notice at such time and at such place as shall from time to time be determined by the board.






	SECTION 3.7



	Special Meetings



	.






	Special meetings of the board of directors may be called by the chairman, the chief executive officer, the president, or the secretary or by any two (2) or more directors then serving on at least one (1) day's notice to each director given by one of the means specified in Section 3.9 hereof other than by mail, or on at least three (3) days' notice if given by mail. Special meetings shall be called by the chairman, chief executive officer, president or secretary in like manner and on like notice on the written request of any two (2) or more of the directors then serving.






	SECTION 3.8



	Quorum



	.






	At all meetings of the board of directors, a majority of the authorized number of directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business and the act of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of the board of directors, except as may be otherwise specifically provided by statute, the article of incorporation, or these bylaws. If a quorum is not present at any meeting of the board of directors, then the directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present.





	A meeting at which a quorum is initially present may continue to transact business notwithstanding the withdrawal of directors, if any action taken is approved by at least a majority of the required quorum for that meeting.
















	SECTION 3.9



	Notice Procedure



	.






	Whenever, under provisions of any statutes, the article of incorporation or these bylaws, notice is required to be given to any director, such notice shall be deemed given effectively if given in person, by telephone or any other comprehensible means, by mail addressed to such director at such director's address as it appears in the records of the corporation, with postage paid thereon, or by telegram, telex, telecopy, email or other electronic communication or similar means addressed as aforesaid.






	SECTION 3.10



	Waiver of Notice



	.






	Whenever notice is required to be given under any provision of the Nevada General Corporation Law, the articles of incorporation, or these bylaws, a written waiver thereof, signed by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when such person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the directors, or members of a committee of directors, need be specified in any written waiver of notice unless so required by the articles of incorporation or these bylaws.






	SECTION 3.11



	Board Action by Written Consent Without a Meeting



	.






	Unless otherwise restricted by the articles of incorporation or these bylaws, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the board of directors, or of any committee thereof may be taken without a meeting if all members of the board or committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing and the writing or writings are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the board or committee.

	expected to benefit the corporation. The loan, guaranty or other assistance may be with or without interest and may be unsecured, or secured in such manner as the board of directors shall approve, including, without limitation, a pledge of shares of stock of the corporation. Nothing contained in this section shall be deemed to deny, limit or restrict
















	the powers of guaranty or warranty of the corporation at common law or under any statute.






	SECTION 3.14



	Reduction of Directors



	.






	No reduction of the authorized number of directors shall have the effect of removing any director prior to the expiration of such director's term of office.

The board may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. In the absence or disqualification of a member of a committee, the member or members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not such member or members constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the board of directors to act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member. Any such committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the board of directors, or in the bylaws of the corporation, shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the board of directors in the management of the business and affairs of the corporation, and may authorize the seal of the corporation to be affixed to all papers that may require it; but no such committee shall have the power or authority (i) approving or adopting or

	Article 6. Indemnity







	SECTION 6.1



	Third Party Actions



	.






	The corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the corporation) by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director,


	officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement (if such settlement is approved in advance by the corporation, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such person's conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interest


	of the corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that the person's conduct was unlawful.






	SECTION 6.2



	Actions by or in the Right of the Corporation



	.






	The corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such


	person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys' fees) and amounts paid in settlement (if such settlement is approved in advance by the corporation, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with the defense or














	settlement of such action or suit if such person acted in good faith and in manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the corporation unless and


	only to the extent that the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the court shall deem proper. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article VI, no person shall be indemnified hereunder for any expenses or amounts paid in settlement with respect to any action to recover short-swing profits under


	Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.






	SECTION 6.3



	Successful Defense

	such person shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith.






	SECTION 6.4



	Determination of Conduct



	.






	Any indemnification under Sections 6.1 and 6.2 (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that the indemnification of the director, officer, employee or agent is proper in the circumstances because such person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Sections 6.1 and 6.2. Such determination shall be made (1) by the board of directors or


	the executive committee by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding or (2) or if such quorum is not obtainable or, even if obtainable, a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (3) by the shareholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a director, officer, employee or agent of the corporation shall be entitled to contest any determination that the director, officer, employee or agent has not met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 by petitioning a court of competent jurisdiction.






	SECTION 6.5



	Payment of Expenses in Advance



	.






	Expenses incurred in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding, by an individual who may be entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 6.1 or 6.2, shall be paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the director, officer, employee or agent to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified by the corporation as authorized in this


	Article VI.
















	SECTION 6.6



	Indemnity Not Exclusive



	.






	The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by or granted pursuant to the other sections of this Article VI shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any by-law, agreement, vote of shareholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in such person's official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office.






	SECTION 6.7

	SECTION 6.8



	The Corporation



	.






	For purposes of this Article VI, references to "the corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors, officers, and employees or agents, so that any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent corporation, or is or was serving at the request of such constituent corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under and subject to the provisions of this Article VI (including, without limitation the provisions of Section 6.4) with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as such person would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued.






	SECTION 6.9



	Employee Benefit Plans



	.

	employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best interests of the corporation" as referred to in this Article VI.

	Article 7. Records And Reports







	SECTION 7.1



	Maintenance and Inspection of Records



	.






	The corporation shall, either at its principal executive officer or at such place or places as designated by the board of directors, keep a record of its shareholders listing their names and addresses and the number and class of shares held by each shareholder, a copy of these bylaws as amended to date, accounting books, and other records.





	Any shareholder of record, in person or by attorney or other agent, shall, upon written demand under oath stating the purpose thereof, have the right during the usual hours for business to inspect for any proper purpose the corporation's stock ledger, a list of its shareholders, and its other books and records and to make copies or extracts therefrom. A proper purpose shall mean a purpose reasonably related to such person's interest as a shareholder. In every instance where an attorney or other agent is the person who seeks the right to inspection, the demand under oath shall be accompanied by a power of attorney or such other writing that authorizes the attorney or other agent so to act on behalf of the shareholder. The demand under oath shall be directed to the corporation at its registered office in Nevada or at its principal place of business.





	The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of the corporation shall prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of shareholders, a complete list of the shareholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, showing the address of each shareholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each shareholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any shareholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting, either at a place within the city where the meeting is to be held, which place shall be specified in the notice of the meeting, or, if not so specified, at the place where the meeting is to be held. The list shall also be produced and kept at


	the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any shareholder who is present.






	SECTION 7.2



	Inspection by Directors



	.






	Any director shall have the right to examine the corporation's stock ledger, a list


	of its shareholders, and its other books and records for a purpose reasonably related to his















	position as a director. The Superior Court of the county of the corporation's registered office is hereby vested with the exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether a director is entitled to the inspection sought. The Court may summarily order the corporation to permit the director to inspect any and all books and records, the stock ledger, and the stock list and to make copies or extracts therefrom. The Court may, in its discretion, prescribe any limitations or conditions with reference to the inspection, or award such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper.






	SECTION 7.3



	Annual Statement to Shareholders



	.






	The board of directors shall present at each annual meeting, and at any special meeting of the shareholders when called for by vote of the shareholders, a full and clear statement of the business and condition of the corporation.






	Article 8. General Matters







	SECTION 8.1



	Execution of Corporate Contracts and Instruments



	.






	The board of directors, except as otherwise provided in these bylaws, may authorize any officer or officers, or agent or agents, to enter into any contract or execute any instrument in the name of and on behalf of the corporation; such authority may be general or confined to specific instances. Unless so authorized or ratified by the board of directors or within the agency power of an officer, no officer, agent or employee shall have any power or authority to bind the corporation by any contract or engagement or to pledge its credit or to render it liable for any purpose or for any amount.






	SECTION 8.2



	Stock Certificates; Partly Paid Shares



	.






	The shares of the corporation shall be represented by certificates, provided that the board of directors of the corporation may provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or all classes or series of its stock shall be uncertificated shares. Any such resolution shall not apply to shares represented by a certificate until such certificate is surrendered to the corporation. Notwithstanding the adoption of such a resolution by the board of directors, every holder of stock represented by certificates and upon request every holder of uncertificated shares shall be entitled to have a certificate signed by, or in the name of the corporation by the chairman or vice-chairman of the board of directors,


	or the president or vice-president, and by the chief financial officer or an assistant treasurer, or the secretary or an assistant secretary of such corporation representing the number of shares registered in certificate form. Any or all of the signatures on the certificate may be a facsimile. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate has ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the corporation with the same effect as if such person were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.













	The corporation may issue the whole or any part of its shares as partly paid and subject to call for the remainder of the consideration to be paid therefor. Upon the face or back of each stock certificate issued to represent any such partly paid shares, upon the books and records of the corporation in the case of uncertificated partly paid shares, the total amount of the consideration to be paid therefor and the amount paid thereon shall be stated. Upon the declaration of any dividend on fully paid shares, the corporation shall declare a dividend upon partly paid shares of the same class, but only upon the basis of the percentage of the consideration actually paid thereon.






	SECTION 8.3



	Special Designation on Certificates



	.






	If the corporation is authorized to issue more than one class of stock or more than one series of any class, then the powers, the designations, the preferences, and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights shall be set forth in full or summarized on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock; provided, however, that, in lieu of the foregoing requirements there may be set forth on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock a statement that the corporation will furnish without charge to each shareholder who so requests the powers, the designations, the preferences, and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights.






	SECTION 8.4



	Lost Certificates.







	Except as provided in this Section 8.4, no new certificates for shares shall be issued to replace a previously issued certificate unless the latter is surrendered to the corporation and canceled at the same time. The corporation may issue a new certificate of stock or uncertificated shares in the place of any certificate theretofore issued by it, alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, and the corporation may require the owner of the lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, or his legal representative, to give the corporation a bond sufficient to indemnify it against any claim that may be made against


	it on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of any such certificate or the issuance of such new certificate or uncertificated shares.






	SECTION 8.5



	Construction; Definitions



	.

	SECTION 8.6

	Dividends

	.













	The directors of the corporation, subject to any restrictions contained in (i) the Nevada General Corporation Law or (ii) the articles of incorporation, may declare and pay dividends upon the shares of its capital stock. Dividends may be paid in cash, in property, or in shares of the corporation's capital stock.





	The directors of the corporation may set apart out of any of the funds of the corporation available for dividends a reserve or reserves for any proper purpose and may abolish any such reserve. Such purposes shall include but not be limited to equalizing dividends, repairing or maintaining any property of the corporation, and meeting contingencies.






	SECTION 8.7



	Fiscal Year



	.






	The fiscal year of the corporation shall be fixed by resolution of the board of directors and may be changed by the board of directors.






	SECTION 8.8



	Seal



	.






	The corporation may adopt a corporate seal, which shall be adopted and which may be altered by the board of directors, and may use the same by causing it or a facsimile thereof to be impressed or affixed or in any other manner reproduced.






	SECTION 8.9



	Transfer of Stock



	.






	Upon surrender to the corporation or the transfer agent of the corporation of a certificate for shares duly endorsed or accompanied by proper evidence of succession, assignation or authority to transfer, it shall be the duty of the corporation to issue a new certificate to the person entitled thereto, cancel the old certificate, and record the transaction in its books.






	SECTION 8.10



	Stock Transfer Agreements



	.






	The corporation shall have power to enter into and perform any agreement with any number of shareholders of any one or more classes of stock of the corporation to restrict the transfer of shares of stock of the corporation of any one or more classes owned by such shareholders in any manner not prohibited by the Nevada General Corporation Law.






	SECTION 8.11



	Registered Shareholders



	.






	The corporation shall be entitled to recognize the exclusive right of a person registered on its books as the owner of shares to receive dividends and to vote as such owner, shall be entitled to hold liable for calls and assessments the person registered on its books as the owner of shares, and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or shares on the part of another person, whether or













	not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by the laws of Nevada.






	Article 9. Amendments






	The bylaws of the corporation may be adopted, amended or repealed by the shareholders entitled to vote; provided, however, that the corporation may, in its articles of incorporation, confer the power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws upon the directors. The fact that such power has been so conferred upon the directors shall not divest the shareholders of the power, nor limit their power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws.
