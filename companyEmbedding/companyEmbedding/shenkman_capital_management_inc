U.S. High Yield Bonds - Shenkman





























Skip to content

U.S. High Yield Bonds
Bonds represent an agreement in which a corporation commits to repay borrowed funds under set terms. Judging the potential to repay is where SHENKMAN CAPITAL can make a difference.


High yield bonds offer lower volatility than equities due to their coupon income.
High Yield Bonds Should be a Strategic Allocation.

In most cases, the high yield market meets the actuarial assumption of a 7%-8% return, which is generated predominantly by an annual income stream.
High yield securities have historically produced significantly higher risk-adjusted returns than most other fixed income sectors.
In down markets, a larger coupon for high yield securities helps to offset market declines, and in up markets high yield securities usually correlate to rising equities.
High yield securities have attributes that enable investors to benefit from corporate developments as well as enjoy the characteristics of fixed income.
High yield bonds are generally not impacted by modest rises in interest rates. Additionally, spreads are more a reflection of market expectations for future default rates rather than expectations for higher interest rates.

Investors should not be misled by the common myths associated with high yield.
Five Myths of the High Yield Market.

Yield compensates for credit risk.

The Reality – The high yield market is characterized by asymmetric risk whereby the potential for downside losses outweighs upside capital appreciation.


The market is deep and liquid.

The Reality – The high yield market is an over-the-counter market that is highly dependent on dealer capital. The majority of high yield bonds do not trade on a daily basis, which means there may be a significant difference between trade prices and broker quotes.


Credit ratings reflect the actual risk.

The Reality – Independent fundamental analysis is paramount. Additionally, the market generally anticipates upgrades and downgrades long before the actual rating changes.


High yield bonds correlate to U.S. Treasuries.

The Reality – Over the last 26 years there have been six periods during which the 10-year Treasury yield has risen more than 100 basis points. High yield bonds and leveraged loans had positive returns during each of these periods.


Spreads correlate to interest rates.

The Reality – Historically, spreads have been a reflection of the expected default rates over a six- to nine-month period. An expectation of low default rates typically results in spread compression.

Bank Loans - Shenkman






























Skip to content









Menu




Bank Loans
While loans and credit are a driving force in making capital available to support growth, some are more credit-worthy than others. Caution is our watchword.


High yield bank loans are loans made to non-investment grade companies. These loans are senior in the company’s capital structure and are typically secured by the company’s assets. Bank loans also have a floating rate coupon, meaning the yield on the bank loans fluctuates with interest rates.
Why Bank Loans?

Seniority in the capital structure means that borrowers are contractually obligated to make payments on their loans before payments to other creditors, which generally results in a higher recovery rate.
Leveraged loans are typically secured by the company’s physical assets, which helps to preserve principal value, reduce volatility, and can lead to higher recovery rates.
Floating rate coupons act as a hedge against rising interest rates, historically performing very well during inflationary environments.
High yield loans offer yield improvement relative to investment grade bonds with considerably shorter duration, and generally similar volatility characteristics.
Bank loans can be viewed as a logical substitute or supplement to a core fixed income allocation.

Over the past decade, bank loans have transitioned from being a bank-dominated market to an institutionally accepted asset class with a market value of over $1.7 trillion at the end of 2014. During this transition, there have been many positive developments, including better liquidity, greater transparency, broader diversification, total return benchmarks, trade groups, public ratings, and standardized trade documentation. At SHENKMAN CAPITAL, we have a long track record of managing loans and understand their unique attributes.

I.
INTRODUCTION 
SHENKMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, INC. (Shenkman Capital) is an investment adviser registered with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (the SEC) under Section 203 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the Advisers Act). This Compliance Manual (the Manual) is designed to assist Shenkman Capital and its
officers, directors (or other person occupying a similar status or performing similar functions), and team members and any other person who provides advice on behalf of Shenkman Capital and is subject to Shenkman Capitals supervision and
control (each, a Supervised Person), in preventing violations of the Advisers Act and the rules promulgated thereunder. Shenkman Capital has a copy of or has access to the Advisers Act and the applicable rules, which are available at
www.sec.gov.  The Manual sets forth policies and procedures relating to various aspects of Shenkman Capitals business
and is designed to meet the requirements of Rule 206(4)-7 under the Advisers Act. Although each section of the Manual addresses a different compliance issue, procedures relating to certain issues may be found in more than one section. 
Shenkman Capital is a fiduciary and, therefore, must serve the interests of its advisory clients. Shenkman Capital must adhere to the
highest standard of care and diligence in conducting its business activities as is required by law, and must be particularly sensitive to situations in which the interests of its advisory clients may be directly or indirectly in conflict with those
of Shenkman Capital. Compliance obligations are a priority of Shenkman Capital and its Supervised Persons. The failure of a Supervised Person to comply with these procedures may expose Shenkman Capital and such individual to significant
consequences, including termination of employment with Shenkman Capital, potential monetary sanctions and criminal and civil penalties.  Shenkman Capitals chief compliance officer (the Compliance Officer) is responsible for ensuring that each Supervised Person receives, or has access to, a copy of the most recently
updated Manual, as it may be amended from time to time, and for implementing the policies and procedures contained in this Manual. Each Supervised Person is responsible for reading and following the Manual. The Manual includes the related
appendices, as they may be revised from time to time. If you have any questions as to how these procedures relate to a particular situation, consult with the Compliance Officer. In addition, if you suspect, or become aware of, a violation (or
possible violation) of any policy or procedure contained in this Manual, you should notify the Compliance Officer immediately. 
Unless otherwise noted, all citations in this Manual refer to sections of the Advisers Act or to rules promulgated thereunder.
  


II.
 IDENTIFICATION OF CHIEF COMPLIANCE OFFICER AND SUPERVISED PERSONS 
 


 
A.
 Shenkman Capitals Compliance Officer is Richard H. Weinstein and his delegate(s), appointed from time to time by the Compliance
Officer.   


 
B.
 The Compliance Officer is responsible for ensuring the implementation of this Manual, which may be accomplished by the Compliance Officer
himself or through his delegate(s).   


 
C.
 Shenkman Capitals Supervised Persons are identified in Appendix A, which will be revised as needed by the Compliance Officer.





III.
COMPLIANCE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES   


 
A.
 DISCLOSURES   


 
1.
 Form ADV  Shenkman Capital must complete and maintain an accurate Uniform Application for Investment Adviser Registration (Form ADV). Form ADV consists of Parts 1A, 2A (the Firm Brochure)
and 2B (the Brochure Supplement, and together with the Firm Brochure, Part 2), as well as a series of attachments in the form of Schedules (for Part 1A and the Firm Brochure) and an Appendix (for the Brochure Supplement).
 Brochure Supplements are prepared for each Supervised Person who: (i) formulates investment advice for
a client and has direct client contact; or (ii) makes discretionary investment decisions for client assets even if the person has no direct client contact. 
Shenkman Capital is responsible for maintaining the accuracy of the information in its Form ADV. Shenkman Capital is
required to amend parts 1A and the Firm Brochure of its Form ADV and, with respect to the Firm Brochure, submit a summary of material changes thereto, at least annually, within 90 days of its fiscal year end, and more often as required by the
instructions to the Form ADV. Shenkman Capital is also required to promptly update its Brochure Supplement when the information contained therein becomes materially inaccurate. 
The Adviser must file parts 1A and 2A of its Form ADV with the SEC via the Investment Adviser Registration Depository
(IARD), and maintain copies thereof in its files.   


 
2.
 Delivery  Shenkman Capital is required to furnish its Firm Brochure to each of its advisory clients and prospective advisory clients, including investors in private investment vehicles sponsored by Shenkman Capital
(each a Sponsored Fund and, collectively, the Sponsored Funds). Shenkman Capital must deliver the Firm Brochure to an advisory client or a prospective advisory client before or at the time it enters into an advisory contract
with the client. Shenkman Capitals standard form of investment advisory contract contains an acknowledgement of receipt of the Firm Brochure.  Shenkman Capital will deliver, without charge, to each client on an annual basis, no later than 120 days after the end of its fiscal year, an updated Firm Brochure, including a summary of material changes
thereto, and any applicable Brochure Supplements.   


 
3.
 Disclosure of Financial and Disciplinary Information 
In addition to financial and disciplinary information required to be disclosed in Part 1A and the Firm Brochure (each a
Disclosure Event.), Shenkman Capital shall disclose disciplinary history material to a clients evaluation of certain Supervised Persons integrity in their Brochure Supplement. Senior management and other Supervised Persons
have an obligation to inform the Compliance Officer of the occurrence of a Disclosure Event or any other event that might require disclosure to clients or disclosure on Form ADV. 
  2 


If a Disclosure Event or other disclosable event is reported to the
Compliance Officer, the Compliance Officer will prepare the necessary disclosure and ensure that it is appropriately disseminated.   


 
4.
 Client Reporting  Shenkman Capitals policies regarding the periodic statements and/or reports that will be delivered to Shenkman Capitals clients (including clients that are investors in Sponsored Funds) are
set forth under the heading Review of Accounts in the Firm Brochure. The Compliance Officer will ensure that these reports are sent to clients in accordance with such policies. 
 


 
5.
 Anti-Fraud Provisions/Rule 
Section 206 of the Advisers Act, otherwise known as the anti-fraud provisions, makes it unlawful for any investment
adviser, by use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, directly or indirectly: (i) to employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud any client or prospective client; (ii) to engage in any transaction,
practice, or course of business which operates as a fraud or deceit upon any client or prospective client; (iii) acting as a principal for its own account, knowingly to sell any security to, or purchase any security from, a client, or, acting
as a broker for a person other than such client, knowingly to effect any sale or purchase of any security for the account of such client, without disclosing to such client in writing before the completion of such transaction the capacity in which
the adviser is acting and obtaining the consent of the client to such transaction; or (iv) to engage in any act, practice, or course of business which is fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative. The SEC has adopted a number of rules that
identify specific conduct and activities that would constitute a violation of Section 206.  Under the
anti-fraud provisions of the Advisers Act, Shenkman Capital has an obligation to make full and adequate disclosure to clients regarding potential and actual conflicts of interest and to keep current all disclosure and marketing materials provided to
its clients or investors in Sponsored Funds. In addition, Rule 206(4)-8 prohibits Shenkman Capital from making false or misleading statements or engaging any fraudulent, deceptive or manipulative conduct with respect to investors and prospective
investors in Sponsored Funds. Rule 206(4)-8 applies to any materials or statements prepared or made by Shenkman Capital to any prospective or existing investor in such Sponsored Funds. 
 


 
B.
 INVESTMENT ADVISORY CONTRACTS   


 
1.
 The Compliance Officer must review each advisory contract entered into with clients (Advisory Contract). The Compliance Officer must
also review the form of Advisory Contract (if any) entered into with a Sponsored Fund or its affiliates.   


 
2.
 Before an Advisory Contract is executed on behalf of Shenkman Capital, the Compliance Officer will confirm that the contract includes an
Assignment Clause to the effect that Shenkman Capital may not assign the agreement without the clients consent.   


 
3.
 Among other things, the Advisory Contract should: 
 


 

 
 set forth Shenkman Capitals authority (discretionary or non-discretionary) over the clients account; 
  3 




 

 
 describe the duties to be performed by Shenkman Capital; 
 


 

 
 identify the clients investment objective, guidelines and any account restrictions; 
 


 

 
 specify Shenkman Capitals compensation and the manner of payment; 
 


 

 
 include provisions for terminating the contract;   


 

 
 to the extent Shenkman Capital or any of its affiliates derive any benefits, including the receipt of compensation of any kind and/or any form of
reimbursement arrangement, such benefits, services and/or arrangements should be fully described and disclosed in the Advisory Contract and it may be appropriate to describe and disclose such benefits, services and/or arrangements in other places,
such as in Part 2A or 2B of the ADV and other offering materials and will need to be monitored by the Compliance Officer; and   


 

 
 contain the clients acknowledgement of receipt of Part 2A unless another written acknowledgement of receipt previously has been signed by the
client.   


 
4.
 Whenever the clients investment objectives, guidelines or restrictions or any other term of an Advisory Contract has changed, the Advisory
Contract should be amended to reflect the changes.   


 
5.
 An Advisory Contract may not contain any of the following terms: 
 


 

 
 Limitation of Liability (Hedge Clauses)  An Advisory Contract may not require that the client waive any rights against Shenkman
Capital that the client has under the federal securities laws. However, the Advisory Contract may limit the liability of Shenkman Capital (e.g., to cases in which Shenkman Capital does not act with gross negligence, recklessness, or in a willfully
improper or in an illegal manner), provided that it is clear that no waiver of rights under federal securities laws is intended.   


 

 
 Termination Penalties  An Advisory Contract may not impose a penalty on the client for terminating the contract or the services of Shenkman
Capital.   


 
C.
 PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT PROCESSES   


 
1.
 Allocation of Investment Opportunities Among Clients 
As a fiduciary, Shenkman Capital must allocate investment opportunities among its clients in a fair and equitable
manner. Shenkman Capital will allocate all securities and other investment opportunities among clients in accordance with Shenkman Capitals policies and procedures regarding trade allocations, as set forth in Appendix B. 
 


 
2.
 Consistency with Client Investment Objectives/Restrictions 
Each client account (including each Sponsored Fund) will be reviewed on a periodic basis by the Compliance Officer, with
the assistance of portfolio managers, if necessary, to determine whether the account is being managed in a manner that is consistent with the clients investment objectives, guidelines and/or restrictions, as communicated to Shenkman Capital.
In the case of Sponsored Funds, the offering memorandum for each such Sponsored Fund should be reviewed for consistency and compliance. 
  4 




 
3.
Comparative Review of the Performance of Similarly Managed Accounts 
At least semi-annually, the Compliance Officer, with the assistance of portfolio managers, if necessary, will compare
the performance of Shenkman Capitals client accounts that have substantially similar investment objectives, guidelines and restrictions. The Compliance Officer will report any unexplained significant discrepancies to senior management to
determine appropriate action.   


 
4.
 Consistency with Certain Legal Restrictions 
Periodically, the Compliance Officer, with the assistance of other Supervised Persons, if necessary, will determine
whether each private fund (advised or sponsored by Shenkman Capital) is in compliance with Section 12(d) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 as set forth in Appendix B. The Compliance Officer, with the assistance of other Supervised
Persons, if necessary, will also review client accounts to determine whether Shenkman Capital is in compliance with other applicable legal requirements including, but not limited to, Section 13 and Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934. In addition, Shenkman Capital will monitor compliance with its anti-money laundering procedures, as set forth in Appendix O.   


 
D.
 TRADING AND BROKERAGE PRACTICES   


 
1.
 Best Execution and Soft Dollar Arrangements 
 


 
a.
 Shenkman Capital has a duty to obtain best execution for its advisory clients securities transactions. To fulfill this obligation,
Shenkman Capital generally must execute securities transactions in such a manner that the clients total cost or proceeds in each transaction is the most favorable under the circumstances. The SEC has stated that in deciding what constitutes
best execution, the determinative factor is not the lowest possible price or commission cost, but whether the transaction represents the best qualitative execution. In seeking best execution, Shenkman Capital should consider the full range of the
brokers services, including the value of research provided, execution capability, commission rate, financial responsibility and responsiveness. The SEC has, however, indicated that an investment manager need not solicit competitive bids on
each transaction.   


 
b.
 The Compliance Officer will periodically monitor Shenkman Capitals trading to ensure that Shenkman Capital has obtained best execution in
accordance with the policies and procedures as set forth in Appendix C.   


 
c.
 Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 permits Shenkman Capital to pay more than the lowest available commission rate (or
otherwise pay up) to compensate that broker for research and other products and services that provide lawful and appropriate assistance to Shenkman Capital in carrying out its investment decision-making responsibilities (often referred
to as soft-dollar arrangements). Shenkman Capital does not currently participate in any soft dollar arrangements, although it may do so in the future. Therefore, all soft dollar arrangements must be reviewed by the Compliance Officer
before being implemented and will be in accordance with Shenkman Capitals policies and procedures concerning the use of soft dollars, as set forth in Appendix D from time to time. 
  5 




 
2.
 Client Directed Brokerage  Certain of Shenkman Capitals clients may direct that Shenkman Capital execute all or a portion of the transactions for such clients account through a specific broker, in return for such broker
providing the client with various services. This direction restricts Shenkman Capitals discretion to select brokers and negotiate commission rates and/or security prices and may adversely affect Shenkman Capitals ability to obtain best
price and execution. Accordingly, when a client directs brokerage to a specific broker, Shenkman Capital: (i) requires that the client provides such direction in writing to Shenkman Capital; and (ii) provides the client with appropriate
written disclosure. Shenkman Capital has adopted procedures regarding client directed brokerage, which are set forth in Appendix D.   


 
3.
 Trade Aggregation  Shenkman Capital may aggregate orders for its client accounts for trade execution with the same broker. When trades are aggregated, each participating account will generally be allocated securities on an
average price basis. Shenkman Capitals policies and procedures concerning trade aggregation are included in its trade allocation procedures, which are set forth in Appendix B. 
 


 
4.
 Principal and Cross Transactions   


 
a.
 Principal and Cross Transactions. Neither Shenkman Capital nor any of its affiliates may, directly or indirectly: (i) while acting as
principal for its own account, knowingly sell any security to, or purchase any security from, an advisory client; or (ii) while acting as broker for a person other than such client, knowingly effect any sale or purchase of any security for the
account of an advisory client without, in each case, disclosing to such client in writing, prior to the completion of such transaction, the capacity in which Shenkman Capital is acting, and obtaining the consent of the advisory client to the
transaction. Blanket consents (prior consent obtained to cover a category of transactions) are not sufficient for this purpose. The SEC does not consider an adviser to be acting as a broker for an account when the adviser does not receive additional
transaction-based compensation.   


 
b.
 Agency Cross Transactions. An agency cross transaction is a transaction in which an investment adviser acts as the broker for both the seller
and purchaser of a security (and either the seller or the purchaser is a client). Shenkman Capital may not participate in agency cross transactions.   


 
c.
 Transactions Between Client Accounts. From time to time, Shenkman Capital may seek to execute transactions between client accounts. Such
transactions must be pre-approved by the Compliance Officer. The Compliance Officer is responsible for ensuring that such transactions are conducted in accordance with Shenkman Capitals policies and procedures, as set forth in Appendix
E.   


 
5.
 Errors and Reallocations  Consistent with its fiduciary duties, Shenkman Capitals policy is to take the utmost care in making and implementing investment decisions for its client accounts. To the extent an error occurs,
Shenkman Capital seeks to ensure that its clients best interests are served. Shenkman Capitals policies and procedures concerning errors and reallocations are set forth in Appendix F. 
  6 




 
E.
 VALUATION   


 
1.
 Client account assets must be valued for all purposes in accordance with Shenkman Capitals procedures regarding valuation which are set forth
in Appendix G.   


 
2.
 If a Supervised Person believes that the existing valuation procedures do not provide for an accurate valuation of a particular asset or class of
assets in a clients account, he or she must report this matter immediately to the Compliance Officer.   


 
3.
 At least annually, the Compliance Officer will meet with Shenkman Capitals portfolio personnel to review the valuation procedures to determine
whether any revisions are necessary.   


 
F.
 INVESTMENT ADVISORY FEES   


 
1.
 Investment advisory fees should be accurately described in the Form ADV and documented in each clients written contract. Any changes to fee
arrangements with a client should be in writing.   


 
2.
 The bills and invoices Shenkman Capital provides to clients should be reviewed to ensure that all advisory fees are properly calculated.
  


 
3.
 Performance-based compensation is only permitted in accordance with the Advisers Act and the applicable rules. All such arrangements must be
reviewed by the Compliance Officer.   


 
4.
 Special requirements may apply to prepaid advisory fees and such arrangements must be reviewed by the Compliance Officer.
  


 
G.
 PROCEDURES TO PREVENT INSIDER TRADING 
Shenkman Capital has adopted and implemented written policies and procedures that are designed to prevent the misuse of
material nonpublic information by Shenkman Capital and its Supervised Persons. The Compliance Officer is responsible for the implementation of such procedures. Shenkman Capitals current written policies and procedures to detect and prevent
insider trading are set forth in Appendix H.   


 
H.
 CODE OF ETHICS  PERSONAL TRADING PROCEDURES 
Shenkman Capital and its Supervised Persons may effect transactions for their own accounts in the same securities
purchased and sold for the accounts of Shenkman Capitals clients. To ensure that trading by Shenkman Capital and its Supervised Persons is conducted in a manner that does not adversely affect Shenkman Capitals clients and in a manner
consistent with the fiduciary duty owed by Shenkman Capital to its clients, Shenkman Capital has adopted a Code of Ethics and Policies Governing Personal Securities Transactions, which is set forth in Appendix I. 
 


 
I.
 SAFEGUARDING OF CLIENT ASSETS   


 
1.
 If Shenkman Capital has or is deemed to have direct or indirect control over client assets, and, accordingly, has custody of such client assets,
such client securities and or funds must be held by qualified custodians and Shenkman Capital must comply with all other requirements of applicable rules. 
  7 




 
 Examples of circumstances in which Shenkman Capital will have custody of client assets include: (i) the receipt of securities litigation
settlement checks intended for a client (or former client); (ii) the receipt of a tax refund on behalf of a client (or former client); (iii) the receipt of stock certificates or dividend checks in the name of a client (or former client);
(iv) if Shenkman Capital calculates its advisory fee, bills the custodian and the custodian automatically deducts fees from client accounts (through arrangements with clients and the qualified custodian); (v) if Shenkman Capital or an
affiliate is a general partner of a limited partnership or managing member of a limited liability company, or holds a comparable position for a Sponsored Fund; and (vi) if Shenkman Capital or an affiliate is a trustee of a trust for the benefit
of a client.  If a Shenkman Capital team member inadvertently receives from non-clients:
(i) securities litigation settlement checks; (ii) tax refunds; (iii) stock certificates or dividend checks; or (iv) any other asset, certificate or document purporting to evidence ownership in an asset, in each case for or on
behalf of a current or former client, such team member should immediately advise the Compliance Officer. Furthermore, where appropriate, the Compliance Officer must promptly take the following steps: 
 


 
a.
 promptly identify the assets that it has inadvertently received from a non-client; 
 


 
b.
 promptly identify the client (or former client) to whom such assets are attributable; 
 


 
c.
 promptly forward the assets to its client (or former client) or a qualified custodian, but in no event later than five (5) business days
following Shenkman Capitals receipt of such assets;   


 
d.
 promptly return to the non-client sender any assets which Shenkman Capital does not forward to its client (or former client) or a qualified
custodian, but in no event later than five (5) business days following Shenkman Capitals receipt of such assets; and   


 
e.
 maintain and preserve appropriate records of all client assets inadvertently received by Shenkman Capital, including a written explanation of

APPENDIX I  CODE OF ETHICS AND POLICIES GOVERNING  PERSONAL SECURITIES
TRANSACTIONS  INTRODUCTION  This Code of Ethics and Policies Governing Personal Securities Transactions (the Code) has been adopted by Shenkman Capital with respect to Shenkman Capitals investment advisory services
to all of its clients (each, a Client), including U.S. registered investment companies or series thereof advised or sub-advised by Shenkman Capital (each, a Fund). The Code establishes standards and procedures for the
detection and prevention of inappropriate personal securities transactions by persons having knowledge of the investments and investment intentions of a Client and addresses other situations involving a potential conflict of interest. Definitions of
underlined terms are included in Annex 1.  This Code is intended to ensure that persons subject to the Code conduct
themselves in accordance with the following principles:   


 
(i)
 the duty at all times to place first the interests of Clients; 
 


 
(ii)
 the requirement that all personal securities transactions be conducted consistent with this Code and in such a manner as to avoid any actual or
potential conflict of interest or any abuse of an individuals responsibility and position of trust;   


 
(iii)
 the fundamental standard that Shenkman Capital personnel not take inappropriate advantage of their positions; and 
 


 
(iv)
 the duty at all times to comply with all applicable state and federal securities laws. 
 


1.
 WHO IS COVERED BY THIS CODE  This Code applies to all directors, officers and team members of Shenkman Capital. Certain provisions apply only to Access Persons and portfolio managers. Shenkman Capital forbids any Access
Person from engaging in any conduct that is contrary to this Code or Shenkman Capitals Policy and Procedures to Detect and Prevent Insider Trading and similar or related policies and procedures. All Access Persons are subject to the
Codes restrictions and requirements regarding opening securities accounts, effecting securities transactions, reporting securities transactions, maintaining information and documents in a confidential manner, and other matters. 
Any team member who becomes aware of a violation of this Code by any other team member must promptly report such
violation to the Chief Compliance Officer. Failure to comply with this Code is a very serious matter and may result in disciplinary action, including, among other things, monetary fines, profit disgorgement, and suspension or termination of
employment.   


2.
 PRE-CLEARANCE REQUIREMENT  Access Persons. All Access Persons must obtain prior written approval from the Review Officer (Richard Weinstein) or Assistant Review Officer (or other team member designated by the
Review Officer from time to time) before engaging in any personal securities transactions involving: (i) the securities of any company; (ii) shares of a Fund; (iii) an initial public offering; (iv) the private placement of
securities; and (v) an investment opportunity of limited availability. FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, ALL ACCESS PERSONS ARE REQUIRED TO PRE-CLEAR PERSONAL SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING THE SECURITIES OF 


INVESTMENT GRADE, HIGH YIELD RATED, AND NON-RATED COMPANIES. Approvals will
generally be valid until the close of business on the next business day after approval is granted.  This
pre-clearance requirement does not apply to transactions involving municipal bonds, mutual funds (other than a Fund), closed-end funds, exchange traded funds (ETFs), and exchange traded notes (ETNs).

(1)
 employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud a Client or engage in any manipulative practice with respect to a Client;

 Access Persons. In addition to the restrictions in Section 3(a), Access Persons are subject to the following restrictions:
  


 
(i)
 Blackout Period. Access Persons shall not purchase or sell a Covered Security that is held in a Client Account in a transaction
over which such Access Person has direct or indirect influence or control on a day during which he or she knew or should have known a Client Account has a pending buy or sell order in that same security until that
order is executed or withdrawn. For purposes of this Section 3, the: (i) common stock and any fixed income security of an issuer shall not be deemed to be the same security; (ii) non-convertible preferred stock of an issuer shall be
deemed to be the same security as the fixed income securities of that issuer; (iii) convertible preferred stock of an issuer shall be deemed to be the same security as both the common stock and fixed income securities of that issuer; and
(iv) the options of an issuer shall be deemed to be the same as the common stock of that issuer. 
  2 




 
(1)
 Blackout Period Exclusions. The following transactions shall not be prohibited by this Code and are not subject to the pre-clearance
requirements of Section 2 or the limitations of Section 3(b):

relationship with the Client. Any Access Persons who has taken a personal position through a private placement will be under an affirmative obligation to disclose that position in writing to the Review Officer or Assistant Review Officer if
he or she plays a material role in the Clients subsequent investment decision regarding the same issuer; this separate disclosure must be made even though the Access Persons has previously disclosed the ownership of the privately placed
security in compliance with the pre-clearance requirements of this section. Once disclosure is given, an independent review of the Clients investment decision will be made.

 any director or team member of Shenkman Capital, or other person, who provides investment advice on behalf of Shenkman Capital and is subject to the
supervision and control of Shenkman Capital who: (a) has access to non-public information regarding any Clients purchase or sale of securities, or non-public information regarding the portfolio holdings of any Fund; or (b) who is
involved in making securities recommendations to Clients, or who has access to such recommendations that are non-public; and

SHENKMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, INC. CODE OF ETHICS

Shenkman Capital Management, Inc. Code of Ethics
APPENDIX I 
CODE OF ETHICS AND POLICIES GOVERNING  PERSONAL SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS  INTRODUCTION 
This Code of Ethics and Policies Governing Personal Securities Transactions (the Code) has been adopted by Shenkman Capital with respect to
Shenkman Capitals investment advisory services to all of its clients (each, a Client), including U.S. registered investment companies or series thereof advised or sub-advised by Shenkman Capital (each, a Fund). The Code
establishes standards and procedures for the detection and prevention of inappropriate personal securities transactions by persons having knowledge of the investments and investment intentions of a Client and addresses other situations involving a
potential conflict of interest. Definitions of underlined terms are included in Annex 1.  This Code is intended to ensure that persons
subject to the Code conduct themselves in accordance with the following principles:   


 
(i)
the duty at all times to place first the interests of Clients;   


 
(ii)
the requirement that all personal securities transactions be conducted consistent with this Code and in such a manner as to avoid any actual or potential conflict of
interest or any abuse of an individuals responsibility and position of trust;   


 
(iii)
the fundamental standard that Shenkman Capital personnel not take inappropriate advantage of their positions; and 
 


 
(iv)
the duty at all times to comply with all applicable state and federal securities laws. 
 


1.
WHO IS COVERED BY THIS CODE  This Code applies to all directors, officers and team members of Shenkman Capital. Certain provisions apply only to Access Persons and portfolio managers. Shenkman Capital forbids any Access
Person from engaging in any conduct which is contrary to this Code or Shenkman Capitals Policies to Detect and Prevent Insider Trading and similar or related policies and procedures. All Access Persons are subject to the Codes
restrictions and requirements regarding opening securities accounts, effecting securities transactions, reporting securities transactions, maintaining information and documents in a confidential manner, and other matters. 
Failure to comply with this Code is a very serious matter and may result in disciplinary action, including, among other things, monetary
fines, profit disgorgement, and suspension or termination of employment.  PRE-CLEARANCE REQUIREMENT 
Access Persons. All Access Persons must obtain prior written approval from the Review Officer (Richard Weinstein) or
Assistant Review Officer (as designated by the Review Officer from time to time) before engaging in any personal securities transactions involving: (i) the securities of any company; (ii) shares of a Fund; (iii) an initial public
offering; (iv) the private placement of securities; and (v) an investment opportunity of limited availability. FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, ALL ACCESS PERSONS ARE REQUIRED TO PRE-CLEAR PERSONAL SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING THE
SECURITIES OF INVESTMENT GRADE, HIGH YIELD RATED, AND NON-RATED COMPANIES. Approvals will generally 



be valid until the close of business on the next business day after approval is granted.  This pre-clearance requirement does not apply to transactions involving municipal bonds, mutual funds (other than a Fund), closed-end funds, and exchange traded funds (ETFs). 
PROHIBITED TRANSACTIONS   


 
(a)
All Directors, Officers and Team Members:   


 
(i)
Prohibition Against Fraudulent Conduct. No director, officer or team member may use any information concerning a security held or to be acquired for a
Client Account or his or her ability to influence any investment decisions, for personal gain or in a manner detrimental to the interests of a Client. In addition, no director, officer or team member shall, directly or indirectly:
  


 
(1)
employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud a Client or engage in any manipulative practice with respect to a Client; 
 


 
(2)
make to a Client, any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state to a Client a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading;   


 
(3)
engage in any act, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon a Client; or 
 


 
(4)
engage in any manipulative practice with respect to a Client.   


 
(ii)
Confidentiality. Except as required in the normal course of carrying out their business responsibilities, no director, officer or team member shall reveal
information relating to the investment intentions or activities of any Client, or securities that are being considered for purchase or sale on behalf of any Client Account. 
 


 
(b)
Access Persons. In addition to the restrictions in Section 3(a), Access Persons are subject to the following restrictions: 
 


 
(i)
Blackout Period. Access Persons shall not purchase or sell a Covered Security that is held in a Client Account in a transaction over which such
Access Person has direct or indirect influence or control on a day during which he or she knew or should have known a Client Account has a pending buy or sell order in that same security until that order is executed or
withdrawn. For purposes of this Section 3, the: (i) common stock and any fixed income security of an issuer shall not be deemed to be the same security; (ii) non-convertible preferred stock of an issuer shall be deemed to be the same
security as the fixed income securities of that issuer; (iii) convertible preferred stock of an issuer shall be deemed to be the same security as both the common stock and fixed income securities of that issuer; and (iv) the options of an
issuer shall be deemed to be the same as the common stock of that issuer.   


 
(1)
 Blackout Period Exclusions. The following transactions shall not be 
  2 




 
 
prohibited by this Code and are not subject to the pre-clearance requirements of Section 2 or the limitations of Section 3(b): 
 


 
(A)
purchases or sales over which the Access Person has no direct or indirect influence or control (for this purpose, you are deemed to have direct or indirect
influence or control over the accounts of a spouse, minor children and relatives residing in the Access Persons home);   


 
(B)
purchases which are part of an automatic reinvestment plan;   


 
(C)
purchases or sales which are non-volitional on the part of the Access Person; and 
 


 
(D)
purchases effected upon the exercise of rights issued by an issuer pro rata to all holders of a class of its securities, to the extent such rights were acquired from
such issuer.   


 
(ii)
Undue Influence. Access Persons shall not cause or attempt to cause any Client Account to purchase, sell or hold any security in a manner calculated to
create any personal benefit to them and shall not recommend any securities transactions for a Client Account without having disclosed their interest, if any, in such securities or the issuer thereof, including, without limitation:
(i) Beneficial Ownership of any securities of such issuer; (ii) any position with such issuer or its affiliates; and (iii) any present or proposed business relationship between the Access Person (or any party in which he
or she has a significant interest) and such issuer or its affiliates.   


 
(iii)
Corporate Opportunities. Access Persons shall not take personal advantage of any opportunity properly belonging to a Client. 
 


 
(iv)
Other Prohibited Transactions. Access Persons shall not:   


 
(1)
induce or cause a Client Account to take actions or to fail to take action, for personal benefit rather than for the benefit of the Client Account;
  


 
(2)
establish or maintain an account at a broker-dealer, bank or other entity through which securities transactions may be effected without written notice to the Review
Officer or Assistant Review Officer prior to or promptly after establishing such an account;   


 
(3)
use knowledge of portfolio transactions of a Client Account for their personal benefit or the personal benefit of others; or 
 


 
(4)
violate the provisions of the federal or state securities laws.   


 
(c)
Initial Public Offerings. Access Persons may not directly or indirectly acquire securities in an initial public offering without prior written approval
from the Review Officer or Assistant Review Officer, which must be sought in accordance with the pre-clearance requirements of this section.   


 
(d)
 Private Placements. Access Persons may not directly or indirectly acquire securities in

  3 




 
 
a private placement unless the Review Officer or Assistant Review Officer determines whether the investment opportunity is appropriate, and therefore should be reserved, for a Client, and whether
such opportunity is being offered to the Access Persons by virtue of Shenkman Capitals relationship with the Client. Any Access Persons who has taken a personal position through a private placement will be under an affirmative
obligation to disclose that position in writing to the Review Officer or Assistant Review Officer if he or she plays a material role in the Clients subsequent investment decision regarding the same issuer; this separate disclosure must be made
even though the Access Persons has previously disclosed the ownership of the privately placed security in compliance with the pre-clearance requirements of this section. Once disclosure is given, an independent review of the Clients
investment decision will be made.   


 
(e)
Service As a Director. Access Persons shall not serve on the boards of directors of publicly traded companies, absent prior authorization based upon a
determination by the Review Officer or Assistant Review Officer that the board service would not conflict with the interests of any Client.   


 
(f)
Portfolio Managers. In addition to the restrictions set forth in this Section 3, no portfolio manager shall purchase or sell a Covered Security
within seven calendar days before a Client Account trades in that same security and such portfolio manager made or participated in making the recommendation to trade that security for a Client Account. Any profits realized on trades within this
proscribed period shall be disgorged and given to charity.  REPORTING REQUIREMENTS 
 


 
(a)
Reporting. Access Persons, must report to the Review Officer or Assistant Review Officer the information described in this Section with respect to

control or with respect to transactions effected pursuant to an automatic investment plan are not subject to the reporting requirements of this Section.

the making of any recommendations with respect to such purchases or sales;   


 
(ii)
any director or team member of Shenkman Capital, or other person, who provides investment advice on behalf of Shenkman Capital and is subject to the supervision and
control of Shenkman Capital who: (a) has access to non-public information regarding any Clients purchase or sale of securities, or non-public information regarding the portfolio holdings of any Fund; or (b) who is involved in making
securities recommendations to Clients, or who has access to such recommendations that are non-public; and   


 
(iii)
any natural person in a control relationship to Shenkman Capital who obtains information concerning recommendations made to a Client by Shenkman Capital with regard to
the purchase or sale of Covered Securities by Shenkman Capital on behalf of a Client Account.  Act means the
Investment Company of 1940, as amended.  Beneficial Owner shall have the meaning as that set forth in Rule 16a-1(a)(2)
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, except that the determination of direct or indirect beneficial ownership shall apply to all Covered Securities which an Access Person owns or acquires. A beneficial owner of a
security is any person who, directly or indirectly, through any contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship or otherwise, has or shares a direct or indirect pecuniary interest (the opportunity, directly or indirectly, to profit or
share in any profit derived from a transaction in the subject securities) in a security.  Indirect pecuniary interest in
a security includes securities held by a persons immediate family sharing the same household. Immediate family means any child, stepchild, grandchild, parent, stepparent, grandparent, spouse, sibling, mother-in-law, father-in-law,
son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law, or sister-in-law (including adoptive relationships).   


(d)
Control means the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of a company, unless this power is solely the result of an official
position with the company. Ownership of 25% or more of a companys outstanding voting securities is presumed to give the holder thereof control over the company. This presumption may be rebutted by the Review Officer or Assistant Review Officer
based upon the facts and circumstances of a given situation. 




(e)
Covered Security means any security except:   


 
(i)
direct obligations of the Government of the United States;   


 
(ii)
bankers acceptances and bank certificates of deposits;   


 
(iii)
commercial paper and debt instruments with a maturity at issuance of less than 366 days and that are rated in one of the two highest rating categories by a nationally
recognized statistical rating organization;   


 
(iv)
repurchase agreements covering any of the foregoing; and   


 
(v)
shares of registered open-end investment companies other than exchange-traded funds and a Fund. 
 


(f)
Purchase or sale includes, among other things, the writing of an option to purchase or sell. 
 


(g)
Security held or to be acquired by a Client Account means   


 
(i)
any Covered Security which, within the most recent 15 days (x) is or has been held by the applicable Client Account or (y) is being or has been
considered by the Client or its investment adviser for purchase by the applicable Client; and   


 
(ii)
any option to purchase or sell, and any security convertible into or exchangeable for, a Covered Security.
