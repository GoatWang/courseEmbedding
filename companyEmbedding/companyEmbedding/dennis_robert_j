The Project Manager's MBA: How to Translate Project Decisions into Business Success

Dennis J. Cohen, Robert J. Graham 
ISBN: 978-0-7879-5256-3
264 pages
November 2000, Jossey-Bass



Read an Excerpt


 
Excerpt 1: (PDF)


















Description
Project managers are no longer judged by the technical success of
their projects alone. They're also held accountable for their
contributions to the company's financial goals. Yet most project
managers don't have the business knowledge necessary to make
project-based decisions that lead to bottom-line success. In this
book, Dennis Cohen and Robert Graham, both former university
professors and experienced project management consultants, provide
the skills that, until now, could only be gained through a graduate
degree and years of hands-on experience. 
Cohen and Graham walk project managers through basic business
concepts such as value creation, accounting and finance, strategy,
and marketing. They connect these concepts to the decisions project
managers face every day. And they make it easy to apply the
resulting solutions on the job through a unique business systems
calculator. Readers can use the online calculator in conjunction
with the book to understand how different project variables affect
business outcomes, to determine the overall impact of proposed
project changes, and to evaluate the economic results of many
decisions they make.
Cohen and Graham's principles apply equally to projects in
business, non-profit, and government organizations. And each one is
illustrated through case studies drawn from a range of industries,
including pharmaceuticals, the technology sector, even the
winemaking business. Whether the mandate is to get new products to
market, improve the infrastructure, or better serve customers and
clients, this book teaches project managers how to make day-to-day
decisions from an upper-management perspective. And it provides a
blueprint for planning and pitching potential projects that
demonstrates a higher level of business savvy.

Reviews
"This book touches on issues that are critical to a project's
success but are frequently ignored by project managers. I consider
this a must-read for anyone who wants to manage projects
effectively." --Judd Kuehn, senior project management consultant,
Chevron USA Inc.

"Dennis Cohen and Bob Graham, two pioneers in the development of
project management education materials, produce a book that further
enhances their status as icons in the field. This book provides the
knowledge and skill project managers need to integrate their
projects into the total business enterprise." --Paul C. Dinsmore,
author, Winning in Business with Enterprise Project
Management

"Cohen and Graham have presented a provocative view of the project
manager's role that will stretch, expand, and challenge skill-sets
and perspectives. It will prompt project managers and their teams
to not only manage their projects well, but to look beyond to the
larger organizational and financial contexts in which their
projects reside and contribute. This is a critical mindset and
paradigm shift for tomorrow's successful project managers!"
--Robert Storeygard, project leadership specialist, 3M Learning
Center-Business Acumen-Project Management and Teamwork Group

"This book is both timely and informative, a must-read, as the
project manager evoles from a project-centric focus to a business
focus. Bob and Dennis use an easy-to-read style with lots of
examples to transform abstract financial concepts into something
less intimidating." --Gregory M. Willits, project management
process champion, Motorola
