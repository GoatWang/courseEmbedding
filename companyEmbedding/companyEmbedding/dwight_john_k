                    Company: Who We Are:  History



 


Our Founders 
Our Beginning 
Our Brand 
Our Reach 



Previous Next 
Our Founders 
Austin Church was born in 1799, at East Haddam, Connecticut. He studied medicine at Yale and received his doctorate in 1823. After marrying Nancy Dwight, Dr. Church moved to Hartford, Connecticut, and later lived in Rochester, New York. 
Nancy Dwight’s brother, John, was born in South Hadley, Massachusetts in 1819, a descendant of the John Dwight who was born in England in 1600 and settled in Deedham, Massachusetts. 
In 1846, these two New Englanders first prepared a product that would become a household name: bicarbonate of soda — that is, baking soda. 

Previous Next 
Our Beginning 
Church and Dwight’s first factory was the kitchen of the latter’s home, with baking soda packed in paper bags by hand. (Today, pure bicarbonate of soda is processed and packed by specialized modern machinery, never touched by human hands.)   
A year later, in 1847, John Dwight and Company was formed. Dwight’s saleratus, “aerated salt,” adopted the Cow Brand as its trademark (owing to the use of sour milk with saleratus in baking). The standard package of the product weighed one pound. 

Previous Next 
Our Brand 
Due to its popularity among consumers, Dr. Church saw a growing need and demand for baking soda. He developed larger production facilities and formed a partnership, Church & Company, with his sons, James A. Church and E. Dwight Church. They trademarked their product under the brand ARM & HAMMER™. 
In 1896, the descendants of Austin Church and John Dwight consolidated their interests under the name of Church & Dwight Co., Inc.    

Previous Next 
Our Reach 
Baking soda is now found in nearly every kitchen in the country, regarded as a necessity by millions of American consumers. 
Of course, baking soda is no longer confined to the kitchen. It is used throughout the house, in every phase of housekeeping and personal hygiene. ARM & HAMMER™ Baking Soda, which was first prepared in a New England village, now is used the world over.

Mr. Dwight has more than 20 years' experience as a director of a publicly-held bank holding company, having served as a director and member of the audit committee of Eastern Bancorp, Inc. (parent of Vermont Federal Bank), a director of Vermont Financial Services Corporation (parent of Vermont National Bank), and a director of Chittenden (parent of multiple banks). 

In evaluating Mr. Dwight's qualifications as a director, the board considered the contribution that his extensive expertise in the area of asset management and his considerable financial acumen has made to his board service. The board determined that he brings to his role as director a strong proficiency in the area of analyzing and evaluating both company financial statements and complex financial instruments, which enhances his service not only as a member of the board but also as a member of its Enterprise Risk Committee and as chair of the Treasury and Finance Committee, and as a member of the Bank's Trust Committee. 

The board also determined that the diversity of perspective of the board as a whole benefits from Mr. Dwight's status as a resident of Vermont and a very active member of the greater Burlington, Vermont community. We have extensive operations in Vermont by virtue of our 2008 acquisition of Chittenden.
