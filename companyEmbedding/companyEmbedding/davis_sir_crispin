    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV
License: CC-BY

2 GB gzip8 GB uncompressed

Download



The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

      "Crispin is a highly accomplished media executive whose strategic vision

      Davis was the chief executive officer of Reed Elsevier from 1999-2009

      "Crispin's proven leadership and exceptional track record of

      successfully transforming a company while managing challenging global

      issues will be a valuable asset to Hasbro's Board," said Basil Anderson,

      Hasbro's Lead Independent Director.

    


      Prior to joining Reed Elsevier, Davis served for five years as chief

      executive officer of Aegis Group, PLC, a media and digital marketing

      communications company, where he developed the firm's research

      capabilities and expanded its geographic reach. Previously, Davis was

      the group managing director at Guinness Plc. (now Diageo).

    


      Davis graduated from Oxford University. He began his career with Proctor

      & Gamble in 1970 and served with the company for 20 years, including as

      President of the Company's US Food Division.

    


      Davis currently serves on the Board of Vodafone Group, Plc., a global

      telecommunications company where he is a member of the firm's Audit and

      Risk Committee. He previously served on the Board of Glaxo Smith Kline

      Plc., including as Chairman of the Remuneration Committee. He is also a

      member of Oxford University's Council of the University.

the high court judge states categorically that he was not aware at 
the time that his brother, Sir Crispin Davis, was a non-executive director of GSK, one of three defendant drug 
companies in the MMR controversy.  But when the Eye and others asked his office about a potential conflict five 
months ago, a statement was issued on his behalf which said: "In 2003, Mr 
Justice Davis's brother was appointed as a non-executive director of GSK. At the 
date of the hearing before Mr Justice (February 2004), the possibility of any 
conflict of interest arising from his brother's position was not raised with him 
and did not occur to him. If he was wrong, any possible remedy must be sought in 
the court of appeal."

by Alex Constantine  Reed Elsevier's science and medicine division, 
Elsevier, publishes 500 handbooks and journals, including The Lancet, while its 
subsidiary, Reed Exhibitions, hosts arms fairs around the world....."We find 
ourselves in a situation where our parent company is filling an absolutely 
critical part in the arms trade. We're horrified and embarrassed and we want 
them to stop," says Horton, adding that The Lancet has had "endless" 
conversations with Reed Elsevier about the conflict.....In March, 59 of The 
Lancet's 83 editorial consultants sent a letter to Reed Elsevier's CEO, Sir 
Crispin Davis (above), giving him 3 weeks to respond to a series of questions 
concerning the company's involvement in arms fairs. Photo by: Courtesy of Reed 
Elsevier....."Our defence shows are quality businesses which have performed well 
in recent years," said chief executive Sir Crispin Davis....."We have 
listened closely to these concerns and this has led us to conclude that the 
defence shows are no longer compatible with Reed Elsevier's position as a 
leading publisher of scientific, medical, legal and business content."
