 Reliable String Lights for Indoor and Outdoor Displays
 LED Christmas lights are brighter than their incandescent equivalents while using less power, so you can make the most of your holiday decorations without breaking the bank or blowing a fuse. With colors from pure white to green and pink, our LED C6 string lights are an excellent addition to your indoor and outdoor Christmas decor this year. All of our LED string lights are single piece molded construction, meaning the bulbs cannot be replaced. This protects from water invading the sockets, making them safe for outdoor use. Because our C6 string lights are fully rectified, if one bulb goes out, the others will stay lit. 
 Color Options
Choose from a variety of color options, including multi-colored lights for festive outdoor decorations that are sure to get your home noticed. We also sell multiple shades of white string lights so be careful not to mix them up if you want your lights to match. Unlike the traditional warm white lights that are around 3000 Kelvin in color, the pure white lights are cooler in color, bordering on blue, around 4000 Kelvin. Our champagne light strings are even warmer with a color temperature around 2200 Kelvin. Please note that our purple lights tend to appear closer to red than blue on the purple scale.

Authentic Reproduction of Propellers used in WWI

 Flying machines filling the skies during WWI and the Roaring Twenties featured wooden propellers similar to this. Massive engines of the era were brought to life by giving the prop a hefty swing. This authentic reproduction is hand-crafted of solid wood, just like the originals. Available is a 6’ Vintage flight propeller with tin-hammered blades and an unrivaled, hand-rubbed finish.  Includes hanging hardware.Read moreAuthentic Reproduction of Propellers used in WWI

Nice prop.
Over all, it's a nice decoration. No pilot is going to mistake it for the real thing, but that's ok. It's lighter than it looks. Comes with all the hardware to mount it. Made in China.

                    In June 2003, Truett Craft purchased a 150-acre agricultural tract near the southwest corner of Frankford and 98th Street located in the Lubbock-Cooper Independent School District.  The initial Master Plan called for 470 single-family residences and 88 garden homes.  Truett designed the location for the garden homes in the center of the subdivision with only one entrance.  It was his expectation to have an ideal quiet location with rear entry garages for retirees. 

Truett wanted the subdivision to be complete with an elementary school and a church.  Truett was the son of a Methodist preacher and he donated the southwest corner of 98th and Frankford to St. Luke's Methodist Church.  

Lakewood Estates was built in a series of cul-de-sacs that includes triple cul-de-sacs that give an added measure of security to the addition.
The main builders in the subdivision for single-family homes are: Creative Homes, David Rogers Homes, Gerald Long Builders, Kim Craig Construction, and Art Cuevas.  Garden home builders include: Joanie Coles, Truett Craft, and Art Cuevas

Description
Let this durable string of LED C6 warm white bulbs take the worry out of your holiday lighting display. Using 10 times less energy than incandescent, the 35 faceted Christmas light bulbs are spaced 6 inches apart on green wire making them perfect for use on outdoor or indoor trees and in general decorating. UL listed for indoor and outdoor use, 80 sets of these 18 foot strings can be connected end-to-end. These lights won't let you down because when one bulb goes out, the rest stay lit.
