										Investment Management
									






Investment ManagementAt Old Dominion Capital Management, Inc., we believe investors benefit from being broadly diversified across many different asset classes, and we strive to increase this benefit by using some asset classes that are not closely correlated.  We use broad diversification in an effort to provide high quality portfolios that combine lower degrees of volatility with reasonable long-term results.  
 
In service to your personal goals regarding return and regarding risk avoidance, we offer four distinct categories of investment strategy: conservative growth, moderate growth, growth, and aggressive growth. We also customize our investment solutions to account for individual circumstances.
Our Investment Process Because your financial picture is unlike any other, we begin by helping you define your investment objectives and constraints. This process helps us build a personalized strategy -- a working template that will evolve with your changing financial needs and circumstances. Your written investment policy statement will specify your investment objectives, risk tolerance, expected cash flows, asset allocation, and any special circumstances. We will review and update your investment policy statement together at least twice a year to ensure it remains consistent with your current goals. 
As an individual investor, your assets are held in your own name at a third-party brokerage firm, typically Charles Schwab & Co, Inc., where we have a very good service arrangement through their institutional support operation. The brokerage firm delivers account statements on a monthly basis and provides online account access via its website. Your updated account information is also available 24/7 on our own website, and Old Dominion Capital Management, Inc. will also provide you with a personalized quarterly account statement as well as our quarterly newsletter, which provides our own perspective on current market conditions and our strategy.
Our Commitment to Technology Leadership
As a firm, we are committed to being industry leaders in leveraging technology to deliver effective, efficient service to our clients. We have implemented new technologies to drive efficiencies across our investment research, portfolio management, and trading platforms. Our firm has served as a beta test site for portfolio management software, internet-based security trading systems, and the development of interactive internet websites. While we have the research and technological capabilities of many larger firms, our smaller relative size allows us to provide a level of personal service and attention to clients that is sometimes difficult to find in many larger organizations.

How long has Old Dominion Capital Management, Inc. been in business?
We started our business in Charlottesville, Virginia in January of 1989 and now also have an office in Alexandria, Virginia. Although our offices are both located in the state of Virginia, we serve clients in over half the states in the U.S. 
What types of investment strategies do you offer?
At Old Dominion Capital Management, Inc., we believe investors benefit from being broadly diversified across many different asset classes, and we strive to increase this benefit by using some asset classes that are not closely correlated.  We use broad diversification in an effort to provide high quality portfolios that combine lower degrees of volatility with reasonable long-term results.. Within this basic philosophy, we offer conservative growth, moderate growth, growth, and aggressive growth strategies according to each client’s desire for return and for risk avoidance. We also customize our investment solutions to account for individual circumstances.
What financial planning services do you offer?
We offer a full range of financial planning services, including retirement planning (both accumulation of assets for retirement and the sustainable distribution of retirement income), estate planning and wealth transfer, insurance and risk management, employee benefits, and charitable giving. 
What is different about your approach? 
Because we believe it is critical to making good financial decisions, we offer integrated financial planning services at no additional fee. These financial planning services work hand-in-hand with our diversified investment strategies.  We work closely with accountants and attorneys to ensure that these advisors have the information they need to do the best job for our shared clients. We strive to be a central source of financial advice as we get to know our clients and develop long-term relationships. 
What is the value of a fee-only advisor?
We insist on offering professional and unbiased advice to our clients. As fee-only advisors, we are paid a percentage of assets under management and receive no commissions or mark-ups on transactions. We are rewarded for maximizing our clients’ assets, and our no-commission structure ensures that we are always working in the best interests of our clients.
What do you charge for your services?
Every client is charged based on assets under management (AUM). With a minimum fee of $6,000 per year, clients are charged 1% of AUM for the first $2,000,000, 0.8% for the next $3,000,000, and 0.6% for AUM over $5,000,000.
Do you have a minimum account size requirement?
We generally charge a minimum fee of $6,000 per year, which would be the standard fee on a $600,000 account. In certain circumstances we are willing to aggregate various family accounts to make this minimum easier to attain.
Do you charge an additional fee for financial planning?
No. We believe that investment management and financial planning are both critical parts of the service we offer, and our standard fee covers both. 
How can I have reasonable assurance that I will not outlive my money?
It is important to employ an investment strategy that offers the opportunity for reasonable investment returns while reducing the possibility of disastrous investment results. The appropriate balance of risk and expected return differs according to each client’s specific circumstances. It is also critical to set sustainable spending targets and to regularly revisit the assumptions and unfolding realities that underlie those targets. That is why we create a lifetime spending plan for each client and keep it up to date. 
What is the best way to maximize my investment income?
Particularly in these times of very low interest rates, few people have the ability to generate the investment income that they need from dividends and interest alone. Because the goal of generating adequate income must be balanced with the goals of offsetting future inflation, earning a high investment return, and protecting the portfolio value from both rising interest rates (falling bond prices) and falling interest rates (falling income), we take a “total return” approach to income generation. Using a very broad range of investment asset classes, we arrange for regular income distributions, replenishing the portfolio cash from dividend income, interest income, and realized capital appreciation.How do I get started with your services?The first step is to talk with one of our investment professionals to determine whether we are a good fit for one another. Once we agree that we can work effectively as a team, we will guide you through the steps to getting your financial matters in order and working toward meeting your life goals.

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Time (NYSE:TIME) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 4 Hold Ratings, 1 Buy RatingConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.20)Consensus Price Target: $15.20 (7.04% upside)

We analyzed their goals and completed a full retirement cash flow analysis. Through this analysis, we were able to determine that Tom and Katie could, in fact, afford to retire at age 65 and maintain a comfortable standard of living. We worked closely with them to monitor the retirement plan and ensure their financial situation remained on track for the long term.PlanningFinancial PlanningFinancial planning is extremely personal. Not only is every individual's financial situation unique, but every person has deep-rooted attitudes, comfort levels, and perspectives regarding money and finances. At Old Dominion Capital Management, Inc., we believe that providing true service to our clients means honoring every individual, working closely with you to understand what makes you distinct, evaluating your unique financial situation, and identifying a financial planning strategy that fits your needs, goals, and beliefs.Retirement PlanningAs talk of the possibility of tax reform continues in Washington, there's an increased focus on the rules for "stretch IRAs." This retirement planning technique, which enables you to preserve assets in an inherited IRA for an extended period, could be targeted in a larger tax reform package. For the time being, however, stretch IRA planning remains a viable option for many people.Annuities3. Charitable gift annuities: This approach is somewhat more sophisticated than direct gifts and donor-advised funds. A charitable gift annuity is a contract between a donor and a charity. You agree to transfer money, securities, or other assets to the organization, which in turn agrees to make specified payments to "annuitants"—usually you or you and someone else you designate.Long Term Care2. Your health care costs could go up. Some people think they'll have it made when they reach age 65 and become eligible for Medicare. While Medicare may reduce your health insurance outlays, you'll still likely need supplemental insurance, and there will be out-of-pocket expenses. And what if you need long-term care? In 2016, the average cost of a private room in a U.S. nursing home was $7,698 per month, according to the Genworth Cost of Care survey. That's more than $92,000 a year.Asset ManagementThe first concern was to ensure Carla had adequate cash available to meet her immediate needs. Our team helped her convert the existing joint checking account and several other joint accounts into her own name. Next, we helped her file for life insurance benefits on five different policies. We helped consolidate her accounts, and then worked with her to determine her personal investment goals. We agreed on an income figure and arranged for automatic monthly electronic transfer of that amount to her checking account. Our team then suggested a strategy to immediately begin diversifying the investments and to complete that process over a specified time period. We collaborated on an asset allocation and a long-term investment strategy that took into account her income needs, risk tolerance, desire for reasonable long-term return, and the tax implications of these issues.Charitable Remainder Trusts6. Meeting charitable intentions. You can use a trust to direct donations to a charity both while you're alive and after your death. With a charitable remainder trust (CRT), your family can receive regular payments during your lifetime, with the remainder of the assets going to the charity when you die. A charitable lead trust (CLT) reverses that equation, providing current income to a charity and then directing the assets that remain at your death to your beneficiaries. In either case, establishing the trust is likely to reduce your taxes.Charitable Lead Trusts4. Charitable trusts: There are two main types to consider: the charitable remainder trust (CRT) and the charitable lead trust (CLT).College FundingWill your child enter college soon? However much you have managed to save, it may fall short of the very high cost of today's higher education. Financial aid—in the form of grants, loans, or work-study programs—could help make up the difference, but your child will have to apply for this needs-based aid, and that means completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA.InvestmentWealth ManagementAlexandria, VA. Founded in 1989, we provide a full spectrum of wealth management services. We are a registered investment advisor with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Today we manage assets for over 300 client relationships throughout the United States.Investment ManagementJim's primary responsibilities include oversight of client services, and he is also involved in security selection and investment strategy for the firm. With more than 30 years of professional investment management experience, he co-founded Old Dominion Capital Management in 1989 after working as an investment broker with A.G. Edwards and Sons, Inc. A graduate of the University of Virginia, he received the Chartered Financial Analyst designation from the CFA Institute.Mutual Funds2. Conduct an inventory. Now is a good time to compile a list of your assets. This may include: stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and other investments; amounts that you've transferred to trusts; retirement plan and IRA funds; and proceeds that will be available from life insurance policies. Also, review any agreements made during the course of your first marriage. For instance, if you were required to name your then-spouse as the beneficiary of your retirement plan accounts, you may have less flexibility than you thought.BondsTaxesTax PlanningCharitable GivingWe offer a full range of financial planning services, including retirement planning (both accumulation of assets for retirement and the sustainable distribution of retirement income), estate planning and wealth transfer, insurance and risk management, employee benefits, and charitable giving.Estate TaxesAvoiding Probate1. Avoiding probate. Assets distributed according to the provisions of your will must go through a process known as probate, governed by state law. In some states, this can be extremely lengthy and costly, especially if your will is contested. What's more, your will is open to public inspection—anyone can find out what you're giving to which beneficiaries. Assets transferred to a trust, however, are exempt from probate. When you die, the trustee of a trust can quickly—and privately—distribute your worldly goods to the beneficiaries you've chosen.Tax ServicesRoth IRAThese rules cover assets in traditional IRAs. There are different requirements for Roth IRAs, from which most distributions, even by beneficiaries, are tax-free. The original account holders don't have to take RMDs, although beneficiaries are required to withdraw money each year according to schedules based on their life expectancies.Real Estate TaxesMistake 5. Being handicapped by your biggest asset. It's often hard to give up the home in which you raised your children. However, at some point during retirement, it may become too expensive to live there. Even if you've paid off your mortgage, you'll still be responsible for real estate taxes, repairs, and utilities, which could add up to thousands of dollars a month. Selling the old homestead and then buying a smaller place could free up your equity while reducing your costs.Tax DeductionsHow can you donate to charity? Let us count the ways. Although there are many variations on these themes, there are four basic paths for making contributions to charitable organizations that let you take tax deductions while pursuing your philanthropic goals. They are...Income TaxHow much in income taxes will you pay? Use this 1040 tax calculator to help determine your tax bill for next April.Capital Gains Taxes5. Estate taxes. Trump has proposed to repeal the federal estate tax. In addition, he has called for eliminating the tax rule allowing heirs to adjust the taxable basis of inherited property to its value at the death of the person making the bequest. This so-called step-up in basis may reduce capital gains taxes on inherited assets. The proposed changes could cause income tax complications for some taxpayers.Tax Return PreparationJeff’s primary responsibilities include client service and financial planning for Old Dominion. Prior to joining the firm, he provided income tax return preparation and analysis for clients, and as an enrolled agent, represented clients in the resolution of tax disputes. He also has extensive experience as a Montana trout fishing guide.Send to PhoneOld Dominion Capital Management Inc815 E Jefferson St, Charlottesville, VA 22902(434) 270-0608Send this business listing as a text message to a mobile phone.I agree to the Terms and ConditionsCancelSendYour text message was sent.To opt out at anytime, send the word STOP to YP411.To get a help message, send the word HELP to YP411.There was an error sending your text.Please try again.E-MailOld Dominion Capital Management Inc815 E Jefferson St, Charlottesville, VA 22902(434) 270-0608Send this business details to yourself or up to 5 friends.Up to 5 email addresses, separate addresses with a commaSend Yourself a CopyCancelSend
