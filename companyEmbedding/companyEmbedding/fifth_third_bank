If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

History[edit]

Fifth Third Bank's corporate history began on June 17, 1858, when the Bank of the Ohio Valley opened in Cincinnati. Five years later, the Third National Bank organized on June 23, 1863. On April 29, 1871, the younger bank acquired the older one, beginning a long history of acquisitions and mergers that absorbed and renamed numerous smaller banks.[3]
The Fifth Third name[edit]
Fifth Third's unusual name is the result of the June 1, 1908, merger of Third National Bank and Fifth National Bank, to become the Fifth-Third National Bank of Cincinnati (the hyphen was later dropped).[3] While Third National was the senior partner, the merger took place when prohibitionist ideas were gaining popularity, and it is legend that "Fifth Third" was better than "Third Fifth," which could have been construed as a reference to three fifths of alcohol.[4] The name went through several changes over the years until March 24, 1969, when it was changed to Fifth Third Bank.[3]

Acquisitions and mergers[edit]




The Fifth Third footprint


In 1999, the company completed the acquisition of Enterprise Federal Bancorp Inc., one of the biggest thrifts in the Cincinnati area. The purchase, estimated at $96.4 million, added 11 branches to Fifth Third in greater Cincinnati. Fifth Third also acquired Ashland Bankshares, Inc. and its subsidiary Bank of Ashland, both based in Kentucky. The $80-million purchase gave Fifth Third four more branches and $160 million in assets. Fifth Third also began to implement plans to expand further into Florida and acquired South Florida Bank Holding Corp. in June, adding another four branches to its Florida roster. Additional expansion into the Cleveland area came with the $204-million acquisition of Emerald Financial Corp. Fifth Third also acquired Cleveland-based Emerald Financial Corp. and its subsidiary, Strongsville Savings Bank.
In November 2000, Fifth Third announced the purchase of Old Kent Bank of Western Michigan. This added more than 300 full-service banking centers in Indiana, Illinois and Michigan.[5]
In May 2007, Fifth Third announced the acquisition of R-G Crown Bank of Casselberry, Florida, a transaction that closed in the fourth quarter of 2007 and which added 30 branches in Florida and three in Georgia.[6]
On August 16, 2007, Fifth Third announced the purchase of First Charter Bank of Charlotte, North Carolina.[7] As part of this transaction, Fifth Third entered the North Carolina market with 57 branches, and the Atlanta market with two branches.[8] The Federal Reserve Board approved the transaction for Fifth Third Bank to acquire First Charter, April 16, 2008.[9] The acquisition completed in June 2008.[10]
On September 25, 2007, Fifth Third announced the acquisition of nine branch locations in Atlanta, GA, from First Horizon National Corporation.[11] First Horizon canceled the sale February 7, 2008, as the sale price suddenly became unacceptable to FHN. Then, news outlets reported that the sale was reinstated March 25, 2008.[12]
On October 31, 2008, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) announced that all deposits of Florida-based Freedom Bank, which ceased operation that day, would be assumed by Fifth Third Bank.[13]
On March 30, 2009, Fifth Third announced a joint venture with Advent International, in which Advent would purchase 51% of its credit card processing business, Fifth Third Processing Solutions. The new company Fifth Third Processing Solutions LLC began operation June 2009.[14]
Fifth Third was rumored to be one of the front runners alongside Huntington Bancshares to buy the National City branches in the Pittsburgh and Erie regions that the United States Department of Justice required PNC Financial Services to sell as part of PNC's 2008 acquisition of National City.[15] Had Fifth Third bought the branches, it would have greatly expanded the bank's presence in the Pittsburgh region where Fifth Third has opened a small handful of branches over the past few years as opposed to acquiring a rival bank, as well as enter the Erie market. Ultimately, PNC sold the bulk of the overlapping branches to First Niagara Bank. In 2015, Fifth Third announced it would exit the Pittsburgh market by selling its retail branches to locally based FNB Corporation, but it would continue to do commercial banking in Pittsburgh.[16]
On October 28, 2014, Fifth Third announced plans to move its Michigan regional headquarters from Southfield to downtown Detroit in what will be named the Fifth Third Bank Building at One Woodward. The bank will occupy about 62,000 sq ft (5,800 m2) of the structure and has also pledged to invest $85 million in the city of Detroit.[17] The office had 150 employees.[18]
Controversies[edit]
2007 data breach[edit]
In January 2007, The New York Times published an article entitled Data Breach Could Affect Millions stating "Yesterday, Fifth Third Bank of Cincinnati was identified as the sponsoring bank that handles TJX’s accounts, which makes it responsible for ensuring that the retailer met the industry’s data security standards."[19] It was later found that potentially 45.7 million credit card numbers were compromised. This, from the Associated Press, "TJX says its computer systems were first breached in July 2005 by a hacker or hackers who accessed information from customer transactions dating to January 2003. TJX says it didn’t learn of the breach until about three months ago.... The filing also says, “We believe that the intruder had access to the decryption tool for the encryption software utilized by TJX.”[20]
2014 Discrimination Settlement[edit]
In August 2014, the Department of Justice filed a settlement with Fifth Third Mortgage Company resolving allegations that the bank engaged in a pattern of discrimination on the basis of disability and receipt of public assistance in violation of Equal Credit Opportunity Act. Under the settlement, Fifth Third was required to establish a settlement fund of $1.5 million to compensate eligible mortgage loan applicants who were asked to provide a letter from their doctor to document the income they received from Social Security Disability Insurance.[21]

History[edit]

Fifth Third Bank's corporate history began on June 17, 1858, when the Bank of the Ohio Valley opened in Cincinnati. Five years later, the Third National Bank organized on June 23, 1863. On April 29, 1871, the younger bank acquired the older one, beginning a long history of acquisitions and mergers that absorbed and renamed numerous smaller banks.[3]
The Fifth Third name[edit]
Fifth Third's unusual name is the result of the June 1, 1908, merger of Third National Bank and Fifth National Bank, to become the Fifth-Third National Bank of Cincinnati (the hyphen was later dropped).[3] While Third National was the senior partner, the merger took place when prohibitionist ideas were gaining popularity, and it is legend that "Fifth Third" was better than "Third Fifth," which could have been construed as a reference to three fifths of alcohol.[4] The name went through several changes over the years until March 24, 1969, when it was changed to Fifth Third Bank.[3]

Acquisitions and mergers[edit]




The Fifth Third footprint


In 1999, the company completed the acquisition of Enterprise Federal Bancorp Inc., one of the biggest thrifts in the Cincinnati area. The purchase, estimated at $96.4 million, added 11 branches to Fifth Third in greater Cincinnati. Fifth Third also acquired Ashland Bankshares, Inc. and its subsidiary Bank of Ashland, both based in Kentucky. The $80-million purchase gave Fifth Third four more branches and $160 million in assets. Fifth Third also began to implement plans to expand further into Florida and acquired South Florida Bank Holding Corp. in June, adding another four branches to its Florida roster. Additional expansion into the Cleveland area came with the $204-million acquisition of Emerald Financial Corp. Fifth Third also acquired Cleveland-based Emerald Financial Corp. and its subsidiary, Strongsville Savings Bank.
In November 2000, Fifth Third announced the purchase of Old Kent Bank of Western Michigan. This added more than 300 full-service banking centers in Indiana, Illinois and Michigan.[5]
In May 2007, Fifth Third announced the acquisition of R-G Crown Bank of Casselberry, Florida, a transaction that closed in the fourth quarter of 2007 and which added 30 branches in Florida and three in Georgia.[6]
On August 16, 2007, Fifth Third announced the purchase of First Charter Bank of Charlotte, North Carolina.[7] As part of this transaction, Fifth Third entered the North Carolina market with 57 branches, and the Atlanta market with two branches.[8] The Federal Reserve Board approved the transaction for Fifth Third Bank to acquire First Charter, April 16, 2008.[9] The acquisition completed in June 2008.[10]
On September 25, 2007, Fifth Third announced the acquisition of nine branch locations in Atlanta, GA, from First Horizon National Corporation.[11] First Horizon canceled the sale February 7, 2008, as the sale price suddenly became unacceptable to FHN. Then, news outlets reported that the sale was reinstated March 25, 2008.[12]
On October 31, 2008, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) announced that all deposits of Florida-based Freedom Bank, which ceased operation that day, would be assumed by Fifth Third Bank.[13]
On March 30, 2009, Fifth Third announced a joint venture with Advent International, in which Advent would purchase 51% of its credit card processing business, Fifth Third Processing Solutions. The new company Fifth Third Processing Solutions LLC began operation June 2009.[14]
Fifth Third was rumored to be one of the front runners alongside Huntington Bancshares to buy the National City branches in the Pittsburgh and Erie regions that the United States Department of Justice required PNC Financial Services to sell as part of PNC's 2008 acquisition of National City.[15] Had Fifth Third bought the branches, it would have greatly expanded the bank's presence in the Pittsburgh region where Fifth Third has opened a small handful of branches over the past few years as opposed to acquiring a rival bank, as well as enter the Erie market. Ultimately, PNC sold the bulk of the overlapping branches to First Niagara Bank. In 2015, Fifth Third announced it would exit the Pittsburgh market by selling its retail branches to locally based FNB Corporation, but it would continue to do commercial banking in Pittsburgh.[16]
On October 28, 2014, Fifth Third announced plans to move its Michigan regional headquarters from Southfield to downtown Detroit in what will be named the Fifth Third Bank Building at One Woodward. The bank will occupy about 62,000 sq ft (5,800 m2) of the structure and has also pledged to invest $85 million in the city of Detroit.[17] The office had 150 employees.[18]
Controversies[edit]
2007 data breach[edit]
In January 2007, The New York Times published an article entitled Data Breach Could Affect Millions stating "Yesterday, Fifth Third Bank of Cincinnati was identified as the sponsoring bank that handles TJX’s accounts, which makes it responsible for ensuring that the retailer met the industry’s data security standards."[19] It was later found that potentially 45.7 million credit card numbers were compromised. This, from the Associated Press, "TJX says its computer systems were first breached in July 2005 by a hacker or hackers who accessed information from customer transactions dating to January 2003. TJX says it didn’t learn of the breach until about three months ago.... The filing also says, “We believe that the intruder had access to the decryption tool for the encryption software utilized by TJX.”[20]
2014 Discrimination Settlement[edit]
In August 2014, the Department of Justice filed a settlement with Fifth Third Mortgage Company resolving allegations that the bank engaged in a pattern of discrimination on the basis of disability and receipt of public assistance in violation of Equal Credit Opportunity Act. Under the settlement, Fifth Third was required to establish a settlement fund of $1.5 million to compensate eligible mortgage loan applicants who were asked to provide a letter from their doctor to document the income they received from Social Security Disability Insurance.[21]

Fifth Third Bank Sets the Bar High With Exceptional Banking Products
By Valencia Higuera
June 12, 2013









Headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio, Fifth Third Bank is a regional bank that offers a variety of financial services from credit cards to student loans.As a well-known bank in the Midwest, Fifth Third Bank is an excellent choice if you are looking for a financial institution with a proven track record. With a history that spans more than 150 years, and approximately 1,300 branch locations in the U.S., there is a banking product to suit your every need.     Fifth Third Bank ReviewKnowing a financial institution’s products and services in depth can help you determine if they’re the right bank for you. Here is a breakdown of Fifth Third Bank’s most popular products that are available now.1. Checking Accounts at Fifth Third
Some banks only offer two or three checking account options. Fifth Third Bank, however, has five options such as an eAccess account which is perfect for those who prefer the convenience of managing bills and accounts online. On the other hand, you can enjoy unlimited check writing with an Essential Checking account, while an Established Checking account rewards you for maintaining multiple accounts with the bank. And if you are looking for a checking account that earns interest, an Enhanced or Preferred Checking account might be a good match.    2. Fifth Third Bank Savings Account OptionsWith six savings account options to choose from, there is no reason to delay building your financial cushion. Fifth Third Bank savings accounts include the Goal Setter and Relationship Savings accounts. There is also the option of a Relationship Money Market account which earns a higher interest rate than a regular savings fund, plus a no-fee savings account for minors.Need help saving for your kid’s college education? Start a 529 Savings Plan with as little as $25 to start an college fund off strong. And if you have a high-deductible health insurance plan, Fifth Third Bank’s Health Savings Account can help you prepare for future medical expenses.3. Fifth Third Bank CD Rates and Accounts
These savings accounts, however, are not the only options available to you. Fifth Third Bank offers several certificate options that take advantage of CD rates today, with terms that range from seven days to seven years. Minimum opening deposits for certificates of deposit range from $500 to $5,000, depending on the CD term, and Fifth Third Bank CD rates pay higher than other savings options. The money earned from your deposit can be credited to your checking account, your savings account, or back to your CD for even greater savings.    4. Fifth Third Bank Credit CardsRelated ArticlesAre Bank Deposits Assets or Liabilities?Countries With the Highest Interest Rates TodayHow a Credit Union Membership Could Save You More MoneyChoosing the right credit card can be tough. There’s fine print to read, plus you have to compare card features. Fortunately, this bank offers four credit card options, and all Fifth Third Bank credit cards feature excellent benefits. These credit card advantages include: no annual fees, low introductory rates, travel insurance, rental car insurance and cell phone protection. Plus, some cards let you earn cash back on qualifying purchases.5. Fifth Third Bank Mortgage Rates and LoansDo you seek a bank that specializes in various home loan programs and products? If so, look no further and submit an application with Fifth Third Bank. This financial institution offers a range of mortgage products, such as fixed rate mortgages, adjustable rate mortgages and jumbo home loans. Choose a conventional home loan, or select a loan with fewer costs, such as an FHA or a VA home loan.The My Community Mortgage program helps teachers, firefighters, police officers and military personnel purchase homes, and the Good Neighbor Program is designed to help families who need a low-down payment home loan option. Whether you need a loan for a new purchase or a refinance, Fifth Third Bank mortgage rates are fair and competitive.6. Fifth Third Bank Online BankingA bank that does not offer online and mobile banking is a deal breaker for some people. But fortunately, this is not an issue with Fifth Third. Fifth Third Bank online banking services allow account holders to manage their accounts 24 hours a day, seven days a week. You can pay your bills, check your balances, find a branch or ATM and transfer funds, all from your home or mobile device.    Pros and Cons of Fifth Third BankIn addition to the bank’s multiple financial products, several other features make this bank a top choice for residents in the Midwest. Some banks are only open between the hours of 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., which limits how often customers can conduct business inside the branch. However, some Fifth Third Bank locations have longer hours, with branches opening at 8 a.m. and closing at 6 p.m. Monday through Friday.Fifth Third Bank customer service is also worth mentioning, as many customers praise its bankers for their friendly attitudes and willingness to assist.At the same time, there are no perfect banks. Fifth Third Bank only has branches in 12 states, some of which are not open on Saturdays, which may create a problem for account holders who are unable to handle certain bank transactions during a weekday.Should You Bank With Fifth Third Bank?If you live in a state with a Fifth Third Bank branch, seriously consider the many benefits this local institution can offer. Not only does the bank feature more checking and savings account options than many other banks, but its variety of home loan programs can help you realize your dream of homeownership sooner, too.(Photo: Stevan Sheets)

AVOID THIS BANK!  THEY ARE UNPROFESSIONAL, THEY NICKLE AND DIME YOU, THEY HAVE TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.  I opened an account with them 13 years ago and for the past 6 years have noticed a growing trend in worsening conditions for customers.  Recent events were severe enough to force me to close the account.  I strongly advise you to consider ANY other bank before opening an account or taking out a loan with this one.

Leon Harrison
When I retired in 2007, I got a big GM buyout. Fifth Turd called me up, telling me that I wasn’t making any money. I invested in Harford Insurance [which insured the bank], and lost $6,000 in 2008, before cashing out. They work for the bank or themselves, getting commissions to sell shit that they neither know nor care about; pimp it, pump it and dump it for Wall Street big boys. No millionaire investment advisors working there, at least for those of customers who walk in off the street. Inflation has been eating away at my two minus-1% CDs, it being about 5% when you consider and factor in gasoline and groceries, which the government does not. Causing your safe deposits and investments to rot and not increase a lot. After the 2008 bust, and a half-dozen investment and financial advisors who only cost and lost me money, I no longer know who I can trust; pretty professional offices and cubby holes with papers and computers no longer impressing me that much, like those lying guys who wear nice ties. I say the same concerning my learning at Huntington, Chase and PNC; not thanks to the big banks that bought out all of our smaller local ones. Nobody told me to invest in gold and guns!

Fifth Third Bank
 NerdWallet’s rating: 3.0 / 5.0


 


Learn moreat Fifth ThirdA regional bank based in Ohio, Fifth Third has a strong branch network across 10 states in the Midwest, South and Southeast. But beware of fees that can snowball if you don’t have a total of $1,500 across your accounts at all times. Harsh overdraft policies and low interest rates might also dampen your enthusiasm for the bank.
The bottom line

Fifth Third is a regional bank that serves 10 states in the Midwest, South and Southeast
Fees on checking accounts and overdrafts are expensive, and can add up quickly
Savings, checking and certificate accounts have low interest rates when compared with other banks

Overall 

 






Read on for more information about Fifth Third Bank’s checking and savings products, CDs, customer experience and fees.
Checking


 

Fifth Third’s Essential checking account has its pros and cons. Being a part of the Allpoint ATM network means access to a machine is never difficult no matter where you are in the U.S. But the account offers no interest, and the monthly fee may end up applying only to those who can least afford it.




ProsCons




Great ATM coverage, with more than 45,000 ATMs across the countryA low minimum deposit of $50$11 monthly fee, which is waived if you have $1,500 total across all Fifth Third accounts, spend at least $500 on a Fifth Third credit card a month, or meet one of a handful of other requirementsNo interest rate offered



Account reviewed for rating: Essential checking
» MORE: NerdWallet’s best checking accounts
Savings


 

With its bare-bones interest rate, the basic Fifth Third savings account won’t earn much. Add the conditional monthly fee into the mix, and you get an account that’s tough to recommend.




ProsCons




Goal Setter Savings account offers a bonus after you achieve a previously set goal, with some restrictions. The one-time bonus is equal to the total interest earned during the time your account is open. But the interest rate is so low that your bonus might not add up to much.Has a low interest rate of 0.01%; rates may vary by region$5 monthly fee, unless you meet certain requirements, like owning a Fifth Third checking account or holding an account balance of $500 or more



Account reviewed for rating: Goal Setter Savings
» MORE: NerdWallet’s best savings accounts
Certificates of deposit


 

Although Fifth Third offers CDs with a fair minimum-opening deposit, low rates mean low returns for customers.




ProsCons




A reasonable $500 minimum opening deposit for standard CDsIf you have at least $5,000, you qualify for promotional CDs with higher interest ratesVery low rates for standard CDs, ranging from 0.05% to 0.60%. Rates may vary by region.




Customer experience


 

Fifth Third has more than 1,200 branches across 10 states in the Midwest, South and Southeast, a lot for a regional bank. The bank has locations in Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee and West Virginia.
The bank can be reached by phone, and Twitter support also is available. Its website is generally easy to use.
Overdraft fees


 

If you have an account with Fifth Third, be careful not to overdraw; the fees can be steep. Your first overdraft will cost $25, followed by $37 for every time your account is overdrawn after that, up to 10 times a day. Starting May 2, 2017, the fee will be $37 for each overdraft, and the maximum daily overdrafts will drop from 10 to 5. Even if you’re enrolled in the bank’s overdraft protection service, transferring funds from another account, a Fifth Third credit card, or a line of credit will cost you an additional $12 each time.
» MORE: Overdraft fees: What banks charge
High minimums, high overdraft fees
If you tend to not have at least $1,500 in your bank accounts at all times, the fees can add up quickly, so Fifth Third probably won’t be the bank for you. With the bank’s high overdraft fees and low interest rates on all accounts, you probably won’t see your money grow in any significant way. That said, a strong regional branch system and extensive ATM network means that people who prefer to bank in person will be able to access services more easily.

Ratings methodology

NerdWallet’s overall ratings for banks and credit unions are weighted averages of several categories: checking, savings, certificates of deposit or credit union share certificates, customer experience and overdraft fees.
Factors we consider, depending on the category, include rates and fees, ATM and branch access, account features and limits, user-facing technology, customer service and innovation.
The stars represent ratings from poor (one star) to excellent (five stars). Ratings are rounded to the nearest half-star.

Plan for Your Goals

              Invest For Retirement

Plan your retirement right
Planning for retirement is one of the most important things you can do in life. And it’s never too early—or too late—to start. So tell us where you are today. We’ll help you get to the right retirement tomorrow.

Start Planning
Ready to retire


              Plan For Education

Planning for the costs of education
It’s smart to go to college. It’s even smarter to plan ahead. If you have a child or grandchild and you want to start saving for their education, you’re in the right place. A 529 savings account is a great way to help pay for higher education. It allows your money to grow over time with the security of FDIC insurance and 529 tax advantages.

Student Planning


              Buy A Home

Buying a home
Buying a house is a big deal. And finding the home of your dreams is only part of it. You’ll also want to find the loan that fits your finances.
At Fifth Third, our Mortgage Loan Originators are here to listen to you, learn about your unique needs, and answer all of your questions. Then, we will find the loan that's right for you.

              Save For Life Event

Life Events
Life is full of surprises. Some are great—like suddenly falling in love and planning a wedding. Others are not so great. But whatever life has in store, it’s important to be financially prepared. We can help you and your personal bank accounts get ready.

Life Events


              Consolidate Debt

Consolidate Debt
Credit cards, auto loans, money borrowed for college—paying all those bills every month can be a real hassle. Why not consolidate your debts with someone you can trust?
Consolidating with Fifth Third can help simplify your life by giving you one simple monthly payment. Plus, our competitive rates can really help you put more of your money in your personal bank account.

Consolidate Debt


              Learn About Finance

Power of the Purse
Money isn't everything. But knowing how to manage money can make everything better. That's what our Financial Empowerment program is all about—helping people understand how to better manage their finances and save for the future.
We even have programs designed specifically for students—it's never too soon to learn how to manage money and establish good habits.

Loading...Finding the Best BanksBefore purchasing a new product or service, particularly one that would require parting with large amounts of your money, it’s always a good idea to check for reviews to ensure you’re getting your money’s worth.In the past, people relied on word of mouth from friends and family to find great deals. But the internet has changed everything. Now it’s easier than ever to check product and service reviews on just about anything.If you’re thinking of opening a new bank account with a local financial institution and want to compare products and services, it’s good to follow the same practice of checking reviews.GOBankingRates makes this process easy by offering banking review articles for local banks.How to Benefit From a Local Banking Review A banking review provides you with the opportunity to learn a bit more about a specific financial institution and its products and services.While it’s common for consumers to work with a financial institution for the sole purpose of opening a checking or savings account, exploring a banking review showcases all of the benefits or downsides of working with a bank or credit union.You might find that one bank offers more ways to save, grow and borrow money than you could imagine, while providing other perks, like discounts at local businesses.GOBankingRates Offers Local Bank ReviewsLearn more by exploring the local bank banking review articles on GOBankingRates.

              Invest For Retirement

Plan your retirement right
Planning for retirement is one of the most important things you can do in life. And it’s never too early—or too late—to start. So tell us where you are today. We’ll help you get to the right retirement tomorrow.

              Plan For Education

Planning for the costs of education
It’s smart to go to college. It’s even smarter to plan ahead. If you have a child or grandchild and you want to start saving for their education, you’re in the right place. A 529 savings account is a great way to help pay for higher education. It allows your money to grow over time with the security of FDIC insurance and 529 tax advantages.

Student Planning


              Buy A Home

Buying a home
Buying a house is a big deal. And finding the home of your dreams is only part of it. You’ll also want to find the loan that fits your finances.
At Fifth Third, our Mortgage Loan Originators are here to listen to you, learn about your unique needs, and answer all of your questions. Then, we will find the loan that's right for you.

Life Events
Life is full of surprises. Some are great—like suddenly falling in love and planning a wedding. Others are not so great. But whatever life has in store, it’s important to be financially prepared. We can help you and your personal bank accounts get ready.

              Consolidate Debt

Credit cards, auto loans, money borrowed for college—paying all those bills every month can be a real hassle. Why not consolidate your debts with someone you can trust?

Money isn't everything. But knowing how to manage money can make everything better. That's what our Financial Empowerment program is all about—helping people understand how to better manage their finances and save for the future.
We even have programs designed specifically for students—it's never too soon to learn how to manage money and establish good habits.
