Take the DONSAS Survey                           Together We Can Prevent Sexual Assaults
 Sexual assault is a crime... It hurts a shipmate and affects the readiness of the entire unit. Ultimately, our challenge to eliminate sexual assaults will be resolved by leadership - at the unit level.
CNO announced five initiatives to help "end the scourge of sexual assult" in our Navy (click here). 
Admiral John Richardson
Chief of Navy Operations
 
 

 Sexual assault has no place in our Corps. Sexual assault not only has a long-lasting effect on the individual victim, but it also erodes unit readiness and command climate. I see positive progress and indicators that the Marine Corps SAPR Program is going in the right direction. However, I also believe that there is still much work to do... Marines must all work together to create an environment in which crimes of misconduct are not tolerated in any form.
General Robert B. Neller Jr.
Commandant of the Marine Corps

1400-1500's.  Richardson Origins
- from a Richardson website


�The
surname Richardson emerged as a notable
English family name in the county of Cheshire, where John Richardson in
Cheshire of Malpas and Irby, branched northward to Durham and settled
in many
locations in Durham, including Briary of Shotley Bridge.  His
successor
Nicholas Richardson branched south to North Briary in Yorkshire. 
John
Richardson, a magistrate of Swansea, also claims direct descent.  Also descended are branches at Whitby,
Ripon, Painstalk, all in the county of Whitby, at Lime Regis in
Norfolk,
Gloucestershire and Worcestershire.�

1663-1741. The Life of Richard Richardson



Richard
Richardson was born, brought up, and lived most of his life at Bierley
on the
outskirts of Bradford, a district at the heart of Yorkshire�s textile
industry.  He was a member of
the first
generation of Englishmen to take an informed interest in bryophytes. He
was a
contemporary of Adam Buddle, Samuel Brewer (who came to live near
Richardson),
Samuel Doody and William vernon.

These
men corresponded with the older naturalist, John Ray, supplying
information for
his publications on natural history.

Little
is known of Richardson�s own bryological career and discoveries.
However, he
corresponded with Dillenius, Gronovius, Petiver, Sir Hans Sloane, and
many
other naturalists � a correspondence fortunately preserved and
published by his
great grand daughter, and revealing that Richardson occupied an
important �
even pivotal � role in sustaining interest in botany among contemporary
naturalists

Richardson
was sufficiently wealthy not to need to
overexert himself professionally, and was able to fully indulge his
passion for
plants by travelling widely in England, Wales, and Scotland.  He took particular interest in mosses and
lichens, as well as vascular plants. He also developed the gardens at
Bierley
to an extent hitherto unknown in northern England. 
Not confining himself to growing plants of medical interest,
Richardson�s gardens became renowned as rich in both native and foreign
plants,
particularly when a hot-house was built in 1718.

Exactly
how his garden was laid out and its position on the estate is not known.  Evidently it was large and gave Richardson
much pleasure.  When asked for some
specimens by a fellow botanist, he complained that the season was
rather far
advanced, but that he would do his best, and that he had �set about
drying such
plants as are still in flower; and I think I can preserve for you one
hundred and
fifty dry specimens that are fair and well-preserved. 
If I live to enjoy my garden another year, I dare promise you
double that number.



1702. A New England Quaker Story




Throughout
the seventeenth century, English
Nantucketers resisted all attempts to establish a church on the island,
partly
because a woman by the name of Mary Coffin Starbuck forbade it.  It was said that nothing of consequence was
done on Nantucket without Mary's approval. 
Mary Coffin and Nathaniel Starbuck had been the first English
couple to
be married on the island, in 1662, and had established a lucrative
outpost for
trading with the Wampanoag.  Whenever an
itinerant minister came to Nantucket looking to establish a
congregation, he
was firmly rebuffed by Mary Starbuck. 
Then, in
1702, Mary succumbed to a charismatic Quaker minister named John
Richardson.  Speaking before a group
assembled in the Starbucks' living room, Richardson succeeded in moving
Mary to
tears.  It was Mary Starbuck's
conversion to Quakerism that established the unique fusion of
spirituality and
covetousness that would make possible Nantucket's rise as a whaling
port.

Quakers
or, more properly, members of the Society of Friends, depended on their
own
experience of God's presence, the "Inner Light," for guidance rather
than relying on a Puritan minister's interpretation of scripture.  But Nantucket's ever growing number of
Quakers were hardly free-thinking individuals. 
Friends were expected to conform to rules of behavior determined
during
yearly meetings, encouraging a sense of community that was as carefully
controlled as that of any New England society. 

If there
was a difference, it was the Quaker belief in pacifism and a conscious
spurning
of worldly ostentation-two principles that were not intended to
interfere, in
any way, with a person's ability to make money.  Instead
of building fancy houses or buying fashionable clothes,
Nantucket's Quakers reinvested their profits in the whale fishery.  As a result, they were able to weather the
downturns that laid to waste so many mainland whaling merchants, and
Mary
Starbuck's children, along with their Macy and Coffin cousins, quickly
established a Quaker whaling dynasty.


1772.  Death
in Mysterious Circumstances


The Rev. William
Richardson had been sent to America by the Kirk of Scotland to bring
Christianity to the Indian tribes.  He spent most of his life
travelling in the South Carolina backcountry before settling in the
Waxhaws region.  In 1760, he married the daughter of a missionary
there.  But the marriage produced no children and was by all
accounts unhappy.

In 1772, the Reverend was found one morning dead in his study, on his
knees and with a bridle around his neck.  At the time his wife
showed great grief and all concluded that it had been an act of
religious melancholy.  He was thus buried quickly.

However, many knew of the temper of his wife and their acrimonious
relationship.  Somewhat suspiciously, it transpired, all of the
servants had been sent out into the field on the day of his
death.  It was therefore decided that the corpse should be taken
out of the grave and examined.  Marks of stangulation were found
on the neck and bruises on the chest.  The conclusion reached was
that no man could possibly have destroyed himself in the manner by
which the bridle had been placed around the neck.  It was in fact
more than probable that the bridle had been put there and the body set
in a praying position after he had been strangled.

There the account ends and we have no identification of the guilty
party.  For the dead man himself, there was issue.   He
had adopted his nephew, William Richardson Davie, as a son after the
mother had died and oversaw his education.  That young man became
an American patriot, achieving fame and distinction in the War of
Independence.
 


1780-1783. 
Richard
Richardson in Hiding


At the
surrender of Charleston, Brigadier Richardson and his two sons, Richard
and
Edward, were taken prisoner by the British and sent to a military
station on
John's Island.  Here the Brigadier died
and his two sons nearly fell victim to the smallpox.
However, Richard was
able to make his escape and, being
disguised by the effects of the disease, returned to the neighborhood
of his
home where he concealed himself in the Santee Swamp.

By this
time, British troops had overrun the state and were occupying the
Richardson
Big Home plantation.  His family were,
it is said, restricted there to a small apartment and allowed only a
scanty
share of the provisions.  Nevertheless,
every day Dorcas Richardson would send food to her husband in the swamp
via an
old and faithful negro in whose discretion she could trust. Sometimes
she even ventured
to visit him, taking their little daughter with her.  

It was not long before the
British had information of Richardson's escape.
They
naturally concluded that he was somewhere in the vicinity of his family
and
relatives.  A diligent search was
instituted and scouts were sent in every direction.  Rewards were
offered
for his apprehension; but without success.

Not
infrequently did the officers boast in the presence of the wife of what
they
would do to her husband should they capture him.  On
one occasion, some of the officers displayed their swords
reeking with blood - probably that of cattle - and told her that it was
the
blood of Captain Richardson whom they had killed.  At
another time they brought intelligence that he had been taken
and hanged.  In this state of cruel
suspense she sometimes remained for several successive days, unable to
learn
the fate of her husband and not knowing whether to believe or distrust
the
horrible tales brought to her ears.

Hearing
that the British troops had been temporarily ordered away, Richard did
visit
his wife at their plantation.  However,
he had been seen on his way by a loyalist. 
A party of them assembled and were soon to be seen drawn up in
front of
his house.  Richard hastily came forth,
leaped on his steed, and galloped up the oak-lined avenue, avoiding the
little
firing that was aimed at him,

All this took place in
the sight of his terrified family.  Afterwards,
they would describe the danger and his providential
escape.  His wife Dorcas could only
account for his escape by conjecturing that the party had determined to
take
Richardson alive and thus claim the reward that had been offered for
his
capture.

When peace returned,
Colonel Richardson, who had been promoted for his
services,
resumed his life as a planter.  Of he
and his wife�s ten children, four died young. 
The rest married and reared families.


1793. Peggy Richardson and the Catholic
Uprising in Armagh

There were many anxious people waiting for tidings, and
amongst
them was one Peggy Richardson who, on hearing of the plight of the
Protestants,
determined to relieve them.  She went
home and told her mother the state of affairs, saying: " I'm going to
relieve them."

The old woman said: "Why, child, you
cannot go; you will
be
killed."
She replied, "Why, mother, isn't my father there?"
"He is, dear."
"And my three brothers?"
"They are, dear."
"And my husband is there? "
�He is, dear."
"And, God helping me, I'll be there, too.�
So saying, she took a strong petticoat and two new pillow
slips,
which she sewed to the headband of a petticoat with strong cord around
them,
forming loops at the top for handles. 
She then went to the haystack, and pulled out sufficient to make
a hole
large enough to put her little four-year-old girl in, tying up a bunch
of hay
to stuff into the hole.

Late that night she took her little girl and placed her
in the
haystack with many cautions, and then, having equipped herself she went
to
Churchill, where she got all the ball cartridges she could carry.  She then started by the Derryhubbert road
for the Diamond, arriving safely about the same time as William Blacker
at the
scene of the conflict.  The latter had
to traverse a friendly country across Portadown Bridge, to about five
to six
miles in the direction of Loughgall, when all at once they came upon
the scene
of meditated rapine and murder.




1800. Thomas Richardson - A Quaker in
Lombard Street


From
his
square-toed shoes to his low broad-brimmed Quaker hat, a solidity marks
him.  Here walks a man of substance,
warm and comfortable, without pride but with a due regard for himself.  The buttoned gaiters and knee breeches, the
long, collarless coat of broadcloth in Quaker plainness, the hat of
best fur,
show a simplicity, dignity and sureness towards himself and a meek
disregard of
other opinion by one who could afford to disregard it. 


He fronts
his fellow men without ornament and
without disguise, confident that they will take him for what he is.  In spite of the firm chin and prominent
nose, a humorous kindness marks his face; the eyes - alert and friendly
-
belong to the man who later knew all the Ayton children, who liked to
ask them
to tea at Cleveland Lodge when the strawberries were ripe, and who
could see
and supply the school needs of �4 tin pie dishes� or �2 milking frocks.�  

Thomas
Richardson was always human; business never
overwhelmed him; as his life went on, his shrewdness remained and his
kindness
of heart mellowed.



1815-40. Thomas Miles Richardson in the
Northeast

His favorite sketching grounds comprised Northumberland,
the
Borders and Scotland.  His activities as
a writer and illustrator further emphasised his loyalties to the region.  He published a volume on the Armorial Bearings
in St Andrew�s Chapel, Newcastle, and began to work on books about
Newcastle
(from 1816) and the castles of the English and Scottish Borders (from
1833). 


His election, in 1840, as an associate of the New Society
of
Painters in Watercolours, based in London, seems to have been a
temporary
deviation from his regional activities, and it is perhaps no wonder
that he was
expelled three years later.


1823. The Execution of Joseph Richardson in Dumfries


It
appeared that M'Kenna and Joseph Richardson had gone to Dublin in
August 1822,
and, with the assistance of a person from whom M'Kenna knew four years
before,
purchased 500 notes of the British Linen Company and got a plate
engraved of
the guinea note of Carrick, Brown & Co. of Glasgow. 
In this business they were engaged some two
to three weeks and got 300 of the notes printed.  They
then returned to Scotland where they were apprehended. 
172 of the notes were found in the
possession of M'Kenna's wife and 163 in a turf dyke in Joseph
Richardson's
yard.   
A petition
had been sent to the fountain of mercy
in favour of these unhappy men and an answer was returned with a
respite during his Majesty's
pleasure for William Richardson only. 
A
gentleman who accompanied the clergyman to the
jail described minutely the demeanor of all the prisoners on receiving
the
answer to their petition.  William
Richardson who was first visited appeared " quite uplifted" with the
communication made to him; for a few seconds his colour went and came,
but the
first flutter of the heart being soon ever, his breathing became freer,
and his
speech firmer; and although he expressed some regret at the fate of his
companions, his mind was evidently wholly engrossed with the strong
instinctive
desire of self-preservation.  On the
other hand, M'Kenna and Joseph Richardson apparently received the news
of their
now irrevocable doom with every feeling becoming their situation.  Joseph did express a satisfaction that his
brother's life was spared, since, to use his own words, "the idea of
two
brothers going out of life in the same awful way was painful to be
thought
on." 
On
Saturday the distracted mother of poor Joseph
visited him for the last time, with the unhappy woman being so overcome
by her maternal feelings as to
swoon away again and again.  Tuesday he
bade adieu to his sister and a younger brother and took a last leave of
his
wife who was all night in the cell with him.
The
scaffold was erected in front of the prison in
Buccleugh Street.  At an early hour vast
multitudes were pouring into the town from the surrounding country to
witness
the awful scene and long before the appointed hour the crowd was
immense.  At about three o'clock the
prisoners
ascended the scaffold, when the executioner adjusted the fatal cord,
and after
a short time spent in praise and prayer, the signal was given, and they
were
ushered into the world that is �unseen & eternal," amongst a very
general feeling of sympathy from the surrounding multitude.


1840. James
Richardson and the Sugar Business

There
were four market days in
Glasgow, leaving Wednesday and Saturday free, to enable the members of
the
trade to visit Greenock and Port Glasgow.

The
Lochgoil steamer, by which
they travelled, left the Broomielaw at half-past seven in the morning,
and
breakfast was served on the passage down, and after spending two hours
or so in
business, they generally found their way back to Glasgow about two
o'clock.

When
there
was fog the passage was
tedious, and not without hazard.  One
sugar man was kept all night off Dumbarton in a steamer, with little
food and
inadequate sleeping accommodation.  Mr.
Richardson generally sat near the funnel, enveloped in a blue cloak,
interesting himself in some book he had brought with him. 
He was an omnivorous reader.  After
a drive of about five miles from
Springhall, near Rutherglen, he glanced hurriedly at his letters, which
were
brought to him before the steamer started, and prepared himself for the
eventualities of the day, whether to sell or buy.




1843.  Aunt
Sukey's Ordeal

 Susan
Richardson (Aunt Sukey)
and her children had been brought into Illinois territory by her
master, Andrew
Border.  One day, her children and those
of her master had gotten into an altercation and her mistress had had
her
children whipped.  When Sukey objected,
she was told that she would be subject to a severe lashing herself.

The
thought of being scourged, and by a woman too, was more than
Sukey could bear.  So hastily and
secretly one winter�s night she left with her children and went north,
following the stars, to Cairo where she got on the line of the
underground
railroad, reaching Knox County.

But
scarcely had Aunt Sukey and her charges alighted from the
wagon that they was arrested and conveyed to Knoxville where they were
confined to the county jail.  Notice of her
capture was immediately sent south.  Her
master saw the notice, hastened to Knoxville, and grabbed the children.  

Frantic and almost
heart-broken,
the poor mother thought that she must return to the dread scourged life
of
bondage with her children.  But she was
advised by sympathizing friends not to go; for it would only be to
suffer
increased pain and mental anxiety as her children would undoubtedly be
sold and
sent south.  Instead, she boarded a
sleigh and sped over the snowy earth to Galesburg where she could be
safer.

Soon
after Aunt Sukey had settled in Galesburg, a lawsuit - which
became famous - was instituted by her former master, Andrew.Border, for
her
recovery.  By some means it was defeated. 


1847.  Jonathan
Richardson's Spa in Shotley Bridge

 The
spring anciently called "Hally Well," now Shotley Spa, was at a
distant period noted for its efficacy in the cure of scrofulous
complaints; it
fell, however, into disuse, and for a long time no benefit was derived
from it,
till a prevailing tradition lately induced Jonathan Richardson, Esq.,
to
commence a search upon the spot where it was supposed to exist. 

The
search was successful.  Appropriate
buildings, a wellroom, baths, &c, were erected in the rustic style;
and Mr.
Richardson has opened carriage-drives and promenades upon his estate.

In
the
village, there are two paper-mills in operation; a market for corn is
held
weekly, and a fair for cattle every half year.



1880's. Bessbrook Village

Bessbrook
is a large manufacturing village, the
population of which is about 4,000 � the same number as are employed in
Mr
Richardson�s linen manufacturing enterprises there. 
It is situated in a beautiful and well-watered valley convenient
to the Camlough Mountains and about three miles from Newry.  The
scenery,
from the combined effect of hill, vale and wood is very attractive.  

The
village is the property of Mr John Grubb
Richardson Esq., who has spared no expense or trouble to make it �the
model
town�. In this he has received the heartiest support from other
members of
the firm.  
The place
has certain peculiarities.  First it
is without a public house, a feature endorsed by six to one of
householders in
a recent poll. It is also without a pawnbrokers, and a police
barrack,
these not being required.  
Bessbrook
is remarkable for its yarn and linen
manufactories, a process from flax-growing to the finished product � be
it
family linen, a pocket handkerchief of a table cloth - carried on
locally.  The firm�s huckabacks, towelling, fronting linens,
drills,
diapers and damasks are known the world over.  The damasks made at
Bessbrook by machinery are easily the equal of those made by hand looms.  The company have also extensive quarries
where the beautiful blue and grey granite is hewn out, dressed and
polished for
different markets.  It is now extensively used in England,
Scotland and
America for monumental and other purposes.  

The
religious denominations are well represented.  A fine structure is
that
belonging to the Irish Church capable of holding 500-600.  The
Presbyterians have a commodious Church for a similar number.  The
Friends
(Mr Richardson himself being a parishioner) have a place of worship for
700-800
and the Wesleyians have a neat Chapel.  The Roman Catholic Chapel
is a
spacious edifice.

1916. A Letter from the Quaker Elizabeth Richardson

�In the dark and stormy days which have fallen
over the world since August 1914 and in which some have seen their way
to
testify to convictions which have not been deemed popular I can
personally
testify that in no quarter did I find such steadfastness of purpose and
such a
rigid adherence to deep religious convictions as in Mrs Spence Watson. 

In the struggle for liberty of conscience I
received great inspiration through her brave and noble spirit nor can I
forget
how, in what were to me very trying days in 1916, when friends were
falling
rapidly away, Mrs Watson insisted on staying with me during the long
hours
which preceded the hearing of my claim before the Gateshead Tribunal,
the only
friend I had in court."

Elizabeth Richardson spoke
and wrote fearlessly against the First World War.  At
the passing of the Military Service Act, she advised and
helped many young men whose punishments and imprisonments she felt most
keenly.


1916. Jimmy Richardson and His Bagpipes



Jimmy
Richardson was twenty
years old and a piper in the Canadian Scottish Battalion when he won
his
Victoria Cross for gallantry during the First World War.

On October 8
1916, his company
was held up in the Somme by very strong wire and came under intense
fire.  Piper Richardson, who had obtained
permission to play the company '�over the top,� strode up and down
outside the
wire playing his pipes.  This so
inspired the company that the wire was rushed and the position captured.  After the rush, Jimmy turned back to recover
his pipes but was never seen again.

Richardson's
bagpipes were
believed to have been lost in the mud of the Somme. 
However, it turned out that a British Army chaplain had found
the
pipes in 1917 and brought them back home after the war to a school in
Scotland
where he was a teacher. The pipes were unidentified for several
decades, and
served as a broken, mud-caked, and blood-stained reminder of an unknown
piper
from the Great War.  Ninety years later,
these pipes were identified as those played by Piper Richardson on that
fateful
day in 1916 and were repatriated to Canada.


1954.  Texas Money


Like
much of East Texas, Henderson County is a rolling expanse of
pastureland, woods, and worked-out cotton fields.  Its county seat
and cultural capital is a sleepy town with the splendid name of Athens
(pop. 5,300).  Henderson County and Athens have a distinction that
makes them notable even in Texas.  They have spawned about 50 of
Texas' millionaires and multimillionaires.  The biggest of these
big rich are a select few known throughout Texas as "the new Athenians."

Sid Richardson, the richest of the new Athenians because of his ocean
of oil reserves, jokingly takes credit for starting the boys from
Athens on their way years ago.  When making his first killing in
oil, Richardson drove into town in a block-long Cadillac.  "When I
left," he says, "all of these guys sitting on those benches around the
square jumped up and down and followed me out of town."

A commentator described him as follows:


"He was
your classic wildcatter.  Nobody could estimate, not even Sid
Richardson, how much money he had.  During the hot months of
summer, he would always spend time in California at a small place in
Laboya.  It was a place that lured an odd collection of people -
Washington figures such as J. Edgar Hoover and Joseph McCarthy,
Hollywood types, and Mafia people - because it was close to the race
track which Sid Richardson loved."


Richardson and his friend Clint Murchison hit the front pages when
trying to help a fellow Texan buy the New York Central Railroad.

The story goes that Murchison called Richardson in California and said,
"I need your
help."  Richardson took the call just when he was starting out
for a round of golf.  In his haste, he agreed to go along on the
deal without hearing the details.  Next day when he spoke to
Murchison again, Richardson was startled to find that it was not a $10
million deal as he thought but a $20 million one.  "What the hell
did you say was the name of that railroad?" he exclaimed.
 
1961. Tony Richardson and A Taste of Honey


Tony
Richardson continued in the vein of kitchen-sink realism with an
adaptation in
1961 of Shelagh Delaney's novel of working-class life. 

Set in
England in the early 1960s, A Taste of Honey starred Rita
Tushingham as
the waifish Jo, a plain 17-year-old girl who is dragged from one shabby
bed-sitter to another by Helen (Dora Bryan), her promiscuous, alcoholic
termagant of a mother. 

When
Helen and her current lover, Peter (Robert Stephens), take a holiday in
Blackpool, Jo goes along and, while walking on the beach, meets Jimmy
(Paul
Danquah), a black sailor on leave. 
After they spend the night together Jimmy's ship leaves for
points
unknown.  Helen and Peter have
impulsively decided to marry, and they move into his flat, leaving Jo
in the
cold.  She gets a job in a shoe store,
where she meets gay and mild-mannered Geoffrey, and the two decide to
move into
a flat together.  Jo soon discovers
she's carrying Jimmy's child, news that depresses her. 
But Geoffrey couldn't be happier, and he
begins knitting baby clothes, goes to a clinic for child-care
instruction, and
even offers to marry Jo.

This
moving film is exceptionally well acted and directed; it is a tribute
to
Richardson's boldness in taking on the theme of miscegenation, then a
much more
controversial issue.
  

1965. Lady Darwin's Brooch


In
1965,
widowed and about to move to a new apartment, Lady Darwin approached
Australia
House in London, offering an unusual object for repatriation to
Australia.  It was a gold brooch that had
belonged to
her grandmother.  Encased in a box
labelled Flavelle Bros, Sydney, she dated it to 1860, about the time
that her
grandmother, Fanny Richardson, had sailed home to Britain.

Lady
Darwin�s great grandfather, Dr William Richardson, had arrived in
Australia on
the Katharine Stewart Forbes from Scotland in 1825.  His daughter Fanny was born in 1837.  Her granddaughter recalled that �she always
spoke of her girlhood as having been spent in Sydney. 
And she remembered the long voyage back to Britain under
sail!�  Two of her brothers did stay as
sheep farmers in New South Wales.  


Fanny�s
brooch measures 4.5 centimetres high and 6.2 centimetres across and is
notable
for the strong, sculptural treatment of the spray of leaves tied with a
fillet.  The botanical motifs are
decidedly Australian; two native woody pear pods and leaves, brake and
bird�s
nest fern fronds, a curling lily leaf tied at the base with a fillet,
and a callistemon
or banksia flower.  Each metal leaf has
been cast or cut, shaped and carefully engraved to simulate the form
and
texture of the species.

2000. Ghosts at Richhill Castle



At
seventeen, Dolly had been acclaimed as the most
beautiful girl in all Ireland.  When she
went to visit her aunt, Lady Loftus, in Dublin, she was the object of
such
admiration that she could not walk in the Mall because of the crowd of
undesired worshippers.   Instead she
had
to rise at 6 a.m. and take her exercise in St. Stephens Green to ensure
some
privacy.  Dolly and William Richardson were
married
in 1775, but sadly she died, childless, in 1793.
Warren
Coates, chairman of the Northern Ireland
Paranormal Research Association, is leading a group who visit the
castle once a
fortnight to investigate paranormal activity. 
Tape recordings, cameras and highly-sensitive instruments that
measure
humidity, air pressure and magnetic fields are being used to detect the
presence
of spirits. 
�When we
set up our equipment, we actually got activity over the whole
building,� Warren
said.  �When you take away things like
draughty windows or doors, rumbling pipes or floorboards creaking, you
reach
the conclusion that there is a definite presence.�

Gordon
Little and his wife, Helen, live in part of the castle and are trying
to
have it restored.  �In the 47 years that
the castle has been my family home I have never seen a ghost,� Gordon
said.  �My sister-in-laws relatives have
though � one of her sisters chatted to the spirit of a lady on the
stairs and
reckons it was Dolly.  I tend to resent
the fact that people can see things, while I live here and I can�t.  If they prove there is a ghost here I will
accept it.� 

2007. Governor Bill Richardson and UFO's



Bill
Richardson, the New Mexico Governor and Democratic Presidential
candidate, has an unusual background, New England high WASP and
Mexican.  His grandfather was a Boston naturalist of Mayflower
descent who collected specimens in Central America and married a
Mexican lady from a prestigious family in Oaxaca.  He became a
planter and rancher in Nicaragua and, according to the candidate's
autobiography Between Worlds,
"fathered children by four different women in Mexiico and Central
America."
Now Jim
Geraghy of the National Review
has found a 2004 story about him and wondered if it might help or
hinder his Presidential ambitions.  Jim came up with a new slogan
for our running guy: "Bill Richardson, A President for Americans of All
Colors, including the Little Green Men."
Despite
denials by Federal officials, many UFO buffs cherish the notion that in
1947 a flying saucer crashed in rural Roswell, scattering alien bodies
and saucer debris across the terrain.  In 2004, Gov. Bill
Richardson wrote in a foreword to a new book The Roswell Dig Diaries that "the
mystery surrounding this crash has never been adequately explained, not
by independent investigators nor by the US Government."
Richardson's
foreword drew scorn from veteran UFO investigators and science
popularizers.  The grand old man of sceptical UFO investigators,
Philip J. Kass, who has written for Aviation
Week & Space Technology since 1952, said: "Gov. Richardson
is wrong about Roswell and too trusting of TV network promoters. 
After more than a third of a century of research, I have found no
credible evidence of extraterrestrial visitors."
