Mr. Verrecchia holds both a Bachelor of Arts degree in accounting and a Master of Business Finance degree, each from the University of Rhode Island. We believe Mr. Verrecchia's qualifications for nomination include his strong understanding and insights related to the operation of an enterprise in both the U.S. and international markets as the current chairman and former chief executive officer and president of a multinational publicly held corporation, his experience transforming a traditional product business, his extensive understanding of the capital markets and accounting as a former chief financial officer, his experience as a member of the board of directors of other publicly held companies and his prior experience as our lead independent director.

"The separation of these two positions proactively addresses the current corporate environment and is in the best interests of Hasbro and our shareholders."As the Company's C.E.O., Mr. Verrecchia will now have overall responsibility for setting the Company's strategic direction and for making the day-to-day decisions related to running Hasbro."We are fortunate that we have an individual on board who can assume the role and responsibilities of C.E.O.," continued Mr. Hassenfeld. "I have worked very closely with Al Verrecchia for many years, and his integrity, business acumen, successful track record and expertise relating to Hasbro and the issues affecting our industry make him the ideal choice to take on the role of C.E.O. Al's skills and experience will serve Hasbro well in the coming years, and I am especially pleased that this move happens at a time when the Company has returned to profitability and a position of strength.""I am honored by this promotion, and I will continue doing what I know best - working hard to make Hasbro the best toy and game company in the world," said Mr. Verrecchia. "I am pleased that Alan and our Board of Directors have demonstrated their confidence in my abilities as I take on the challenge and day-to-day responsibilities of C.E.O., while Alan directs his focus as Chairman on a range of important initiatives, especially corporate governance issues," continued Mr. Verrecchia."I am enormously proud of my long-term business and personal relationship with Alan, and the thousands of loyal and dedicated employees with whom I have had the good fortune of working with over the years. Going forward, we will remain focused on leveraging Hasbro's unmatched portfolio of core brands as we look to increase shareholder value in the years to come," Mr. Verrecchia said.Mr. Verrecchia joined Hasbro in 1965 as a junior accountant. Since that time, he has climbed the ranks and served in a variety of key senior executive positions, most recently as the Company's President and Chief Operating Officer. Over the years, Mr. Verrecchia has also served as Hasbro's Executive Vice President, Global Operations; Chief Financial Officer; and President, Hasbro Manufacturing Services."I have worked with two generations of Hassenfeld's during my 38 years at Hasbro. I am honored to have the opportunity to carry on the 80-year tradition of this great Company," Mr. Verrecchia concluded.Hasbro is a worldwide leader in children's and family leisure time entertainment products and services, including the design, manufacture and marketing of games and toys ranging from traditional to high-tech.

PAWTUCKET, R.I.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Alfred J. Verrecchia, Chairman of the Board of Directors, Hasbro, 
      Inc., (NASDAQ: HAS) has been selected as a 2011 Toy Industry Hall of 
      Fame inductee. Inductees are nominated by the industry at large and 
      selected by Toy Industry Association members and Hall of Fame inductees. 
      The induction ceremony will take place during the 11th Annual 
      Toy of the Year (TOTY) Awards on Saturday, February 12, 2011, marking 
      the start of the 108th American International Toy Fair.
    


      “The incredible career-long track record of success and leadership 
      exhibited by Al Verrecchia on both an industry level, and at Hasbro, 
      make him a natural choice for induction into the Toy Industry Hall of 
      Fame,” said Brian Goldner, Hasbro’s President and CEO.
    

      In 1965, Verrecchia began his career in the toy industry as a staff 
      accountant at Hasbro, working his way up to CEO in 2003. During his 
      tenure as CEO, Verrecchia was one of the prime architects in building 
      and executing a strategy focused on aggressively leveraging the 
      Company’s unmatched portfolio of brands in a wide range of categories 
      beyond traditional toys and games. Prior to his tenure as CEO, 
      Verrecchia held a range of senior executive positions at Hasbro, 
      including Chief Financial Officer and President, Hasbro Manufacturing 
      Services, among others. He assumed the position of Chairman in 2008.
    

      In addition to his positions at Hasbro, Verrecchia has also held several 
      leadership roles in the toy industry. He served as Vice Chairman of the 
      Toy Industry Association’s (TIA) Board of Directors beginning in 2006 
      and then took on additional responsibilities as Chairman in 2008 and 
      2009. In addition, Verrecchia was Chair of both the finance committee 
      and the budget committee, and served on the investment committee and the 
      audit committee. He is also a co-founding member of the International 
      Council of Toy Industries’ CEO Roundtable.
    

      “Al Verrecchia has helped to revolutionize the toy industry over the 
      past 45 years and the TIA is honored to welcome him to the Toy Industry 
      Hall of Fame,” said Carter Keithley, TIA president.
    

      Criteria for consideration for the Hall of Fame include “outstanding 
      contributions to the toy industry, an unimpeachable record of integrity 
      and respect in the industry, and a prominent role in promoting the 
      public’s awareness and appreciation of the importance of toys in the 
      lives of children.” Verrecchia joins an impressive group of just 55 
      individuals in the Toy Industry Hall of Fame including Merrill, Stephen 
      and Alan Hassenfeld; George Lucas, creator of the classic Star Wars and 
      Indiana Jones movies; Sam Walton, founder of Walmart; Academy Award 
      winning director John Lasseter; and Reuben Klamer, inventor of the Game 
      of Life. Donald Duncan, Founder of Duncan Toys Company, is this year’s 
      posthumous inductee.
    

      Verrecchia will accept his award in person this Saturday at the TOTY 
      Awards, which will be held at the Frederick P. Rose Hall, Home of Jazz 
      at Lincoln Center in New York City.

Verrecchia said he relied entirely on EDC staff to report on 38 Studios finances







Thursday
Sep 24, 2015 at 4:49 PM
Sep 24, 2015 at 4:49 PM






				By Kate Bramson Journal Staff Writer
			
PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- Alfred J. Verrecchia, who was vice chairman of the R.I. Economic Development Corporation and chairman of Hasbro toy company when the EDC board approved the 38 Studios loan deal in 2010, never reviewed any financial records from the company, he told First Southwest's lawyer, Gerald J. Petros.
Instead, Verrecchia said he relied entirely on EDC staff and three professional advisory firms the agency retained -- Wells Fargo, First Southwest and Strategy Analytics -- to analyze 38 Studios' fiscal situation.
"Did you ever ask to review yourself the financial plan prepared by 38 Studios?" Petros asked.
"No," Verrecchia replied.
Petros: "Why not?"
Verrecchia: "I was relying upon the staff of EDC. It would have taken me an awful lot of time and energy that I didn't have to go in and review their financial plan."
Further, Verrecchia's deposition reveals that he and one other EDC board member -- Stephen Lane, then CEO of medical-device company Ximedica -- were e-mailed by an EDC administrative assistant that Keith Stokes wanted them to know about a meeting on April 9, 2010 with then-Governor Carcieri, Curt Schilling, Mike Corso, Keith Stokes and J. Michael Saul. Asked why he he was invited to meet with Schilling by the Governor, Verrecchia said he could not recall why. He insisted he did not attend that meeting.
A later e-mail between Verrechia and Lane that was discussed during the deposition indicated Lane attended what was referred to as “the Curt Schilling ‘Pitch’” meeting.
“I was not at the ‘Pitch’ meeting,” Verrecchia said. “I don’t know what went on at the ‘Pitch’ meeting. He [Lane] was there. He’s asking me if I had been appraised of the ask, and I said I have not appraised, so I have no idea what went on at the Curt Schilling ‘Pitch’ meeting, which is his terminology, not mine.”
Verrechia said he recalled the EDC's Saul asking if he could speak to anyone at Hasbro about the video-game business. Verrecchia, who had stepped down as Hasbro CEO in 2008, noted that Hasbro licensed its “properties to video game developers to, you know, exploit our intellectual property in the video game market.”
An e-mail discussed during Verrecchia’s deposition from Saul to Corso and Stolzman on April 12, 2010, sought to schedule a meeting with Verrecchia, Lane, then-Hasbro CEO Brian Goldner, Stokes, Schilling and one to two 38 Studios board members.
By April 22, Saul was writing to Verrecchia about his agreeing to introduce EDC staff to Mark Blecher at Hasbro as part of the “38 Studios’ due diligence.” Verrecchia said Blecher worked for Hasbro and was responsible for video-game activities, primarily licensing agreements with video game distributors, licensed intellectual property.” It appeared from documents that the meeting between Saul and Blecher took place April 29, 2010, Verrecchia confirmed. A later e-mail about that meeting indicated another Hasbro employee attended – James Jones, whom Verrecchia said he did not know.
Verrecchia insisted he and Lane were not working with EDC staff on the 38 Studios transaction before the full board knew about the transaction.
From his work at Hasbro, the world's second-largest toy company with approximate revenue of $4.2 billion when he retired as CEO in 2008, Verrecchia said in his deposition that he was familiar with the video-game industry, knew that delays with game releases were common and says he spoke to the EDC board about the risks and insisted the loan should not close unless the EDC retained a third-party monitor that would evaluate 38 Studios with a goal of keeping the company on track to make the game. Verrecchia said he didn't learn that a third-party monitoring agreement never was reached until long after the fact.
Verrecchia noted on more than one occasion in his deposition that Stokes talked about then-Speaker Fox’s interest in the 38 Studios transaction: “All Keith Stokes said was that the Legislature had passed this job creation bill and that the $75 million was earmarked at that time for 38 Studios, and he indicated that the Speaker will be unhappy if we were to take that $75 million and give it to somebody else,” Verrecchia said.
In late 2008, Carcieri had selected Verrecchia to lead a review of the EDC. In 2009, Verrecchia authored a scathing report blasting Rhode Island's economic-development efforts and the state agency charged with creating and retaining jobs, calling the agency "fragmented, disjointed and without focus." 
In announcing those findings, Verrecchia compared the EDC to a "basket of frogs," and said the agency's director should be replaced with a "professional economic development executive" and board members should be "qualified and able to establish strategy, ensure accountability and drive performance."
By January 2010, Carcieri appointed a new board, with Verrecchia as vice chairman, after a national search for a new EDC director failed to produce results. A month earlier, Ioanna T. Morfessis, hired as that new chief, abruptly resigned, before she was set to take over. 
The state's lawyer Max Wistow represented Verrechia at the deposition but said there would be no fee – Wistow said he was not getting paid, “except on the contingency basis that everybody knows about.”

Further, Verrecchia's deposition reveals that he and one other EDC board member -- Stephen Lane, then CEO of medical-device company Ximedica -- were e-mailed by an EDC administrative assistant that Keith Stokes wanted them to know about a meeting on April 9, 2010 with then-Governor Carcieri, Curt Schilling, Mike Corso, Keith Stokes and J. Michael Saul. Asked why he he was invited to meet with Schilling by the Governor, Verrecchia said he could not recall why. He insisted he did not attend that meeting.
A later e-mail between Verrechia and Lane that was discussed during the deposition indicated Lane attended what was referred to as “the Curt Schilling ‘Pitch’” meeting.
“I was not at the ‘Pitch’ meeting,” Verrecchia said. “I don’t know what went on at the ‘Pitch’ meeting. He [Lane] was there. He’s asking me if I had been appraised of the ask, and I said I have not appraised, so I have no idea what went on at the Curt Schilling ‘Pitch’ meeting, which is his terminology, not mine.”
Verrechia said he recalled the EDC's Saul asking if he could speak to anyone at Hasbro about the video-game business. Verrecchia, who had stepped down as Hasbro CEO in 2008, noted that Hasbro licensed its “properties to video game developers to, you know, exploit our intellectual property in the video game market.”
An e-mail discussed during Verrecchia’s deposition from Saul to Corso and Stolzman on April 12, 2010, sought to schedule a meeting with Verrecchia, Lane, then-Hasbro CEO Brian Goldner, Stokes, Schilling and one to two 38 Studios board members.
By April 22, Saul was writing to Verrecchia about his agreeing to introduce EDC staff to Mark Blecher at Hasbro as part of the “38 Studios’ due diligence.” Verrecchia said Blecher worked for Hasbro and was responsible for video-game activities, primarily licensing agreements with video game distributors, licensed intellectual property.” It appeared from documents that the meeting between Saul and Blecher took place April 29, 2010, Verrecchia confirmed. A later e-mail about that meeting indicated another Hasbro employee attended – James Jones, whom Verrecchia said he did not know.
Verrecchia insisted he and Lane were not working with EDC staff on the 38 Studios transaction before the full board knew about the transaction.
From his work at Hasbro, the world's second-largest toy company with approximate revenue of $4.2 billion when he retired as CEO in 2008, Verrecchia said in his deposition that he was familiar with the video-game industry, knew that delays with game releases were common and says he spoke to the EDC board about the risks and insisted the loan should not close unless the EDC retained a third-party monitor that would evaluate 38 Studios with a goal of keeping the company on track to make the game. Verrecchia said he didn't learn that a third-party monitoring agreement never was reached until long after the fact.
Verrecchia noted on more than one occasion in his deposition that Stokes talked about then-Speaker Fox’s interest in the 38 Studios transaction: “All Keith Stokes said was that the Legislature had passed this job creation bill and that the $75 million was earmarked at that time for 38 Studios, and he indicated that the Speaker will be unhappy if we were to take that $75 million and give it to somebody else,” Verrecchia said.
In late 2008, Carcieri had selected Verrecchia to lead a review of the EDC. In 2009, Verrecchia authored a scathing report blasting Rhode Island's economic-development efforts and the state agency charged with creating and retaining jobs, calling the agency "fragmented, disjointed and without focus." 
In announcing those findings, Verrecchia compared the EDC to a "basket of frogs," and said the agency's director should be replaced with a "professional economic development executive" and board members should be "qualified and able to establish strategy, ensure accountability and drive performance."
By January 2010, Carcieri appointed a new board, with Verrecchia as vice chairman, after a national search for a new EDC director failed to produce results. A month earlier, Ioanna T. Morfessis, hired as that new chief, abruptly resigned, before she was set to take over. 
The state's lawyer Max Wistow represented Verrechia at the deposition but said there would be no fee – Wistow said he was not getting paid, “except on the contingency basis that everybody knows about.”

Iron Mountain Appoints Al Verrecchia as Chairman of the Board

BOSTON (March 25, 2013) – Iron Mountain Incorporated (NYSE: IRM), the storage and information management company, today announced that Alfred J. Verrecchia became chairman of its board effective March 15, 2013. Verrecchia, 70, joined the company’s board in March 2010 and was appointed lead independent director in June 2012. Verrecchia has been chairman-elect since late 2012, when the company announced the retirement of longtime CEO and chairman Richard Reese and welcomed new CEO William Meaney. With the appointment of Verrecchia, the board separates the chairman and CEO roles between two individuals, creating a new leadership structure for the company and reflecting best practices for corporate governance.
Verrecchia is also chairman of the board at Hasbro Inc., a publicly held, branded play and entertainment company. He has spent his entire career at Hasbro, holding various senior leadership roles, including chief operating officer and chief financial officer before serving as CEO from 2003-2008. He was elected chairman in 2008.
“Al has provided our board with deep executive and financial pedigree since he joined, and he’ll make a fine chairman,” said Bill Meaney, president and CEO of Iron Mountain. “I look forward to working with him in his new role and leading Iron Mountain to deliver sustainable value through steady, long-term revenue growth and a continued focus on driving strong returns on our invested capital.” 
In addition to his chairman duties for Iron Mountain and Hasbro, Verrecchia has extensive experience with board service, having been on the board of Old Stone Corporation from 1987 to 2012, FGX International Holdings from February 2009 to March 2010, and CVS Caremark from September 2004 to March 2007. 
He holds a B.A. and M.A. from the University of Rhode Island.
