The MTB was designed to fill the need for a mop sink in a lower price range, but with good splash protection. It is normally not equipped with tiling flanges, so sealant should be applied where basin meets the wall. Flanges are available upon request. Each exposed side can be equipped with vinyl or aluminum bumper guards, OR cast integral stainless steel caps. Please see the accessories section for additional information on the bumper guards. We produce the MTB in two sizes, both of which have 3" centered brass drains cast integral and a stainless steel dome strainer and screws.

The Production of Knowledge
The Challenge of Social Science Research
William H. Starbuck


Provocative call for us to reassess the task of social science research in the form of a quasi-autobiographical account of a life spent engaged in research
Thorough critique of the current practices of social science scholarship
Proposes reforms to the methodology and practice of research
An informative and entertaining consideration of the 'big picture' in social science








The Production of Knowledge
The Challenge of Social Science Research
William H. Starbuck



Description



Bill Starbuck has been one of the leading management researchers in the United States over several decades. In this book he reflects on a number of challenges associated with management and social science research--the search for a "behavioral science", the limits of rationality, the lack of reliability in many research findings, the social shaping of research agendas, cultures and judgements. It is an engaging, autobiographical account in which he discusses some of his own research and various methodological debates.

Author Information

William H. Starbuck is ITT Professor of Creative Management at the Stern School of Business, New York University.

The Production of Knowledge
The Challenge of Social Science Research
William H. Starbuck


Reviews and Awards


"In this remarkable book, one of the most original minds in all of social science shows how to make the science better. Bill Starbuck demonstrates that true scholars are defined by their inputs, not just their outputs. Inputs captured in his autobiography are converted into lessons that reshape the tools we use to understand social complexity. This book is a profound illustration of living the craft of scholarship, with equally profound guidelines to improve the craft!"-- Karl E. Weick, Rensis Likert Distinguished University Professor of Organizational Behavior and Psychology, University of Michigan
"In a fascinating account of his 40 years of investigation and learning, Bill Starbuck presents an original, razor-sharp and often devastating critique of our vast body of organizational research. He also plots the route to a better way to create useful, cumulative knowledge of organizations, This book is a must-read for anyone who wishes to study organizations and it will become a classic in our literature."--Danny Miller, Rogers-J.-A.-Bombardier Chair of Entrepreneurship Hautes Études Commerciales, Montréal
