 CAMBRIDGE, Mass., May 5 /PRNewswire/ -- Paul J. Sekhri has joined PerSeptive Biosystems, Inc. (NASDAQ: PBIO) as marketing director, Analytical Products, the company announced today. Sekhri comes to PerSeptive Biosystems from Millipore Corporation where he had been senior manager, Biotechnology Market Development.
 Sekhri will be responsible for PerSeptive's ImmunoDetection(tm) products that combine the flow-through characteristics of the company's Perfusion Chromatography(R) process with the protein specific high sensitivity of immunoassays. This growing portfolio includes ID(tm) Sensor Cartridges; Real-Time Process Monitor(tm) (RPM(tm)), the first instrument to perform real-time immunoassays to monitor biopharmaceutical production processes such as purification and fermentation; and an ImmunoDetection(tm) workstation for the research market to be introduced later this year.
 "Paul Sekhri adds another level of experienced biopharmaceutical marketing capabilities to our marketing team," said Robert B. Anacone, senior vice president, Marketing and Sales, of PerSeptive Biosystems. "We expect that his background will help establish our innovative ImmunoDetection products as important new solutions for the biopharmaceutical industry."
 Sekhri was responsible for the successful product development and launch of Millipore's Viresolve(tm) viral membrane filters. He also served as European liaison of the company's biotechnology marketing efforts. Prior to Millipore, Sekhri was director of Marketing at Zymark Corporation, and earlier served as marketing manager at Genex Corporation. He began his career as a financial consultant/account executive at Dean Witter Reynolds.
 Sekhri received a B.S. degree in zoology from the University of Maryland, and a M.S. degree in anatomy from the University of Maryland School of Medicine. Sekhri was an assistant professor at Towson State University, where he taught undergraduate anatomy and physiology.
 PerSeptive Biosystems designs, manufactures and markets proprietary products and systems for the purification and analysis of biomolecules. These bioseparations products are designed to reduce significantly the time and cost required for the development and manufacture of biopharmaceuticals. The company's current and planned products for the purification and analysis of biomolecules are based on three interrelated core technologies: Perfusion Chromatography(R) for high resolution separations of biomolecules 10 to 1,000 times faster than conventional chromatography, ImmunoDetection(tm) for real-time immunoassays in a flow-through cartridge format and Rational Surface Design(tm) synthetic surfaces that bind biomolecules with the high specificity of antibodies.

      of how immunotherapies work in each patient. We are building a pipeline 
      of immunomodulators for the treatment of cancer and inflammatory 
      diseases and leveraging the breadth of our technology through strategic 
      collaborations. http://www.enumeral.com
