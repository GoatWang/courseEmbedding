Dave Shryock has three decades of experience in financing small businesses.  Following business school, he spent eleven years at South Shore Bank in Chicago, initially as a commercial lender and eventually as President and CEO of the Bank.
He then founded SB Partners Capital Fund.  The Fund raised $25 million from investors, returning $57 million during its dozen years of existence.  The Fund focused on small businesses, and seven of its eight portfolio companies were run by ethnic minorities or women.  
Dave serves on the board of Elevate Energy, a rapidly growing, Chicago based non-profit committed to smarter energy use for all, having previously served as its Chairman.  He also is a director of Metal Flow Corporation in Holland, Michigan; and the Slovak American Foundation.  Dave is a graduate of Harvard College and Yale School of Management.

Kris served as President of Wilsonart Americas, the leading manufacturer of decorative laminate, with over $600 million in revenue.  As the first outside president in Wilsonart’s history, she drove significant improvements in revenue and EBITDA, while successfully selling the company to private equity.
Previously, as President of Herman Miller’s North American Office business, Kris drove growth and profitability through building brand, creating new products, and developing strong diverse teams. She effectively balanced growth and profitability goals, doubling operating income while growing sales over 10% annually.
Kris also led marketing for both Herman Miller and Haworth, another leading office furniture manufacturer, revitalizing their brands by clarifying essential values and creating distinct positioning.
Kris has led global product development, business development, customer service, and manufacturing teams, having started her business career as a first line supervisor in a diesel engine plant at Navistar.
Kris is a director of KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY), Columbia Forest Products, and Dexter Apache Holdings. She previously served on the boards of American Capital (NASDAQ:ACAS), Soil Safe, and Select Comfort Corporation (NASDAQ:SCSS).
