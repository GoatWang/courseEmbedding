Investment Approach


                    Lone Star seeks investment opportunities in developed markets that have suffered an economic and/or banking crisis, resulting in a dislocation in asset pricing and value opportunities.  Specifically, Lone Star seeks to capitalize on market conditions in which:
			
                

Liquidity is restricted and financing is constrained;
Financial institutions’ balance sheets are under pressure and there is a need to dispose of high volumes of assets to manage capital, deleverage and build liquidity; and
Lone Star is able to achieve a favorable position in a transaction through its large network of relationships across the globe.


                    When pursuing investment opportunities, Lone Star evaluates a broad scope of transactions including, but not limited to:
			
                

Equity and debt investments in value-oriented assets, including corporate, commercial, and single family residential real estate and consumer debt;
Other real estate and real estate-related assets;
Control investments in financially oriented and other operating companies; and
Securitized products such as RMBS (Residential Mortgage Backed Securities), CDOs (Collateralized Debt Obligations, the underlying assets of which generally consist of RMBS), CMBS (Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities) and other asset-backed securities.


                    Lone Star’s investment approach focuses on leveraging long standing relationships with counterparties to source opportunities, a comprehensive bottom-up asset-based underwriting approach, a streamlined approval process, a dedicated asset management platform and the continual evaluation of exit strategies.

                        (1) Vintage Year is the period during which the Fund either first called capital from its respective Limited Partners and/or made substantial investments.
                    

                        (2) As of March 31, 2017, Lone Star Fund X, Lone Star Residential Mortgage Fund I and Lone Star Real Estate Fund V were in their investment periods.  Investment period refers to the period of time from the formation date to the expiration of the partners’ commitments, subject to certain exceptions outlined in each Fund’s limited partnership agreement.
                    

                        (3) Aggregate price of assets purchased includes the equity, financing and other sources of capital used.

DALLAS, Nov. 15, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Lone Star Funds today announced that it has completed the final closing for Lone Star Fund X (U.S.), L.P. and Lone Star Fund X (Bermuda), L.P. (collectively "LSF X").  Total capital available is approximately $5.6 billion, which includes LSF X commitments and an anticipated co-investment from associated entities.
Commitments to LSF X exceeded LSF X's original target of $5 billion.








In April, Lone Star announced it had closed Lone Star Real Estate Fund V (U.S.), L.P. and Lone Star Real Estate Fund V (Bermuda), L.P. (collectively "LSREF V"), its fifth dedicated commercial real estate fund, at approximately $5.8 billion, exceeding its $5 billion fundraising target and reaching its $5.5 billion hard cap for third party commitments.
Lone Star, a global private equity firm, invests on behalf of its limited partners, which include institutional investors such as pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, as well as foundations and endowments that support medical research, higher education, and other philanthropic causes.  
Lone Star is a highly disciplined, value-driven investor that focuses on opportunities that emerge during periods of market dislocation, often providing liquidity to markets in the aftermath of a financial crisis.  Lone Star focuses on businesses, sellers, and assets that require capital support and management direction to succeed post-crisis. In this context, Lone Star considers a broad scope of markets, industries, and opportunities through equity and debt investments in value-oriented assets, real estate and real estate-related assets, control investments in operating companies, and securitized products. 
Since the establishment of its first fund in 1995, Lone Star has organized seventeen private equity funds with aggregate capital commitments exceeding $70 billion.

Lone Star Fund V			

Lone Star Fund V (U.S.), L.P. and Lone Star Fund V (Bermuda), L.P. (collectively, “Lone Star Fund V”), formed in September 2004, held their final closings in December 2004 with $5.1 billion in combined capital commitments.  Over its 40 month investment period, Lone Star Fund V invested substantially all of its equity capital in 56 investments comprised of 4,613 assets with an aggregate purchase price of approximately $16.6 billion.  Transactions consummated by Lone Star Fund V included investments, directly or through joint ventures, in secured and corporate unsecured non-performing loans, real estate and financially oriented and real estate-rich operating companies.
During the early stages of Lone Star Fund V’s investment period, distressed opportunities continued to expand in Germany as approximately 33% of the capital was invested in the country.  Major acquisitions in Germany included a mortgage bank that required recapitalization, as well as numerous purchases of non-performing loan portfolios.  Investment activity in the U.S. also began to accelerate upon signs of weakness in the subprime residential mortgage market.
