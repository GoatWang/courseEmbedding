Concrete Ready Mix
Serving San Francisco to San Jose

Avoid the frustration of producing concrete on your work site. Avoid dealing
	 with the bags of cement, sand, aggregate (gravel) and possibly other additives
	 (like color and ad mixtures) that must be delivered to the construction
	 area. And remember the clean supply of water that is necessary, along
	 with a rented hopper to mix the concrete. One small error in the wet/dry
	 ratio can render an entire batch of concrete unusable.

A1 Materials offers you the solution to this messy process.
A1 Materials ready mixed concrete is a precise mixture that is premixed
	 in a batch plant and is ready to be dropped at your home or job site based
	 on your custom order. Select from Custom Colors and Add Mixtures to create
	 the perfect concrete mix for your project.
Our ready mix concrete products consist of properly proportioned mixes
	 we prepare and deliver in a unhardened condition for pouring and shaping
	 into designed forms at the job site, like driveways, foundations, sidewalks,
	 landscape borders, block walls, over passes, pools, dams, footings for
	 gates and fences and much more.
Selecting the best concrete mix for a job entails:

Determining the ingredients that will produce the desired permeability,
			 strength, appearance and other properties of the concrete after it has
			 hardened and cured.


Determining the ingredients that are necessary to achieve a workable consistency
			 considering the weather and other conditions at the job site.

​Why Choose Us
A1 Materials ready Mix Concrete is focused on providing great service,
	 ensuring customer satisfaction 100% of the time.
We will do everything we can to meet your expectations. With a variety
	 of add mixtures and colors to choose from, we are sure your expectations
	 will be met. With our batch plant here in San Carlos, we can ensure the
	 overall high quality of the concrete.
