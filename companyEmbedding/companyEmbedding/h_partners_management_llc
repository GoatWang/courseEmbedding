Rehan Jaffer acquired his taste for activist investing while at Dan Loeb's Third Point, a pioneer activist fund. After his time at Third Point, Jaffer briefly joined River Run Partners in 2004, after which he went on to found H Partners. In the book Hedge Hunters, Loeb says of Jaffer: “He is super-hungry. He’s got a good nose. He’s very intelligent. So he’s got a great combination of having a high IQ, really strong financial analytics, a great nose for value, and great trader sense.”                    Fund Profile  Filing Period:  2017-06-30 2017-03-31 2016-12-31 2016-09-30 2016-06-30 2016-03-31 2015-12-31 2015-09-30 2015-06-30 2015-03-31 2014-12-31 2014-09-30 2014-06-30 2014-03-31 2013-12-31 2013-09-30 2013-06-30 2013-03-31 2012-12-31 2012-09-30 2012-06-30 2012-03-31 2011-12-31 2011-09-30 2011-06-30 2011-03-31 2010-12-31          Fund Name: H Partners Management   Manager Rehan Jaffer   Portfolio Value $1,171,010,000   Change This QTR +0.85%                 Top Holdings  Login to See All Holdings | Sign up      Filing Period:  2017-06-30 2017-03-31 2016-12-31 2016-09-30 2016-06-30 2016-03-31 2015-12-31 2015-09-30 2015-06-30 2015-03-31 2014-12-31 2014-09-30 2014-06-30 2014-03-31 2013-12-31 2013-09-30 2013-06-30 2013-03-31 2012-12-31 2012-09-30 2012-06-30 2012-03-31 2011-12-31 2011-09-30 2011-06-30 2011-03-31 2010-12-31     Last updated on May 15, 2017, 1:38 pm based on SEC 13F filings Last update: May 15, 2017, 1:38 pm              No.  Security  Ticker  Shares  Value (x$1000)  Activity  % Port      1.

H Partners Management seeks to achieve superior risk-adjusted returns by selectinginvestments that trade at a discount to their appropriate comparables and have a catalyst for realization of value. Their fund primarily invests in equity securities, distressed instruments and company obligations. H Partners's investment approach is based on fundamental, bottom-up stock and bond selections. Each position will be evaluated based on its potential to generate expected returns in excess of its worst case downside. Risk measurement will be based on the volatility of the underlying cash flows of the security, the \"\"layer\"\" in the capitalization, and comparable valuations. Profit potential is evaluated by determining the probability and timing of possible positive and negative catalysts combined with an estimate of the total return to be realized assuming the catalyst occurs.
