 Minn Shares Inc. (OTCMKTS:MSHSD) Files An 8-K Changes in Registrant’s Certifying Accountant

Item 4.01




Changes in Registrants Certifying
Accountant.




Explanatory Note


This amended Current Report on Form 8-K/A (8-K/A) is being filed
to amend the Current Report on Form 8-K regarding a change in
certifying accountant filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on February 8, 2017 (the Original 8-K), to correct a
statement in the Original 8-K regarding the absence of reportable
events as that term is defined in RegulationS-K,
Item304(a)(1)(v).


During the Companys two most recent fiscal years and the
subsequent interim period from January 1, 2017 through the date
of Lurie, LLPs (Lurie) dismissal, there were no reportable events
as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K,
except that in connection with its audit of the Companys
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, Lurie
reported the existence of two material weaknesses in the internal
control over financial reporting of Titan CNG LLC (Titan), a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, to the board of managers
of Titan. The ineffectiveness of Titans internal control over
financial reporting was due to the following material weaknesses:
(1) a lack of internal control procedures and of proper review
and approval procedures with regards to Titans consolidated
financial statements and monthly close process and (2) a lack of
adequate segregation of duties and necessary corporate accounting
resources in the Companys financial reporting process and
accounting function as a result of the Companys limited financial
resources to support hiring of personnel and implementation of
accounting systems. Until such time as the Company expands its
staff to include additional accounting personnel and hire a full
time chief financial officer, it is likely the Company will
continue to report material weaknesses in its internal control
over financial reporting. These material weaknesses have not been
corrected.


Except for the added disclosure that there were reportable
events, as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of
Regulation S-K, this 8-K/A does not amend or update any other
information contained in the Original 8-K.


The Company has provided Lurie with a copy of the foregoing
statements and has requested and received from Lurie a copy of
the letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission
stating that Lurie agrees with the above statements. A copy of
the letter from Lurie is attached as Exhibit16.1 to this Form
8-K.




Item 9.01


Financial Statements and Exhibits.







(d)


Exhibits: the following exhibits are filed as part of this
report:






Exhibit No.
