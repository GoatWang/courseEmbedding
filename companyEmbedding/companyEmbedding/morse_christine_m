340B Programs In Disproportionate Share Hospitals [Ober|Kaler]
June 25, 2013










Professional Biography





Overview

Ms. Morse focuses on general health care law and regulatory matters.

Much of her practice deals with issues related to fraud and abuse claims, reimbursement, corporate compliance, long term care and Medicare Part B.
Ms. Morse's strong regulatory background provides the necessary foundation for her health care practice, which typically includes coordination of, and participation in, acquisition due diligence, internal investigations, voluntary disclosures, and investigations resulting from inquiries by various governmental authorities. She has represented a wide range of provider types, including pharmacies, laboratories, hospitals, hospital systems, durable medical equipment (DME) providers, home health providers, physicians and other health care practitioners, device manufacturers, nursing homes and other long term care providers. She regularly addresses clients' concerns and issues arising from state and federal self-referral laws (including Stark), Anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. She has worked on numerous qui tam (whistleblower) suits.
Ms. Morse's work often overlaps with our White Collar Group. More recently, she has assisted in government investigations initiated by United States Attorneys Offices and state Attorneys General Offices of various provider types, including laboratories, pharmacies and hospitals. Ms. Morse has represented providers from the initial phases of an investigation through settlement and/or litigation and has experience in subpoena response, document productions, witness interviews and negotiation processes. With more than ten years' experience in compliance issues relating to many different provider types, and familiarity with providers' operations, she has demonstrated the ability to bring professionalism and positive results in those situations where complex and sensitive issues often arise.
Ms. Morse has also developed significant legal and operational experience relating to institutional and specialty pharmacies, including licensure, Medicaid reimbursement and Medicare Part D issues. Additionally, Ms. Morse has experience in assisting both pharmacies and "covered entities" such as Disproportionate Share Hospitals (DSHs), Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), and Ryan White Centers with issues related to their participation in the Health Resources and Services Administration's (HRSAs) 340B Drug Discount Program.
