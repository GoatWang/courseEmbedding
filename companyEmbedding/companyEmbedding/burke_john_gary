University of Miami

                  A private research university with more than 15,000 students from around the world, the University of Miami is a vibrant and diverse academic community focused on teaching and learning, the discovery of new knowledge, and service to the South Florida region and beyond.

Product Description▼▲
The Gospel of John is a genuine literary masterpiece. In the first instance it is simple, accessible, clear, and easily applicable. In the second instance, it is enigmatic in its wording, its oddly times historical references, and its controversial interpretation of events with an obvious theological agenda, namely, to convince you to believe and follow Jesus Christ.In John [NIVAC] seasoned Johannine scholar Gary Burge unpacks the Gospel of John revealing a message that is as powerful, compelling, and transforming today as it was when John wrote the book. Indeed, Burge tends to follow John's lead by telling John's story after him while always pointing towards the Word made flesh, Jesus Christ.

Publisher's Description▼▲
Most Bible commentaries take us on a one-way trip from our world to the world of the Bible. But they leave us there, assuming that we can somehow make the return journey on our own. In other words, they focus on the original meaning of the passage but dont discuss its contemporary application. The information they offer is valuablebut the job is only half done! The NIV Application Commentary Series helps us with both halves of the interpretive task. This new and unique series shows readers how to bring an ancient message into a modern context. It explains not only what the Bible meant but also how it can speak powerfully today.


Author Bio▼▲
 Gary M. Burge (PhD, King's College, Aberdeen University) is a professor of New Testament in the Department of Biblical and Theological Studies at Wheaton College and Graduate School, Wheaton, Illinois. Gary has authored a number of books, including Who Are Gods People in the Middle East? What Christians Are Not Being Told About Israel and the Palestinians; John and Letters of John in the NIV Application Commentary series; The New Testament in Antiquity (coauthored with Lynn Cohick and Gene Green); and the first three volumes in the Ancient Context, Ancient Faith series, The Bible and the Land and Jesus, the Middle Eastern Storyteller, and Encounters with Jesus. Gary specializes in the Middle East, its churches, and its history in the Hellenistic period. 

Endorsements▼▲
The NIV Application Commentary Series promises to be of very great service to all who preach and teach the Word of God.
J.I. Packer
Regent College 

The NIV Application Commentary Series doesn't fool around: it gets right down to business, brining this ancient and powerful word of God into the present so that it can be heard and believed with all the freshness of a new day, with all the immediacy of a friend's embrace.
Eugene Peterson,
Regent College

The NIV Application Commentary Series helps pastors and Bible teachers with one the most neglected elements in good preaching--accurate, useful application. Most commentaries tell you a few things that are helpful and much that you do not need to know. By dealing with the original meaning and contemporary significance of each passage, the NIV Application Commentary Series promises to be helpful all the way around. 
James Montgomery Boice
Tenth Presbyterian Church, Philadelphia, PA

This series promises to become an indispensable tool for every pastor and teacher who seeks to make the Bible's timeless message speak to this generation.
Billy Graham

Here, at last, is a commentary that makes the proper circuit from the biblical world to main street. The NIV Application Commentary is magnificent gift to the church.
Kent Hughes,
College Church, Wheaton, IL

Here at last is a commentary which is not only academically well informed but which helps the contemporary reader hear God's word and consider its implications; scholarship in the service of the church.
Arthur Rowe,
Spurgeon's College


If you want to avoid hanging applicational elephants from interpretive threads, then the NIV Application Commentary Series is for you. This series excels at both original meaning and contemporary significance. I support it one hundred percent.
Howard J. Hendricks,
Dallas Theological Seminary

This is the pulpit for the 21st Century
George K. Brushaber,
President, Bethel College & Seminary

It takes more than interpretation of God's word to change lives, it takes application. Application is the bottom line in teaching and preaching. Without it, we've missed the point of the Bible. The NIV Application Commentary is an outstanding resource for pastors and anyone else who is serious about developing "doers of the word".
Rick Warren,
Saddleback Church

The NIV Application Commentary Series shares the same goal that has been the passion of my own ministry--communicating God's word to a contemporary audience so that they feel the full impact of its message.
Bill Hybels,
Willow Creek Community Church

This series dares to go where few scholars have gone before--into the real life world of biblical application faced by pastors and teachers everyday. This is everything a good commentary series should be.
Leith Anderson
Pastor, Wooddale Church

Some commentaries build walls that isolate you back in the ancient world. The NIV Application Commentary builds bridges that make the Bible come alive with meaning for contemporary life--and the series do so concisely, clearly, and accurately. No wasted words or academic detours--just solid help and practical truth.
Warren W. Weirsbe

            If you are looking for a commentary to shed light on a Scripture this commentary will amaze you.  This NIV commentary is easy to read. I spoke to someone once who said...a commentary is used by pastors to build a stronger foundation for their sermons.  No one reads a commentary from front to back.  Well, I did just that.  This book of John brings to life for the reader the life of Jesus Christ, the time period he lived in as well transcend 2000 years and remains current today in the life of Christians and Church life.  This is a must read for everyone. I clearly give it 10 stars.

            As a full-time minister, I appreciate the thoughtful application of the text this commentary offers. Burge rightfully sees in John's gospel challenges to our religious forms and our Christian walk, encouraging us to a spiritual encounter with the Bread of Heaven. Tough texts are recognized as such and offer more than cursory treatment (ie: 7:37f, 7:53-8:12, 20:21ff). The scholarship is solid and direction for further study is helpful. This work draws the reader into a thirst for more of John's Gospel and ultimately it inspires belief in Jesus as the Christ, the Son of God, in whose name we have life.

            I absolutely love this commentary.  Easy to read.  Deep enough to stimulate.  And great for building sermons or preparing for Bible class.  Well worth the money.
