History[edit]
Hotels.com was established in 1991 by David Litman and Robert Diener as the Hotel Reservations Network (HRN), providing hotel booking via a toll-free phone number in the United States.[1] In 2001, the company was acquired by USA Networks Inc (USAI) which also acquired a controlling interest in Expedia, the online travel booking company.
After buying the domain name for approximately US$11m,[2] HRN changed its name in 2002 to Hotels.com and launched the offline brand 1-800-2-Hotels as well as allowing hotel bookings on line. There followed a period of rapid international expansion with 29 sites added over the next two years. In 2003, USAI was renamed InterActiveCorp (IAC). In 2005 IAC separated its travel business under the name Expedia Inc. Hotels.com then became an operating company of Expedia Inc.[3]
International growth since 2002 has included web sites for North, Central and South America, Europe, Australia, Japan, China and the Pacific Rim, the Middle East and South Africa. Web sites for Indonesia and Vietnam launched in 2011. Customers in all countries can book online or by phoning one of the multilingual call centres. Calls are both toll-free and paid, depending on the country of booking.[3]
In 2011, Hotels.com launched an iPad application and updated its mobile phone product on iPhone and Android.[4]
On December 1, 2016, Hotels.com took over Venere.com (another Expedia owned company).
U.S. disability rights infringement[edit]
In May 2007, Hotels.com was subject to a class action complaint (Smith v. Hotels.com L.P., California Superior Court, Alameda County, Case No. RG07327029) brought against them for “ongoing discrimination against persons with mobility disabilities who desire to, but cannot, use hotels.com’s worldwide reservation network to make reservations for hotel rooms”.[5] The company denied the accusation and opposed the action, but was found guilty on one count of infringing California’s Unruh Civil Rights Act, and on one count in violation of Unfair Competition Law. Hotels.com then agreed to provide suitable accessibility information about hotels sold on its website.[6]
Loyalty program[edit]
Like its competitors (such as Agoda), Hotels.com has a loyalty program.[7] This allows customers to claim discounts on most, but not all, hotels, regardless of hotel chain or type.[8] For every 10 nights stayed at hotels booked with hotels.com, customers can claim a price reduction on a subsequent booking. This reduction is equivalent to the average amount paid for those nights. The reduction does not reduce taxes and fees payments, and some other restrictions apply.[9] The program is called "Hotels.com Rewards" (formerly "Welcome Rewards") and launched in the US, Canada and much of Latin America in 2008. It then extended to the UK and Australia in 2010, and to more than 40 additional countries in 2011.
Hotel Price Index[edit]
Starting 2004, Hotels.com has published a twice-yearly review of international hotel room price trends called the Hotels.com Hotel Price Index based on the prices paid per room by its customers using a weighted average based on the number of rooms sold in each of the markets in which it operates.[10] Information includes notable price changes and comparisons between destinations, hotel types, and other price-related analyses for the previous six months.[11] The Hotel Price Index is published both digitally and in print, and is aimed at journalists, the media, and hoteliers as part of its public relations.
Advertising[edit]




Hotels.com RusLine CRJ100 logojet at Pulkovo Airport (2017)


In advertisements, Hotels.com had a character named Smart (Voiced by Ed Helms) who appeared in 2009, 2010 and 2011 advertisements. In 2012, the "Smart" character was given a new look, as part of the new global red brand launched in April of that year, his look changed from clay animation to CGI, and he no longer had a goatee, along with his outfit changed from a buttoned suit to a tuxedo, and his face also was tweaked as well.
In 2014, Hotels.com introduced the character "Captain Obvious", who makes self-evident comments with the aim of communicating that hotels.com is the obvious choice. The campaign was devised by the ad firm Crispin Porter + Bogusky.[12]

History[edit]
Hotels.com was established in 1991 by David Litman and Robert Diener as the Hotel Reservations Network (HRN), providing hotel booking via a toll-free phone number in the United States.[1] In 2001, the company was acquired by USA Networks Inc (USAI) which also acquired a controlling interest in Expedia, the online travel booking company.
After buying the domain name for approximately US$11m,[2] HRN changed its name in 2002 to Hotels.com and launched the offline brand 1-800-2-Hotels as well as allowing hotel bookings on line. There followed a period of rapid international expansion with 29 sites added over the next two years. In 2003, USAI was renamed InterActiveCorp (IAC). In 2005 IAC separated its travel business under the name Expedia Inc. Hotels.com then became an operating company of Expedia Inc.[3]
International growth since 2002 has included web sites for North, Central and South America, Europe, Australia, Japan, China and the Pacific Rim, the Middle East and South Africa. Web sites for Indonesia and Vietnam launched in 2011. Customers in all countries can book online or by phoning one of the multilingual call centres. Calls are both toll-free and paid, depending on the country of booking.[3]
In 2011, Hotels.com launched an iPad application and updated its mobile phone product on iPhone and Android.[4]
On December 1, 2016, Hotels.com took over Venere.com (another Expedia owned company).
U.S. disability rights infringement[edit]
In May 2007, Hotels.com was subject to a class action complaint (Smith v. Hotels.com L.P., California Superior Court, Alameda County, Case No. RG07327029) brought against them for “ongoing discrimination against persons with mobility disabilities who desire to, but cannot, use hotels.com’s worldwide reservation network to make reservations for hotel rooms”.[5] The company denied the accusation and opposed the action, but was found guilty on one count of infringing California’s Unruh Civil Rights Act, and on one count in violation of Unfair Competition Law. Hotels.com then agreed to provide suitable accessibility information about hotels sold on its website.[6]

Like its competitors (such as Agoda), Hotels.com has a loyalty program.[7] This allows customers to claim discounts on most, but not all, hotels, regardless of hotel chain or type.[8] For every 10 nights stayed at hotels booked with hotels.com, customers can claim a price reduction on a subsequent booking. This reduction is equivalent to the average amount paid for those nights. The reduction does not reduce taxes and fees payments, and some other restrictions apply.[9] The program is called "Hotels.com Rewards" (formerly "Welcome Rewards") and launched in the US, Canada and much of Latin America in 2008. It then extended to the UK and Australia in 2010, and to more than 40 additional countries in 2011.
Hotel Price Index[edit]
Starting 2004, Hotels.com has published a twice-yearly review of international hotel room price trends called the Hotels.com Hotel Price Index based on the prices paid per room by its customers using a weighted average based on the number of rooms sold in each of the markets in which it operates.[10] Information includes notable price changes and comparisons between destinations, hotel types, and other price-related analyses for the previous six months.[11] The Hotel Price Index is published both digitally and in print, and is aimed at journalists, the media, and hoteliers as part of its public relations.
Advertising[edit]




Hotels.com RusLine CRJ100 logojet at Pulkovo Airport (2017)


In advertisements, Hotels.com had a character named Smart (Voiced by Ed Helms) who appeared in 2009, 2010 and 2011 advertisements. In 2012, the "Smart" character was given a new look, as part of the new global red brand launched in April of that year, his look changed from clay animation to CGI, and he no longer had a goatee, along with his outfit changed from a buttoned suit to a tuxedo, and his face also was tweaked as well.
In 2014, Hotels.com introduced the character "Captain Obvious", who makes self-evident comments with the aim of communicating that hotels.com is the obvious choice. The campaign was devised by the ad firm Crispin Porter + Bogusky.[12]

History[edit]
Hotels.com was established in 1991 by David Litman and Robert Diener as the Hotel Reservations Network (HRN), providing hotel booking via a toll-free phone number in the United States.[1] In 2001, the company was acquired by USA Networks Inc (USAI) which also acquired a controlling interest in Expedia, the online travel booking company.
After buying the domain name for approximately US$11m,[2] HRN changed its name in 2002 to Hotels.com and launched the offline brand 1-800-2-Hotels as well as allowing hotel bookings on line. There followed a period of rapid international expansion with 29 sites added over the next two years. In 2003, USAI was renamed InterActiveCorp (IAC). In 2005 IAC separated its travel business under the name Expedia Inc. Hotels.com then became an operating company of Expedia Inc.[3]
International growth since 2002 has included web sites for North, Central and South America, Europe, Australia, Japan, China and the Pacific Rim, the Middle East and South Africa. Web sites for Indonesia and Vietnam launched in 2011. Customers in all countries can book online or by phoning one of the multilingual call centres. Calls are both toll-free and paid, depending on the country of booking.[3]
In 2011, Hotels.com launched an iPad application and updated its mobile phone product on iPhone and Android.[4]
On December 1, 2016, Hotels.com took over Venere.com (another Expedia owned company).
U.S. disability rights infringement[edit]
In May 2007, Hotels.com was subject to a class action complaint (Smith v. Hotels.com L.P., California Superior Court, Alameda County, Case No. RG07327029) brought against them for “ongoing discrimination against persons with mobility disabilities who desire to, but cannot, use hotels.com’s worldwide reservation network to make reservations for hotel rooms”.[5] The company denied the accusation and opposed the action, but was found guilty on one count of infringing California’s Unruh Civil Rights Act, and on one count in violation of Unfair Competition Law. Hotels.com then agreed to provide suitable accessibility information about hotels sold on its website.[6]
Loyalty program[edit]
Like its competitors (such as Agoda), Hotels.com has a loyalty program.[7] This allows customers to claim discounts on most, but not all, hotels, regardless of hotel chain or type.[8] For every 10 nights stayed at hotels booked with hotels.com, customers can claim a price reduction on a subsequent booking. This reduction is equivalent to the average amount paid for those nights. The reduction does not reduce taxes and fees payments, and some other restrictions apply.[9] The program is called "Hotels.com Rewards" (formerly "Welcome Rewards") and launched in the US, Canada and much of Latin America in 2008. It then extended to the UK and Australia in 2010, and to more than 40 additional countries in 2011.
Hotel Price Index[edit]
Starting 2004, Hotels.com has published a twice-yearly review of international hotel room price trends called the Hotels.com Hotel Price Index based on the prices paid per room by its customers using a weighted average based on the number of rooms sold in each of the markets in which it operates.[10] Information includes notable price changes and comparisons between destinations, hotel types, and other price-related analyses for the previous six months.[11] The Hotel Price Index is published both digitally and in print, and is aimed at journalists, the media, and hoteliers as part of its public relations.

Way too complicated..


            If you want to do basic checks in a city, this app is fine, but for a frequent Hotels.com user and rewards member, this app is cumbersome and complicated.  Easier to just open your web browser and go to the site than fight with this app.

Worst version of Hotels.com app.  Love Hotels.com


            I use Hotels.com all the time and love it, but this version of the app is terrible.  Hard to use, links poorly to account.  Can't get to account info or use free nights.  Just really a bad app.  Use the website instead and skip the app.  Love the apps on other devices, need to make this app like other versions and it will be much better.

Bare Bones


            This app does the basic stuff but that's it. No way to view saved hotels, very little advanced searching options, and no way to view rewards status.

Hotel.com


            Great for booking room but no option to check on your account. This needs to be fixed. Why use this app when you need to go to web site to check point status a view your account info.

Crashes often


            You can book directly via the app, which is nice. But it crashes often in the middle of booking. Needs an update.
Also, Hotels.com recently re-did their Rewards program erasing all of my free hotel nights and reviews of hotels without notice. I will not be using them again.

didn't have to type in anything but my credit card


            I was able to login to my rewards account and schedule a hotel trip without typing in anything else except for my credit card number.  To me, that makes this a good modern app!  Needs printing support.  If it had that, it'd get 5 stars.

Good Start


            I use Hotels.com all the time when I travel. The app is a good start; it's clean and fast. I wish this app would bring back the sexy moving splash screen that was on the iPad version right after it [app] was completely redesigned. 

At the moment the only problem I have with this app is the small thumbnail size photos for some hotels. I hope this get fix in a feature update.

Almost PERFECT


            But I cannot share a possible choice of hotel by email. That would be VERY useful.

Otherwise a real step UP from the WEB site. Good work.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
