                                    The tracking system is applicable as soon as an order is first created. The GPS tracking works only with on-demand orders and is active as soon as our delivery executives (Pathao Riders) pick up the order. For merchant orders, you can see every stage of order as it is picked up and travels through out Dhaka, to the cash collection processes, and is eventually completed. Our delivery person at each stage of the delivery will update the status of each package individually, so you always know where your packages are.

Working at Pathao – Pathao Engineering – MediumHomepageFollowSign in / Sign upNavid KhanBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingJul 23Working at PathaoI thought of working at Pathao, when I initially saw how it actually made my life easier. After I applied for the position, I was called one evening and the head of Human resources, Sifat Hasan engaged in an eventful phone interview. Two days later, I was asked to come to the office for a chat by the Junior VP, Ahmed Fahad. Two days later they confirmed my postion and I was asked to come in. Interviews are usually a cumbersome process, but here, it seemed more of a “getting to know each other” than an “Interview”.On the first day at Pathao. I went to their office and I was introduced to everyone by Sifat Hasan. Everyone was quite busy but they all seemed to have a great time and they took a few minutes off to talk to me. A week in the office and I could feel that everyone here is working towards making peoples’ lives easier rather than working to meet deadlines.One of the best things here is the flat organizational nature. You get to interact with the VP’s on a daily basis and not just to ask how they are doing, but sharing your ideas about how things can be made better. There is no stop in the flow of ideas. Everything moves fast, fails fast and learns fast. There are only formalities but no restrictions on how you want to work on your job. Here, I was not eased into the job by being spoon fed, I was given a task and all the help and I was expected to do it how I see fit.As the whole organization it is still growing. I feel its potential and also my own. I feel that I can have an impact on its operations and my work here will be acknowledged. I thought it would take a while for me to adjust and get my work done, but when I saw people looking for me and asking me for solutions and ideas for ways a certain task could be done better. I could understand that I was given more responsibility that I expected in the first month. But that was not a bad thing, I got all the help I needed and I also got the hang of my job faster. Not only that, I could see the acknowledgement from people when I did my job and I knew it had an impact on the bigger picture. Pathao is growing really fast and it will be the future of Bangladesh’s on demand service. To serve the on demand needs of the country Pathao needs a lot of people. When I joined here there were about 150 people, within two months the number grew to 180 plus. New office space being acquired and all of us trying to make it feel like home. There are weekly meetings which are not real meetings but just another reason to have a good time at the office. The new joiners are introduced and the company achievements are shared with everyone through these meetings. There are training sessions that happen every week on different topic that are relevant for the work we are doing and also for the career.Here at pathao, we face challenges every day and we overcome them on a daily basis. Being challenged every day means we are working towards making Pathao products better every day. We work with the drive, that our work here will greatly benefit the people out there. I do not just have to assume the effects of Pathao in Dhaka. I can see it in real time.Working at Pathao has been a good learning and growing experience. The future prospects of this company does not seem like hard work but more exciting. I hope to be a part of this company while it reaches the lives of the people of the country and also to celebrate small wins that we achieve every day.Share2Never miss a story from Pathao Engineering, when you sign up for Medium.

Pathao Aims To Solve Two Major Problems in Bangladesh

Very few startups in Bangladesh are working to solving two major problems. Pathao, Bangladesh’s one of the fastest growing technology start-up is working to create solution in logistic sector as well as in the transportation sector.
Pathao is developing tangible solutions to battle the country’s biggest infrastructural problems. After establishing e-commerce Delivery Company in Bangladesh, they are now expanding into the ride-hailing transportation space. Using a dynamic fleet of motorbikes, Pathao’s solutions are harnessing the power of technology to change the face of Bangladesh.
Recently SD Asia had the chance to talk with Hussain M Elius, CEO of Pathao. He talked about the influence behind Pathao, Business plan and some challenges of managing a logistic startup.
 Influence behind ‘Pathao’:
‘Pathao’ is trying to tackle a local problem. ‘’Being born and bred in Dhaka we recognized traffic was one of the gaping problems in the city. We set about to solve that in their own way – first by building infrastructure around mass moving packages and now into more on-demand point-to-point deliveries and packages’’ Elius said.
They recognized the booming e-commerce industry and decided that is something that needs our service so that was their first target. After that, they moved on to transportation. Given the agonizing hours spent on cars and CNGs we knew two-wheelers to be the most viable option in a crowded but compact city like Dhaka. They are demo testing on demand motorcycle ride in Dhaka city now.
 
Pathao’s plan with the recent investment:

Pathao is currently looking to expand its team with industry leading professionals. Backed up by international venture capital, they are one of the most rapidly growing teams in Dhaka and want to stay true to the start up roots. Thus, culture is very important to us. They are looking for high achievers who will go above and beyond their job descriptions to fulfill our long-term vision. So we are investing in getting an A-Class team in place who are entrepreneurial, open to using the latest technology and want to super-charge their career out of the regular 9 to 5.
The tech they have built is extremely scalable, and they will be positioning theirselves for growth in upcoming months.
 
Pathao team:

There are 100 people in Pathao fleet and 40 people in the executive and development team. By end of December, they expect to have a total of 200 people in the team. They have a plan to have the largest last-mile delivery fleet in Bangladesh by the end of 2016.
 
Business model Marketing and Future plan of Pathao:
They are providing delivery and cash-collection support to businesses through Pathao Fulfillment and transportation service through Pathao Rides.
The idea of Pathao has always been to scale across different verticals. They will use the same base infrastructure to serve different markets. Pathao Rides is only one of our new verticals and more will be coming online, as early as the first quarter of 2017.
In the near future, Pathao is planning want to activate thousands of bikers on the street involved in hyperlocal deliveries and transportation. They are creating a new profession – entrepreneurs powered by technology who can work as hard or as little as they want, but still be accountable and earn more than their average peer.
Logistics startup’s challenges in Bangladesh and How to overcome:
According to Elius, “The challenges are enormous, but not insurmountable. It took a lot of trial-and-error, a lot of studying the data and a dash of luck to finally have a stable system that can cater to our hundreds of active merchants. Getting trust of businesses was the most crucial in the process. We were fortunate to have a great team in place’’.
They are also facing the problem of cash handling. They are looking at Cash-On-Delivery as an opportunity instead of a problem.
