No other SUV> * in this class gives you the choice of 2WD, 4WD, and Auto Modes. Turn the available All-Mode® 4x4-i dial, located just behind the gearshift, to lock into 4WD on rough terrain and in varying weather. Turn it again to switch into 2WD for better mileage. The intuitive Auto Mode senses slippery roads or rough terrain and automatically adjusts power to each wheel. When things smooth out, it switches back to 2WD.
		
		
	

					
				










7 PREMIUM SEATS. YES, 7. 


Impressive Passenger Volume
Fill it up with seven passengers, and the Pathfinder still has room for up to 16 cubic feet of cargo. Drop the 3rd row and you’ve got more than 47 cubic feet, or drop both the 2nd and 3rd rows and you’ve got a virtually flat space with 79.8 cubic feet of cargo for your seriously big loads. There’s also a large under-floor storage area that keeps valuables out of sight. It’s easily accessed whether the 3rd row is folded or upright, giving added cargo room even when you have seven passengers along for the ride.> *
