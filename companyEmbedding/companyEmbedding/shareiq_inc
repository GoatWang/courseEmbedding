      Marketing; Opens First US Office




Company Helps Brands Measure, Analyze and Optimize the Performance 
      of Their Visual Content Across Social Media Platforms and Publishers






July 06, 2017 11:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK & BERLIN--(BUSINESS WIRE)--ShareIQ today launched the first image performance platform to provide 
      full transparency on how branded visual content engages consumers across 
      social media platforms and publishers. With three billion images being 
      uploaded to the web every day, the software-as-a-service solves a 
      growing problem facing brands: the lack of visibility in how, where and 
      why their visual content is seen and shared across the web. By 
      identifying, tracking and anticipating how images lead to engagement and 
      action, ShareIQ enables brands to measure and optimize their visual 
      content.
    


      Through the deployment of proprietary image DNA technology, ShareIQ has 
      analyzed and indexed more than 750 billion digital brand images. The 
      platform creates in-depth performance analyses on both owned and 
      competitive images so that brands can discover exactly what visual 
      images, be it theirs or their competitors’, inspire influencers and 
      drive social trends. Launch customers include Tommy Hilfiger, a second 
      leading designer lifestyle brand, an international food and beverage 
      company and a global high-end automotive manufacturer. In 
      addition, the Berlin-based company has opened its first US office in New 
      York City.
    

      “Our goal at ShareIQ is to give our customers a three-dimensional view 
      of image activity and to help them understand how visual content is 
      posted, shared and discovered across the Internet,” said Brian Killen, 
      founder and CEO, ShareIQ. “We can show you what worked yesterday or last 
      month and, more importantly, what’s going to work tomorrow. At the CMO 
      level, ShareIQ is a must-have solution that enables marketing teams to 
      benchmark against competitors´ image performance and optimize their ad 
      spend and brand investments.”
    

ShareIQ Product Offerings


ShareIQ Analytics PlatformThe ShareIQ analytics platform 
      helps marketers understand when, where and how visual content engages 
      consumers across social media platforms and publishers. The system 
      focuses on visual content performance, providing insight on which 
      specific images, tags, platforms or publishers perform best for a brand 
      and its competition. Within the platform, a ‘Share Tree’ feature reveals 
      the people and publishers that make the biggest impact to enhance 
      influencer marketing efforts as well as the distribution strategy of 
      future content. Brands can quickly map the universe of those who post 
      and share images to influence others.
    

ShareIQ Custom AudiencesVisual content now creates a 
      demonstrable discover-to-buy pathway, and with ShareIQ, marketers for 
      the first time can flexibly build custom audiences of viewers, posters 
      or sharers of images. Within the platform, brands can simply search by 
      image, collection, brand or keyword to create preferred audiences. 
      Through company partnerships, these audiences are then matched to 
      anonymous cookie IDs for targeted digital advertising.
    

About ShareIQShareIQ is image performance SaaS for brands, 
      helping brands measure and optimize their visual content, and benchmark 
      their competitors. Co-founded by Brian Killen and Bernhard Weisshuhn, 
      the company provides brands with unique and actionable insights on the 
      performance of visual content across social media platforms and 
      publishers. At its heart, ShareIQ is a powerful analytics and targeting 
      platform to identify, discover and understand how visual images are seen 
      and shared online. Brand marketing teams who oversee earned, owned and 
      paid media work within the ShareIQ platform to better understand how 
      images lead to action, engagement, influence and purchase. Discover more

ShareIQ helps brands track their product images across the web

As more and more product images get shared on platforms like Instagram, Pinterest and Tumblr, ShareIQ says it can help brands understand what’s going on.
Founder and CEO Brian Killen used to work as the head of strategy at marketing company Acxiom, and he recalled being told by a retail marketing executive, “I see my pictures all over Pinterest and websites and all over the globe, but there’s no product information, no detail, I don’t know how people discovered them. How do I get people to know that they can buy it from me?” So he started ShareIQ to answer those questions.
While other companies like Curalate and Olapic have also built marketing tools around social photo-sharing, Killen said ShareIQ is uniquely focused on helping brands understand how their images spreading across the web, and how those images are contributing to the company’s bottom line.

ShareIQ products include an analytics platform covering things like a brand’s most engaged content and the total audience reached by that content. It also includes a “share tree” displaying how different users and publishers are spreading the content, and data on how a brand’s performance stacks up against competitors.
 The company also offers a tool for creating “custom audiences” of people who have seen or shared a brand’s image. So if you scrolled past a photo of a cool product but had no idea how to buy it, you might soon start seeing ads that actually direct you to the product page.
Behind the scenes, Killen said ShareIQ has developed a new approach to storing images and associated data, one that allows the company to “really get massive scale, super high accuracy, super fast matching and speed, and very, very low cost on the server.” As a result, the company says it has the infrastructure to keep up with all the new content being added across the web each day, with 750 billion images processed so far.
And while ShareIQ only officially launched this week, its customers already include Tommy Hilfiger. The company (which was founded in Berlin) is also opening its first US office in New York City.
