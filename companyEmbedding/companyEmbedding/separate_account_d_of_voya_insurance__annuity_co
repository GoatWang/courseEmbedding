 Average Annual Total Returns as of 06/30/2017    (shown in percentages)
 





 Mutual funds offered through a retirement plan are investments designed for retirement purposes.  Early withdrawals will reduce your account value and if taken prior to age 59 1/2, a 10% IRS penalty may apply. 





 The performance data quoted represents past performance.  Past performance does not guarantee future results.  For month-end performance which may be lower or higher than the performance data shown please call 800-584-6001.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that, when sold, an investment may be worth more or less than the original cost.  





 The returns assume reinvestment of all dividends (ordinary income and capital gains) and are net of management fees and other fund operating expenses. An asset based Administrative Fee is deducted from your account quarterly at an annual rate of 0.16% of balances held in each of the investment options including the Stable Value Option. These returns do not reflect any plan level administrative fees, if applicable; if reflected, returns would be less favorable. The performance data shown below also does not reflect an expense reimbursement which may be applied to participant accounts on a quarterly basis. If this expense reimbursement did apply and had been reflected, the performance data shown for each option would have been higher. Please contact your local representative for more information.
 





 The returns assume reinvestment of all dividends (ordinary income and capital gains) and are net of management fees and other fund operating expenses. 





 You should consider the investment objectives, risks and charges, and expenses of the funds carefully before investing.  The prospectus contains this and other information.  Anyone who wishes to obtain a free copy of the fund prospectuses may call their Voya representative or the number above.  Please read the prospectus carefully before investing. 





 Returns less than one year are not annualized.  Fund Inception Date is the date of inception for the underlying fund, and is the date used in calculating the periodic returns.  This date may also precede the portfolio's inclusion in the product.

 The risks of investing in small company stocks may include relatively low trading volumes, a greater degree of change in earnings and greater short-term volatility. 





 Foreign investing involves special risks such as currency fluctuation and public disclosure, as well as economic and political risks. 





 Some of the Funds invest in securities guaranteed by the U.S. Government as to the timely payment of principal and interest; however, shares of the Funds are not insured nor guaranteed. 





 High yielding fixed-income securities generally are subject to greater market fluctuations and risks of loss of income and principal than are investments in lower yielding fixed-income securities. 





 Sector funds may involve greater-than average risk and are often more volatile than funds holding a diversified portfolio of stocks in many industries. Examples include: banking, biotechnology, chemicals, energy, environmental services, natural resources, precious metals, technology, telecommunications, and utilities. 





 *The Gross Expense Ratios shown do not reflect any temporary fee or expense waivers that may be in effect for a fund. The performance of a fund with a temporary fee or expense waiver would have been lower if the gross fund fees / expenses listed had been reflected.
