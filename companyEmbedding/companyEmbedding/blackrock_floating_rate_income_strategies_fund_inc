Overview






Investment Approach
BlackRock Floating Rate Income Strategies Fund, Inc.’s (FRA) (the 'Fund') investment objective is to provide shareholders with high current income and
such preservation of capital as is consistent with investment in a diversified, leveraged portfolio consisting primarily of floating rate debt securities and
instruments. The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing, under normal market conditions, at least 80% of its assets in floating rate
debt securities, including floating or variable rate debt securities that pay interest at rates that adjust whenever a specified interest rate changes and/or
which reset on predetermined dates (such as the last day of a month or calendar quarter). The Fund invests a substantial portion of its investments in
floating rate debt securities consisting of secured or unsecured senior floating rate loans that are rated below investment grade. The Fund may invest
directly in such securities or synthetically through the use of derivatives.No assurance can be given that the Fund's investment objective will be achieved.

Total Distribution Current year distributions are not classified as “Income,” “Short-Term Capital Gains,” “Long-Term Capital Gains,” or “Return of Capital” until calendar year-end.











Past distributions are not indicative of future distributions.

If a Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net realized capital gains in the current fiscal year; a portion of its distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of a shareholder's investment is paid back to the shareholder. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect a Fund's investment performance and should not be confused with 'yield' or 'income'. When distributions exceed total return performance, the difference will reduce the Fund's net asset value per share. Although the character of income will not be determined until the end of the fund’s fiscal year, please refer to the 'Closed-End Fund Resources' section of the BlackRock website for Section 19 notices that provide estimated amounts and sources of the fund's distributions, which should not be not be relied upon for tax reporting purposes. A Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year will be sent to shareholders to illustrate how the Fund’s distributions should be reported for federal income tax purposes.

Effective Duration measures the sensitivity of the price of a bond with or without embedded options to changes in interest rates, taking into account the likelihood of the bond being called, put and/or sunk prior to its final maturity date while incorporating after-tax impacts on the bond. The options-based duration model used by BlackRock employs certain assumptions and may differ from other fund complexes. Effective Duration is measured at the individual bond level, aggregated to the portfolio level, and adjusted for leverage, hedging transactions and non-bond holdings, including derivatives.

Ratings

 Ratings



Morningstar Rating

Overall Floating Rate Income Strategies Fund received a Morningstar Rating of 4 stars for the 3-year period, 3 stars for the 5-year period and 5 stars for the 10-year period, rated against 26, 22 and 15 Bank Loan Funds, respectively. Performance results represent past performance and are no guarantee of future results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For each U.S.-domiciled fund with at least a 3-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar RatingTM based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund&#39;s monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive five stars, the next 22.5% receive four stars, the next 35% receive three stars, the next 22.5% receive two stars and the bottom 10% receive one star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) The Overall Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted-average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5- and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morningstar Ratings are for the share classes cited only; other classes may have different ratings.

The fund itself has not been rated by an independent rating agency. Credit quality ratings on underlying securities of the fund are received from S&P, Moody’s and Fitch and converted to the equivalent S&P major rating category. This breakdown is provided by BlackRock and takes the median rating of the three agencies when all three agencies rate a security the lower of the two ratings if only two agencies rate a security and one rating if that is all that is provided. Unrated securities do not necessarily indicate low quality. Below investment-grade is represented by a rating of BB and below. Ratings and portfolio credit quality may change over time.





Negative weightings may result from specific circumstances (including timing differences between trade and settle dates of securities purchased by the funds) and/or the use of certain financial instruments, including derivatives, which may be used to gain or reduce market exposure and/or risk management. Certain transactions the funds may utilize may give rise to a form of leverage through either (a) additional market exposure or (b) borrowing capital in an attempt to increase investment return. The use of such transactions includes certain leverage-related risks, including potential for higher volatility, greater decline of the fund’s net asset value and fluctuations of dividends and distributions paid by the fund.

Allocations are subject to change.

Important Information

 

Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses which may be obtained by visiting the SEC Edgar database. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.


Common shares for most of the closed-end funds identified above are only available for purchase and sale at current market price on a stock exchange. A closed-end fund’s dividend yield, market price and NAV will fluctuate with market conditions. The information for these funds is provided for informational purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation of an offer to buy or sell Fund shares.


Performance results reflect past performance and are no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. All returns assume reinvestment of all dividends. The market value and net asset value (NAV) of a fund's shares will fluctuate with market conditions. Closed-end funds may trade at a premium to NAV but often trade at a discount.  The fund is actively managed and its characteristics will vary. Stock and bond values fluctuate in price so the value of your investment can go down depending on market conditions. International investing involves special risks including, but not limited to political risks, currency fluctuations, illiquidity and volatility. These risks may be heightened for investments in emerging markets. Fixed income risks include interest-rate and credit risk. Typically, when interest rates rise, there is a corresponding decline in bond values. Credit risk refers to the possibility that the bond issuer will not be able to make principal and interest payments. Principal of mortgage- or asset-backed securities normally may be prepaid at any time, reducing the yield and market value of those securities. Obligations of US govt. agencies are supported by varying degrees of credit but generally are not backed by the full faith and credit of the US govt. Non-investment-grade debt securities (high-yield/junk bonds) may be subject to greater market fluctuations, risk of default or loss of income and principal than higher rated securities. Investments in emerging markets may be considered speculative and are more likely to experience hyperinflation and currency devaluations, which adversely affect returns. In addition, many emerging securities markets have lower trading volumes and less liquidity. The fund may use derivatives to hedge its investments or to seek to enhance returns. Derivatives entail risks relating to liquidity, leverage and credit that may reduce returns and increase volatility. There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. The Fund is subject to numerous risks, including investment risks. Shares of closed-end funds often trade at a discount from their net asset value. The Fund is not a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund may not be appropriate for all investors.  The amounts and sources of distributions reported in any notices are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to change based on tax regulations. The Fund will send a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes. Yields are based on income earned for the period cited and on the Fund's NAV at the end of the end of the period.  Some investors may be subject to the alternative minimum tax (AMT).   Some BlackRock funds make distributions of ordinary income and capital gains at calendar year end. Those distributions temporarily cause extraordinarily high yields. There is no assurance that a fund will repeat that yield in the future. Subsequent monthly distributions that do not include ordinary income or capital gains in the form of dividends will likely be lower.


The Funds are distributed by BlackRock Investments, LLC (together with its affiliates, “BlackRock”).

Alpha (3y)
Compared to S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index.<br/><br/>Alpha is calculated at the portfolio level.<br/><br/>A measure of performance on a risk-adjusted basis. Alpha takes the volatility (price risk) of a mutual fund and compares its risk-adjusted performance to a benchmark index. The excess return of the fund relative to the return of the benchmark index is a fund&#39;s alpha.

Yield to Maturity
Yield to Maturity (YTM) is the discount rate that equates the present value of a bond&#39;s cash flows with its market price (including accrued interest). The Fund Average YTM is the weighted average of the fund&#39;s individual bond holding YTMs based upon Net Asset Value (&#39;NAV&#39;). The measure does not include fees and expenses. For callable bonds, YTM is the yield-to-worst.

Effective Duration
Effective Duration measures the sensitivity of the price of a bond with or without embedded options to changes in interest rates, taking into account the likelihood of the bond being called, put and/or sunk prior to its final maturity date while incorporating after-tax impacts on the bond. The options-based duration model used by BlackRock employs certain assumptions and may differ from other fund complexes. Effective Duration is measured at the individual bond level, aggregated to the portfolio level, and adjusted for leverage, hedging transactions and non-bond holdings, including derivatives.

Ratings

 Ratings



Morningstar Rating

Overall Floating Rate Income Fund received a Morningstar Rating of 4 stars for the 3-year period, 4 stars for the 5-year period and - stars for the 10-year period, rated against 210, 160 and 65 Bank Loan Funds, respectively. Performance results represent past performance and are no guarantee of future results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For each U.S.-domiciled fund with at least a 3-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar RatingTM based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund&#39;s monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive five stars, the next 22.5% receive four stars, the next 35% receive three stars, the next 22.5% receive two stars and the bottom 10% receive one star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) The Overall Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted-average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5- and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morningstar Ratings are for the share classes cited only; other classes may have different ratings.

Lipper Leader Ratings
 


Consistent Return Floating Rate Income Fund received the following Consistent Return ratings for the 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods, respectively: 4 (208 funds), 4 (159 funds), and - ( funds).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lipper ratings for Consistent Return reflect funds&#39; historical risk-adjusted returns, adjusted for volatility, relative to peers.

 


Expense Floating Rate Income Fund received the following Expense ratings for the 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods, respectively: 5 (92 funds), 5 (63 funds), and - ( funds).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lipper ratings for Expense reflect funds&#39; expense minimization relative to peers with similar load structures.

 


Preservation Floating Rate Income Fund received the following Preservation ratings for the 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods, respectively: 5 (5,771 funds), 5 (4,773 funds), and - ( funds).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lipper ratings for Preservation reflect funds&#39; historical loss avoidance relative to other funds within the same asset class. Preservation ratings are relative, rather than absolute, measures, and funds named Lipper Leaders for Preservation may still experience losses periodically; those losses may be larger for equity and mixed equity funds than for fixed income funds.

 


Total Return Floating Rate Income Fund received the following Total Return ratings for the 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods, respectively: 5 (208 funds), 4 (159 funds), and - ( funds).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lipper ratings for Total Return reflect funds&#39; historical total return performance relative to peers.

 


Overall Lipper Leaders ratings based on an equal-weighted average of percentile ranks for each measure over 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods (if applicable) and do not take into account the effects of sales charges for these categories (Consistent Return, Preservation, Total Return, Expense, and Tax Efficiency) as of 30-Apr-2017 out of 208, 5,771, 208, 92 and 208 Funds, respectively in Lipper's Loan Participation Funds classification.

% Notional Exposures
% of Notional Exposures is a breakdown designed to represent a fund’s ownership of both traditional fixed income securities and derivatives including, but not limited to, futures, options and swap contracts. For traditional fixed income securities, there is no difference between the market value and the notional exposure. For derivatives, the notional exposure represents the exposure to the underlying assets plus the value of the financing (or lending) associated with the implementation of these derivatives. The sum of all exposures (both market value and notional exposure) is equal to the fund’s net asset value (open-end) or net managed assets (closed-end). Net Derivatives represents the approximate net notional value of the longs less the short derivatives held in the fund.

The fund itself has not been rated by an independent rating agency. Credit quality ratings on underlying securities of the fund are received from S&P, Moody’s and Fitch and converted to the equivalent S&P major rating category. This breakdown is provided by BlackRock and takes the median rating of the three agencies when all three agencies rate a security the lower of the two ratings if only two agencies rate a security and one rating if that is all that is provided. Unrated securities do not necessarily indicate low quality. Below investment-grade is represented by a rating of BB and below. Ratings and portfolio credit quality may change over time.





Negative weightings may result from specific circumstances (including timing differences between trade and settle dates of securities purchased by the funds) and/or the use of certain financial instruments, including derivatives, which may be used to gain or reduce market exposure and/or risk management. Certain transactions the funds may utilize may give rise to a form of leverage through either (a) additional market exposure or (b) borrowing capital in an attempt to increase investment return. The use of such transactions includes certain leverage-related risks, including potential for higher volatility, greater decline of the fund’s net asset value and fluctuations of dividends and distributions paid by the fund.

Allocations are subject to change.

Important Information

 

Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses or, if available, the summary prospectuses which may be obtained by visiting the iShares Fund and BlackRock Fund prospectus pages. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.


*Source: BlackRock and Morningstar. As of 03/31/17. 14 of 23 funds accounts for 60% of our total active fixed income mutual funds. Based on 5 year performance of BlackRock’s active mutual funds only. Over the 1, 3, 5 and 10 year periods, 5, 14, 14 and 11 of BlackRock fixed income funds are in the first quartile of their respective Morningstar categories. Based on institutional share classes of BlackRock open-end taxable and tax-free fixed income funds (based on 23 funds). 87% statistic based on $76.8B out of $87.9B AUM of all share classes of the funds. Strategic Income Opportunities Fund AUM is $27.8B which accounts for 36% of the total $76.8B AUM of funds that have first quartile performance. Institutional shares may not be available to all retail investors. Performance for different share classes may vary.†As of 03/31/17. Source: Morningstar. Analysis based only on institutional shares of BlackRock active fixed income funds vs. institutional shares of active fixed income funds within their respective Morningstar categories. Expenses are based on the funds’ most recent prospectus net expense ratios, excluding investment dividend expense, interest expense, and certain other fund expenses. Morningstar category net expense ratio also excludes these expenses. Includes active open-end taxable and tax-free fixed income mutual funds only, and excludes index funds. 87% of BlackRock active fixed income funds are in the lowest fee quartile (20 out of 23 funds). Based on 23 BlackRock active taxable and tax-free funds. Institutional shares may not be available to all retail investors. Performance for different share classes may vary.The fund is actively managed and its characteristics will vary.  The fund may use derivatives to hedge its investments or to seek to enhance returns. Derivatives entail risks relating to liquidity, leverage and credit that may reduce returns and increase volatility.  Corporate loan values fluctuate in price so your investment can go down depending on market conditions. Corporate loans may be illiquid, affecting the funds ability to realize net asset value in the event of a liquidation of assets. The fund may invest in non-US borrowers, which involves risks including fluctuation in foreign exchange rates, political and economic developments. Corporate loans in the funds portfolio typically are not rated or rated non-investment-grade (below Baa by Moodys or BBB by Standard & Poors). These corporate loans generally involve greater risks to principal and income.


Performance results reflect past performance and are no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value of shares will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. All returns assume reinvestment of all dividends. Performance information shown without sales charge would have been lower if the applicable sales charge had been included. Performance during periods of exceptional market conditions should not be expected to be repeated in a normal market environment. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.Fund details, holdings and characteristics are as of the date noted and subject to change. Yields are based on income earned for the period cited and on the Fund's NAV at the end of the period. Some BlackRock funds make distributions of ordinary income and capital gains at calendar year end. Those distributions temporarily cause extraordinarily high yields. There is no assurance that a fund will repeat that yield in the future. Subsequent monthly distributions that do not include ordinary income or capital gains in the form of dividends will likely be lower.
