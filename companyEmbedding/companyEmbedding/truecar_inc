Toyota was founded in 1937 by Kiichiro Toyoda and its headquarters are located in Toyota City, Japan. Toyota was created as a spinoff from Toyota Industries to create automobiles. Toyota was solely a Japanese operation, until the early 1980s when they began building US based plants.
The Toyota Motor Group now owns the brands Lexus and Scion as well as Daihatsu and Hino Motors. In 1997 Toyota introduced the Prius, the world's best-selling hybrid car. New Toyota models that have seen success include the Corolla and Yaris, due to the recent rises in gas prices. With a focus on value and technology, Toyota prices have remained competitive and affordable.

Hyundai History
Hyundai models range from the Accent, a small three-door hatchback, to the Veracruz crossover SUV. With starting Hyundai car prices ranging from $10,690 to $28,940, and a 10-year / 100,000-mile warranty, Hyundai produces a quality car at an affordable price.
The Hyundai Motor Company is the eighth-largest and the world's fastest-growing auto maker. In 1968, Hyundai released its first of several Hyundai models: the Cortina. The Hyundai Excel was the first Hyundai car to enter the United States in 1986, and set a record for the most automobiles sold (126,000) in the first year of business in the U.S.
After a record-setting year, Hyundai gained a reputation for poor quality after some cost-cutting measures. Hyundai then heavily invested in the design, quality, and manufacturing and long-term research and added a 10-year / 100,000-mile powertrain warranty which helped sales increase dramatically by 2004. Hyundai is now one of the top 100 most valuable brands worldwide.

Ford History
Ford offers several car, truck and SUV models. Ford prices for all models fall within the starting price range of $13,995 to $49,325.
In October of 1913, Henry Ford changed the world of car production with the mass production of the Ford Model T. The new car assembly line helped reduce Ford prices and helped make personal transportation affordable. The moving assembly line reduced the time to assemble the chassis by more than 10 hours per car. With this new assembly line, Ford produced 308,162 cars, which was more than all other auto makers combined.
Ford is also responsible for the best-selling U.S. sports car and convertible, the Mustang. Ford trucks have been extremely successful with model lines such as the Ford F-Series, which has been the best selling full-sized pickup truck for more than 30 years. The company now offers crossovers as well as Ford SUV models.

					Full Description



TrueCar, Inc., incorporated on February 25, 2005, is an Internet-based information, technology and communication services company. The Company has a data-driven online platform, which features market data and analytics. The Company-branded platform is available on its TrueCar Website and mobile applications. The Company also customizes and operates its platform on a co-branded basis for its affinity group marketing partners, including financial institutions, membership-based organizations, and employee buying programs for a range of enterprises. The Company enables users to obtain market-based pricing data on new and used cars, and to connect with its network of TrueCar Certified Dealers. It also allows automobile manufacturers to connect with TrueCar users during the purchase process and deliver targeted incentives to consumers. The Company's network of over 13,000 TrueCar Certified Dealers consists primarily of new car franchises, as well as independent dealers selling used vehicles. TrueCar Certified Dealers operate in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.The Company's subsidiary, ALG, Inc. (ALG), provides forecasts and consulting services regarding determination of the residual value of an automobile at given future points in time. These residual values are used to underwrite automotive loans and leases to determine payments by consumers. In addition financial institutions use this information to measure exposure and risk across loan, lease and fleet portfolios. The Company also obtains automobile purchase data from various sources and uses this data to provide consumers and dealers with geographically specific, real-time pricing information. Through its Websites and mobile applications, a consumer selects a vehicle, adds desired options and inputs a Zone Improvement Plan (ZIP) code. The Company then presents the consumer with the TrueCar Curve, a graphical distribution of what others paid for a similar make, model and trim of car. Within this distribution, the Company includes manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP), factory invoice, and average price paid for that make, model and trim in the consumer's local market. The Company generally provides consumers with its TrueCar Average, a calculation based on the recent transactions of TrueCar users that provides an understanding of what others have paid for similarly configured vehicles. This information enables the consumer to evaluate a potential price in the context of market data.The Company's network of TrueCar Certified Dealers interfaces with its platform primarily through its Dealer Portal, an application that can be accessed online or using a mobile device. The Dealer Portal is considered a sales enhancement tool, and it enables dealers to access information on their prospects unavailable to them in their standard customer relationship management (CRM) software. The Portal allows dealers to assess the competitiveness of their vehicle pricing relative to their market, create vehicle pricing rules, access details on potential buyers wants and needs, create custom detailed offers based on vehicles in stock, manage how their dealership profile appears on the network and assess their competitive market performance on vehicles sold through their dealership, and also includes various administrative and other management tools. The Pricing Manager provides dealers with a single interface to assess the competiveness of their vehicle pricing relative to their market and set pricing on all makes and models they offer for sale. The Sales Analyzer helps dealers understand how their pricing for recently sold vehicles compares to the market. The Offer Tool helps dealers create custom detailed offers based on vehicles in stock. The Dealership Profile enables dealers to identify their selling benefits to customers, including salesperson names and pictures, dealership makes, hours of operation, and Website and social media links.The Company's offerings enable manufacturers to target consumers based on membership in an affinity group and other criteria. Through its platform, manufacturers can create cash incentives targeted to specific consumers and provide the ability to generate a coupon code that can be redeemed and validated at any dealership across the country in connection with the purchase of a new car. For consumers looking to purchase a used car, the Company provides an aggregated listing of used vehicles in their local marketplace. Along with displaying stated information made available by the seller about the pricing and condition of car, it provides consumers with information related to the value of other cars of the same make, model, year and stated condition in the market.The Company competes with AutoTrader.com, Cars.com, CarGurus.com, eBay Motors, Edmunds.com, KBB.com, Autobytel.com, Google, Bing, Yahoo, General Motors, Ford and Costco Auto Program.

Technology[edit]
TrueCar's "massive up-to-the-minute database of selling prices" is an example of big data at the petabyte level and is run on Apache Hadoop.[4]:1
History[edit]
TrueCar was originally incorporated under the name "Zag.com Inc." in Delaware in February 2005. Scott Painter, along with several co-founders, including Tom Taira and Jim Nguyen operated the business primarily as a provider of “white-labeled” auto-buying programs for affinity groups. Within the Zag.com environment, the concepts of price confidence using data and analytics presented in an easy-to-digest form was incubated and launched in a separate company, TrueCar.com. The TrueCar concept involved gathering data from a number of different sources in order to compile updated vehicle prices for consumers in an attempt to enhance Zag.com's services.[5][6] Ultimately, the two entities were combined to form TrueCar, Inc.
TrueCar ranked 11th on the L.A. Business (LAB) annual list of the 100 Fastest Growing Private Companies in Los Angeles,[7] and Inc. Magazine ranked TrueCar on its 2010 list of Fastest Growing Companies in America.[8]
In January 2011, TrueCar released ClearBook.com, a used vehicle index that analyzes the used car market.[9] The website provides users with prices based on market data.[9][10]
In August 2011, TrueCar raised $200 million in debt and equity financing, and purchased ALG, a company that provides information on future residual values of vehicles, for an estimated $83 million.[11] TrueCar later hired Larry Dominique, former vice president of product planning at Nissan, to run its ALG business and work with auto manufacturers.[12] Additional 2011 deals included the acquisition of News Corp-backed Honk.com in May.[13]

Technology[edit]
TrueCar's "massive up-to-the-minute database of selling prices" is an example of big data at the petabyte level and is run on Apache Hadoop.[4]:1
History[edit]
TrueCar was originally incorporated under the name "Zag.com Inc." in Delaware in February 2005. Scott Painter, along with several co-founders, including Tom Taira and Jim Nguyen operated the business primarily as a provider of “white-labeled” auto-buying programs for affinity groups. Within the Zag.com environment, the concepts of price confidence using data and analytics presented in an easy-to-digest form was incubated and launched in a separate company, TrueCar.com. The TrueCar concept involved gathering data from a number of different sources in order to compile updated vehicle prices for consumers in an attempt to enhance Zag.com's services.[5][6] Ultimately, the two entities were combined to form TrueCar, Inc.
TrueCar ranked 11th on the L.A. Business (LAB) annual list of the 100 Fastest Growing Private Companies in Los Angeles,[7] and Inc. Magazine ranked TrueCar on its 2010 list of Fastest Growing Companies in America.[8]
In January 2011, TrueCar released ClearBook.com, a used vehicle index that analyzes the used car market.[9] The website provides users with prices based on market data.[9][10]
In August 2011, TrueCar raised $200 million in debt and equity financing, and purchased ALG, a company that provides information on future residual values of vehicles, for an estimated $83 million.[11] TrueCar later hired Larry Dominique, former vice president of product planning at Nissan, to run its ALG business and work with auto manufacturers.[12] Additional 2011 deals included the acquisition of News Corp-backed Honk.com in May.[13]
In late 2011, TrueCar launched a television advertising campaign with commercials promoting its services.[14] Shortly thereafter, TrueCar faced backlash from the automotive industry,[15] when several state agencies and regulators notified TrueCar that its practices were noncompliant with some state laws.[16][17] In response to those notices, TrueCar overhauled its pricing structure,[14] and moved from a pay-per-sale model to a subscription model for dealers in some states.[18]
In 2013, about 400,000 vehicles were sold from TrueCar and TrueCar Certified Dealers.[citation needed] In 2014, more than 611,000 new and used vehicles were purchased at TrueCar Certified Dealerships. TrueCar had a hand in 3.9% of U.S. new car retail sales in 2014.[19] As of October 2015, TrueCar had more than 10,000 dealerships in its network.[3]
In February 2014, TrueCar acquired the domain True.com, using the site as an umbrella domain name.[20] On May 16, 2014, TrueCar became a publicly traded company and is listed on the NASDAQ under the ticker, NASDAQ: TRUE.[21] TrueCar successfully completed a secondary offering in November 2014 worth approximately $125 million.[2]
Painter stepped down as CEO of TrueCar in December 2015. He was replaced by Chip Perry.[22][23]
Venture capital investments[edit]
In its 2008 Series A round of venture funding, TrueCar raised $2.8 million from Zag's original investors.[5][24][25] It received $8.1 million in Series B investments from Capital One and Anthem Venture Partners[26] and TrueCar raised another $35.5 million in 2010.[24]
In September 2011, TrueCar raised $200 million in funding from USAA, GRP Partners, Keating Capital, Silicon Valley Bank and Capricorn Investment Group.[24][27]
Truecar raised $30 million from Vulcan Capital in December 2013.[28] As of 2013, the company has raised over $200 million in financing since its founding in 2005.[28]
Partnerships[edit]
TrueCar launched the first all-female racing team in 2012, with support from Penske Media Corporation and Dragon Racing.[29][30] The companies sponsored the women in six racing series, including IndyCar, Global MX-5 Cup, Star Mazda, USF2000, World Challenge and Rally America.[30][31] In June 2012, The Virgin Group announced its partnership in support of TrueCar's "Women Empowered" initiative.[29]
TrueCar powers car-buying programs for approximately 576 brands. TrueCar’s Affinity Partners include USAA, Sam's Club, Consumer Reports, AAA, American Express, Geico and Farmers.[32][33]

TrueCar, Inc. is an automotive pricing and information website for new and used car buyers and dealers. TrueCar is paid by dealerships so they can obtain potential buyers' contact information. Potential car buyers receive an online report illustrating what others have paid for cars, illustrative pricing from a network of TrueCar Certified Dealers. TrueCar reports its users have purchased more than 2 million cars from dealers in its network. The company is headquartered in Santa Monica, CA,[1] and its network includes around 10,000 automobile dealers in the United States.[2][3]

Technology[edit]
TrueCar's "massive up-to-the-minute database of selling prices" is an example of big data at the petabyte level and is run on Apache Hadoop.[4]:1
History[edit]
TrueCar was originally incorporated under the name "Zag.com Inc." in Delaware in February 2005. Scott Painter, along with several co-founders, including Tom Taira and Jim Nguyen operated the business primarily as a provider of “white-labeled” auto-buying programs for affinity groups. Within the Zag.com environment, the concepts of price confidence using data and analytics presented in an easy-to-digest form was incubated and launched in a separate company, TrueCar.com. The TrueCar concept involved gathering data from a number of different sources in order to compile updated vehicle prices for consumers in an attempt to enhance Zag.com's services.[5][6] Ultimately, the two entities were combined to form TrueCar, Inc.
TrueCar ranked 11th on the L.A. Business (LAB) annual list of the 100 Fastest Growing Private Companies in Los Angeles,[7] and Inc. Magazine ranked TrueCar on its 2010 list of Fastest Growing Companies in America.[8]
In January 2011, TrueCar released ClearBook.com, a used vehicle index that analyzes the used car market.[9] The website provides users with prices based on market data.[9][10]
In August 2011, TrueCar raised $200 million in debt and equity financing, and purchased ALG, a company that provides information on future residual values of vehicles, for an estimated $83 million.[11] TrueCar later hired Larry Dominique, former vice president of product planning at Nissan, to run its ALG business and work with auto manufacturers.[12] Additional 2011 deals included the acquisition of News Corp-backed Honk.com in May.[13]
In late 2011, TrueCar launched a television advertising campaign with commercials promoting its services.[14] Shortly thereafter, TrueCar faced backlash from the automotive industry,[15] when several state agencies and regulators notified TrueCar that its practices were noncompliant with some state laws.[16][17] In response to those notices, TrueCar overhauled its pricing structure,[14] and moved from a pay-per-sale model to a subscription model for dealers in some states.[18]
In 2013, about 400,000 vehicles were sold from TrueCar and TrueCar Certified Dealers.[citation needed] In 2014, more than 611,000 new and used vehicles were purchased at TrueCar Certified Dealerships. TrueCar had a hand in 3.9% of U.S. new car retail sales in 2014.[19] As of October 2015, TrueCar had more than 10,000 dealerships in its network.[3]
In February 2014, TrueCar acquired the domain True.com, using the site as an umbrella domain name.[20] On May 16, 2014, TrueCar became a publicly traded company and is listed on the NASDAQ under the ticker, NASDAQ: TRUE.[21] TrueCar successfully completed a secondary offering in November 2014 worth approximately $125 million.[2]
Painter stepped down as CEO of TrueCar in December 2015. He was replaced by Chip Perry.[22][23]
Venture capital investments[edit]
In its 2008 Series A round of venture funding, TrueCar raised $2.8 million from Zag's original investors.[5][24][25] It received $8.1 million in Series B investments from Capital One and Anthem Venture Partners[26] and TrueCar raised another $35.5 million in 2010.[24]
In September 2011, TrueCar raised $200 million in funding from USAA, GRP Partners, Keating Capital, Silicon Valley Bank and Capricorn Investment Group.[24][27]
Truecar raised $30 million from Vulcan Capital in December 2013.[28] As of 2013, the company has raised over $200 million in financing since its founding in 2005.[28]
Partnerships[edit]
TrueCar launched the first all-female racing team in 2012, with support from Penske Media Corporation and Dragon Racing.[29][30] The companies sponsored the women in six racing series, including IndyCar, Global MX-5 Cup, Star Mazda, USF2000, World Challenge and Rally America.[30][31] In June 2012, The Virgin Group announced its partnership in support of TrueCar's "Women Empowered" initiative.[29]
TrueCar powers car-buying programs for approximately 576 brands. TrueCar’s Affinity Partners include USAA, Sam's Club, Consumer Reports, AAA, American Express, Geico and Farmers.[32][33]
