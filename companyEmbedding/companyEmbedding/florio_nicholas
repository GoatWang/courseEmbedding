Samantha Florio and Nicholas SIlvia's Wedding Website







MenuSamantha and Nicholas   September 16, 2017    • Port Jefferson, NY50 days to go!Our StoryHow We MetSam and Nick met on his first day at St. Joseph's College(SJC). Nick had been an active member of the Campus Activities Board (CAB) at Suffolk County Community College, so he decided to visit the CAB office at SJC, where Sam was the Program Director that year. Since he was new and reminded Sam of "a cute lost puppy" she made sure that he knew about the Western Rodeo Social that was being held on campus later that month. Sam remembers Nick wearing pink skate sneakers to the event, and challenged him to see who could ride on the mechanical bull the longest. About two weeks after the evening social, Nick introduced Sam to his favorite show, "How I Met Your Mother" and asked her to be his girlfriend after watching an episode in the Shea Conference Room together. How He ProposedSam loves amusement parks and roller coasters. Every summer since Sam graduated from SJC, the two would visit a different amusement park as their mini vacation, often with their friends Dan and Lauren. Since Sam wanted to take Nick to visit Wildwood as part one of vacation, part two was going to Six Flags with Dan and Lauren for the new "Joker" roller coaster. Nick decided that it was the perfect place to propose. He planned everything out perfectly. He bought T-shirts which were hidden underneath their normal clothes until everyone went on Nitro. As the ride began, Lauren took of her black shirt so her undershirt could show "Sam" and Dan did the same to show "marry". Nick could not take his top shirt off entirely since he was sitting next to Sam, so he flashed the camera as the coaster came down the first hill to show "me?" At the end of the ride, Lauren and Dan ran off to check the ride photo to make sure it came out clearly, as Nick pretended to be sick to buy some time. Once Nick knew the picture was clear, Sam was able to go see the picture for herself, and she turned around to see Nick on his knee, with the most perfect ring in his hand.The day didn't end there! Since Sam loves teddy bears and has a collection, Nick also bought a bear with his own t-shirt asking "Will you marry me" on it, which Sam discovered in their hotel room after the day at the park. Dan and Lauren sent flowers to the room with champagne. The hotel knew about the engagement and had placed rose petals leading from the door to a giant heart on the bed. Even Nick's friend, Dave, drove to New Jersey from Albany that night to celebrate for dinner at Brio; and dinner was absolutely delicious!The WeddingSaturday, September 16, 2017Attire: FormalCeremonyNew Life Assembly 19 North Country Road, Port Jefferson, NY, United StatesReceptionSmithtown Landing Country Club495 Landing Avenue, Smithtown, NY, United StatesWedding PartyKelly - Maid of HonorKelly is Sam's little sisterAly - Matron of HonorAly is Sam's older sister.Danielle - BridesmaidDanielle is Sam's best friend.Jacqueline - BridesmaidJacqueline is Sam's cousin.Corinne - BridesmaidCorinne is Nick's older sister.Annemarie - BridesmaidAnnemarie is Nick's little sister.Dan - Best ManDan is one of Nick's childhood best friends.Joe - Bestest MenchJoe is Nick's brother-in-law.Dave - GroomsmanDave is one of Nick's childhood best friends.Mike - GroomsmanMike is one of Nick's childhood best friends.Peter - GroomsmanPeter is Sam's little brother.Chris - GroomsmanChris is Nick's little brother.Thanks, we've received your .Schedule Your Reminder.Sign up below and we'll remind you a month before the wedding to check back for all the details you need to know.Please enter a valid email address.Remind MeWebsite created on The Knot.

Follow this contractor

















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Florida:













Does Florio Nicholas P carry a valid contracting license?



If you pay someone to construct a building or a structure, make structural alterations to load bearing walls, or perform services such as plumbing or air conditioning work, that person must have a state contractor's license.











How important is contractor licensing in Florida?



The Florida Construction Industry License Board maintains high standards for contractor licensing. Prior to receiving their license, Florida contractors are required to prove four years of relevant work experience or education; pass a board examination and prove financial solvency.











Your liability risk when hiring Florio Nicholas P



In Florida, licensed contractors with employees are required to carry workers' compensation insurance and attest they have obtained public liability and property damage insurance in the amounts determined by the Board.











Financial recourse when hiring Florio Nicholas P



Florida maintains a recovery fund, called the Florida Homeowners' Construction Recovery Fund, which is available to a natural person who has suffered monetary damages by the financial mismanagement or misconduct of a contractor, and who has exhausted all other sources of payment. The Board makes the determination of eligibility for an award. Florida contractors are not required to carry an active bond.











What else should I know before hiring Florio Nicholas P



As of 2007, the Florida DBPR began requiring license applicants to submit their fingerprints, which are used to run a criminal background check with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. In addition, they are required to provide a credit report during the license application process to demonstrate financial stability. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The Florida Construction Industry License Board recommends getting at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

for any job, commercial or residential.

Description



Description
Artist: Nicholas Watts
The Targa Florio was reputed to be run in the most hostile environment in Europe. Raced over the toughest roads, this year the Sicilian road race ran for almost 500 miles, over 11 laps, of the tortuous Piccolo Circuito Madonie. For the 56th Targa Florio in 1972, Enzo Ferrari entered just one of his powerful 312PB sports-racing prototypes. Driven by Arturo Merzario and Sandro Munari, the car set the fastest lap in practice and dominated the race itself.
Edition signed by Arturo Merzario and Sandro Munari and a small number of artist-signed Artist Proofs are available.
Print size 33″x25″ (84cm x 63cm) Image size 26″x17″ (66cm x 45cm)
