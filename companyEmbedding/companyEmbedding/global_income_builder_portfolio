 Principal Investment Strategy


                    The Trust seeks to provide current income with the potential for capital appreciation by investing in dividend-paying stocks of global companies along with shares of exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”) that invest substantially all of their assets in fixed-income securities.

The Sponsor, with the assistance of Guggenheim Partners Investment Management, LLC (“GPIM”), an affiliate of Guggenheim Partners, LLC, has selected the securities to be included in the Trust’s portfolio. The Trust portfolio will invest a substantial amount of its assets, either directly or indirectly through its investment in ETFs, in securities from at least three different countries, as defined by Russell Investments. The Trust will, as of the initial date of deposit, invest at least 40% of its assets directly or indirectly in the securities of non-U.S. companies located in at least three different countries, as defined by Russell Investments.

The Sponsor and GPIM believe that companies that distribute significant dividends on a consistent basis generally demonstrate strong financial strength and positive performance relative to their peers. The common stocks selected will constitute approximately 50% of the Trust portfolio.

Shares of ETFs that invest substantially all of their assets in fixed-income securities will make up the remaining 50% of the Trust portfolio. The fixed-income ETFs included in the portfolio invest in a wide range of both domestic and international debt securities rated investment-grade through below investment-grade. High-yield, below investment-grade securities or “junk” bonds are considered to be speculative and are subject to greater market and credit risks than investment-grade securities.

The fixed-income ETFs included in the portfolio will invest in debt securities with short-term, medium-term and long-term maturities. Typically fixed-income securities with longer periods before maturity are more sensitive to interest rate changes.

Finally, the fixed-income ETFs included in the portfolio will invest in debt securities issued by foreign companies, including companies located in emerging markets, and municipal bonds.
                






 Selection Criteria


                    United States Equity Strategy

Approximately 25% of the Trust portfolio will constitute U.S. equity common stocks selected using a disciplined process that includes both quantitative screening and qualitative analysis. These common stocks may be issued by small-, mid- and large-capitalization companies and by real estate investment Trusts. The Sponsor selects U.S. companies that it believes should be core holdings of a diversified dividend-paying portfolio. The Sponsor begins with a universe of all dividend paying companies in the United States as of the date of the security selection. The Sponsor then selects the final portfolio by performing quantitative and qualitative screening, which is primarily based on, but not limited to dividend growth, dividend coverage and profitability.

International Equity Strategy

Approximately 25% of the Trust portfolio will constitute common stocks selected according to a quantitative dividend strategy. These stocks will be dividend paying American Depositary Receipt (“ADR”)/Global Depositary Receipt (“GDR”)/New York Registry Share equity securities or U.S.-listed common stocks of foreign companies representing both developed and emerging markets. The common stocks may be issued by small-, mid- and large-capitalization companies.

Fixed-Income Exchange-Traded Funds

Approximately 50% of the Trust portfolio will constitute ETFs that invest substantially all of their assets in both domestic and international fixed-income securities. The Sponsor, with the assistance of GPIM, has selected fixed-income ETFs believed to have the best potential for current income. When selecting the ETFs for the Trust, the Sponsor considers a number of factors, including but not limited to, the size, liquidity and daily trading volume, the current dividend yield, the strategy and investment objective, the fixed-income securities held by the ETF, the expense ratio and the overlap of the underlying fixed-income securities held by the ETFs.
                






 Risks and Other Considerations


As with all investments, you may lose some or all of your investment in the Trust. No assurance can be given that the Trust’s investment objective will be achieved. The Trust also might not perform as well as you expect. This can happen for reasons such as these:

• Securities prices can be volatile. The value of your investment may fall over time. Market value fluctuates in response to various factors. These can include stock market movements, purchases or sales of securities by the Trust, government policies, litigation, and changes in interest rates, inflation, the financial condition of the securities’ issuer or even perceptions of the issuer. Units of the Trust are not deposits of any bank and are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.

• The Trust invests in shares of ETFs. ETFs are investment pools that hold other securities. The ETFs in the Trust are usually passively-managed index funds that seek to replicate the performance or composition of a recognized securities index. ETFs are subject to various risks, including management’s ability to meet the fund’s investment objective. Shares of ETFs may trade at a discount from their net asset value in the secondary market. This risk is separate and distinct from the risk that the net asset value of the ETF shares may decrease. The amount of such discount from net asset value is subject to change from time to time in response to various factors. The underlying ETF has management and operating expenses. Consequently, you will bear not only your share of your Trust’s expenses, but also the expenses of the underlying ETFs. By investing in ETFs, the Trust incurs greater expenses than you would incur if you invested directly in the ETFs.

• The ETFs are subject to annual fees and expenses, including a management fee. Unitholders of the Trust will bear these fees in addition to the fees and expenses of the Trust. See “Fees and Expenses” for additional information.

• The Trust is subject to an ETF’s index correlation risk. To the extent that an underlying ETF is an index-tracking ETF, index correlation risk is the risk that the performance of an ETF will vary from the actual performance of the fund’s target index, known as “tracking error.” This can happen due to fund expenses, transaction costs, market impact, corporate actions (such as mergers and spin-offs) and timing variances.

• The value of the fixed-income securities ETFs will generally fall if interest rates, in general, rise. Typically, fixed-income securities with longer periods before maturity are more sensitive to interest rate changes. The Trust may be subject to greater risk of rising interest rates than would normally be the case due to the current period of historically low rates.

• An ETF or an issuer of securities held by an ETF may be unwilling or unable to make principal payments and/or to declare distributions in the future, may call a security before its stated maturity, or may reduce the level of distributions declared. Issuers may suspend dividends during the life of the Trust. This may result in a reduction in the value of your units.

• The financial condition of an ETF or an issuer of securities held by an ETF may worsen, resulting in a reduction in the value of your units. This may occur at any point in time, including during the primary offering period.

• Economic conditions may lead to limited liquidity and greater volatility. The markets for fixed-income securities, such as those held by certain ETFs, may experience periods of illiquidity and volatility. General market uncertainty and consequent repricing risk have led to market imbalances of sellers and buyers, which in turn have resulted in significant valuation uncertainties in a variety of fixed-income securities. These conditions resulted, and in many cases continue to result in, greater volatility, less liquidity, widening credit spreads and a lack of price transparency, with many debt securities remaining illiquid and of uncertain value. These market conditions may make valuation of some of the securities held by an ETF uncertain and/or result in sudden and significant valuation increases or declines in its holdings.

• Certain ETFs held by the Trust invest in securities that are rated below investment-grade and are considered to be “junk” securities. Below investment-grade obligations are considered to be speculative and are subject to greater market and credit risks, and accordingly, the risk of non-payment or default is higher than with investment-grade securities. In addition, such securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes and more likely to receive early returns of principal in falling rate environments.

• Certain ETFs held by the Trust may invest in securities that are rated as investment-grade by only one rating agency. As a result, such split-rated securities may have more speculative characteristics and are subject to a greater risk of default than securities rated as investment-grade by more than one rating agency.

• The Trust invests in U.S.-listed foreign securities, a New York Registry Share, and ADRs and certain ETFs held by the Trust may invest in foreign securities. Investment in foreign securities presents additional risk. ADRs are issued by a bank or Trust company to evidence ownership of underlying securities issued by foreign corporations. New York Registry Shares are created by a U.S. registrar so that securities of companies incorporated in the Netherlands may be traded on a U.S. exchange. Securities of foreign issuers present risks beyond those of domestic securities. More specifically, foreign risk is the risk that foreign securities will be more volatile than U.S. securities due to such factors as adverse economic, currency, political, social or regulatory developments in a country, including government seizure of assets, excessive taxation, limitations on the use or transfer of assets, the lack of liquidity or regulatory controls with respect to certain industries or differing legal and/or accounting standards.

• The Trust and certain ETFs held by the Trust invest in securities issued by companies headquartered in countries considered to be emerging markets. Emerging markets are generally defined as countries with low per capita income in the initial stages of their industrialization cycles. Risks of investing in developing or emerging countries include the possibility of investment and trading limitations, liquidity concerns, delays and disruptions in settlement transactions, political uncertainties and dependence on international trade and development assistance. Companies headquartered in emerging market countries may be exposed to greater volatility and market risk.

• Certain ETFs held by the Trust may invest in securities whose value may be dependent on currency exchange rates. The U.S. dollar value of these securities may vary with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Most foreign currencies have fluctuated widely in value against the U.S. dollar for various economic and political reasons such as the activity level of large international commercial banks, various central banks, speculators, hedge funds and other buyers and sellers of foreign currencies.

• The Trust invests in securities issued by mid-capitalization companies and certain ETFs held by the Trust may invest in securities issued by small-capitalization and/or mid-capitalization companies. These securities customarily involve more investment risk than securities of large-capitalization companies. Small-capitalization and mid-capitalization companies may have limited product lines, markets or financial resources and may be more vulnerable to adverse general market or economic developments.

• Share prices or distributions on the securities in the Trust may decline during the life of the Trust. There is no guarantee that share prices of the securities in the Trust will not decline and that the issuers of the securities will declare distributions in the future and, if declared, whether they will remain at current levels or increase over time.

• Inflation may lead to a decrease in the value of assets or income from investments.

• The Sponsor does not actively manage the portfolio. The Trust will generally hold, and may, when creating additional units, continue to buy, the same securities even though a security’s outlook, market value or yield may have changed.

See “Investment Risks” in Part A of the prospectus and “Risk Factors” in Part B of the prospectus for additional information.







Please see the Trust prospectus for more complete risk information.
Unit Investment Trusts are fixed, not actively managed and should be considered as part of a long-term strategy. Investors should consider their ability to invest in successive portfolios, if available, at the applicable sales charge. UITs are subject to annual fund operating expenses in addition to the sales charge. Investors should consult an attorney or tax advisor regarding tax consequences associated with an investment from one series to the next, if available, and with the purchase or sale of units. Guggenheim Funds Distributors, LLC does not offer tax advice.

Performance
Performance widget loading ...



Commentary

As of June 30, 2017 

	Month in review


		The JPMorgan Income Builder Fund (I Class Shares) returned 0.32% in June.

		The Federal Reserve (Fed) increased interest rates and said it expects one more increase this year if the economy performs as expected. In addition, the Fed detailed a plan for unwinding its balance sheet, which could begin before the end of 2017.

		News of high inventory levels and rising production in certain countries drove oil prices to a seven-month low.

		U.S. employment report data announced at the beginning of June disappointed. Despite the disappointment relative to expectations, the unemployment rate fell to its lowest level in 16 years.

		Favoring equities during the month helped performance as rates moved up and global equities continued to outperform U.S. core fixed income broadly. Our positioning in credit was also a benefit as high yield outperformed both core fixed income and government bonds.


	Looking ahead


		We maintain conviction in our pro-risk positioning as better global economic growth and relatively slow tightening by global central banks remain supportive of risk assets. We continue to favor equities broadly across regions and look to diversify our credit exposure within fixed income.

		International equities are currently about 60% of our total equity allocation, including real estate investment trusts. We continue to find European equities particularly attractive given strong economic and earnings momentum, lower near-term political risks, and generally attractive yields in the region. Our exposure to equities is at the highest level since mid-2015.

		We continue to believe that credit will be the most attractive area within fixed income. While we have maintained a sizeable allocation to high yield, we began to diversify our credit exposure by reducing high yield and marginally increasing our allocation to emerging markets debt. We believe that high yield spreads are relatively tight and the returns on the asset class will likely come from the income component rather than capital appreciation going forward. However, high-yield fundamentals remain supportive so we still believe the asset class has a place in an income portfolio.

Disclaimer1Please refer to the prospectus for additional information about cut-off times. Total return assumes reinvestment of income. The Fund's adviser and/or its affiliates have contractually agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses to the extent Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, dividend and interest expenses related to short sales, interest, taxes, expenses related to litigation and potential litigation and extraordinary expenses) exceed 0.75% for A Shares, 1.25% for C Shares, 0.60% for I Shares and 0.75% for T Shares of the average daily net assets. The Fund may invest in one or more money market funds advised by the adviser or its affiliates (affiliated money market funds). The Fund's adviser has contractually agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses in an amount sufficient to offset the fees and expenses of the affiliated money market funds incurred by the Fund because of the Fund's investment in such money market funds. This waiver is in effect through 2/28/2018 for A Shares, 2/28/2018 for C Shares, 2/28/2018 for I Shares and 2/28/2018 for T Shares, at which time the adviser and/or its affiliates will determine whether to renew or revise it. The difference between net and gross fees includes all applicable fee waivers and expense reimbursements. Mutual funds have fees that reduce their performance: indexes do not. You cannot invest directly in an index. MSCI World Index (net of foreign withholding taxes) is a broad measure of the performance of developed countries' equity markets. The Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index is an unmanaged index representing SEC-registered taxable and dollar denominated securities. It covers the U.S. investment grade fixed rate bond market, with index components for government and corporate securities, mortgage pass-through, and asset-backed securities. The Income Builder Composite Benchmark is a composite benchmark of unmanaged indexes that includes 60% MSCI World Index (net of foreign withholding taxes) and 40% Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Index. The performance of the Lipper Flexible Portfolio Funds Index includes expenses associated with a mutual fund, such as investment management fees. These expenses are not identical to the expenses charged by the Fund. An individual cannot invest directly in an index. Total return figures (for the fund and any index quoted) assume payment of fees and reinvestment of dividends (after the highest applicable foreign withholding tax) and distributions. Without fee waivers, fund returns would have been lower. Due to rounding, some values may not total 100%. Â©2017, American Bankers Association, CUSIP Database provided by the Standard & Poor's CUSIP Service Bureau, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. All rights reserved.The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10- year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.Rankings do not take sales loads into account.The following risks could cause the fund to lose money or perform more poorly than other investments. For more complete risk information, see the prospectus. Investments in bonds and other debt securities will change in value based on changes in interest rates. If rates rise, the value of these investments generally drops. Securities rated below investment grade are considered "high-yield," "non-investment grade," "below investment-grade," or "junk bonds." They generally are rated in the fifth or lower rating categories of Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service. Although they can provide higher yields than higher rated securities, they can carry greater risk. International investing has a greater degree of risk and increased volatility due to political and economic instability of some overseas markets. Changes in currency exchange rates and different accounting and taxation policies outside the U.S. can affect returns.  The prices of equity securities are sensitive to a wide range of factors, from economic to company-specific news, and can fluctuate rapidly and unpredictably, causing an investment to decrease in value. Investments in derivatives may be riskier than other types of investments. They may be more sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions than other types of investments. Many derivatives create leverage, which could lead to greater volatility and losses that significantly exceed the original investment. Commodity investing is subject to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities, particularly if leveraged. Their value may be affected by overall market movements, index volatility, interest rate changes, or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity. Use of leveraged derivatives may increase return but also increase the possibility for greater loss.Total return assumes reinvestment of income. The top 10 holdings listed reflect only the Fund's long-term investments. Short-term investments are excluded. Holdings are subject to change. The holdings listed should not be considered recommendations to purchase or sell a particular security. Each individual security is calculated as a percentage of the aggregate market value of the securities held in the Fund and does not include the use of derivative positions, where applicable. Beta measures a fund's volatility in comparison to the market as a whole. A beta of 1.00 indicates a fund has been exactly as volatile as the market. Sharpe ratio measures the fund's excess return compared to a risk-free investment. The higher the Sharpe ratio, the better the returns relative to the risk taken. Tracking Error: The active risk of the portfolio, which determines the annualized standard deviation of the excess returns between the portfolio and the benchmark. Alpha: The relationship between the performance of the Fund and its beta over a three-year period of time. Standard deviation/Volatility: A statistical measure of the degree to which the Fund's returns have varied from its historical average. The higher the standard deviation, the wider the range of returns from its average and the greater the historical volatility. The standard deviation is calculated over a 36-month period based on Fund's monthly returns. The standard deviation shown is based on the Fund's Class A Shares or the oldest share class, where Class A Shares are not available. R2: The percentage of a Fund's movements that result from movements in the index ranging from 0 to 100. A Fund with an R2 of 100 means that 100 percent of the Fund's movement can completely be explained by movements in the Fund's external index benchmark. Risk measures are calculated based upon the Funds' broad-based index as stated in the prospectus.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

 Fact SheetJun 30, 2017







The Fund
The Fund invests in common stocks, income instruments, preferred stocks and hybrid securities around the globe that the portfolio managers believe may provide attractive levels of income. For its investments in common stocks, the managers may also seek t o invest in securities they believe have the potential to grow income and/or provide capital appreciation over time.



The Approach
Fund managers employ a bottom-up, research driven process to identify what they believe are attractive global securities up and down the capital structure. Management endeavors to invest in income producing instruments, coupled with investments in common  stocks that may have the potential for growth of income and capital appreciation over time. Overall asset allocation decisions are made collectively by the portfolio management team.



The Features
The global, multi-asset class approach may provide diversification benefits as management seeks to uncover opportunities across an array of income producing securities and common stock. A flexible mandate with broad discretion (within the specified inves tment ranges) to allocate across investment instruments may help navigate the challenges that face traditional sources of income.

References to investments are to the aggregate holdings of the Fund and the Portfolio.


About Risk: 
Fund performance is sensitive to stock market volatility. Changes in the dividend policies of companies could make it difficult to provide a predictable level of income. Investments in foreign instruments or currencies can involve greater risk and volati lity than U.S. investments because of adverse market, economic, political, regulatory, geopolitical or other conditions. Dividend capture strategies may result in higher portfolio turnover, increased trading costs and potential for capital loss or gains.  When interest rates rise, the value of preferred stocks and other hybrid securities will generally decline. As interest rates rise, the value of certain income investments is likely to decline. No fund is a complete investment program and you may lose m oney investing in a fund. The Fund may engage in other investment practices that may involve additional risks and you should review the Fund prospectus for a complete description.

6. SEC 30-day yield is a standardized measure based on the estimated yield to maturity of a fund's investments over a 30-day period and is based on the maximum offer price at the date specified. The SEC 30-day yield is not based on the distributions made by  the fund, which may differ. Distribution Rate at NAV is calculated by dividing the last distribution paid per share (annualized) by NAV. The Fund's monthly distribution may be comprised of ordinary income, net realized capital gains and returns of capit al.
7. Alpha measures risk-adjusted performance, showing excess return delivered at the same risk level as the benchmark. Beta measures the volatility of a fund relative to the overall market. R-Squared represents the percentage of the portfolio's movement that  can be explained by the general movement of the market. Standard deviation measures the historic volatility of a fund. Sharpe Ratio uses standard deviation and excess return to determine reward per unit of risk.
8. A portion of the Fund's returns may be comprised of return of capital or short term capital gains. The Fund will determine the tax characteristics of all Fund distributions after the end of the calendar year and will provide shareholders such information  at that time. Please consult your tax advisor for further information.

Ratings are based on Moody's, S&P or Fitch, as applicable. If securities are rated differently by the ratings agencies, the higher rating is applied. Ratings, which are subject to change, apply to the creditworthiness of the issuers of the underlying sec urities and not to the Fund or its shares. Credit ratings measure the quality of a bond based on the issuer's creditworthiness, with ratings ranging from AAA, being the highest, to D, being the lowest based on S&P's measures. Ratings of BBB or higher by  S&P or Fitch (Baa or higher by Moody's) are considered to be investment-grade quality. Credit ratings are based largely on the ratings agency's analysis at the time of rating. The rating assigned to any particular security is not necessarily a reflection  of the issuer's current financial condition and does not necessarily reflect its assessment of the volatility of a security's market value or of the liquidity of an investment in the security. Holdings designated as "Not Rated" are not rated by the nati onal ratings agencies stated above.

Sales Charges
(based on $10 public offering price per unit)



Initial Sales Charge1.00% Deferred Sales Charge2.45%
Creation + Development Fee0.50%
Sales Fee3.95%






               The deferred Sales Charge will be deducted in monthly installments on the last business day of Feb 2016, Mar 2016 and Apr 2016 or upon early redemption. For unit prices other than the above offering price, percentages of initial sales charge, creation and development fee, and  deferred sales charge will vary, but in no event will the maximun sales charge exceed 3.95% of the public offerring price. For trusts with a fully deferred sales charge, the initial sales charge will not vary. Early redemption of units will still cause  payment of the deferred sales charge.
            






Risks and Other Considerations

1 Cumulative total return measures the terminal value of an investment relative to the initial value of the investment and is expressed as a percentage gain (loss), and does not take into account the length of time over which the investment was held. The terminal value of an investment takes into account both capital appreciation (depreciation) and reinvestment of income and capital distributions into additional units of the trust. The terminal value also takes into account maximum allowable sales charges and all applicable expenses of the trust. 
2 Average annual total return is the compounded annual return that if constantly earned over the same time period as the investment would have equated to the same terminal value as the investment, and is expressed as an annual percentage gain or loss. The terminal value of an investment takes into account both capital appreciation (depreciation) and reinvestment of income and capital distributions into additional units of the trust. The terminal value also takes into account maximum allowable sales charges and all applicable expenses of the trust. 
Past performance does not guarantee future results. It is possible to lose money investing in this portfolio. Average annual total return calculations take into account reinvestment of all distributions and payment of the trust's maximum applicable up-front and deferred sales charge. Please refer to each trust's highlight card and prospectus for applicable sales charges and expenses. The value of units will fluctuate with changes in market conditions and units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
Returns With Transactional Sales Charge reflect the maximum transactional sales charge that would be payable by an investor upon sale or redemption of units at the end of the applicable period(s). The transactional sales charge includes any initial or deferred sales charges other than the creation and development fee. These returns do not reflect any creation and development fee prior to collection (generally the close of the initial offering period). Any creation and development fee is reflected in the returns as of the time of payment by a trust. 
Returns Without Transactional Sales Charge do not reflect any transactional sales charge and do not reflect any creation and development fee prior to collection (generally the close of the initial offering period). Any creation and development fee is reflected in the returns as of the time of payment by a trust.
Returns with distributions reinvested assumes distributions are reinvested on the reinvestment date. Product returns will be understated for the period between the distribution Ex-date and Payable-date, if a distribution is expected.
