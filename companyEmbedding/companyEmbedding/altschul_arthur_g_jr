Early life[edit]
Altschul was born in 1920 in Manhattan to Helen Lehman Goodhart (maternal granddaughter of Mayer Lehman, one of the three founding brothers of Lehman brothers) and Frank Altschul, an investment banker who was a senior partner at Lazard Frères until 1945 and chairman of General Investors Corporation until he retired in 1961.
He graduated from Deerfield Academy in Massachusetts and in 1943 from Yale College.
Career[edit]
He served in the Marines from 1943 through 1945 and was a New York Times reporter in the late 1940s.
As he had family connections to the Lehman family, he worked as an analyst with Lehman Brothers before joining General American Investors Company (a closed-end investment concern in which his family has a substantial interest) and then Goldman Sachs where he served as a general partner from 1959 to 1977 and a limited partner from 1977 to 1999. He was also chairman of General American Investors from 1961 to 1995.[4]
He led the private family office, Overbrook Management Corporation, founded by his father to manage and protect the wealth and financial well-being of the Altschul Family. In 2002, the office opened its doors to provides asset management and related services to institutional investors and high net worth individuals. Over the years, Overbrook’s leadership passed to him, and then to the third generation, his son, Arthur Goodhart Altschul, Jr, who currently serves as Overbrook’s Chairman.[3]

Rula Jebreal
Dave Allocca/Starpix



Biotechnology and investment entrepreneur Arthur Altschul Jr. and Rula Jebreal are engaged, we can exclusively reveal. We hear wealthy Altschul, who is the son of former Goldman Sachs partner, philanthropist and art collector Arthur Altschul, proposed to journalist and screenwriter Jebreal in late April. Page Six reported in March that the two were dating, having been spotted together at several restaurants and events. This will be the first marriage for Altschul. Jebreal previously dated Julian Schnabel for five years, before splitting in 2011. She also has a teenage daughter from a previous relationship. Reached for comment, Altschul said: “We are engaged. We’re very much in love, and look forward to being married.”

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for General American Investors (NYSE:GAM) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: No ratings tracked in the last 12 months.Consensus Rating:N/A (Score: NaN)Consensus Price Target: N/A

Early life[edit]
Altschul was born in 1920 in Manhattan to Helen Lehman Goodhart (maternal granddaughter of Mayer Lehman, one of the three founding brothers of Lehman brothers) and Frank Altschul, an investment banker who was a senior partner at Lazard Frères until 1945 and chairman of General Investors Corporation until he retired in 1961.
He graduated from Deerfield Academy in Massachusetts and in 1943 from Yale College.
Career[edit]
He served in the Marines from 1943 through 1945 and was a New York Times reporter in the late 1940s.
As he had family connections to the Lehman family, he worked as an analyst with Lehman Brothers before joining General American Investors Company (a closed-end investment concern in which his family has a substantial interest) and then Goldman Sachs where he served as a general partner from 1959 to 1977 and a limited partner from 1977 to 1999. He was also chairman of General American Investors from 1961 to 1995.[4]
He led the private family office, Overbrook Management Corporation, founded by his father to manage and protect the wealth and financial well-being of the Altschul Family. In 2002, the office opened its doors to provides asset management and related services to institutional investors and high net worth individuals. Over the years, Overbrook’s leadership passed to him, and then to the third generation, his son, Arthur Goodhart Altschul, Jr, who currently serves as Overbrook’s Chairman.[3]
Philanthropy[edit]
Altschul was on the Board of Trustees of many museums and philanthropic organisations, including the Whitney Museum, the United Jewish Appeal, the Overbrook Foundation, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, The American Assembly,[2] and the International Foundation for Art Research.
Barnard College at its 1984 commencement ceremonies awarded Altschul its highest honor, the Barnard Medal of Distinction.
Personal life[edit]
Altschul was married four times:[4]

Stephanie Rosemary Wagner, married in 1956, she later died in a plane crash.[5]

Stephen Altschul (b 1957), mathematician and researcher
Charles Altschul


Siri von Reis (divorced 1972) with whom he had three children:

Arthur Altschul, Jr. (born 1964), in 2013, he married Palestinian newscaster Rula Jebreal.[6]
Emily Helen Altschul (born 1966), in November 2002, she married John Miller (journalist), former host of 20/20, the weekly news magazine on ABC, in a civil ceremony in Manhattan.[7]
Serena Altschul (b 1970), MTV and CNN broadcast journalist

He graduated from Deerfield Academy in Massachusetts and in 1943 from Yale College.
Career[edit]
He served in the Marines from 1943 through 1945 and was a New York Times reporter in the late 1940s.
As he had family connections to the Lehman family, he worked as an analyst with Lehman Brothers before joining General American Investors Company (a closed-end investment concern in which his family has a substantial interest) and then Goldman Sachs where he served as a general partner from 1959 to 1977 and a limited partner from 1977 to 1999. He was also chairman of General American Investors from 1961 to 1995.[4]
He led the private family office, Overbrook Management Corporation, founded by his father to manage and protect the wealth and financial well-being of the Altschul Family. In 2002, the office opened its doors to provides asset management and related services to institutional investors and high net worth individuals. Over the years, Overbrook’s leadership passed to him, and then to the third generation, his son, Arthur Goodhart Altschul, Jr, who currently serves as Overbrook’s Chairman.[3]
Philanthropy[edit]
Altschul was on the Board of Trustees of many museums and philanthropic organisations, including the Whitney Museum, the United Jewish Appeal, the Overbrook Foundation, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, The American Assembly,[2] and the International Foundation for Art Research.
Barnard College at its 1984 commencement ceremonies awarded Altschul its highest honor, the Barnard Medal of Distinction.
Personal life[edit]
Altschul was married four times:[4]

Stephanie Rosemary Wagner, married in 1956, she later died in a plane crash.[5]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.
