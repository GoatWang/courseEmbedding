About OakmarkWhy Oakmark?Philosophy & ProcessOwning ValueOakmark in Your PortfolioPortfolio ManagersProxy Voting PolicyHarris Associates

About Harris Associates L.P.
Harris Associates L.P., based in Chicago, is the investment adviser to The Oakmark Funds.
The firm was founded in 1976 by dedicated investment professionals who believed that delivering successful investment results for clients requires a consistent investment philosophy, a commitment to superior investment research, and a high level of customer service. Our roster of clients has grown over the years, but these basic beliefs remain unchanged.
We are value investors. In constructing portfolios for The Oakmark Funds and other clients, we seek out businesses that we believe are priced at significant discounts to their underlying value. These companies must offer significant profit potential and be run by managers who think and act as owners. We frame the investment process as owning a piece of a business for the long term.
We believe in the importance of intensive, fundamental research. Our experienced investment analysts evaluate each company on the basis of its fundamental characteristics. Our research process is based on a disciplined quantitative and qualitative screening process.
We recognize that each of our clients has unique goals and needs; therefore, portfolios are crafted to meet those objectives. We are as proud of our client service as we are of our outstanding long-term investment results.
Assets under management at Harris Associates totaled approximately $124 billion as of June 30, 2017. Our team includes 39 investment professionals and 198 total employees. Harris Associates is an autonomous subsidiary of Natixis Global Asset Management, L.P.
