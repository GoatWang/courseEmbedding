Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notice Form
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") is a United States copyright law that provides guidelines for online service providers in case of copyright infringement. Below is the information that should be present in these notices. It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to us as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. The form of notice specified below is consistent with the DMCA, which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office website, http://www.copyright.gov.
To file a notice of infringement with us, you must provide us with the items specified below. Please note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that the material is infringing your copyright. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether material infringes your copyright, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.
This notice and any attachments we receive will be forwarded to the alleged infringer, who will then have the opportunity to file a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. Should a properly filed counter notification be filed, you will be notified and have 10 business days within which to file for a restraining order in Federal Court to prevent the reinstatement of the material.

Product Description

David Vallieres and Eric Holmlund – Retirement Firesale Package (Reseller License)
Price: $97
Just pay: $32
Sale Page: http://www.25kfiresale.com/crazydeal/
Dear Friend,
I won’t waste your time talking about how beneficial getting products with Master Resell Rights can be.  I’m sure you already know that getting these kinds of products is one of the quickest, easiest, and least expensive ways to get products to sell and start making money.
The hard part is finding quality products to sell . . . and quantity.  I general, you will never get rich selling just one ebook.  No matter how many copies of the ebook you sell, you will always be leaving money on the table.
You need plenty of high quality products to sell on the front end AND the back end of your business… that is, you need more products to sell to your customers after they buy that first product from you.
Of course, you could spend the time and money to create all of these products yourself.  Or, you could spend the time (a lot of time, actually) and money to find quality products that have resell rights that you can turn around and sell to your current customers.
But, the most cost-effective and time-effective option is to have a good look at this CRAZY DEAL that I have put together for you here.  
First, take a look at all the products you’ll be able to SELL once you download this package (you can also use them for yourself of course)…

Classical Music from Amazon.comClassical music encompasses the whole of western music from the early renaissance through the 20th century. From famous pieces like Beethoven’s 5th symphony to the esoteric compositions of visionary modernists like John Cage, the depth and breadth of classical music ensures there’s something for every listener to enjoy. At Amazon.com, you’ll find a complete selection of classical music spanning from early baroque to contemporary compositions. Influential composers like J.S. Bach were largely responsible for establishing a unified system of musicality throughout Europe, which led to an explosion of creative output across the continent. Paired with the invention and perfection of instruments like the violin and piano, prolific composers like Vivaldi and Haydn brought music into the classical period. Characterized by a more uniform style and presentation, classical music from this era embraced lasting forms like the symphony and concerto. As artists like Mozart continued to innovate and expand the musical vocabulary of the day, the classical era gave way to the drama and emotive compositions of the romantic era. Legendary composers like Brahms, Beethoven, and Wagner wrote some of the most memorable and moving pieces of music in history, and remain popular today. As the philosophical ideals of classical music began to shift toward creative expression and individuality, composers like Mahler, Debussy, and Stravinsky produced deeply artistic works that would forever redefine society’s perception of music. To find classical music that you like, you can use our helpful product filters. Simply choose the eras, composers, and recording formats that you prefer, and we’ll create a list of products that meet your criteria. You’ll find thousands of classical recordings in several formats, including CDs, Vinyl, and digital download, so no matter how you prefer to listen, you’ll be sure to find many records you love. Classical music has long been the soundtrack to western history. Through the works of the great composers, you can immerse yourself in the art, culture, and philosophy of the European golden age.
