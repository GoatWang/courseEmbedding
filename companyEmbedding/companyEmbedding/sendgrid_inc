Mapping Customer Lifecycle Transitions








Note: This guest post comes from Joshua Neckes and Brian Thompson at Simon Data. Simon is a tool that transforms your data into clear insights that let you get more out of your marketing. Connect your data in minutes, create customized segments, deploy to existing channels, and discover what your customers want.


        It's a common misconception that lifecycle marketing is about triggers, like triggering an associated email, text, or push notification when someone's abandoned their cart. At Simon Data, we think that lifecycle marketing is about transitions in the customer journey, when customers move from stage to stage, as they engage with your brand.
      

        Savvy e-commerce companies build sophisticated lifecycle campaigns around these specific, well-defined transitions, seeking to move customers from a less valuable cohort to a more valuable cohort. Optimizing around these critical lifecycle milestones yields meaningful increases in customer lifetime value (LTV).
      

        Each business has its own unique dynamics and transition points. Early on, Instagram found that once a user uploaded three photos, their tendency toward daily app usage increased dramatically. Accordingly, the entire onboarding flow was built and optimized to encourage and incentivize customers to hit that three photo mark.
      

        At Etsy, the team found something similar with sellers: once they'd listed six items on the platform, their LTV increased substantially. As a result, the team spent a tremendous amount of time devising strategies to encourage sellers to list more.
      

        What's the friction?
      

        Once a critical lifecycle transition point is found, the next step is figuring out how to ensure customers make it through that transition. A given point may have a variety of different friction points that inhibit the transition.
      

        Take the Instagram example: one concern might be availability-a given user may not have three photos that they want to share. For someone else, the issue might be privacy and being uncertain about who might see their photo. For yet another user, the problem could be a confusing process around uploading photos.
      

        Each of these friction points requires a separate 'remediation' to help facilitate the transition from 'user with less than 3 photos' to 'user with more than 3 photos.' It's through creative ideation, data-driven testing, and cross-channel engagement that companies like Instagram and Etsy are able to build multifaceted programs that cumulatively account for and address these transition points.
      

        Common transitions and their dynamics
      

        While each business has unique transitions and friction points, within specific verticals and industries, there are observable trends across businesses. Below, we explore some of the more critical and universal transition points for e-commerce businesses.
      

        1. Anonymous -> Activated
      

        Regardless of brand, focus, or vertical, an essential transition is when a user provides their contact information. Data-driven brands understand the net value of each new email address, by acquisition channel, and can deploy a variety of interventions to prevent disengagements and bounces. Incentives typically lead the way, but a strong content strategy can often be enough to prompt an anonymous user to opt in.
      

        2. Activated -> First Purchase
      

        Once someone has activated and provided their information, the next transition is that critical first purchase. Here, e-commerce businesses often combine aggressive retargeting with well-honed welcome messages (push, email, or both) that are purpose-built for conversion. This (coupled with activation) is the transition point that receives by far the most investment. It makes sense, of course, as a 'conversion' is a favorable metric for measuring growth and future potential engagement. However, excessive focus on this transition can sometimes be detrimental to other critical life cycle transitions (including those below).
      

        3. First Purchase -> Second Purchase
      

        Post-purchase flows are often underdeveloped compared to their first-purchase counterparts. This is typically due to lack of data, or capabilities, to target users based on first purchase dynamics (e.g. item, amount, season, review content, etc.). It's important to be wary of the several potential friction points that arise at this stage.
      

        A first-time buyer's initial purchase during the holiday season might have been for someone else; another customer may have bought on a whim, with no real interest in the category; another may have a bad first experience, which is notoriously challenging to overcome. Following initial conversion, marketers should dedicate more resources to driving a second purchase.
      

        4. Second Purchase -> Nth Purchase
      

        While almost every company we see has some sort of post-purchase flow, there's a very uneven engagement landscape following a second purchase (and beyond). Repeat purchasing dynamics are very company-specific and vertical-dependent. For example: the more diverse a product catalog, the more likely downstream retention will be.
      

        Savvier companies can often provide product recommendations but struggle to intersperse content and branded messaging that reinforces the customer's emotional connection with the brand. And a purely transactional relationship predicated on personalized offers often leads to disengagement and churn.
      

        In our next post, we'll cover the next 7 lifecycle transitions and how to better catalyze customer movement from one stage to another. In the meantime, check out SendGrid's Essential Guide To Email Commerce.

SendGrid's Main Product Is Just a Byproduct


Isaac Saldana wants to build tools that make life easier for developers. SendGrid is just the start.

WRITE A COMMENT























SendGrid's Isaac Saldana (left) and Jose Lopez (right) launched the company with one simple premise: to make developers' lives easier.


CREDIT: Courtesy Company






COMPANY PROFILE
Company: SendGrid Headquarters: Boulder, CO Founder: Isaac Saldana, 34, Jose Lopez, 30 Year Founded: 2009 Full Year Revenue: $28.9 million Employees: 225 Raised: $27 million Twitter: @sendgrid Facebook: facebook.com/SendGrid Website: www.sendgrid.com 







Editor’s Note: Vote for your top pick among Inc.'s 35 Under 35 Coolest Entrepreneurs of 2014. Inc.com announces the Readers' Choice winner Thursday, June 26.
SendGrid is at its heart a B2D, or business-to-developer, company. The company's email product is more of a byproduct. 
After graduating from the University of California, Riverside with a degree in electrical engineering and computer science in 2003, Isaac Saldana, the company's co-founder, encountered his "aha" moment. When he launched a couple of tech startups just out of school, he noticed a major problem for software developers: It was very difficult to enable apps to send automated emails alerting users to something happening on the network. 
So Saldana decided to build the infrastructure that would better ensure that deliverability. Along with co-founders Tim Jenkins, 37, and college buddy Jose Lopez, 30, Saldana formally launched SendGrid after graduating from the TechStars accelerator program in 2009. Five years and $27 million in funding later, the company employs 225 and is responsible for delivering approximately 2 percent of the world's nonspam email.
And though email would become the company's main revenue driver--clients include Uber, Spotify, and Pinterest--the heart of the company rests with its core inspiration: developers.
"There's SendGrid the product," Saldana says, referring to the company's flagship email deliverability system, "and there's SendGrid the company. SendGrid the company is about making developers' lives easier."
To that end, Saldana hired former Oracle executive Jim Franklin as SendGrid's CEO in 2011, when the company had just 30 employees. Though Franklin runs the company, Saldana, now president, keeps his eye on product development.
"He's a creator and an innovator," Franklin says. "He wants to be building the product every day. When he was CEO, he was still sitting at a computer building stuff."
Without the business's day-to-day to weigh on him, Saldana has kept his focus on where his passions lie: developing. And although that means tinkering with the SendGrid product, it also means finding new product avenues for the company. 
Saldana and Franklin agree the company's focus on developers gives SendGrid the mandate to create products well outside the realm of email deliverability. Part of Saldana's work today is focused on SendGrid Labs, the company's innovation studio, which releases and sells tools for developers that the company has found helpful in building its own products. For example, one of its early releases, Loader.io, helps developers test app functionality as traffic scales.
Saldana thinks any tool that helps developers do their job, especially in the cloud, falls under SendGrid's umbrella, meaning the email plumbing Saldana says he's passionate about is really just one aspect of what could be a much larger system.
"Developers don't have all the tools, and we're on a mission to create them," he says. "Since the beginning, we were also developers."
