On September 29, 2016, the Active Assets Government Trust existing class was re-designated as "S Class."
The Board of Active Assets Institutional Government Securities Trust approved changing the Fund's name to ''Active Assets Government Trust'', effective as of March 31, 2016. No changes have been made to the investment objectives or policies of the Fund.
Where the net expense ratio is lower than the gross expense ratio, certain fees have been waived and/or expenses reimbursed. These waivers and/or reimbursements will continue for at least one year from the date of the applicable fund’s current prospectus (unless otherwise noted in the applicable prospectus) or until such time as the fund's Board of Directors/Trustees acts to discontinue all or a portion of such waivers and/or reimbursements. Absent such waivers and/or reimbursements, returns would have been lower. Expenses are based on the Fund's current prospectus.
Subject to change daily. Portfolio information and composition are provided for informational purposes only, and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell any security. 

DEFINITIONS 
Net Asset Value (NAV) is the dollar value of a single mutual fund share, based on the value of the underlying assets of the fund minus its liabilities, divided by the number of shares outstanding. It is calculated at the end of each business day. Subsidized(Sub.) reflects current fee waivers in effect. Absent such fee waivers, the yield would have been lower. The Unsubsidized (Unsub.) does not reflect the fee waivers currently in effect. Current yield is a measure that looks at the current price of a bond instead of its face value and represents the return an investor would expect if he or she purchased the bond and held it for a year. Calculated by dividing the Annual Cash Inflows / Market Price. The 7-day effective yields are annualized net yields that describe 1-year earnings assuming dividends are reinvested at the average rate of the last 7 days. SEC 30-day yield is a measure of the income generated by the portfolio's underlying asset over the trailing 30 days, relative to the asset base of the portfolio itself. The SEC 30-day yield - Subsidized (Sub.) reflects current fee waivers in effect. Absent such fee waivers, the yield would have been lower. The SEC 30-Day yield - Un-Subsidized (Un-Sub.) does not reflect the fee waivers currently in effect.
Weighted average maturity (WAM).Maturity measures the number of days remaining in the life of a bond. The weighted average maturity of the portfolio represents the market-weighted average of the maturities of the portfolio's individual holdings. Weighted average life (WAL). A measure of sensitivity to liquidity and/or credit risk. Weighted average life takes into account all call options exercised by the issuer as well as permissible maturity shortening devices such as demand features.

You could lose money by investing in the Fund. Although the Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Funds’ sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will  provide financial support to the Fund at any time.
1 Amended rule 2a-7(a)(8) (defining “daily liquid asset” to mean (i) cash; (ii) direct obligations of the U.S. Government; and (iii) securities that will mature or are subject to a demand feature that is exercisable and payable within one business day).
2 Amended rule 2a-7(a)(32) (defining “weekly liquid assets” to mean (i) cash; (ii) direct obligations of the U.S. Government; (iii) Government securities issued by a person controlled or supervised by and acting as an instrumentality of the Government of the United States pursuant to authority granted by the Congress of the United States, that are issued at a discount to the principal amount to be repaid at maturity and have a remaining maturity of 60 days or less; and (iv) securities that will mature or are subject to a demand feature that is exercisable and payable within five business days). As of January 1, 2011, the SEC requires fund companies to file a new exhibit with risk/return summary information in interactive data (XBRL) format. Click here for XBRL files.
Please consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the portfolios carefully before investing. The prospectus contains this and other information about the portfolios. To obtain a prospectus, download one at www.morganstanley.com/liquidity or call 1.800.236.0992. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.
Morgan Stanley Investment Management (MSIM) is the asset management division of Morgan Stanley.


 






 

  WAM is the weighted average maturity of the portfolio. The WAM calculation utilizes the interest-rate reset date, rather than a security's stated final maturity, for variable- and floating- rate securities. By looking to a portfolio's interest rate reset schedule in lieu of final maturity dates, the WAM measure effectively captures a fund's exposure to interest rate movements and the potential price impact resulting from interest rate movements.
 


  WAL is the weighted average life of the portfolio. The WAL calculation utilizes a security's stated final maturity date or, when relevant, the date of the next demand feature when the fund may receive payment of principal and interest (such as a put feature). Accordingly, WAL reflects how a portfolio would react to deteriorating credit (widening spreads) or tightening liquidity conditions.
 


  Tracking error and information ratio are calculated using the Portfolio's Blended Index (added October 2, 2013), as this is a better representation of the Portfolio's global multi-asset strategy. The investment team manages the Portfolio relative to this Blended Index.
 


  Excess return versus Custom Benchmark is calculated using the Portfolio's Blended Index based on the period since it was added as a benchmark on October 2, 2013.
 


  NTM = Next Twelve Months
 


  LTM = Last Twelve Months
 


  Because the Portfolio had not commenced operations as of the most recent fiscal year end, no portfolio turnover rate is available for the Portfolio.
 


  The Reorganization occurred on January 6, 2015. The inception date reflects the inception date of the Private Fund.
 


  Global equities is represented by the MSCI All Country World Index.
 


  Net exposure % calculated as [(MV of long cash security and derivative positions)-(absolute value of MV in short derivative positions)]/(portfolio MV)
 


  Gross exposure % calculated as [(MV of long cash security and derivative positions)+(absolute value of MV in short derivative positions)]/(portfolio MV).
 


  Fixed income net and gross exposure is duration adjusted (U.S. Treasury 10-Year equivalents)
 


  Security ratings disclosed above have been obtained from Standard & Poor's Ratings Group ("S&P"). S&P's credit ratings express its opinion about the ability and willingness of an issuer to meet its financial obligations in full and on time.'AAA' is the highest rating. Any rating below 'BBB-' rating 
		is considered non-investment grade. Ratings are relative and subjective and are not absolute standards of quality. Ratings apply only to the underlying holdings of the portfolio and does not remove market risk.
		"NR" or "Not Rated" indicates that no rating has been requested, that there is insufficient information on which to base a rating, or that S&P does not rate a particular obligation as a matter of policy. Futures are not rated.

              With nearly a fifth of earnings reports out, investors are divided on how early corporate reports are serving as an indicator of the overall health of the U.S. economy, and that could contribute to a volatile week as stocks linger near record highs.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks

              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.
