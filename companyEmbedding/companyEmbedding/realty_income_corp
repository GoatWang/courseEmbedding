FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

History[edit]
Realty Income Corporation was founded in 1969 by William E. Clark and Evelyn J. Clark.[5] Its first acquisition was a Taco Bell restaurant in early 1970. Initially, the company focused on acquiring properties from the Clarks’ development company, which engaged in land acquisition, construction, leasing, and sales of fast food restaurant properties.[6] The company used cash to purchase the land needed for stores that required real estate to run, and then leased the property to the stores long term. [7]
By 1992 the company had formed 22 partnerships, which controlled 628 properties and involved 68,000 individual partners. In 1994, it merged its various partnerships into a publicly traded company, listed on the New York Stock Exchange with the single letter "O" as its symbol. The company rolled all of its partnerships into one entity and issued stock to its partnership base.[8] William E. Clark, Jr., retired as CEO in 1997, succeeded by Thomas A. Lewis, who was in turn succeeded by John Case in 2013. Clark remained as chairman until 2009 and was followed by Donald R. Cameron and then Michael D. McKee who is the current Chairman of the Board.[9][10]
In 2010 the company expanded its real estate holdings to include wineries in the Napa Valley.[11] In 2012, the company announced the acquisition of American Realty Capital Trust (NASDAQ:ARCT), a publicly traded REIT founded by Nicholas Schorsch, for $3.2 billion.[12][13] The deal closed in January 2013.[14][15][16] The enterprise value of Realty Income at that time increased to $12.4 billion with an equity market capitalization of $8.4 billion.[17]
Realty Income saw its 2013 revenues rise more than 61.2% as compared to 2012.[18] In 2015 the company was included on the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index, for boosting its dividend 79 times over twenty years, and in seventy consecutive quarters.[19] In March 2015, the company was added to the S&P 500.[20]
Trademark[edit]
In 2002, Realty Income Corporation received a registered trademark for the phrase, "The Monthly Dividend Company," emphasizing its practice of paying investor dividends on a monthly, rather than quarterly, basis. As of February 2017, it has paid 559 dividends in the 48 years since its founding in 1969, and has increased the dividend 90 times since the company was listed on the NYSE in 1994, with total payouts to shareholders exceeding $4.5 billion.[21][22]
Properties and Portfolio Management[edit]
The company primarily acquires commercial properties that are freestanding, single-tenant locations, and that are leased to regional and national commercial enterprises under long-term net-lease agreements. As of its February 2017 Form 10-K filing, the company owned 4,944 properties in 49 states with about 83 million square feet of leasable space.[3]
Ratings and Awards[edit]
Realty Income Corporation was listed by Forbes Magazine as one of the "100 Most Trustworthy Companies" for 2009.[23] It was also named to the list of Mergent Dividend Achievers beginning in 2005. It has earned investment grade credit ratings from Moody’s Investor Services, Standard & Poors, and Fitch Rating Agency.[24]

History[edit]
Realty Income Corporation was founded in 1969 by William E. Clark and Evelyn J. Clark.[5] Its first acquisition was a Taco Bell restaurant in early 1970. Initially, the company focused on acquiring properties from the Clarks’ development company, which engaged in land acquisition, construction, leasing, and sales of fast food restaurant properties.[6] The company used cash to purchase the land needed for stores that required real estate to run, and then leased the property to the stores long term. [7]
By 1992 the company had formed 22 partnerships, which controlled 628 properties and involved 68,000 individual partners. In 1994, it merged its various partnerships into a publicly traded company, listed on the New York Stock Exchange with the single letter "O" as its symbol. The company rolled all of its partnerships into one entity and issued stock to its partnership base.[8] William E. Clark, Jr., retired as CEO in 1997, succeeded by Thomas A. Lewis, who was in turn succeeded by John Case in 2013. Clark remained as chairman until 2009 and was followed by Donald R. Cameron and then Michael D. McKee who is the current Chairman of the Board.[9][10]
In 2010 the company expanded its real estate holdings to include wineries in the Napa Valley.[11] In 2012, the company announced the acquisition of American Realty Capital Trust (NASDAQ:ARCT), a publicly traded REIT founded by Nicholas Schorsch, for $3.2 billion.[12][13] The deal closed in January 2013.[14][15][16] The enterprise value of Realty Income at that time increased to $12.4 billion with an equity market capitalization of $8.4 billion.[17]

That’s certainly the case with Realty Income Corp (NYSE:O). Several bearish headwinds have caused the triple-net real estate investment trust (REIT) to fall on hard times — at least that’s what its share price action would have you believe, anyway. The reality for O stock is still as rosy as ever, though.The Time to Buy Realty Income Corp (O) Stock Is NowMoreSource: ShutterstockIn that mismatched pricing, investors looking to score a high yield that is also growing like clockwork have the opportunity to buy one of the best players in the business. But, that opportunity won’t last long.The best time to buy O stock is now.What’s Going On With Realty Income?For Realty Income, the last few quarters haven’t exactly been wonderful. In case you haven’t heard, retail is dying a quick and painful death at the hands of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). Over the last few months, a variety of retailers have reported lower sales and dwindling profits as online shopping continues to grow like weeds.With that, many retailers have begun the process of rightsizing their portfolios- i.e. conducting store closures and laying off workers. Those in more dire straits have even filed for bankruptcy in the wake of rising online sales. Bankruptcy filings for retailers are up over 31% this year alone.  Apple iPhone 8 Possibly Delayed, Management Hopes New Emoji Will Keep Buyers Happy  It shouldn’t come as a surprise, those REITs that focus on the retail sector have been hit especially hard. After all, with stores closing and sales down, it stands to reason that rents will go unfilled and investors will be given the shaft.On top of this, the Federal Reserve is adding gasoline to the dumpster fire that is retail. Rising interest rates poise a problem for REITs or so the perception goes. Thanks to their tax structure, REITs kick-out much of their cash flows as dividends and thusly, have high yields. That’s great when bonds and other fixed income products are paying out 0%. But with the Fed raising rates and bonds once again getting attractive from an income point of view, REITs and their added risks are no longer seen as great.Making matters even worse for REITs is their higher than average debts tied to mortgages. As the Fed raises rates, rolling over those mortgages will be a lot more expensive as Yellen & Company keep raising.So for a retail REIT like O, you have a dying sector coupled with rising rates. And investors aren’t having any of that. Shares of Realty Income are well off of their 52-week highs and are down 19% over the last year. It’s Not That Bad at OBut here’s the thing, it’s not that bad for O to justify such a big time drop. In fact, times are actually pretty good. The secret comes down to its portfolio.O focuses on free standing real estate. We’re not talking about a strip mall, but the Taco Bell in front of the strip mall. And that’s a key distinction. Of its more than 4,900 properties, the bulk are things including everything from convenience stores and restaurants to movie theaters and automotive parts & services centers. Amazon can’t change your car’s oil or cook you a burger and fries. That puts Realty Income’s properties in a different league than say mall operator CBL & Associates Properties, Inc. (NYSE:CBL).You’re getting a portfolio of real estate that is as online-proof as it comes.Even better is that all triple-net leased. That means that tenants- not Realty Income -pay the taxes, maintenance and other fees associated with renting the property. It’s the holy grail of being a landlord and produces better margins. In the end, it allows O to distribute more cash to investors.  BP plc (BP) Considering Spinoff to Form New Energy MLP  As for the Fed, things aren’t as bad for O as they are made out to be. Like a lot of top-notch REITs, management at O saw the rate hikes coming. And with that, they’ve spent much of the last few years using the lower rates to their advantage. That meant retiring expensive and high yielding preferred stock shares and issuing long term bonds at current favorable rates. Realty Income has already prepared itself for new rate environment.Read MoreDividends Keep Rising at ODespite all the negatively and bearish reasoning from investors, O has continued to live up to its “Monthly Dividend” moniker. Cash flows and rents continue to rise at the firm and so far this year Realty Income as raised its monthly dividend 3 times. With its latest payout, it will have completed 565th consecutive monthly payout and currently yields a very respectable 4.47%.That’s clockwork-like precision. Precision that is being thrown away for some less than great reasoning. The truth is Realty Income is fine and will be fine for the foreseeable future. For investors, using the recent downturn in O stock could be a great opportunity to snag a great and growing yield.As of this writing, Aaron Levitt did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities. More From InvestorPlace  The 7 Best Buy-and-Hold “Holdings” on Wall Street    7 Stocks to Buy That Wall Street Analysts Hate    7 Safe High-Yield Dividend Stocks to Buy  The post The Time to Buy Realty Income Corp (O) Stock Is Now appeared first on InvestorPlace.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextChesapeake Energy Corporation (CHK) Stock Is a BIG Buy Under $5InvestorPlaceZuckerberg Wife's Ambitious Secret Finally ExposedUNewz.MeSponsoredWill Apple Inc.

Footnotes

(1) For years prior to 2016, total revenue includes amounts reclassified to income from discontinued operations, but excludes gain on sales, tenant reimbursements, and revenue from Crest Net Lease, a subsidiary of Realty Income. Consistent with Realty Income’s financial reporting methodology changes, 2016 total revenue includes approximately $2.3 million of revenue from Crest Net Lease
(2) Refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis for FFO and AFFO definition and reconciliation to net income available to common stockholders in the 2016 Form 10-K section. For 2012 and 2013, FFO has been adjusted to add back American Realty Capital Trust merger-related costs
(3) Does not include properties held for sale
(4) Includes new properties acquired by Realty Income and Crest Net Lease and properties under development or expansion
(5) Commercial tenants are defined as retailers with over 50 locations and non-retailers with over $500 million in annual revenues
(6) All share and per share amounts reflect the 2-for-1 stock split on December 31, 2004
(7) Annualized dividend amount reflects the December declared dividend rate per share multiplied by 12
(8) Dividend yield was calculated by dividing the dividend paid per share, during the year, by the closing share price on December 31 or the last trading day of the preceding year. Dividend yield excludes special dividends
(9) The 1994 dividend yield is based on the annualized dividends for the period from August 15, 1994 (the date of the consolidation of the
        predecessors to the Company) to December 31, 1994. The 1994 total return is based on the price change from the opening on October 18, 1994 (the Company’s first day of trading) to December 31, 1994 plus the annualized dividend yield

(10) Total return was calculated by dividing the net change in the share price, during the year, plus the dividends paid per share, during the year, by the closing share price on December 31 or the last trading day of the preceding year

Vision and Values
Realty Income was founded by William and Joan Clark in 1969 to generate monthly income for investors. From the first Taco Bell property 

acquisition in 1969 to today, we have continued to operate the company according to two key objectives:
1. Grow and maintain a reliable real estate portfolio to pay dividends to shareholders

Our real estate investment strategy is focused on owning properties net leased to tenants with a service, non-discretionary, and/or low price 

point component to their business
We target properties located in significant markets or strategic locations to ensure the viability of the real estate location for the tenant’s 

business
Our acquisitions department uncovers opportunities consistent with this strategy
Our research department uses its underwriting expertise to assess the tenants’ long-term business prospects
We seek to maintain tenant, industry and geographic diversification through our acquisitions, portfolio management and asset management 

strategies

2. Secure access to low-cost capital to support real estate acquisitions that increase earnings

We have maintained access to the public equity markets since our 1994 listing on the New York Stock Exchange
We have achieved and maintained investment grade credit ratings since 1996
Our relationships with investment and commercial banks provide continued access to capital to fund our growth
Our conservative balance sheet preserves a low cost of capital and offers financial stability throughout various economic cycles

Realty Income Becomes #23 Most Shorted S&P 500 Component, Replacing Host Hotels & Resorts
The most recent short interest data has been released for the 01/13/2017 settlement date, and we here at Dividend Channel like to sift through this fresh data and order the underlying components of the S&P 500 by "days to cover." There are a number of ways to look at short data, for example the total number of shares short; but one metric that we find particularly useful is the "days to cover" metric because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares typically traded. The number of shares short is then compared to the average daily volume, in order to calculate the total number of trading days it would take to close out all of the open short positions if every share traded represented a short position being closed.
