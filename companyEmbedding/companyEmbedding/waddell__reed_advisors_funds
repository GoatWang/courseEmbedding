An investment in a money market fund is neither insured nor guaranteed by the FDIC or any other governmental agency. Although money market funds seek to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in a money market fund.
Pricing: All prices and year-to-date returns are based on closing quotes unless noted, as supplied to the NASDAQ by 6:00 p.m. Eastern time. YTD Prices can be updated 3 to 4 hours after the Daily Pricing information which can result in mismatching data.
Please remember that an investment in a mutual fund involves risk. Investment return and principal value of a mutual fund investment will fluctuate, and shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Estimate the value of the funds and impact of fees and expenses on your investment.
30-Day SEC Yield: is calculated based on a formula mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that calculates a fund's hypothetical annualized income, as a percentage of its assets. A security's income, for the purposes of this calculation, is based on the current market yield to maturity (in the case of bonds) or projected dividend yield (for stocks) of the fund's holdings over a trailing 30 day period. This hypothetical income will differ (at times, significantly) from the fund's actual experience; as a result, income distributions from the fund may be higher or lower than implied by the SEC yield.
Unsubsidized yields reflect what the yield would have been without the effect of reimbursements and waivers. The adviser and its affiliates have or may voluntarily waive a portion of their fees (including, but not limited to, distribution and service (12b-1) fees) and reimburse certain expenses. There is no guarantee that the fund will avoid a negative yield. Such undertaking may be amended or withdrawn at any time.
12-Month Trailing Distribution Yield: at NAV refers to the 12-month historical cash flow paid over the past 12 months in dividends, divided by the past months ending NAV.
Lipper Rankings are based on average annual total returns not including sales charge for the periods indicated. Ranking is for the share class specified; other classes may have different performance characteristics. Under no circumstances does information constitute a recommendation to buy or sell mutual funds. Lipper undertakes no responsibility for updating the calculations more frequently than monthly to incorporate more current data.
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.



Class A share performance, including sales charges, reflects the maximum applicable front-end sales load of 5.75 percent, except Municipal Bond, and Municipal High Income, which have a 4.25 percent maximum sales load, and Limited-Term Bond, which has a 2.5 percent maximum sales load.
Class B share performance, including sales charges, reflects the applicable contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC), which declines from 5 percent beginning at the time of purchase to zero at the beginning of the seventh year.
For Class C shares, a 1 percent CDSC applies to the lesser of amount invested or redemption value of shares redeemed within twelve months after the purchase date.
Class Y shares are not subject to sales charges. Performance at net asset value (NAV) does not include the effect of sales charges.

Data quoted is past performance and current performance may be lower or higher. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate, and shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.Risk Factors: The value of the Fund's shares will change, and you could lose money on your investment. Investing in companies involved primarily in a single asset class (large cap) may be more risky and volatile than an investment with greater diversification. An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. These and other risks are more fully described in the Fund's prospectus. Not all funds or fund classes may be offered at all broker/dealers.
Index Description: The Russell 1000 Growth Index measures the performance of the large-cap growth segment of the U.S. equity universe. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.
Performance results for some funds may include the effect of expense reduction arrangements. If those arrangements had not been in place, the performance results would have been lower.
Fee Waiver and/or Expense Reimbursement: Through October 31, 2017, Waddell & Reed Investment Management Company (WRIMCO), the Fund’s investment manager, Waddell & Reed, Inc. (Waddell & Reed), the Fund’s distributor, and / or Waddell & Reed Services Company, doing business as WI Services Company (WISC), the Fund’s transfer agent, have contractually agreed to reimburse sufficient management fees, 12b-1 fees and / or shareholder servicing fees to cap the total annual ordinary fund operating expenses as follows: Class A shares at 2.31%, Class B shares at 2.12%, Class C shares at 0.87%. Prior to that date, the expense limitation may not be terminated by WRIMCO, Waddell & Reed, WISC or the Board of Trustees.
Pricing: All prices and year-to-date returns are based on closing quotes unless noted, as supplied to the NASDAQ by 6:00 p.m. Eastern time. YTD Prices can be updated 3 to 4 hours after the Daily Pricing information which can result in mismatching data.
Style Analysis: The Morningstar Style Box reveals a fund's investment style. For equity funds the vertical axis shows the market capitalization of the stocks owned and the horizontal axis shows investment style (value, blend, or growth). For fixed-income funds, the vertical axis shows the credit quality of the bonds owned and the horizontal axis shows interest rate sensitivity as measured by a bond's effective duration. Morningstar seeks credit rating information from fund companies on a periodic basis (e.g., quarterly). In compiling credit rating information, Morningstar instructs fund companies to only use ratings that have been assigned by the following Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (NRSROs): Moody's, Standard & Poor's, Fitch, and Egan-Jones. If two NRSROs have rated a security, fund companies are to report the lowest rating; if three or more NRSROs have rated the same security differently, fund companies are to report the rating that is in the middle. For example, if NRSRO X rates a security AA-, NRSRO Y rates the same security an A and NRSRO Z rates it a BBB+, the fund company should use the credit rating of 'A' in its reporting to Morningstar. PLEASE NOTE: Morningstar, Inc. is not itself an NRSRO nor does it issue a credit rating on the fund. An NRSRO rating on a fixed-income security can change from time-to-time. For credit quality, Morningstar combines the credit rating information provided by the fund companies with an average default rate calculation to come up with a weighted-average credit quality. The weighted-average credit quality is currently a letter that roughly corresponds to the scale used by a leading NRSRO. Bond funds are assigned a style box placement of "low", "medium", or "high" based on their average credit quality. Funds with a low credit quality are those whose weighted-average credit quality is determined to be less than "BBB-"; medium are those less than "AA-", but greater or equal to "BBB-"; and high are those with a weighted-average credit quality of "AA-" or higher. When classifying a bond portfolio, Morningstar first maps the NRSRO credit ratings of the underlying holdings to their respective default rates (as determined by Morningstar's analysis of actual historical default rates). Morningstar then averages these default rates to determine the average default rate for the entire bond fund. Finally, Morningstar maps this average default rate to its corresponding credit rating along a convex curve. For interest-rate sensitivity, Morningstar obtains from fund companies the average effective duration. Generally, Morningstar classifies a fixed-income fund's interest-rate sensitivity based on the effective duration of the Morningstar Core Bond Index (MCBI), which is currently three years. The classification of Limited will be assigned to those funds whose average effective duration is between 25% to 75% of MCBI's average effective duration; funds whose average effective duration is between 75% to 125% of the MCBI will be classified as Moderate; and those that are at 125% or greater of the average effective duration of the MCBI will be classified as Extensive. For municipal bond funds, Morningstar also obtains from fund companies the average effective duration. In these cases static breakpoints are utilized. These breakpoints are as follows: (i) Limited: 4.5 years or less; (ii) Moderate: more than 4.5 years but less than 7 years; and (iii) Extensive: more than 7 years. In addition, for non-US taxable and non-US domiciled fixed income funds static duration breakpoints are used: (i) Limited: less than or equal to 3.5 years; (ii) Moderate: greater than 3.5 and less than equal to 6 years; (iii) Extensive: greater than 6 years.
Unsubsidized yields reflect what the yield would have been without the effect of reimbursements and waivers. The adviser and its affiliates have or may voluntarily waive a portion of their fees (including, but not limited to, distribution and service (12b-1) fees) and reimburse certain expenses. There is no guarantee that the fund will avoid a negative yield. Such undertaking may be amended or withdrawn at any time. 
12-Month Trailing Distribution Yield: at NAV refers to the 12-month historical cash flow paid over the past 12 months in dividends, divided by the past months ending NAV. 
Alpha, Beta, R-Squared, Standard Deviation, Sharpe Ratio and Capture Ratio are 5 year statistics. Alpha is a measure of a fund's actual returns and expected performance, given its level of risk (as measured by beta). Beta reflects the sensitivity of the fund's return to fluctuations in the market index. R-squared indicates how much of a fund's fluctuations were attributable to movements in the fund's benchmark. Standard deviation is a measure of how volatile a fund's returns are. Sharpe ratio is a measure of a fund's risk-adjusted performance. Capture ratio reflects the annualized product of fund vs. index returns for all months in which the index had a positive return (upside capture) or negative return (downside capture).
The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance, and does not include the effects of sales charges. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.  © 2017 Morningstar, Inc.

Data quoted is past performance and current performance may be lower or higher. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate, and shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.Risk Factors: The value of the Fund’s shares will change, and you could lose money on your investment. The value of a security believed by the Fund’s manager to be undervalued may never reach what the manager believes to be its full value, or such security’s value may decrease. An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Not all funds or fund classes may be offered at all broker/dealers. These and other risks are more fully described in the Fund’s prospectus.
Index Description: Russell 1000 Value is an unmanaged index comprised of securities that represent the large cap sector of the stock market. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.
Performance results for some funds may include the effect of expense reduction arrangements. If those arrangements had not been in place, the performance results would have been lower.
Fee Waiver and/or Expense Reimbursement: Through October 31, 2017, Waddell & Reed Investment Management Company (WRIMCO), the Fund’s investment manager, Waddell & Reed, Inc. (Waddell & Reed), the Fund’s distributor, and / or Waddell & Reed Services Company, doing business as WI Services Company (WISC), the Fund’s transfer agent, have contractually agreed to reimburse sufficient management fees, 12b-1 fees and / or shareholder servicing fees to cap the total annual ordinary fund operating expenses as follows: Class A shares at 1.22%, Class B shares at 2.50%,  Class C shares at 2.13%, and Class Y at 0.92%. Prior to that date, the expense limitation may not be terminated by WRIMCO, Waddell & Reed, WISC or the Board of Trustees.
Pricing: All prices and year-to-date returns are based on closing quotes unless noted, as supplied to the NASDAQ by 6:00 p.m. Eastern time. YTD Prices can be updated 3 to 4 hours after the Daily Pricing information which can result in mismatching data.
Style Analysis: The Morningstar Style Box reveals a fund's investment style. For equity funds the vertical axis shows the market capitalization of the stocks owned and the horizontal axis shows investment style (value, blend, or growth). For fixed-income funds, the vertical axis shows the credit quality of the bonds owned and the horizontal axis shows interest rate sensitivity as measured by a bond's effective duration. Morningstar seeks credit rating information from fund companies on a periodic basis (e.g., quarterly). In compiling credit rating information, Morningstar instructs fund companies to only use ratings that have been assigned by the following Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (NRSROs): Moody's, Standard & Poor's, Fitch, and Egan-Jones. If two NRSROs have rated a security, fund companies are to report the lowest rating; if three or more NRSROs have rated the same security differently, fund companies are to report the rating that is in the middle. For example, if NRSRO X rates a security AA-, NRSRO Y rates the same security an A and NRSRO Z rates it a BBB+, the fund company should use the credit rating of 'A' in its reporting to Morningstar. PLEASE NOTE: Morningstar, Inc. is not itself an NRSRO nor does it issue a credit rating on the fund. An NRSRO rating on a fixed-income security can change from time-to-time. For credit quality, Morningstar combines the credit rating information provided by the fund companies with an average default rate calculation to come up with a weighted-average credit quality. The weighted-average credit quality is currently a letter that roughly corresponds to the scale used by a leading NRSRO. Bond funds are assigned a style box placement of "low", "medium", or "high" based on their average credit quality. Funds with a low credit quality are those whose weighted-average credit quality is determined to be less than "BBB-"; medium are those less than "AA-", but greater or equal to "BBB-"; and high are those with a weighted-average credit quality of "AA-" or higher. When classifying a bond portfolio, Morningstar first maps the NRSRO credit ratings of the underlying holdings to their respective default rates (as determined by Morningstar's analysis of actual historical default rates). Morningstar then averages these default rates to determine the average default rate for the entire bond fund. Finally, Morningstar maps this average default rate to its corresponding credit rating along a convex curve. For interest-rate sensitivity, Morningstar obtains from fund companies the average effective duration. Generally, Morningstar classifies a fixed-income fund's interest-rate sensitivity based on the effective duration of the Morningstar Core Bond Index (MCBI), which is currently three years. The classification of Limited will be assigned to those funds whose average effective duration is between 25% to 75% of MCBI's average effective duration; funds whose average effective duration is between 75% to 125% of the MCBI will be classified as Moderate; and those that are at 125% or greater of the average effective duration of the MCBI will be classified as Extensive. For municipal bond funds, Morningstar also obtains from fund companies the average effective duration. In these cases static breakpoints are utilized. These breakpoints are as follows: (i) Limited: 4.5 years or less; (ii) Moderate: more than 4.5 years but less than 7 years; and (iii) Extensive: more than 7 years. In addition, for non-US taxable and non-US domiciled fixed income funds static duration breakpoints are used: (i) Limited: less than or equal to 3.5 years; (ii) Moderate: greater than 3.5 and less than equal to 6 years; (iii) Extensive: greater than 6 years.
Unsubsidized yields reflect what the yield would have been without the effect of reimbursements and waivers. The adviser and its affiliates have or may voluntarily waive a portion of their fees (including, but not limited to, distribution and service (12b-1) fees) and reimburse certain expenses. There is no guarantee that the fund will avoid a negative yield. Such undertaking may be amended or withdrawn at any time. 
12-Month Trailing Distribution Yield: at NAV refers to the 12-month historical cash flow paid over the past 12 months in dividends, divided by the past months ending NAV. 
Alpha, Beta, R-Squared, Standard Deviation, Sharpe Ratio and Capture Ratio are 5 year statistics. Alpha is a measure of a fund's actual returns and expected performance, given its level of risk (as measured by beta). Beta reflects the sensitivity of the fund's return to fluctuations in the market index. R-squared indicates how much of a fund's fluctuations were attributable to movements in the fund's benchmark. Standard deviation is a measure of how volatile a fund's returns are. Sharpe ratio is a measure of a fund's risk-adjusted performance. Capture ratio reflects the annualized product of fund vs. index returns for all months in which the index had a positive return (upside capture) or negative return (downside capture).
The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance, and does not include the effects of sales charges. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.  © 2017 Morningstar, Inc.

Data quoted is past performance and current performance may be lower or higher. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate, and shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.Risk Factors: The value of the Fund's shares will change, and you could lose money on your investment. An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. International investing involves additional risks, including currency fluctuations, political or economic conditions affecting the foreign country, and differences in accounting standards and foreign regulations. Fixed income securities are subject to interest rate risk and, as such, the net asset value of the fund may fall as interest rates rise. Investing in below investment grade securities may carry a greater risk of nonpayment of interest or principal than higher-rated bonds. Loans (including loan assignments, loan participations and other loan instruments) carry other risks, including the risk of insolvency of the lending bank or other intermediary. Loans may be unsecured or not fully collateralized may be subject to restrictions on resale and sometimes trade infrequently on the secondary market. These and other risks are more fully described in the fund's prospectus. Not all funds or fund classes may be offered at all broker/dealers.
Index Description: The Bloomberg Barclays Multiverse TR USD  - The Barclays Multiverse Index is an unmanaged index comprised of securities that represent the global bond market. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.
Performance results for some funds may include the effect of expense reduction arrangements. If those arrangements had not been in place, the performance results would have been lower.
Fee Waiver and/or Expense Reimbursement:  Through January 31, 2018, Waddell & Reed Investment Management Company (WRIMCO), the Fund’s investment manager, Waddell & Reed, Inc. (Waddell & Reed), the Fund’s distributor, and / or Waddell & Reed Services Company, doing business as WI Services Company (WISC), the Fund’s transfer agent, have contractually agreed to reimburse sufficient management fees, 12b-1 fees and / or shareholder servicing fees to cap the total annual ordinary fund operating expenses as follows: Class A shares at 1.15%, Class B shares at 2.50%, Class C shares at 2.03%, and Class Y at 0.83%. Prior to that date, the expense limitation may not be terminated by WRIMCO, Waddell & Reed, WISC or the Board of Trustees.
Performance data represents periods prior to changes in the fund's name, strategies and policies (effective 9/18/00) during which the fund sought to achieve its goals by investing primarily in junk bonds, with minimal investments in foreign securities. Accordingly, the performance information for periods prior to that date reflects the operation of the Fund under its former investment strategies and related policies.
Pricing: All prices and year-to-date returns are based on closing quotes unless noted, as supplied to the NASDAQ by 6:00 p.m. Eastern time. YTD Prices can be updated 3 to 4 hours after the Daily Pricing information which can result in mismatching data.
Style Analysis: The Morningstar Style Box reveals a fund's investment style. For equity funds the vertical axis shows the market capitalization of the stocks owned and the horizontal axis shows investment style (value, blend, or growth). For fixed-income funds, the vertical axis shows the credit quality of the bonds owned and the horizontal axis shows interest rate sensitivity as measured by a bond's effective duration. Morningstar seeks credit rating information from fund companies on a periodic basis (e.g., quarterly). In compiling credit rating information, Morningstar instructs fund companies to only use ratings that have been assigned by the following Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (NRSROs): Moody's, Standard & Poor's, Fitch, and Egan-Jones. If two NRSROs have rated a security, fund companies are to report the lowest rating; if three or more NRSROs have rated the same security differently, fund companies are to report the rating that is in the middle. For example, if NRSRO X rates a security AA-, NRSRO Y rates the same security an A and NRSRO Z rates it a BBB+, the fund company should use the credit rating of 'A' in its reporting to Morningstar. PLEASE NOTE: Morningstar, Inc. is not itself an NRSRO nor does it issue a credit rating on the fund. An NRSRO rating on a fixed-income security can change from time-to-time. For credit quality, Morningstar combines the credit rating information provided by the fund companies with an average default rate calculation to come up with a weighted-average credit quality. The weighted-average credit quality is currently a letter that roughly corresponds to the scale used by a leading NRSRO. Bond funds are assigned a style box placement of "low", "medium", or "high" based on their average credit quality. Funds with a low credit quality are those whose weighted-average credit quality is determined to be less than "BBB-"; medium are those less than "AA-", but greater or equal to "BBB-"; and high are those with a weighted-average credit quality of "AA-" or higher. When classifying a bond portfolio, Morningstar first maps the NRSRO credit ratings of the underlying holdings to their respective default rates (as determined by Morningstar's analysis of actual historical default rates). Morningstar then averages these default rates to determine the average default rate for the entire bond fund. Finally, Morningstar maps this average default rate to its corresponding credit rating along a convex curve. For interest-rate sensitivity, Morningstar obtains from fund companies the average effective duration. Generally, Morningstar classifies a fixed-income fund's interest-rate sensitivity based on the effective duration of the Morningstar Core Bond Index (MCBI), which is currently three years. The classification of Limited will be assigned to those funds whose average effective duration is between 25% to 75% of MCBI's average effective duration; funds whose average effective duration is between 75% to 125% of the MCBI will be classified as Moderate; and those that are at 125% or greater of the average effective duration of the MCBI will be classified as Extensive. For municipal bond funds, Morningstar also obtains from fund companies the average effective duration. In these cases static breakpoints are utilized. These breakpoints are as follows: (i) Limited: 4.5 years or less; (ii) Moderate: more than 4.5 years but less than 7 years; and (iii) Extensive: more than 7 years. In addition, for non-US taxable and non-US domiciled fixed income funds static duration breakpoints are used: (i) Limited: less than or equal to 3.5 years; (ii) Moderate: greater than 3.5 and less than equal to 6 years; (iii) Extensive: greater than 6 years.
Unsubsidized yields reflect what the yield would have been without the effect of reimbursements and waivers. The adviser and its affiliates have or may voluntarily waive a portion of their fees (including, but not limited to, distribution and service (12b-1) fees) and reimburse certain expenses. There is no guarantee that the fund will avoid a negative yield. Such undertaking may be amended or withdrawn at any time. 
30-Day SEC Yield: is calculated based on a formula mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that calculates a fund's hypothetical annualized income, as a percentage of its assets. A security's income, for the purposes of this calculation, is based on the current market yield to maturity (in the case of bonds) or projected dividend yield (for stocks) of the fund's holdings over a trailing 30 day period. This hypothetical income will differ (at times, significantly) from the fund's actual experience; as a result, income distributions from the fund may be higher or lower than implied by the SEC yield.
12-Month Trailing Distribution Yield: at NAV refers to the 12-month historical cash flow paid over the past 12 months in dividends, divided by the past months ending NAV. 
Alpha, Beta, R-Squared, Standard Deviation, Sharpe Ratio and Capture Ratio are 5 year statistics. Alpha is a measure of a fund's actual returns and expected performance, given its level of risk (as measured by beta). Beta reflects the sensitivity of the fund's return to fluctuations in the market index. R-squared indicates how much of a fund's fluctuations were attributable to movements in the fund's benchmark. Standard deviation is a measure of how volatile a fund's returns are. Sharpe ratio is a measure of a fund's risk-adjusted performance. Capture ratio reflects the annualized product of fund vs. index returns for all months in which the index had a positive return (upside capture) or negative return (downside capture).
The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance, and does not include the effects of sales charges. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.  © 2017 Morningstar, Inc.

Quarterly Fund Commentary


Waddell & Reed Advisors International Growth Fund

 




04.05.13 
















Market Sector Update
Equities continued to perform well during the quarter despite a number of negative risk events in Europe – the Cypriot financial crisis, inconclusive election results in Italy, and countries reporting slowing economic data. Despite these hardships, central banks remained very accommodative and provided support for equity prices.  In Japan, new leadership implemented monetary easing policies in an effort to get the country out of its long-term economic slump. Fueled by these efforts, the yen weakened significantly and Japanese equity markets rallied in the quarter.  Both the U.S. stock market and U.S. dollar experienced a strong rally during the first quarter of 2013, driven primarily by market stability and growth. Consequently, the strengthening U.S. dollar led to a selloff in emerging markets, as liquidity flew back to the U.S. market.  In Asia, investors were disappointed by weaker-than-expected economic data from China and India. Economic recovery in China continued, albeit at a slower pace than expected. Meanwhile, the coalition government in India appears to be fracturing, resulting in the market downturn, as much-needed government reforms were pushed farther into the future.
Portfolio Strategy
The Fund underperformed the benchmark for the period. Stock selection was the primary deterrent to performance, where holdings in industrials, information technology and consumer discretionary were the largest relative detractors. While sector allocation was better, an underweight in the well-performing consumer discretionary sector as well as an allocation to cash was a drag on performance.  While the Fund had increased its Japanese equity weighting and properly hedged part of its yen exposure, the Fund had not done enough of either. Japanese stocks surged on the dramatic shift in policy and benefited greatly from the weakening yen. The Fund was simply too tentative to properly take advantage.  Aggressive monetary easing policies implemented in Japan adversely affected holdings in China and India as well. The weakening of the Japanese yen resulted in increased money flows to Japan as investors chased stock performance. Consequently, interest in China and India waned, unfavorably affecting stock performance in those regions.  The Fund’s underweight position and strong stock selection within the materials sector added to performance.

Outlook
It is difficult to know if the market is comfortable with massive and growing government debt loads, such as in Japan, the U.S., and Europe, given that officials have proven they will continually attempt to sustain markets through aggressive monetary and fiscal policy.  Assuming the (latest) Japanese experiment continues successfully, that market should remain strong in yen terms. Anecdotally, the low yields and promise of a weakening currency are currently leading flows into higheryielding markets. This likely includes a variety of emerging and also somewhat troubled bond markets – likely Brazil and Indonesia, but also possibly Spain and Portugal.  The distortion of rates, especially in the U.S. and Japan, has led to a global search for yield. We believe this is supportive for equities, as many stocks provide reasonable yields and will likely provide protection from eventual inflation.


The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the Fund's manager and are current through March 31, 2013. The manager’s views are subject to change at any time based on market and other conditions, and no forecasts can be guaranteed. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

      active product lineup, and they are differentiated styles, outside of
      what we believe are more commoditized passive asset classes commonly
      available elsewhere,” he added. “For example, the S&P 500 Bond Index
      Fund, tracking bonds of the index’s companies, will be the first index
      mutual fund with this strategy to this point.”
    

      Index funds typically are a cost-effective way for investors to track a
      benchmark index, meaning returns to index funds, over time, generally
      should mirror returns of their tracking index, minus any fund expenses.
      The divergence between the net returns of an index fund and its tracking
      index is referred to as “tracking error.” IICO and ProShares intend to
      monitor continually the performance and tracking error of the proposed
      Ivy ProShares Index Funds to seek to ensure investors' expectations are
      properly addressed, according to Ivy executives.
    

      Share class and expense information will be available as the funds
      become effective.
