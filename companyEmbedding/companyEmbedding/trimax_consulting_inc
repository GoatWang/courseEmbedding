(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Forward-Looking Statements  This Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These statements include those concerning the following: Our intentions, beliefs and expectations regarding the fair value of all assets and liabilities recorded; our strategies; growth opportunities; product development and introduction relating to new and existing products; the enterprise market and related opportunities; competition and competitive advantages and disadvantages; industry standards and compatibility of our products; relationships with our employees; our facilities, operating lease and our ability to secure additional space; cash dividends; excess inventory, our expenses; interest and other income; our beliefs and expectations about our future success and results; our operating results; our belief that our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements, our expectations regarding our revenues and customers; investments and interest rates. These statements are subject to risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially.  The Company undertakes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this Form 10-Q.  Critical Accounting Policies  The financial statements and accompanying footnotes included in this report has been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States with certain amounts based on management's best estimates and judgments. To determine appropriate carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources, management uses assumptions based on historical results and other factors they believe are reasonable.  Our critical accounting policies are described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2016.  Trends and Uncertainties  Demand for the registrant's products are dependent on general economic conditions, which are cyclical in nature. Because a major portion of our activities are the receipt of revenues from our services and products, our business operations may be adversely affected by competitors and prolonged recessionary periods.  There are no other known trends, events or uncertainties that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material impact on our short term or long term liquidity. Sources of liquidity will come from the sale of our products and services. There are no material  Table of Contents  commitments for capital expenditure at this time. There are no trends, events or uncertainties that have had or are reasonably expected to have a material impact on the net sales or revenues or income from continuing operations. There are no significant elements of income or loss that do not arise from the registrant's continuing operations. There are no other known causes for any material changes from period to period in one or more line items of our financial statements.  We currently have operations planned through December 31, 2016.  Capital and Sources of Liquidity  We have $9,109 in cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2016. We believe that our cash on hand and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to conduct operations through December 31, 2016.  For the three months ended March 31, 2016, we had a net loss of $10,081, resulting in net cash used in operating activities of $10,081 for the period.  For the three months ended March 31, 2015, we had a net income of $4,950. We had a decrease in deferred revenue of $1,000, resulting in net cash provided by operating activities of $3,950 for the period.  For the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, we made an investment in land of $2,000, resulting in net cash used by investing activities of $2,000 for both periods.  We did not pursue any financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2016 or 2015.  Results of Operations  For the three months ended March 31, 2016, we did not recognize any revenues.  For the three months ended March 31, 2015, we recognized revenues of $5,500. We paid operating expenses of $550, resulting in a net income of $4,950 for the period.  The $15,031 difference between the net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and the net income for the period ended March 31, 2015 is a direct result of the extra expenses that are incurred in starting a business, combined with the reduced revenue that comes as part of being a start-up business. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resource and possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases in products.  Table of Contents  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  The registrant had no material off-balance sheet arrangements as of March 31, 2016.  Contractual Obligations  The registrant has no material contractual obligations  May 16, 2016  (c) 1995-2016 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

NOTES TO
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

SEPTEMBER
30, 2016 AND 2015

(UNAUDITED)

 

Note 1.
    Organization, History and
Business

 

Trimax
Consulting, Inc. (“the Company”) was incorporated in
Nevada on May 19, 2014. The Company was established for the purpose
of real estate consulting and the purchasing of Tax
Liens

 

Note 2.
    Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies

  

Revenue
Recognition

 

Revenue
is derived from sales of products to distributors and consumers.
Revenue is recognized in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin
(“SAB”) No. 101, “Revenue Recognition in
Financial Statements,” as revised by SAB No. 104. As such,
the Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists, title transfer has occurred, the price is fixed
or readily determinable, and collectability is probable. Sales are
recorded net of sales discounts and terms are recorded by
contract.

 

Accounts
Receivable

 

Accounts
receivable is reported at the customers’ outstanding
balances, less any allowance for doubtful accounts.  Interest
is not accrued on overdue accounts receivable.

 

Allowance
for Doubtful Accounts

 

An
allowance for doubtful accounts on accounts receivable is charged
to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for
uncollectible accounts at a level management believes is adequate
to cover any probable losses.  Management determines the
adequacy of the allowance based on historical write-off percentages
and information collected from individual customers.  Accounts
receivable are charged off against the allowance when
collectability is determined to be permanently impaired.

 

Stock
Based Compensation

 

When
applicable, the Company will account for stock-based payments to
employees in accordance with ASC 718, “Stock
Compensation” (“ASC 718”).  Stock-based
payments to employees include grants of stock, grants of stock
options and issuance of warrants that are recognized in the
consolidated statement of operations based on their fair values at
the date of grant.

 




7

 

  

The
Company accounts for stock-based payments to non-employees in
accordance with ASC 505-50, “Equity-Based Payments to
Non-Employees.”  Stock-based payments to non-employees
include grants of stock, grants of stock options and issuances of
warrants that are recognized in the consolidated statement of
operations based on the value of the vested portion of the award
over the requisite service period as measured at its then-current
fair value as of each financial reporting date.

 

The
Company calculates the fair value of option grants and warrant
issuances utilizing the Binomial pricing model.  The amount of
stock-based compensation recognized during a period is based on the
value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to
vest.  ASC 718 requires forfeitures to be estimated at the
time stock options are granted and warrants are issued to employees
and non-employees, and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods
if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.  The term
“forfeitures” is distinct from
“cancellations” or “expirations” and
represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered stock
option or warrant.  The Company estimates forfeiture rates for
all unvested awards when calculating the expense for the period.
 In estimating the forfeiture rate, the Company monitors both
stock option and warrant exercises as well as employee termination
patterns.  The resulting stock-based compensation expense for
both employee and non-employee awards is generally recognized on a
straight-line basis over the period in which the Company expects to
receive the benefit, which is generally the vesting
period.

 

Loss per
Share

 

The
Company reports earnings (loss) per share in accordance with ASC
Topic 260-10, "Earnings per Share." Basic earnings (loss) per share
is computed by dividing income (loss) available to common
shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares
available. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed similar to
basic earnings (loss) per share except that the denominator is
increased to include the number of additional common shares that
would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been
issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. Diluted
earnings (loss) per share has not been presented since there are no
dilutive securities.

 

Cash and
Cash Equivalents

 

For
purpose of the statements of cash flows, the Company considers cash
and cash equivalents to include all stable, highly liquid
investments with maturities of three months or less.

 

Concentration
of Credit Risk

 

The
Company primarily transacts its business with one financial
institution. The amount on deposit in that one institution may from
time to time exceed the federally-insured limit.

  




8

 

  

Use of
Estimates

 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

 

Business
segments

 

ASC 280,
“Segment Reporting” requires use of the
“management approach” model for segment reporting. The
management approach model is based on the way a company’s
management organizes segments within the company for making
operating decisions and assessing performance. The Company
determined it has one operating segment as of September 30,
2016.

 

Investment
in Real Property Tax Liens – The investments in real property
tax liens are accounted for as investments in troubled debt and are
carried at cost. Collection of interest, penalties and expense
reimbursements is not certain and is recognized upon being
realized. The Company has evaluated the collectability of the tax
liens and believes the investments are realizable over time as the
first position liens are secured by the related real property and
the estimated fair value of the real property is in excess of the
carrying value of the tax liens and the estimated cost to foreclose
and sell the real property. Therefore no impairment was recognized
on the tax liens as of September 30, 2016.

 

Income
Taxes

 

The
Company accounts for its income taxes under the provisions of ASC
Topic 740, “Income Taxes.” The method of accounting for
income taxes under ASC 740 is an asset and liability method. The
asset and liability method requires the recognition of deferred tax
liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of
temporary differences between tax bases and financial reporting
bases of other assets and liabilities.

 

Emerging
growth Company

 

We are an
“emerging growth company” as that term is used in the
Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS
Act”) and, as such, may elect to comply with certain reduced
public company reporting requirements for future
filings.

10, 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No.
2014-10, Development Stage Entities (Topic 915) – Elimination
of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements, Including an Amendment
to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810, Consolidation,
which eliminates the concept of a development stage entity (DSE) in
its entirety from current accounting guidance. The Company has
elected early adoption of this new standard.

 

The
Company has implemented all other new accounting pronouncements
that are in effect and that may impact its consolidated financial
statements and does not believe that there are any other new
accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a
material impact on its financial position or results of
operations.

 

Note 3.
  Income Taxes

 

Deferred
income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually for
differences between financial statement and tax bases of assets and
liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in
the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the
periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable
income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to
reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
Income tax expense is the tax payable or refundable for the period
plus or minus the change during the period in deferred tax assets
and liabilities.

 

The
effective tax rate on the net loss before income taxes differs from
the U.S. statutory rate as follows:

  




 



 



 





 



9/30/2016

On an
interim basis, the Company had no net operating losses and has
$19,054 available to offset future income for income tax reporting
purposes, which will expire in various years through 2032, if not
previously utilized. However, the Company’s ability to use
the carryover net operating loss may be substantially limited or
eliminated pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 382.The
Company adopted the provisions of ASC 740-10-50, formerly FIN 48,
and “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes”. The
Company had no material unrecognized income tax assets or
liabilities as of September 30, 2016.

 

The
Company’s policy regarding income tax interest and penalties
is to expense those items as general and administrative expense but
to identify them for tax purposes. During the period May 19,

The above figures represent only estimated costs. This expected use of net
proceeds from this offering represents our intentions based upon our current
plans and business conditions. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures
may vary significantly depending on numerous factors, including the status of
and results from operations. As a result, our management will retain broad
discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this offering. We may
find it necessary or advisable to use the net proceeds from this offering for
other purposes, and we will have broad discretion in the application of net
proceeds from this offering. Furthermore, we anticipate that we will need to
secure additional funding for the fully implement our business plan.

In the event we are not successful in selling all of the securities we would
utilize any available funds raised in the following order of priority:

. for general and administrative expenses, including legal and accounting fees   
  and administrative support expenses incurred in connection with our reporting  
  obligations with the SEC;

. for sales and marketing;

. office lease expenses and office equipment; and

. salaries for our Chief Executive Officer and the hiring of 1-2 additional full 
  time employees

Our current corporate offices are located at 319 S. Robertson Blvd, 2nd Floor,
Beverly Hills, CA 90211. Our telephone number is (855) 777-5666. These offices
are provided free of charge by Oeshadebie Toelaram-Waterford, our Chief
Executive Officer. Ms. Toelaram-Waterford personally lease the office space and
currently offers the space to the Company as its corporate office free of
charge. If we are able to raise sufficient capital through this offering, we
will seek to lease a larger, dedicated space at no more than $1,500 per month.


We have limited competition in the tax certificate and tax lien consulting 
industry. Our largest national competitors are in the realtor services industry 
include franchisees of Century 21, Prudential, GMAC Real Estate, and RE/MAX 
insomuch that they are the largest source of all real estate investment 
opportunities.  All of these companies may have greater financial resources than
we do, including greater marketing and technology budgets. We also compete with 
smaller regional and local realtor companies and independent realtors.  Realtors
compete for business primarily on the basis of services offered, reputation, 
personal contacts, and realtor commission. We may have to reduce the fees we 
charge our clients to be competitive with those charged by competitors, which 
may accelerate if market conditions deteriorate.


Company Description
The Company is principally engaged in the business of marketing an array of 
property tax lien services including (a) identifying property tax lien 
auctions and property tax liens for sale; (b) providing valuation services 
with regards to real property subject to property tax liens; and 
(c)


 providing consultative and advisory services to property tax lien
investors in regards to purchasing property tax liens, servicing property 
tax liens and adjudicating property tax liens.

The Company has limited historical operations. Since its inception on May 
19, 2014, the Chief Executive Officer has focused her efforts on identifying
third parties who may want to use our tax lien consulting services and 
creating a marketing program for communicating with such parties.

Our Chief Executive Officer is currently focused on identifying property 
tax liens for sale and providing a valuation of the underlying properties 
to determine profit opportunities. The Company has entered into an 
agreement with one party, Innovation Consulting Worldwide, LLC to provide
our services to the company. Our Chief Executive Officer has likewise been
actively engaged in servicing that contract by providing Innovation with
information regarding future property tax auctions and by further
identifying particular properties that may present a sizable profit
opportunity for Innovation.

	Halcón Resources Corporation





	         



	Offer to Exchange up to $400,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 9.75% Senior Notes due 2020 for up to $400,000,000
	aggregate principal amount of 9.75% Senior Notes due 2020 which have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933; and





	         



	Offer to Exchange up to $400,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 9.25% Senior Notes due 2022 for up to $400,000,000 aggregate principal
	amount of 9.25% Senior Notes due 2022 which have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933



















	         We are offering to exchange $400,000,000 aggregate principal amount of our outstanding, unregistered 9.75% Senior Notes due 2020 (the "old 2020 notes") for an
	equivalent amount of registered 9.75% Senior Notes due 2020 (the "new 2020 notes") and $400,000,000 aggregate principal amount of our outstanding, unregistered 9.25% Senior Notes due 2022 (the "old
	2022 notes" and collectively with the old 2020 notes, the "old notes") for an equivalent amount of registered 9.25% Senior Notes due 2022 (the "new 2022 notes" and collectively with the new 2020
	notes, the "new notes"). The old notes and the new notes are sometimes referred to in this prospectus together as the "notes."





	Terms of the New Notes Offered in the Exchange Offers:







	




	The terms of the new notes are identical to the terms of the old notes, except that the new notes will be registered under
	the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") and will not contain restrictions on transfer, registration rights or provisions for payment of additional interest in case of
	non-registration.







	Terms of the Exchange Offers:







	




	We will exchange the new notes for all outstanding old notes of the same series that are validly tendered and not withdrawn
	prior to the expiration or termination of the exchange offers.








	




	The exchange offers expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on May 22, 2014, unless extended.








	




	Tenders of old notes may be withdrawn at any time prior to the expiration of the exchange offers.








	




	The exchange of new notes for old notes will not be a taxable event for U.S. federal income tax purposes.








	




	The old notes are, and the new notes will be, guaranteed by each of our existing and future domestic restricted
	subsidiaries.






	         There
	is no established trading market for the new notes.




	         Each
	broker-dealer that receives new notes for its own account pursuant to the exchange offers must acknowledge that it will deliver a prospectus in connection with any resale of such
	new notes. The accompanying letter of transmittal relating to the exchange offers states that by so acknowledging and by delivering a prospectus, a broker-dealer will not be deemed to admit that it is
	an "underwriter" within the meaning of the Securities Act. This prospectus, as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, may be used by a broker-dealer in connection with resales of new
	notes received in exchange for old notes where such old notes were acquired by such broker-dealer as a result of market-making activities or other trading activities. We have agreed that, for a period
	of up to 180 days after the expiration date, we will make this prospectus available to any broker-dealer for use in connection with any such resale. See "Plan of Distribution."
















	         



	You should carefully consider the risk factors beginning on page 14 of this prospectus before participating in the exchange
	offers.

















	         



	Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities commission has approved or disapproved of these securities or determined if this prospectus

	PROSPECTUS SUMMARY






	        



	This summary does not contain all the information that may be important to you. You should read the following
	summary together with the more detailed information appearing elsewhere in or incorporated by reference in this prospectus, including the section titled "Risk Factors" and the financial statements and
	related notes incorporated by reference herein.





	        



	All references to the "notes" refer to both the old notes and the new notes, except as otherwise indicated.













	Our Company






	        Halcón Resources Corporation is an independent energy company focused on the acquisition, production, exploration and
	development of onshore liquids-rich oil and natural gas assets in the United States. We were incorporated in Delaware on February 5, 2004 and were recapitalized on February 8, 2012.
	During 2012, we focused our efforts on the acquisition of unevaluated leasehold and producing properties in selected prospect areas, providing us with an extensive drilling inventory in multiple
	basins that we believe allow for multiple years of production growth and broad flexibility to direct our capital resources to projects with the greatest potential returns. During 2013, we focused on
	the development of acquired properties and also divested non-core assets in order to fund activities in our core resource plays.




	        At
	December 31, 2013, our estimated total proved oil and natural gas reserves, as prepared by our independent reserve engineering firm, Netherland, Sewell &
	Associates, Inc., or "Netherland, Sewell," were approximately 136 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBoe), consisting of 114.5 million barrels (MMBbls) of oil, 9.8 MMBbls of
	natural gas liquids, and 69.7 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas. Approximately 40% of our proved reserves were classified as proved developed. We maintain operational control of
	approximately 92% of our proved reserves.




	        Our
	oil and natural gas assets consist of undeveloped acreage positions in unconventional liquids-rich basins/fields. We have acquired acreage and may acquire additional acreage in the
	Bakken / Three Forks formations in North Dakota, the Eagle Ford formation in East Texas, the Utica / Point Pleasant formations in Ohio and Pennsylvania and the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale formation in
	Mississippi and Louisiana, as well as several other areas.




	        Our
	total operating revenues for 2013 were approximately $999.5 million. Production for the fourth quarter of 2013 averaged 40,217 barrels of oil equivalent per day (Boe/d). Pro
	forma for the divestitures of certain non-core assets, production for the fourth quarter of 2013 averaged 37,489 Boe/d. Full year 2013 production averaged 33,329 Boe/d compared to 9,404 Boe/d in 2012,
	resulting in a 254% year over year increase in our average daily production. The increase in production compared to the prior year was driven by our operated drilling results and increased production
	volumes associated with the development of properties we acquired in 2012 in the Bakken / Three Forks, Woodbine, and Eagle Ford formation in East Texas, which we refer to as "El
	Halcón". These areas collectively accounted for approximately 25,764 Boe/d, or 77% of our production in 2013. Our remaining production was associated with various non-core properties,
	many of which have since been divested. In 2013, we participated in the drilling of 284 gross (107.4 net) wells of which 281 gross (104.4 net) wells were completed and capable of production, and 3
	gross (3.0 net) wells were dry holes.












	Our Business and Recent Developments






	        For a description of our business, please see our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, filed
	with the Commission on February 27, 2014 and incorporated herein by reference, as well as the other documents incorporated herein by reference.

	Table of Contents












	        We
	have recently engaged in several significant transactions:






	Pending Sale of East Texas Assets






	        On February 25, 2014, certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries entered into an Agreement of Sale and Purchase with a
	privately-owned company pursuant to which we agreed to sell our Woodbine properties and related assets located in East Texas for a total purchase price of $450.0 million. The effective date of
	the transaction will be April 1, 2014 and is expected to close in mid-April 2014, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions set forth in the agreement of sale and purchase. The
	purchase price is subject to adjustment for (i) operating expenses, capital expenditures and revenues between the effective date and the closing date, (ii) title and environmental
	defects, and (iii) other purchase price adjustments customary in oil and gas purchase and sale agreements. The assets subject to the purchase and sale agreement include approximately 83,000 net
	acres primarily located in Leon, Madison and Grimes Counties, Texas. These properties produced an average of approximately 3,800 Boe/d during the month of January 2014. Estimated proved reserves
	associated with these assets, as of December 31, 2013, were approximately 16.3 MMBoe, 39% of which was proved developed. Upon the closing of the agreement of sale and purchase, the borrowing
	base on our revolving credit facility is expected to be reduced by $100.0 million.






	Divestitures of Non-Core Assets






	        During the second half of 2013, we entered into three separate purchase and sale agreements with unrelated parties to divest certain
	non-core assets located throughout the United States for total consideration of approximately $302.0 million, all three of which closed in the fourth quarter of 2013. In aggregate, as of
	December 31, 2012, estimated proved reserves associated with these non-core assets, were approximately 21.2 MMBoe (69% oil). Production from these non-core assets averaged approximately 4,400
	Boe/d during the third quarter of 2013. Proceeds from the sales of the non-core assets were recorded as a reduction to the carrying value of our full cost pool with no gain or loss recorded. The
	borrowing base reduction associated with these non-core asset sales was $50.0 million. Following the closing of the last of these three divestitures, on December 20, 2013, the borrowing
	base under our senior revolving credit facility, which we refer to as our Senior Credit Agreement, was reduced by the $50.0 million to $700.0 million.






	Issuance of Additional 9.75% Senior Notes






	        On December 19, 2013, we issued an additional $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 9.75% senior notes due
	2020. The net proceeds from the sale of the additional 2020 notes of approximately $406.1 million were used to repay a portion of the then outstanding borrowings under our Senior Credit
	Agreement. In total, we have issued $1.15 billion of 9.75% senior notes due 2020.






	Issuance of 9.25% Senior Notes and Common Stock






	        On August 13, 2013, we issued $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 9.25% senior notes due 2022. The net proceeds
	from the offering of approximately $392.1 million were used to repay a portion of the then outstanding borrowings on our Senior Credit Agreement. On August 13, 2013, we also completed
	the issuance of 43.7 million shares of common stock in an underwritten public offering. The net proceeds from the offering of common stock of approximately $215.2 million were used to
	repay a portion of the then outstanding borrowings on our Senior Credit Agreement.






	Divestiture of Eagle Ford Assets






	        On July 19, 2013, we completed the sale of our interest in Eagle Ford assets in Fayette and Gonzales Counties, Texas to private
	buyers for proceeds of approximately $147.9 million, before

	Table of Contents












	post-closing
	adjustments. Proceeds from the sale were recorded as a reduction to the carrying value of our full cost pool with no gain or loss recorded. As of December 31, 2012, we had
	approximately 3.6 MMBoe of estimated proved reserves associated with these properties. Production from the Eagle Ford assets averaged approximately 1,811 Boe/d during the second quarter of 2013.






	Issuance of 5.75% Series A Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock






	        On June 18, 2013, we issued in a public offering 345,000 shares of 5.75% Series A Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock
	(the Series A Preferred Stock). The net proceeds of approximately $335.5 million were used to repay a portion of the then outstanding borrowings under our Senior Credit Agreement.
	Holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by our Board of Directors, cumulative dividends at the rate of 5.75% per annum on the $1,000
	liquidation preference per share of the Series A Preferred Stock, payable quarterly in arrears on each dividend payment date. Dividends may be paid in cash or, where freely transferable by any
	non-affiliate recipient thereof, in shares of common stock or a combination thereof, and are payable on March 1, June 1, September 1 and December 1 of each year.






	Issuance of Additional 8.875% Senior Notes






	        On January 14, 2013, we issued an additional $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 8.875% senior notes due
	2021. The net proceeds of approximately $619.5 million were used to repay a portion of the then outstanding borrowings on our Senior Credit Agreement and for general corporate purposes. In
	total, we have issued $1.35 billion of 8.875% senior notes due 2021.






	Amendments to Senior Credit Agreement and Borrowing Base






	        On October 31, 2013, we entered into the Sixth Amendment to our Senior Credit Agreement. The Sixth Amendment established our
	borrowing base at $850.0 million, which has since been reduced to $700.0 million upon the closing of the final non-core divestiture in December 2013. Additionally, the Sixth Amendment
	provides for EBITDA (as defined in the Senior Credit Agreement) to be annualized for purposes of measuring compliance with the interest coverage test under the Senior Credit Agreement. Specifically,
	(i) for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2013, the Interest Coverage Ratio will be calculated by utilizing EBITDA for the three month period then ended multiplied by 4;
	(ii) for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2014, the Interest Coverage Ratio will be calculated by utilizing EBITDA for the six month period then ended multiplied by 2; and
	(iii) for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2014, the Interest Coverage Ratio will be calculated by utilizing EBITDA for the nine month period then ended multiplied by 1.333.




	        On
	June 11, 2013, we entered into the Fifth Amendment to the Senior Credit Agreement which permits us, among other things, to pay cash dividends to holders of our preferred
	capital stock. On May 8, 2013, we entered into the Fourth Amendment to the Senior Credit Agreement which modified the calculation of the interest coverage test, which was superseded by the
	Sixth Amendment. On April 26, 2013, we entered into the Third Amendment to our Senior Credit Agreement, which, among other things, provided additional flexibility under certain affirmative and
	negative covenants and on January 25, 2013, we entered into the Second Amendment to our Senior Credit Agreement which expanded our ability to enter into certain commodity hedging agreements.






	2014 Capital Budget






	        We expect to spend approximately $950 million on drilling and completion capital expenditures during 2014. Approximately 49% of
	our 2014 drilling and completions budget is expected to be spent in the Bakken / Three Forks formations in North Dakota, approximately 40% is
	budgeted for the El Halcón area in East Texas, and the remaining amount is planned for various other project areas,




	 





	3











	Table of Contents












	including
	the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale in Louisiana and Mississippi and the Utica / Point Pleasant formations in Ohio. Our 2014 drilling and completion budget contemplates four to five operated rigs
	running in the Bakken / Three Forks, three to four operated rigs running in the El Halcón area and one to two operated rigs running in the other areas. Our drilling and completion
	budget for 2014 is based on our current view of market conditions and current business plans, and is subject to change.




	        We
	expect to fund our budgeted 2014 capital expenditures with cash flows from operations, proceeds from additional potential non-core asset divestitures and borrowings under our Senior
	Credit Agreement. We strive to maintain financial flexibility and may access capital markets as necessary to maintain substantial borrowing capacity under our Senior Credit Agreement, facilitate
	drilling on our large undeveloped acreage position and permit us to selectively expand our acreage position. In the event our cash flows or proceeds from additional potential non-core asset
	dispositions are materially less than anticipated and other sources of capital we historically have utilized are not available on acceptable terms, we may curtail our capital spending.




	        Our
	financial results depend upon many factors, but are largely driven by the volume of our oil and natural gas production and the price that we receive for that production. Our
	production volumes will decline as reserves are depleted unless we expend capital in successful development and exploration activities or acquire properties with existing production. The amount we
	realize for our production depends predominately upon commodity prices and our related commodity price hedging activities, which are affected by changes in market demand and supply, as impacted by
	overall economic activity, weather, pipeline capacity constraints, inventory storage levels, basis differentials and other factors. Accordingly, finding and developing oil and natural gas reserves in
	an economical manner is critical to our long-term success.

	The new notes will evidence the same debt as the corresponding old notes and will be issued under, and be entitled to the
	benefits of, the same indenture that governs the old notes. Holders of the old notes do not have any appraisal or dissenter's rights in connection with the exchange offers. Because the new notes will be registered, the new notes will not be subject

	Conditions to the Exchange Offers





	 







	The exchange offers are subject to certain customary conditions, which we may waive. The registration rights
	agreements do not require us to accept old notes for exchange if the exchange offer or the making of any exchange by a holder of the old notes would violate any applicable law or interpretation of the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission,

	United States Federal Income Tax Consequences





	 







	The exchange of the old notes for new notes in the exchange offers will not be a taxable transaction for United
	States federal income tax purposes. See the discussion under the caption "Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences" for more information regarding the tax consequences to you of the exchange offers.










	Use of Proceeds





	 







	We will not receive any proceeds from the exchange offers.










	Fees and Expenses





	 







	We will pay all of our expenses incident to the exchange offers.










	Exchange Agent





	 







	We have appointed U.S. Bank National Association as exchange agent for the exchange offers. You can find the
	address, telephone number and fax number of the exchange agent under the caption "The Exchange OffersExchange Agent."










	Resales of New Notes





	 







	Based on interpretations by the staff of the SEC, as set forth in no-action letters issued to third parties that
	are not related to us, we believe that the new notes you receive in the exchange offers may be offered for resale, resold or otherwise transferred by you without compliance with the registration and prospectus delivery provisions of the Securities
	Act so long as:











	 






	






	you are
	acquiring the new notes in the exchange offers in the ordinary course of your business;















	 






	8











	Table of Contents






























	 





	 




	 












	 






	






	you have not
	engaged in, do not intend to engage in, and have no arrangement or understanding with any person to participate in the distribution, as defined in the Securities Act, of the Exchange Notes you will receive in the exchange offers;











	 






	






	you are not
	our "affiliate" as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act; and











	 






	






	you are not
	a broker-dealer tendering old notes acquired directly from us for your account.











	 







	By tendering your old notes as described in "The Exchange OffersExchange Offer Procedures," you will be
	making representations to this effect. If you fail to satisfy any of these conditions, you cannot rely on the position of the SEC set forth in the no-action letters referred to above and you must comply with the registration and prospectus delivery
	requirements of the Securities Act in connection with a resale of the new notes.











	 







	We base our belief on interpretations by the SEC staff in no-action letters issued to other issuers in exchange
	offers like ours. We cannot guarantee that the SEC would make a similar decision about our exchange offers. If our belief is wrong, you could incur liability under the Securities Act. We will not protect you against any loss incurred as a result of
	this liability under the Securities Act.











	 







	Each broker-dealer that receives new notes for its own account in exchange for old notes, where such new notes
	were acquired by such broker-dealer as a result of market-making activities or other trading activities, must acknowledge that it will deliver a prospectus meeting the requirements of the Securities Act in connection with any resale of the new notes.
	We have agreed that, for a period of up to 180 days after the expiration date, we will make this prospectus available to any broker-dealer for use in connection with any such resale. See "Plan of Distribution."

	Consequences of Not Exchanging Your Old Notes





	 







	If you do not exchange your old notes in the exchange offers, you will no longer be able to require us to register your old notes
	under the Securities Act, except in the limited circumstances provided under the registration rights agreement. In addition, you will not be able to resell, offer to resell or otherwise transfer your old notes unless we have registered the old notes
	under the Securities Act or unless you resell, offer to resell or otherwise transfer them under an exemption from the registration requirements of, or in a transaction not subject to, the Securities Act.











	 







	For information regarding the consequences of not tendering your old notes and our obligation to file a
	registration statement, please read "The Exchange OfferConsequences of Exchanging or Failure to Exchange Old Notes" and "Description of the New Notes."

	Terms of the New Notes






	        The terms of the new notes and those of the outstanding old notes are substantially identical, except that the transfer restrictions
	and registration rights relating to the old notes do not apply to the new notes. As a result, the new notes will not bear legends restricting their transfer and will not have the benefit of the
	registration rights and related special interest provisions
	contained in the old notes. The new notes represent the same debt as the old notes for which they are being exchanged.




	        The
	following is a summary of the terms of the new notes. It may not contain all the information that is important to you. For a more detailed description of the new notes, please read
	"Description of the New Notes."

	Interest





	 







	Interest on the new 2020 notes will accrue at the rate of 9.75% per year and will be payable semi-annually on January 15 and

	The new notes will be our senior unsecured obligations. The new notes will rank equally with all our current and future senior
	indebtedness. The new notes will rank effectively junior to our secured debt to the extent of the collateral, including secured debt under our existing senior revolving credit facility.










	Optional Redemption





	 







	At any time on or before July 15, 2015, we may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the old 2020 notes and
	the new 2020 notes with the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings at the redemption price set forth under "Description of the New NotesOptional Redemption," if at least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes issued under the
	indenture remains outstanding immediately after such redemption and the redemption occurs within 180 days of the closing date of such equity offering.

	At any time prior to July 15, 2016, we may redeem the old 2020 notes and the new 2020 notes, in whole or in part, at a "make whole"
	redemption price set forth under "Description of the New NotesOptional Redemption." On or after July 15, 2016, we may redeem the old 2020 notes and the new 2020 notes, in whole or in part, at the redemption prices set forth under
	"Description of the New NotesOptional Redemption."











	 







	At any time before August 15, 2016, we may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the old 2022 notes and the
	new 2022 notes with the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings at the redemption price set forth under "Description of the New NotesOptional Redemption," if at least 65% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes issued under the
	indenture remains outstanding immediately after such redemption and the redemption occurs within 180 days of the closing date of such equity offering.











	 







	At any time prior to August 15, 2017, we may redeem the old 2022 notes and the new 2022 notes, in whole or in part, at a
	"make whole" redemption price set forth under "Description of the New NotesOptional Redemption." On or after August 15, 2017, we may redeem the notes, in whole or in part, at the redemption prices set forth under "Description of the New
	NotesOptional Redemption."










	Mandatory Offer to Repurchase





	 







	If we experience specific kinds of changes of control followed by a rating decline or sell certain assets, we may be required to
	purchase all or a portion of the new notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase. See "Description of the New NotesRepurchase at the Option of Holders."










	Basic Covenants of Indenture





	 







	The indentures governing the new notes contain covenants that will limit our ability and the ability of our restricted
	subsidiaries to, among other things:











	 






	






	borrow money;











	 






	






	pay dividends or make other
	distributions on stock;











	 






	






	purchase or redeem stock or
	subordinated indebtedness;











	 






	






	make
	investments;











	 






	






	create liens











	 






	






	enter into transactions with
	affiliates;











	 






	






	sell assets;











	 






	






	refinance certain
	indebtedness; and











	 






	






	merge with or into other
	companies or transfer all or substantially all our assets.

	These limitations are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions which are described in "Description of the New
	NotesCertain Covenants." However, most of the limitations will terminate with respect to either series of notes if both Moody's Investors Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor's Ratings Services assign that series an investment grade
	rating and no default exists with respect to such notes.










	Events of Default





	 







	If there is an event of default on the new notes, the principal amount of notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, may be
	declared immediately due and payable in specified circumstances. Please read "Description of the New NotesEvents of Default and Remedies."










	Transfer Restrictions; Absence of a Public Market for the Notes





	 







	The new notes generally will be freely transferable, but will also be new securities for which there will not initially be a
	market. There can be no assurance as to the development or liquidity of any market for the new notes.




















	Risk Factors






	        Tendering your old notes in the exchange offers involves risks. You should carefully consider the information set forth in this
	prospectus and, in particular, should evaluate the specific factors set forth in the section entitled "Risk Factors" for an explanation of certain risks of investing in the new notes before tendering
	any old notes. For a description of risks related to our industry and business, you should also evaluate the specific risk factors set forth under the heading "Risk Factors," in our Annual Report on
	Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, which is incorporated by reference in this prospectus, and, to the extent applicable, any subsequently filed reports.

	RISK FACTORS





	        



	You should carefully consider the information included or incorporated by reference in this prospectus,
	including the matters addressed under "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements," and the risks described below. In addition, you should read the risk factors in our Annual Report on
	Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, which is incorporated by reference in this prospectus and, to the extent applicable, any subsequently filed
	reports.





	        



	We are subject to certain risks and hazards due to the nature of the business activities we conduct. The risks discussed below, any of which could materially and
	adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations, are not the only risks we face. We may experience additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to
	us; or, as a result of developments occurring in the future, conditions that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows,
	and results of operations.






	Risks Related to the Exchange Offers and the New Notes







	If you do not properly tender your old notes, you will continue to hold unregistered outstanding notes and your ability to transfer outstanding notes will be adversely
	affected.






	        We will only issue new notes in exchange for old notes that you timely and properly tender. Therefore, you should allow sufficient time
	to ensure timely delivery of the old notes and you should carefully follow the instructions on how to tender your old notes. Neither we nor the exchange agent is required to tell you of any defects or
	irregularities with respect to your tender of old notes. Please read "The Exchange OffersExchange Offer Procedures" and "Description of the New Notes."




	        If
	you do not exchange your old notes for new notes in the exchange offer, you will continue to be subject to the restrictions on transfer of your old notes described in the legend on
	the certificates for your old notes. In general, you may only offer or sell the old notes if they are registered under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws, or offered and sold
	under an exemption from these requirements. We do not plan to register any sale of the old notes under the Securities Act. For further information regarding the consequences of tendering your old
	notes in the exchange offer, please read "The Exchange OffersConsequences of Exchanging or Failure to Exchange Old Notes."






	You may find it difficult to sell your new notes.






	        The new notes are a new issue of securities and although the new notes will be registered under the Securities Act, the new notes will
	not be listed on any securities exchange. Because there is no public market for the new notes, you may not be able to resell them.




	        We
	cannot assure you that an active market will exist for the new notes or that any trading market that does develop will be liquid. If an active market does not develop or is not
	maintained, the market price and liquidity of our new notes may be adversely affected. If a market for the new notes develops, they may trade at a discount from their initial offering price. The
	trading market for the new notes may be adversely affected by:






	




	changes in the overall market for non-investment grade securities;








	




	changes in our financial performance or prospects;








	




	the financial performance or prospects for companies in our industry generally;








	




	the number of holders of the notes;








	




	the interest of securities dealers in making a market for the notes; and








	




	prevailing interest rates and general economic conditions.






	14











	Table of Contents









	        Historically,
	the market for non-investment grade debt has been subject to substantial volatility in prices. The market for the new notes, if any, may be subject to similar volatility.
	Prospective investors in the new notes should be aware that they may be required to bear the financial risks of such investment for an indefinite period of time.






	Some holders who exchange their old notes may be deemed to be underwriters.






	        If you exchange your old notes in the exchange offers for the purpose of participating in a distribution of the new notes, you may be
	deemed to have received restricted securities and, if so, will be required to comply with the registration and prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act in connection with any resale
	transaction.





	Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes







	We have a holding company structure in which our subsidiaries conduct our operations and own our operating assets and our ability to make payments on the notes is therefore
	dependent upon the performance of our subsidiaries.






	        We are a holding company, and our subsidiaries conduct substantially all of our operations and own substantially all of our operating
	assets. We have no significant assets other than the equity interests in our subsidiaries. As a result, our ability to make required payments on the notes depends on the performance of our
	subsidiaries and their ability to distribute funds to us. The ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions to us may be restricted by, among other things, any future indebtedness of our
	subsidiaries. If we are unable to obtain the funds necessary to pay the principal amount at the maturity of the notes, or to repurchase the notes upon an occurrence of a change of control, we may be
	required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as a refinancing of the notes. We cannot assure you that we would be able to refinance the notes.






	If we default on our obligations to pay our other indebtedness, we may not be able to make payments on the notes.






	        If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow and are otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required payments of
	principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants under the agreements governing our indebtedness, including financial and
	operating covenants, we could be in default under the terms of such agreements. In the event of any such default:






	




	the holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable, together
	with accrued and unpaid interest;








	




	the lenders under our credit agreement could elect to terminate their commitments thereunder, cease making further loans
	and commence foreclosure proceedings against our assets; and








	




	we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.






	        If
	we breach our covenants under our Senior Credit Agreement or the indentures governing the notes and seek a waiver, we may not be able to obtain a waiver from the required lenders. If
	this occurs, we would be in default under our Senior Credit Agreement or the indenture governing such notes, the lenders could exercise their rights, as described above, and we could be forced into
	bankruptcy or liquidation.






	We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations.






	        Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness, including the notes, and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our
	ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to conditions in the oil and gas industry, general economic and financial conditions, the




	15











	Table of Contents





	impact
	of legislative and regulatory actions on how we conduct our business and other factors, all of which are beyond our control.




	        We
	cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our outstanding indebtedness, or that future borrowings will be available to us in an
	amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other capital needs. If our business does not generate
	sufficient cash flow from operations to service our outstanding indebtedness, we may have to undertake alternative financing plans, such as:






	




	refinancing or restructuring our debt;








	




	selling assets;








	




	reducing or delaying acquisitions or capital investments, such as remanufacturing our rigs and related equipment; or








	




	seeking to raise additional capital.






	        However,
	we cannot assure you that we would be able to implement alternative financing plans, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that implementing any such
	alternative financing plans would allow us to meet our debt obligations. In addition, any failure to make scheduled payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness, including the
	notes, would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on acceptable terms.




	        Our
	inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations, including our obligations under the notes, or to obtain alternative financings, could materially and
	adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.






	Restrictive covenants in the indentures governing the notes and in our Senior Credit Agreement could limit our growth and our ability to finance our operations, fund our
	capital needs, respond to changing conditions and engage in other business activities that may be in our best interests.






	        The indentures governing the notes impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions limit our ability
	and that of our restricted subsidiaries to, among other things:






	




	pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of our capital stock or make other restricted payments;








	




	incur additional indebtedness;








	




	create liens;








	




	engage in mergers or consolidations or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;








	




	make certain dispositions and transfers of assets; and








	




	engage in transactions with affiliates.






	        In
	addition, our Senior Credit Agreement contains a number of significant covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to:






	




	dispose of assets;








	




	incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain types of preferred stock;








	




	pay dividends on our capital stock;








	




	create liens on our assets;








	




	enter into sale or leaseback transactions;






	16











	Table of Contents







	




	enter into specified investments or acquisitions;








	




	repurchase, redeem or retire our capital stock or subordinated debt;








	




	merge or consolidate, or transfer all or substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries;








	




	engage in specified transactions with subsidiaries and affiliates; or








	




	pursue other corporate activities.






	        We
	may be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations imposed on us by the restrictive covenants under the indentures governing the
	notes and our Senior Credit Agreement. Also, our Senior Credit Agreement requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial condition tests. Our ability
	to comply with these ratios and financial condition tests may be affected by events beyond our control and, as a result, we may be unable to meet these ratios and financial condition tests. These
	financial ratio restrictions and financial condition tests could limit our ability to obtain future financings, make needed capital expenditures, withstand a future downturn in our business or the
	economy in general or otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities. A decline in oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas prices, or a prolonged period of oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas
	prices at lower levels, could result in our failing to meet one or more of the financial covenants under our Senior Credit Agreement, which could require us to refinance or amend the Senior Credit
	Agreement resulting in the payment of consent fees or higher interest rates, or require us to raise additional capital at an inopportune time or on terms not favorable to us.




	        A
	breach of any of these covenants or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios or financial condition tests could result in a default under our Senior Credit Agreement.
	A default under our Senior Credit Agreement or the indentures governing the notes, if not cured or waived, could result in acceleration of all indebtedness outstanding thereunder. The accelerated debt
	would become immediately due and payable. If that should occur, we may be unable to pay all such debt or to borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if new financing were then available, it may
	not be on terms that are acceptable to us. Moreover, any new indebtedness we incur may impose financial restrictions and other covenants on us that may be more restrictive than the Senior Credit
	Agreement or the indentures governing the notes. See "Description of the New Notes."






	The notes and the guarantees will be unsecured and effectively subordinated to our secured indebtedness and that of our subsidiary guarantors.






	        The notes and the guarantees will be general unsecured senior obligations ranking effectively junior in right of payment to any secured
	debt of ours and that of each subsidiary guarantor, respectively, including obligations under our Senior Credit Agreement, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing the debt. At
	December 31, 2013, the borrowing base under our Senior Credit Agreement was $700.0 million and we had no borrowings outstanding. Any amounts borrowed thereunder would be secured debt and
	effectively senior in right of payment to the notes to the extent of the value of the collateral securing that indebtedness. The indentures governing the notes will permit us and the subsidiary
	guarantors to incur additional secured debt in the future.




	        If
	we or a subsidiary guarantor is declared bankrupt, becomes insolvent or is liquidated or reorganized, any secured debt of ours or that subsidiary guarantor will be entitled to be paid
	in full from our assets or the assets of the guarantor, as applicable, securing that debt before any payment may be made with respect to the notes or the affected guarantees. Holders of the notes will
	participate ratably with all holders of our unsecured indebtedness that does not rank junior to the notes, including the 8% senior unsecured convertible note due 2017 held by HALRES LLC and
	including all of our other general
	creditors and the holders of our secured debt to the extent such debt is not satisfied with the proceeds of the collateral therefor, based upon the respective amounts owed to each holder or




	17











	Table of Contents





	creditor,
	in our remaining assets. In any of the foregoing events, we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient assets to pay amounts due on the notes. As a result, holders of the notes would
	likely receive less, ratably, than holders of secured indebtedness.






	Our debt level in the future and the covenants in the agreements governing our debt could negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations and business
	prospects and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the notes.






	        Our level of indebtedness in the future, and the covenants contained in the agreements governing our debt, could have important
	consequences for our operations, including by:






	




	making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under the notes or other indebtedness and increasing the risk
	that we may default on our debt obligations;








	




	requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to required payments on indebtedness,
	thereby reducing the availability of cash flow for working capital, capital expenditures and other general business activities;








	




	limiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions
	and general corporate and other activities;








	




	limiting management's discretion in operating our business;








	




	limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;








	




	detracting from our ability to withstand successfully a downturn in our business or the economy generally;








	




	placing us at a competitive disadvantage against less leveraged competitors; and








	




	making us vulnerable to increases in interest rates, because debt under any senior revolving credit facility may vary with
	prevailing interest rates.






	        We
	may be required to repay all or a portion of our debt on an accelerated basis in certain circumstances. If we fail to comply with the covenants and other restrictions in the
	agreements governing our debt, it could lead to an event of default and the consequent acceleration of our obligation to repay outstanding debt. Our ability to comply with these covenants and other
	restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic and financial conditions.






	We are able to incur a substantial amount of additional indebtedness. This could further exacerbate the risks associated with our indebtedness.






	        At December 31, 2013, our $1.5 billion Senior Credit Agreement had a borrowing base of $700.0 million for secured
	borrowings, subject to periodic borrowing base redeterminations, and we had no borrowings outstanding. Borrowings under the Senior Credit Agreement are secured, and as a result, effectively senior to
	the notes and the guarantees of the notes by the guarantors, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing that indebtedness. In addition, the holders of our senior notes totaling
	$2.9 billion and the 8% unsecured convertible note due 2017, which has a current principal balance of approximately $289.7 million, along with holders of any future debt we may incur
	that ranks equally with the notes will be entitled to share ratably with the holders of the notes in any proceeds distributed in connection with any insolvency, liquidation, reorganization,
	dissolution or other winding-up of us. This may have the effect of reducing the amount of proceeds paid to you. If new




	18











	Table of Contents





	debt
	is incurred, the related risks that we and our subsidiaries now face could intensify. Increased leverage could, for example:






	




	make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness; if we fail to comply with the
	requirements of our indebtedness, that failure could result in an event of default of such indebtedness;








	




	require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to required payments on indebtedness,
	thereby reducing the availability of cash flow for working capital, capital expenditures and other business activities;








	




	limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and other general
	corporate purposes;








	




	limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;








	




	diminish our ability to successfully withstand a downturn in our business or the economy generally; and








	




	place us at a competitive disadvantage against less leveraged competitors.






	        If
	new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries' current debt levels, the related risks that we and they now face could increase.






	We may not be able to repurchase the notes upon a change of control.






	        Upon the occurrence of certain change of control events followed within 90 days by a lowering of the rating on the notes by
	either Moody's Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's") or Standard & Poor's Ratings Services ("S&P"), we would be required to offer to repurchase all or any part of the notes then
	outstanding for cash at 101% of the principal amount. The source of funds for any repurchase required as a result of any change of control will be our available cash or cash generated from our
	operations or other sources, including:






	




	sale of assets; or








	




	sales of equity.






	        We
	cannot assure you that sufficient funds would be available at the time of any change of control to repurchase your notes. Additionally, a "change of control" is an event of default
	under our Senior Credit Agreement that would permit the lenders to accelerate the debt outstanding under such facility. Finally, using available cash to fund the potential consequences of a change of
	control may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future, which could negatively impact our ability to conduct our business operations.






	A subsidiary guarantee could be voided if it constitutes a fraudulent transfer under United States bankruptcy or similar state law, which would prevent the holders of the
	notes from relying on that subsidiary to satisfy claims.






	        Under United States bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer laws, our subsidiary guarantees of the notes
	can be voided, or claims under the subsidiary guarantees may be subordinated to all other debts of that subsidiary guarantor if, among other things, the subsidiary guarantor, at the time it incurred
	the indebtedness evidenced by its guarantee or, in some states, when payments become due under the guarantee, received less than
	reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for the incurrence of the guarantee and:






	




	was insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of such incurrence;






	19











	Table of Contents







	




	was engaged in a business or transaction for which the guarantor's remaining assets constituted unreasonably small
	capital; or








	




	intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay those debts as they mature.






	        Our
	subsidiary guarantees may also be voided, without regard to the above factors, if a court found that the subsidiary guarantor entered into the guarantee with the actual intent to
	hinder, delay or defraud its creditors.




	        A
	court would likely find that a subsidiary guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for its guarantee if the subsidiary guarantor did not
	substantially benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the guarantees. If a court were to void a subsidiary guarantee, you would no longer have a claim against the subsidiary guarantor.
	Sufficient funds to repay the notes may not be available from other sources, including the remaining subsidiary guarantors, if any. In addition, the court might direct you to repay any amounts that
	you already received from the subsidiary guarantor.




	        The
	measures of insolvency for purposes of fraudulent transfer laws vary depending upon the governing law. Generally, a guarantor would be considered insolvent
	if:






	




	the sum of its debts, including contingent liabilities, were greater than the fair saleable value of all its assets;








	




	the present fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability
	on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or








	




	it could not pay its debts as they become due.






	        The
	obligations of each subsidiary guarantor will be limited as necessary to prevent each subsidiary guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law. We cannot
	assure you that this limitation will protect the subsidiary guarantees from fraudulent transfer challenges or, if it does, that the remaining amount due and collectible under the guarantees would
	suffice, if necessary, to pay the notes in full when due.






	The notes will be structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities of our future subsidiaries that are not guarantors of the notes.






	        You would not have any claim as a creditor against any of our future subsidiaries that are not guarantors of the notes. Indebtedness
	and other liabilities, including trade payables, whether secured or unsecured, of those subsidiaries will be effectively senior to your claims against those subsidiaries. As a result, your ability to
	make a claim against those subsidiaries may be limited.






	Many of the covenants contained in the indenture will terminate if the notes are rated investment grade by both of S&P and Moody's






	        Many of the covenants in the indentures governing the notes will terminate if the notes are rated investment grade by both of S&P and
	Moody's, provided at such time no default under the indenture has occurred and is continuing. These covenants will restrict, among other things, our ability to pay dividends, to incur debt and to
	enter into certain other transactions. There can be no assurance that the notes will ever be rated investment grade, or that if they are rated investment grade, that the notes will maintain such
	ratings. However, termination of these covenants would allow us to engage in certain transactions that would not be permitted while these covenants were in force. Please see "Description of the New
	NotesCovenant Termination."

	USE OF PROCEEDS






	        The exchange offer is intended to satisfy our obligations under the registration rights agreements we entered into in connection with
	the private offerings of the old notes. We will not receive any proceeds from the issuance of the new notes in the exchange offers. In consideration for issuing the new notes as contemplated in this
	prospectus, we will receive, in exchange, outstanding old notes in like principal amount. We will cancel all old notes surrendered in exchange for new notes in the exchange offers. As a result, the
	issuance of the new notes will not result in any increase or decrease in our outstanding indebtedness.

	DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS







	Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility





	        On February 8, 2012, we entered into a senior secured revolving credit agreement, or Senior Credit Agreement, with JPMorgan
	Chase Bank, N.A. ("JPMorgan") as the administrative agent and lead arranger.




	        The
	Senior Credit Agreement provides for a $1.5 billion facility with a borrowing base of $700.0 million as of December 31, 2013. Amounts borrowed under the Senior
	Credit Agreement will mature on February 8, 2017. The borrowing base will be redetermined semi-annually, with the lenders and the Company each having the right to one interim unscheduled
	redetermination between any two consecutive semi-annual redeterminations. The borrowing base takes into account the Company's oil and natural gas properties, proved reserves, total indebtedness, and
	other relevant factors consistent with customary oil and natural gas lending criteria. The borrowing base is subject to a reduction equal
	to the product of 0.25 multiplied by the stated principal amount (without regard to any initial issue discount) of any future notes or other long-term debt securities that the Company may issue. Funds
	advanced under the Senior Credit Agreement may be paid down and re-borrowed during the five-year term of the revolver. Amounts outstanding under the Senior Credit Agreement bear interest at specified
	margins over the base rate of 0.50% to 1.50% for ABR-based loans or at specified margins over LIBOR of 1.50% to 2.50% for Eurodollar-based loans. These margins fluctuate based on the Company's
	utilization of the facility. Advances under the Senior Credit Agreement are secured by liens on substantially all of the Company's properties and assets. The Senior Credit Agreement contains customary
	representations, warranties and covenants including, among others, restrictions on the payment of dividends on the Company's capital stock and financial covenants, including minimum working capital
	levels (the ratio of current assets plus the unused commitment under the Senior Credit Agreement to current liabilities) of not less than 1.0 to 1.0 and minimum coverage of interest expenses (as
	defined in the Senior Credit Agreement) of not less than 2.5 to 1.0.




	        At
	December 31, 2013, the Company had no borrowings outstanding, $1.2 million of letters of credit outstanding and $698.8 million of borrowing capacity under the
	Senior Credit Agreement, of which approximately $629.0 million was available under the indebtedness limitation in our indentures.




	        On
	January 25, 2013, the Company entered into the Second Amendment to its Senior Credit Agreement which expanded its ability to enter into certain commodity hedging agreements. On
	April 26, 2013, the Company entered into the Third Amendment to its Senior Credit Agreement, which, among other things, provided additional flexibility under certain affirmative and negative
	covenants. On May 8, 2013, the Company entered into the Fourth Amendment to the Senior Credit Agreement which modified the calculation of the interest coverage test, which was superseded by the
	Sixth Amendment, and on June 11, 2013, the Company entered into the Fifth Amendment to the Senior Credit Agreement which permits the Company, among other things, to pay cash dividends to
	holders of its preferred capital stock.




	        On
	October 31, 2013, the Company entered into the Sixth Amendment to the Senior Credit Agreement (the Sixth Amendment). The Sixth Amendment increased the borrowing base to
	$850.0 million, which was subsequently reduced to $700.0 million upon the closing of the final non-core divestiture in December 2013. Additionally, the Sixth Amendment provides for
	EBITDA (as defined in the Senior Credit Agreement) to be annualized for purposes of measuring compliance with the interest coverage test. Specifically, (i) for the fiscal quarter ended
	December 31, 2013, the Interest Coverage Ratio was calculated by utilizing EBITDA for the three month period then ended multiplied by 4; (ii) for the fiscal quarter ended
	March 31, 2014, the Interest Coverage Ratio shall be calculated by utilizing EBITDA for the six month period then ended multiplied by 2; and (iii) for the fiscal quarter ended
	June 30, 2014, the Interest Coverage Ratio shall be calculated by utilizing EBITDA for the nine month period then ended multiplied by 1.333.

	March 2011 Credit Facilities





	        The Company's March 2011 credit facilities included a $250.0 million revolving credit facility and a $75.0 million second
	lien term loan facility (the March 2011 Credit Facilities), replacing the November 2007 facility. SunTrust Bank was the administrative agent for the revolving credit facility, and Guggenheim Corporate
	Funding, LLC was the administrative agent for the second lien term loan facility. The revolving credit facility allowed for funds advanced to be paid down and re-borrowed during the five-year
	term of the revolver, and bore interest at LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 2.5% to 3.25% based on a percentage of usage. The second lien term loan facility provided for payments of interest only
	during its 5.5 year term, and bore interest at LIBOR plus 9.0% with a 2.0% LIBOR floor, or if any period the Company elected to pay a portion of the interest "in kind," then the interest rate
	would have been LIBOR plus 10.0% with a 2.0% LIBOR floor, and with 7.0% of the interest amount paid in cash and the remaining 3.0% paid in kind by being added to principal. At December 31,
	2011, $127.0 million was outstanding under the revolving credit facility and $75.0 million was outstanding under the second lien term loan facility. On February 8, 2012, the
	Company paid in full the outstanding balances under the revolving credit facility and the second lien term loan facility and both facilities were terminated, resulting in a $1.5 million charge
	to interest expense related to an early termination penalty.





	Outstanding Senior Notes







	2021 Notes






	        In addition to the 2020 Notes and the 2022 Notes subject to this exchange offer, we have issued and outstanding an aggregate of
	$1.35 billion principal amount of our 8.875% senior notes due 2021, which we refer to as the 2021 notes. The 2021 notes bear interest at a rate of 8.875% per annum with interest payable
	semi-annually on May 15 and November 15. The 8.875% notes are our senior unsecured obligations and are effectively subordinate to all of our secured debt, including secured debt under
	our Senior Credit Agreement, and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other senior indebtedness.




	        On
	or before November 15, 2015, we may redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Notes with the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption
	price of 108.875% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date provided that: at least
	65% in aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Notes originally issued remains outstanding immediately after the redemption and the redemption occurs within 180 days of the date of closing of
	the related equity offering. In addition, at any time prior to November 15, 2016, we may redeem some or all of the 2021 Notes for the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest
	plus a make whole premium equal to the excess, if any of (a) the present value at such time of (i) the redemption price of such note at November 15, 2016, plus (ii) any
	required interest payments due on the notes through November 15, 2016 (excluding currently accrued and unpaid interest) computed using a discount rate equal to the Treasury Rate plus 50 basis
	points, discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual basis, over (b) the principal amount of such note.




	        On
	or after November 15, 2016, we may redeem some or all of the 2021 Notes at any time or from time to time at the redemption prices (expressed as percentages of the principal
	amount) set forth in the following table plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the applicable redemption date, if redeemed during the 12-month period beginning November 15 of the years

	        In
	addition, upon a change of control of the Company, holders of the 2021 Notes will have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or any part of their notes for cash at a
	price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. The 2021 Notes were issued under and governed by an Indenture dated
	November 6, 2012, between the Company, U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee and the Company's subsidiaries named therein as guarantors (the Indenture). The Indenture contains covenants
	that, among other things, limit the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to: incur indebtedness; pay dividends or make other distributions on stock; purchase or redeem stock or subordinated
	indebtedness; make investments; create liens; enter into transactions with affiliates; sell assets; refinance certain indebtedness; and merge with or into other companies or transfer substantially all
	of the Company's assets.






	Registered 2020 Notes






	        On June 4, 2013, we consummated an exchange offer for $750.0 million of our 9.75% senior notes due 2020, or the
	registered 2020 notes. The registered 2020 notes are identical to the old 2020 notes that are the subject of the exchange offer described in this prospectus, except that the registered 2020 notes have
	been registered under the Securities Act and do not contain restrictions on transfer, registration rights or provisions for the payment of additional interest in case of non-registration that are set
	forth in the old 2020 notes. The new 2020 notes that will be issued in
	exchange for the old 2020 notes that are the subject of the exchange offer described in this prospectus will be identical in all respects to the registered 2020 notes.






	HALRES Note






	        On February 8, 2012, we issued to HALRES LLC, or HALRES, a $275.0 million principal amount 8% senior unsecured
	convertible note due 2017, which we refer to as the "HALRES Note," for an aggregate purchase price of $275.0 million. The HALRES Note bears interest at a rate of 8.0% per annum, payable
	quarterly on March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each year. Through the March 31, 2014 interest payment date, we may elect to borrow and add to
	principal of the HALRES Note, all or any portion of the interest due on the HALRES Note. We elected to pay the interest in kind for the first three fiscal quarters of 2012, and rolled
	$14.7 million of interest incurred during that period into the HALRES Note, increasing the principal amount to $289.7 million. Subsequently accrued interest on the HALRES Note has been
	paid in cash. The HALRES Note matures on February 8, 2017. As of February 8, 2014, the noteholder may elect to convert all or any portion of the principal amount and accrued but unpaid
	interest into common stock. Each $4.50 of principal and accrued but unpaid interest is convertible into one share of our common stock. The HALRES Note is a senior unsecured obligation of
	Halcón and ranks equally with all of Halcón's future senior unsubordinated indebtedness, including the 2020 notes, 2021 Notes and 2022 Notes.

	and
	agrees to be bound by the letter of transmittal and that we may enforce such letter of transmittal against such participant. The method of delivery of old notes, letters of transmittal and all
	other required documents is at your election and risk. If such delivery is by mail, it is recommended that you use registered mail, properly insured, with return receipt requested. In all cases, you
	should allow sufficient time to assure timely delivery. No letter of transmittal or old notes should be sent to us.




	        Signatures
	on a letter of transmittal or a notice of withdrawal, as the case may be, must be guaranteed unless the old notes surrendered for exchange are
	tendered:






	




	by a holder of the old notes who has not completed the box entitled "Special Issuance Instructions" or "Special Delivery
	Instructions" on the letter of transmittal, or








	




	for the account of an eligible institution (as defined below).






	        In
	the event that signatures on a letter of transmittal or a notice of withdrawal are required to be guaranteed, such guarantees must be by a firm which is a member of the Securities
	Transfer Agents Medallion Program, the Stock Exchanges Medallion Program or the New York Stock Exchange Medallion Signature Program (each such entity being hereinafter referred to as an eligible
	institution).
	If old notes are registered in the name of a person other than the signer of the letter of transmittal, the old notes surrendered for exchange must be endorsed by, or be accompanied by a written
	instrument or instruments of transfer or exchange, in satisfactory form as we or the exchange agent determine in our sole discretion, duly executed by the registered holders with the signature thereon
	guaranteed by an eligible institution.




	        We
	or the exchange agent in our or its sole discretion will make a final and binding determination on all questions as to the validity, form, eligibility (including time of receipt) and
	acceptance of old notes tendered for exchange. We reserve the absolute right to reject any and all tenders of any particular old note not properly tendered or to not accept any particular old note
	which acceptance might, in our judgment or our counsel's, be unlawful. We also reserve the absolute right to waive any defects or irregularities or conditions of the exchange offer as to any
	particular old note either before or after the expiration date (including the right to waive the ineligibility of any holder who seeks to tender old notes in the exchange offer). Our or the exchange
	agent's interpretation of the terms and conditions of the exchange offer as to any particular old note either before or after the expiration date (including the letter of transmittal and the
	instructions thereto) will be final and binding on all parties. Unless waived, any defects or irregularities in connection with tenders of old notes for exchange must be cured within a reasonable
	period of time, as we determine. We are not, nor is the exchange agent or any other person, under any duty to notify you of any defect or irregularity with respect to your tender of old notes for
	exchange, and no one will be liable for failing to provide such notification.




	        If
	the letter of transmittal is signed by a person or persons other than the registered holder or holders of old notes, such old notes must be endorsed or accompanied by powers of
	attorney signed exactly as the name(s) of the registered holder(s) that appear on the old notes and the signatures must be guaranteed by an eligible institution.




	        If
	the letter of transmittal or any old notes or powers of attorney are signed by trustees, executors, administrators, guardians, attorneys-in-fact, officers of corporations or others
	acting in a fiduciary or representative capacity, such persons should so indicate when signing. Unless waived by us or the exchange agent, proper evidence satisfactory to us of their authority to so
	act must be submitted with the letter of transmittal.




	        By
	tendering old notes, you represent to us, among other things, that you are not our "affiliate," as defined under Rule 405 under the Securities Act, that the new notes acquired
	pursuant to the exchange offer are being obtained in the ordinary course of business of the person receiving such new notes, whether or not such person is the holder, that neither the holder nor such
	other person has any arrangement or understanding with any person to participate in the distribution of the new notes, and




	27











	Table of Contents





	that
	you are not holding old notes that have, or are reasonably likely to have, the status of an unsold allotment in the initial offering. In the case of a holder that is not a broker-dealer, that
	holder, by tendering, will also represent to us that the holder is not engaged in, and does not intend to engage in, a distribution of the new notes. However, any purchaser of old notes who is our
	affiliate, who intends to participate in the exchange offers for the purpose of distributing the new notes, or is a broker-dealer that acquired old notes in a transaction other than as part of its
	trading or market-making activities and who has arranged or has an understanding with any person to participate in the distribution of the old notes:






	




	cannot rely on the applicable interpretations of the staff of the SEC;








	




	will not be entitled to participate in the exchange offer; and








	




	must comply with the registration and prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act in connection with any resale
	transaction.






	        Each
	broker-dealer that receives new notes for its own account in exchange for old notes, where such old notes were acquired by such broker-dealer as a result of market-making activities
	or other trading activities, must acknowledge that it will deliver a prospectus in connection with any resale of such new notes. See "Plan of Distribution." The letter of transmittal states that by so
	acknowledging and by delivering a prospectus, a broker-dealer will not be deemed to admit that it is an "underwriter" within the meaning of the Securities Act.





	Acceptance of Old Notes for Exchange; Delivery of New Notes





	        Upon satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions to each exchange offer, we will accept, promptly after the expiration date, all
	old notes properly tendered pursuant thereto and will issue the new notes promptly after acceptance of the old notes. See "Conditions to the Exchange Offers." For purposes of the exchange
	offers, we will be
	deemed to have accepted properly tendered old notes for exchange if and when we give oral (confirmed in writing) or written notice to the exchange agent.




	        The
	holder of each old note accepted for exchange will receive a new note in an amount equal to the surrendered old note. Holders of new notes on the relevant record date for the first
	interest payment date following the consummation of the applicable exchange offer will receive interest accruing from the most recent date to which interest has been paid on the old notes. Holders of
	new notes will not receive any payment in respect of accrued interest on old notes otherwise payable on any interest payment date, the record date for which occurs on or prior to the consummation of
	the applicable exchange offer.




	        In
	all cases, issuance of new notes for old notes that are accepted for exchange will be made only after timely receipt by the exchange agent
	of:






	




	certificates for such old notes or a timely book-entry confirmation of such old notes into the exchange agent's account at
	DTC;








	




	a properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal or an agent's message in lieu thereof; and








	




	all other required documents.






	        If
	any tendered old notes are not accepted for any reason set forth in the terms and conditions of the applicable exchange offer or if old notes are submitted for a greater principal
	amount than the holder desires to exchange, such unaccepted or non-exchanged old notes will be returned without expense to the tendering holder (or, in the case of old notes tendered by book entry
	transfer into the exchange agent's account at DTC pursuant to the book-entry procedures described below, such




	28











	Table of Contents





	non-exchanged
	old notes will be credited to an account maintained with DTC promptly upon the expiration or termination of that exchange offer).





	Book-Entry Transfers





	        For purposes of each exchange offer, the exchange agent will request that an account be established with respect to the old notes at
	DTC within two business days after the date of this prospectus, unless the exchange agent has already established an account with DTC suitable for that exchange offer. Any financial institution that
	is a participant in DTC may make book-entry delivery of old notes by causing DTC to transfer such old notes into the exchange agent's account at DTC in accordance with DTC's procedures for transfer.
	Although delivery of old notes may be effected through book-entry transfer at DTC, the letter of transmittal or facsimile thereof or an agent's message in lieu thereof, with any required signature
	guarantees and any other required documents, must, in any case, be transmitted to and received by the exchange agent at one of the addresses set forth under "Exchange Agent" on or prior
	to the expiration date.





	Withdrawal Rights





	        You may withdraw your tender of old notes at any time prior to the expiration date. To be effective, a written notice of withdrawal
	must be received by the exchange agent at one of the addresses set forth under "Exchange Agent." This notice must specify:






	




	the name of the person having tendered the old notes to be withdrawn;








	




	the old notes to be withdrawn (including the principal amount of such old notes); and








	




	where certificates for old notes have been transmitted, the name in which such old notes are registered, if different from
	that of the withdrawing holder.






	        If
	certificates for old notes have been delivered or otherwise identified to the exchange agent, then, prior to the release of such certificates, the withdrawing holder must also submit
	the serial numbers of the particular certificates to be withdrawn and a signed notice of withdrawal with signatures guaranteed by an eligible institution, unless such holder is an eligible
	institution. If old notes have been tendered pursuant to the procedure for book-entry transfer described above, any notice of withdrawal must specify the name and number of the account at DTC to be
	credited with the withdrawn old notes and otherwise comply with the procedures of DTC.




	        We
	or the exchange agent will make a final and binding determination on all questions as to the validity, form and eligibility (including time of receipt) of such notices. Any old notes
	so withdrawn will be deemed not to have been validly tendered for exchange for purposes of the exchange offer for that series of notes. Any old notes tendered for exchange but not exchanged for any
	reason will be returned to the holder without cost to such holder (or, in the case of old notes tendered by book-entry transfer into the exchange agent's account at DTC pursuant to the book-entry
	transfer procedures described above, such old notes will be credited to an account maintained with DTC for the old notes as soon as practicable after withdrawal, rejection of tender or termination of
	that exchange offer). Properly withdrawn old notes may be retendered by following one of the procedures described under "Exchange Offer Procedures" above at any time on or prior to the
	expiration date.

	Conditions to the Exchange Offers





	        Notwithstanding any other provision of the exchange offers, we are not required to accept for exchange, or to issue new notes in
	exchange for, any old notes and may terminate or amend the applicable exchange offer, if any of the following events occur prior to acceptance of such old notes:






	(1)




	the
	exchange offer violates any applicable law or applicable interpretation of the staff of the SEC;






	(2)




	there
	is threatened, instituted or pending any action or proceeding before, or any injunction, order or decree has been issued by, any court or governmental
	agency or other governmental regulatory or administrative agency or commission,








	




	seeking to restrain or prohibit the making or consummation of the exchange offer or any other transaction contemplated by
	the exchange offer, or assessing or seeking any damages as a result thereof, or








	




	resulting in a material delay in our ability to accept for exchange or exchange some or all of the old notes pursuant to
	the exchange offer;








	(3)




	any
	statute, rule, regulation, order or injunction has been sought, proposed, introduced, enacted, promulgated or deemed applicable to the exchange offer or
	any of the transactions contemplated in the exchange offer by any government or governmental authority, domestic or foreign, or any action has been taken, proposed or threatened, by any government,
	governmental authority, agency or court, domestic or foreign, that in our sole judgment might, directly or indirectly, result in any of the consequences referred to in clauses (1) or
	(2) above or, in our reasonable judgment, might result in the holders of new notes having obligations with respect to resales and transfers of new notes which are greater than those described
	in the interpretation of the SEC referred to on the cover page of this prospectus, or would otherwise make it inadvisable to proceed with the exchange offer; or






	(4)




	there
	has occurred:








	




	any general suspension of or general limitation on prices for, or trading in, our securities on any national securities
	exchange or in the over-the-counter market,








	




	any limitation by a governmental agency or authority which may adversely affect our ability to complete the transactions
	contemplated by the exchange offer,








	




	a declaration of a banking moratorium or any suspension of payments in respect of banks in the United States or any
	limitation by any governmental agency or authority which adversely affects the extension of credit, or








	




	a commencement of a war, armed hostilities or other similar international calamity directly or indirectly involving the
	United States, or, in the case of any of the foregoing existing at the time of the commencement of the exchange offer, a material acceleration or worsening thereof;








	which
	in our reasonable judgment in any case, and regardless of the circumstances (including any action by us) giving rise to any such condition, makes it inadvisable to proceed with the exchange
	offer and/or with such acceptance for exchange or with such exchange.




	        The
	foregoing conditions are for our sole benefit and may be asserted by us regardless of the circumstances giving rise to any condition or may be waived by us in whole or in part at any
	time in our reasonable discretion. Our failure at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights will not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right will be deemed an ongoing right
	which may be asserted at any time.




	30











	Table of Contents





	        In
	addition, we will not accept for exchange any old notes tendered, and no new notes will be issued in exchange for any such old notes, if at such time any stop order is threatened or
	in effect with respect to the registration statement, of which this prospectus constitutes a part, or the qualification of the indenture under the Trust Indenture Act.

	DELIVERY OF THE LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL TO AN ADDRESS OTHER THAN AS SET FORTH ABOVE OR TRANSMISSION OF SUCH LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL VIA FACSIMILE OTHER THAN AS SET
	FORTH ABOVE DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A VALID DELIVERY OF THE LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL.






	Fees and Expenses





	        The principal solicitation is being made by mail by U.S. Bank National Association, as exchange agent. We will pay the exchange agent
	customary fees for its services, reimburse the exchange agent for its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the provision of these services and pay other registration expenses,
	including fees and expenses of the trustee under the indenture relating to the new notes, filing fees, blue sky fees and printing and distribution expenses. We will not make any payment to brokers,
	dealers or others soliciting acceptances of the exchange offers.




	        Additional
	solicitation may be made by telephone, facsimile or in person by our and our affiliates' officers and regular employees and by persons so engaged by the exchange agent.





	Accounting Treatment





	        We will record the new notes at the same carrying value as the old notes, as reflected in our accounting records on the date of the
	exchange. Accordingly, we will not recognize any gain or loss for accounting purposes. The expenses of the exchange offers will be expensed as incurred.





	Transfer Taxes





	        Holders who tender their old notes for exchange will not be obligated to pay any related transfer taxes, except that holders who
	instruct us to register new notes in the name of, or request that old notes not tendered or not accepted in the exchange offers be returned to, a person other than the registered tendering holder will
	be responsible for the payment of any applicable transfer taxes.





	Consequences of Exchanging or Failing to Exchange Old Notes





	        If you do not exchange your old notes for new notes in the applicable exchange offer, your old notes will continue to be subject to the
	provisions of the indenture relating to the old notes regarding transfer and exchange of the old notes and the restrictions on transfer of the old notes described in the legend on your certificates.
	These transfer restrictions are required because the old notes were issued




	31











	Table of Contents





	under
	an exemption from, or in transactions not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. In general, the old notes may not be offered or
	sold unless registered under the Securities Act, except under an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. We do not plan to register
	the old notes under the Securities Act. Based on interpretations by the staff of the SEC, as set forth in no-action letters issued to third parties, we believe that the new notes you receive in the
	exchange offers may be offered for resale, resold or otherwise transferred without compliance with the registration and prospectus delivery provisions of the Securities Act. However, you will not be
	able to freely transfer the new notes, and, to the extent described below, you will not be entitled to participate in the exchange offers if:






	




	you are our "affiliate," as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act;








	




	you are not acquiring the new notes in the exchange offer in the ordinary course of your business;








	




	you have an arrangement or understanding with any person to participate in the distribution, as defined in the Securities
	Act, of the new notes you will receive in any exchange offer; or








	




	you are holding old notes that have, or are reasonably likely to have, the status of an unsold allotment in the initial
	offering.






	        We
	do not intend to request the SEC to consider, and the SEC has not considered, the exchange offers in the context of a similar no-action letter. As a result, we cannot guarantee that
	the staff of the SEC would make a similar determination with respect to the exchange offers as in the circumstances described in the no action letters discussed above. Each holder, other than a
	broker-dealer, must acknowledge that it is not engaged in, and does not intend to engage in, a distribution of new notes and has no arrangement or understanding to participate in a distribution of new
	notes. If you are our affiliate, are engaged in or intend to engage in a distribution of the new notes or have any arrangement or understanding with respect to the distribution of the new notes you
	will receive in either exchange offer, you may not rely on the applicable interpretations of the staff of the SEC, you will not be entitled to participate in that exchange offer and you must comply
	with the registration and prospectus
	delivery requirements of the Securities Act in connection with any resale transaction. If you are a participating broker-dealer, you must acknowledge that you will deliver a prospectus in connection
	with any resale of the new notes. In addition, to comply with state securities laws, you may not offer or sell the new notes in any state unless they have been registered or qualified for sale in that
	state or an exemption from registration or qualification is available and is complied with. The offer and sale of the new notes to "qualified institutional buyers" (as defined in Rule 144A of
	the Securities Act) is generally exempt from registration or qualification under state securities laws. We do not plan to register or qualify the sale of the new notes in any state where an exemption
	from registration or qualification is required and not available.





	Other





	        Participation in the exchange offers is voluntary, and you should consider carefully whether to accept. You are urged to consult your
	financial and tax advisors in making your own decision on what action to take.

	DESCRIPTION OF THE NEW NOTES






	        We issued the old 2020 notes under an indenture, dated as of July 16, 2012 (as supplemented, the "2020 Indenture"), among us,
	the subsidiary guarantors and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"). We issued the old 2022 notes under an indenture, dated as of August 13, 2013 (as supplemented, the
	"2022 Indenture"), among us, the subsidiary guarantors and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee. We refer the old 2020 notes and the new 2020 notes together as the "2020 notes" and the old 2022
	notes and the new 2022 notes together as the "2022 notes." We refer to the 2020 Indenture and the 2022 Indenture together as the "Indentures." We will issue each series of new notes under the same
	indenture under which we issued the corresponding series of old notes, and the new notes will represent the same debt as the old notes for which they are exchanged.




	        The
	Indentures are governed by the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (the "Trust Indenture Act"). The terms of the notes include those stated in the Indentures and those made part of the
	Indentures by reference to the Trust Indenture Act. The registration rights agreements referred to under the caption "Registration Rights" set forth the rights holders of the old notes
	have to require us to register their notes with the SEC.




	        Each
	series of old notes that remain outstanding after the completion of the exchange offers, together with the corresponding series of new notes, will be treated as a single class of
	securities under the applicable Indenture. Otherwise unqualified references herein to "notes" shall, unless the context requires otherwise, include the old notes and the new notes, and all references
	to specified percentages in aggregate principal amount of the notes shall be deemed to mean, at any time after the exchange offers are completed, such percentage in aggregate principal amount of the
	old notes and the new notes then outstanding.




	        The
	terms of the new notes will be substantially identical to the terms of the old notes, except that the new notes:






	




	will have been registered under the Securities Act;








	




	will not be subject to transfer restrictions applicable to the old notes; and








	




	will not have the benefit of the registration rights agreement applicable to the old notes.






	        The
	following description is a summary of the material provisions of the Indentures and the registration rights agreements. It does not restate those agreements in their entirety. We
	urge you to read the applicable Indenture(s) and the registration rights agreement(s) because they, and not this description, define your rights as Holders of these notes. You may request copies of
	the Indenture and the registration rights agreement at the address set forth under the heading "Additional Information."




	        You
	can find the definitions of certain capitalized terms used in this description that are not otherwise defined in this description under the subheadings "Certain
	Definitions," and "Registration Rights." In this description, the word "Company" refers only to Halcón Resources Corporation and not to any of its subsidiaries.





	Brief Description of the Notes








	The Notes







	        The old 2020 notes that are subject to this exchange offer were issued on December 19, 2013 in an aggregate principal amount of
	$400.0 million and the old 2022 notes were issued on August 13, 2013 in an aggregate principal amount of $400.0 million.




	33











	Table of Contents





	        These
	notes:






	




	will be general unsecured senior obligations of the Company;








	




	will be equal in right of payment to all existing and future senior Indebtedness of the Company;








	




	will be effectively subordinate in right of payment to any secured Indebtedness of the Company to the extent of the
	collateral securing such Indebtedness, including Indebtedness under the Company's senior secured revolving credit facility;








	




	will be senior in right of payment to any future subordinated Indebtedness of the Company; and








	




	will be unconditionally guaranteed by the Guarantors.









	The Subsidiary Guarantees







	        The new notes will be jointly and severally guaranteed by each of the Company's present Restricted Subsidiaries and its future domestic
	Restricted Subsidiaries.




	        The
	Subsidiary Guarantees of the new notes:






	




	will be general unsecured senior obligations of each Guarantor;








	




	will be equal in right of payment to all existing and future senior Indebtedness of each Guarantor;








	




	will be effectively subordinate in right of payment to any secured Indebtedness of each Guarantor to the extent of the
	collateral securing such Indebtedness, including Indebtedness of the Guarantors under the Company's senior secured revolving credit facility; and








	




	will be senior in right of payment to any future subordinated Indebtedness of each Guarantor.






	        As
	of the date of each Indenture, substantially all of the Company's Subsidiaries were both Guarantors and "Restricted Subsidiaries." However, the Subsidiary Guarantee of a Guarantor is
	subject to release in certain instances as described under the subheading "Subsidiary Guarantees," and under the circumstances described below under the subheading "Certain
	DefinitionsUnrestricted Subsidiary," the Company will be permitted to designate certain of its Subsidiaries as "Unrestricted Subsidiaries." Unrestricted Subsidiaries will be not subject
	to many of the restrictive covenants in the Indenture. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not guarantee these notes.





	Principal, Maturity and Interest





	        We issued the old 2020 notes in the principal amount of $400.0 million, which were an additional issuance of 2020 notes that we
	originally issued in the principal amount of $750.0 million in July 2012, and we issued the old 2022 notes in the aggregate principal amount of $400.0 million. We may issue additional
	notes of either series without the consent of the Holders of such series but subject to the provisions of the applicable Indenture as described below under the caption "Certain
	CovenantsIncurrence of Indebtedness," provided, however, in no event may the Company issue any additional notes of a series if, as a result of any such issuance, the aggregate principal
	amount of notes of that series outstanding would exceed the maximum aggregate principal amount of notes permitted under the Existing Credit Facility or any other Credit Facilities, in each case as in
	effect on the date of such issuance, and provided, further, that the additional notes are fungible with the old notes of the same series for U.S. federal income tax purposes so that such additional
	notes will trade as part of a single class with the old notes. The old notes and any additional notes of the same series subsequently issued under the applicable Indenture, including the new notes
	issued in the exchange offers, will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the applicable Indenture, including, without limitation, waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to
	purchase. Unless otherwise provided or the context otherwise




	34











	Table of Contents





	requires,
	for all purposes of the applicable Indenture and this "Description of the New Notes," references to the notes include any additional notes and new notes actually issued.




	        The
	Company will issue the new notes in minimum denominations of $2,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.




	        Interest
	on the 2020 notes will accrue at the rate of 9.75% per year and will be payable semiannually in arrears on January 15 and July 15. The Company will make each
	interest payment to the Holders of
	record of the notes on the immediately preceding January 1 and July 1. Interest on the 2020 notes accrues from the date interest was most recently paid, which was January 15,
	2014. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. The 2020 notes will mature on July 15, 2020.




	        Interest
	on the 2022 notes will accrue at the rate of 9.25% per year and will be payable semiannually in arrears on February 15 and August 15. The Company will make each
	interest payment to the Holders of record of the notes on the immediately preceding February 1 and August 1. Interest on the 2022 notes accrues from the date it was most recently paid,
	which was February 15, 2014. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. The 2022 notes will mature on February 15, 2022.




	        The
	interest rate on the notes subject to this exchange offer is subject to increase if the registration statement to which this prospectus relates is not declared effective on a timely
	basis or if certain other conditions specified by the registration rights agreements are not satisfied, all as further described under the caption "Registration Rights." All references to
	interest on the notes include any such additional interest that may be payable.





	Methods of Receiving Payments on the Notes





	        If a Holder of not less than $5.0 million aggregate principal amount of any notes has given wire transfer instructions to the
	Company, the Company will make all principal, premium and interest payments to the Holder of such notes in accordance with those instructions. All other payments on the notes will be made at the
	office or agency of the Paying Agent within the City and State of New York unless the Company elects to make interest payments by check mailed to the Holders at their addresses set forth in the
	register of Holders.




	        The
	Company will make all principal, premium and interest payments on each note in global form registered in the name of The Depository Trust Company ("DTC") or its nominee in
	immediately available funds to DTC or its nominee, as the case may be, as the Holder of such global note.





	Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes





	        The Trustee currently acts as Paying Agent and Registrar. The Company may change the Paying Agent or Registrar without prior notice to
	the Holders of the notes, and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar.





	Transfer and Exchange





	        A Holder may transfer or exchange notes in accordance with the applicable Indenture. The Registrar and the Trustee may require a
	Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and the Company may require a Holder to pay any taxes and fees required by law or permitted by the Indenture. The
	Company is not required to transfer or exchange any note selected for redemption. Also, the Company is not required to transfer or exchange any note for a period of 15 days before a selection
	of notes to be redeemed.




	        The
	Holder of a note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes.

	Table of Contents






	Subsidiary Guarantees





	        The Guarantors will jointly and severally guarantee the Company's obligations under these notes on a senior unsecured basis. The
	obligations of each Guarantor under its Subsidiary Guarantee will be limited in a manner intended to prevent that Subsidiary Guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance under applicable laws,
	although no assurance can be given that a court would give the Holders the benefit of such a provision. Please read "Risk FactorsRisks Relating to Our Indebtedness and the
	NotesA subsidiary guarantee could be voided if it constitutes a fraudulent transfer under United States bankruptcy or similar state law, which would prevent the holders of the notes from
	relying on that subsidiary to satisfy claims."




	        Except
	in a transaction resulting in the release of a Subsidiary Guarantee of a Guarantor, the Company will not permit a Guarantor to sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially
	all of its assets, or consolidate with or merge with or into (whether or not such Guarantor is the surviving Person), another Person (other than the Company or another Guarantor)
	unless:






	(1)




	immediately
	after giving effect to that transaction, no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing; and






	(2)




	the
	Person acquiring the assets in any such sale or disposition or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than such
	Guarantor) assumes all the obligations of that Guarantor under its Subsidiary Guarantee pursuant to a supplemental indenture satisfactory to the Trustee.






	        The
	Subsidiary Guarantee of a Guarantor will be released in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Indenture governing the particular series of
	notes:






	(1)




	in
	connection with any sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of that Guarantor (including by way of merger or consolidation)
	other than to the Company or another Guarantor, if such transaction complies with the provisions of the Indenture described under the caption "Repurchase at the Option of
	HoldersAsset Sales;"






	(2)




	in
	connection with any sale or other disposition of the Capital Stock of a Guarantor (including by way of merger or consolidation) other than to the Company
	or another Guarantor, if such transaction complies with the provisions of the Indenture described under the caption "Repurchase at the Option of HoldersAsset Sales" and the
	Guarantor ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company as a result of such transaction;






	(3)




	if
	the Company designates any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture; or






	(4)




	if
	the Company effects a Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance as described under "Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance" or if it
	satisfies and discharges the Indenture as described under "Satisfaction and Discharge."

	Selection and Notice





	        If less than all of the notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Trustee will select notes for redemption as
	follows:






	(1)




	if
	the notes are listed, in compliance with the requirements of the principal national securities exchange on which the notes are listed; or






	(2)




	if
	the notes are not so listed, on a pro rata basis.






	        Notes
	or portions of notes the Trustee selects for redemption shall be in minimum amounts of $2,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. Notices of redemption shall be mailed
	by first class mail at least 30 but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of notes to be
	redeemed at its registered address, except that notices of redemption may be mailed more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the
	notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture. Notices of redemption may not be conditional, except that a notice of redemption to be made with proceeds of an Equity Offering under the first
	paragraph of "Optional Redemption" may be conditioned on completion of such Equity Offering.




	        If
	any note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. A new note in
	principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the original note will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original note. Notes called for redemption become due on
	the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on notes or portions of them called for redemption.

	Mandatory Redemption; Offers to Purchase; Open Market Purchases





	        The Company is not required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the notes. However, under certain
	circumstances, the Company may be required to offer to purchase notes as described under the captions "Repurchase at the Option of HoldersChange of Control" and
	"Asset Sales." The Company may at any time and from time to time purchase notes in the open market or otherwise.





	Repurchase at the Option of Holders







	Change of Control






	        If a Change of Control occurs, unless the Company has previously or concurrently exercised its right to redeem all of the notes as
	described under "Optional Redemption," each Holder of notes will have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or any part (equal to $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in
	excess thereof) of that Holder's notes pursuant to the offer described below (the "Change of Control Offer"). In the Change of Control Offer, the Company will offer a payment (the "Change of Control
	Payment") in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders
	of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on an interest payment date that is on or prior to the date of purchase).




	        Within
	30 days following any Change of Control, the Company will mail a notice to each Holder describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control and
	offering to repurchase notes on the Change of Control Payment Date specified in such notice, which date will be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice
	is mailed, pursuant to the procedures required by the applicable Indenture and described in such notice. The Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and
	any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the notes as a result of a Change of Control. To the
	extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the covenant described herein, the Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and
	regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under this covenant by virtue of the Company's compliance with such securities laws or regulations.




	        On
	the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company will, to the extent lawful:






	(1)




	accept
	for payment all notes or portions thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;






	(2)




	deposit
	with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all notes or portions thereof so tendered; and






	(3)




	deliver
	or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the notes so accepted together with an officers' certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of notes
	or portions thereof being purchased by the Company.






	        The
	Paying Agent will promptly mail to each Holder of notes so tendered and not withdrawn the Change of Control Payment for such tendered notes, with such payments to be made through the
	facilities of DTC for all notes in global form, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book entry) to each Holder a new note equal in principal amount to
	any unpurchased portion of the notes surrendered, if any, by such Holder; provided that each such new note will be in a principal amount of $2,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.




	        The
	Company will publicly announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date.




	39











	Table of Contents





	        The
	provisions described above that require the Company to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control will be applicable regardless of whether or not any other
	provisions of the applicable Indenture are applicable. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture will not contain provisions that permit the Holders of the notes to
	require that the Company repurchase or redeem the notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction.




	        Also,
	the Company's senior secured revolving credit facility currently treats certain change of control events with respect to the Company as an event of default entitling the lenders to
	terminate all further lending commitments, to accelerate all loans then outstanding and to exercise other remedies. The occurrence of a Change of Control may result in a default under future
	Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and give the lenders thereunder the right to require the Company to repay obligations outstanding thereunder. Moreover, the exercise by Holders of
	their right to require the Company to repurchase the notes could cause a default under such future Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such
	repurchase on the Company. The Company's ability to repurchase notes following a Change of Control also may be limited by the Company's then existing financial resources.




	        The
	Company will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if (1) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and
	otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the applicable Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Company and purchases all notes validly tendered and not
	withdrawn under
	such Change of Control Offer, or (2) a notice of redemption for all outstanding notes has been given, unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption price.




	        A
	Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, and conditioned upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change
	of Control at the time of making the Change of Control Offer.




	        The
	definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of "all or substantially all" of the assets of the Company
	and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase "substantially all," there is no precise established definition of the phrase under
	applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a Holder of notes to require the Company to repurchase such notes as a result of a sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less than all
	of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole may be uncertain. In addition, Holders of notes may not be entitled to require the Company to repurchase their notes in certain
	circumstances involving a significant change in the composition of the Board of Directors of the Company, including in connection with a proxy contest, where the Company's Board of Directors does not
	endorse a dissident slate of directors but approves them for purposes of the Indenture.




	        If
	Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding notes validly tender and do not withdraw such notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Company, or any
	other Person making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Company as described above, purchases all of the notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Company will have the right,
	upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem all
	notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a redemption price in cash equal to the applicable Change of Control Payment plus, to the extent not included in the Change of Control Payment,
	accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of redemption (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on an interest payment date that is on or
	prior to the date of purchase).

	Asset Sales






	        The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, consummate an Asset Sale
	unless:






	(1)




	the
	Company (or the Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) receives consideration at the time of such Asset Sale at least equal to the Fair Market Value
	of the Equity Interests or other assets issued or sold or otherwise disposed of; and






	(2)




	(A)
	at least 75% of the aggregate consideration therefor received by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, from such Asset Sale and
	all other Asset Sales since the Issue Date, on a cumulative basis, is in the form of cash, Cash Equivalents or assets of the type referred to in clauses (2) or (3) of the next succeeding
	paragraph, or any combination of the foregoing (together, "Permitted Consideration") or (B) the Fair Market Value of all forms of consideration other than Permitted Consideration since the
	Issue Date does not exceed in the aggregate 10% of the ACNTA of the Company at the time when such determination is made. For purposes of this provision, each of the following shall be deemed to be
	cash:






	(a)




	any
	liabilities (as shown on the Company's or such Restricted Subsidiary's most recent balance sheet) of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (other
	than contingent liabilities and liabilities that are by their terms subordinated to the notes or any Subsidiary Guarantee) that are assumed by the transferee of any such assets pursuant to a customary
	novation agreement or similar agreement that releases the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary from further liability; and






	(b)




	any
	securities, notes or other obligations received by the Company or any such Restricted Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted within
	180 days by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash (to the extent of the cash received in that conversion).








	        Within
	the later of (x) one year after the date of receipt of any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale and (y) six months after the date of an agreement entered into within such
	one-year period committing the Company to make an acquisition or expenditure referred to in clauses (2) or (3) below, the Company
	may apply such Net Proceeds at its option, in any one or more of the following:






	(1)




	to
	repay, prepay, redeem or repurchase the Senior Debt of the Company or any Guarantor; provided that any reduction in outstanding Indebtedness under any
	revolving credit facility shall be deemed to have been made temporarily pursuant to the next-following paragraph and not under this clause (1) unless the Board of Directors of the Company shall
	determine otherwise;






	(2)




	to
	acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or a majority of the Voting Stock of, a Company principally engaged in the Oil and Gas Business that
	will, upon such acquisition, become a Restricted Subsidiary; or






	(3)




	to
	make capital expenditures or to acquire properties or assets, in each case that are used or useful in the Oil and Gas Business.






	        Pending
	the final application of any such Net Proceeds, the Company may temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest such Net Proceeds in any manner not prohibited
	by the applicable Indenture.




	41





















	Table of Contents





	        Any Net Proceeds from Asset Sales that are not applied or invested as provided in the preceding paragraph will constitute "Excess Proceeds." When the aggregate
	amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $25.0 million, the Company will make an offer (the "Asset Sale Offer") to all Holders of notes and, to the extent required by the terms thereof, all holders of
	other Indebtedness that is pari passu with the notes containing provisions similar to those set forth in the applicable Indenture with respect to offers to purchase or redeem with the proceeds of
	sales of assets to purchase the maximum principal amount of notes and such other pari passu Indebtedness that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds. The offer price in any Asset Sale Offer will
	be equal to 100% of principal amount (or accreted value in the case of any such other pari passu Indebtedness issued with a significant original issue discount) plus accrued and unpaid interest, if
	any, to the date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on an interest payment date that is on or prior to the date of purchase),
	and will be payable in cash. If any Excess Proceeds remain after consummation of an Asset Sale Offer, the Company may use such Excess Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the
	applicable Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of notes and such other pari passu Indebtedness tendered into such Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Trustee shall
	select the notes and such other pari passu Indebtedness to be purchased on a pro rata basis, on the basis of the aggregate principal amounts (or accreted values) tendered in round denominations (which
	in the case of the notes will be minimum denominations of $2,000 principal amount or multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof). Upon completion of each Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds
	shall be reset at zero.




	        The
	Company will publicly announce the results of the Asset Sale Offer on or as soon as practicable after the date such Asset Sale Offer is completed.




	        The
	Company will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws and regulations
	are applicable in connection with an Asset Sale Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the covenant described herein, the
	Company will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under this covenant by virtue of the Company's compliance with such
	securities laws or regulations.





	Certain Covenants








	Restricted Payments







	        The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly:






	(1)




	declare
	or pay any dividend or make any other payment or distribution on account of the Company's or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries' Equity Interests
	(including, without limitation, any payment by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in connection with any merger or consolidation involving the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) or
	to the direct or indirect holders of the Company's or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries' Equity Interests in their capacity as such (other than dividends or distributions payable in Equity Interests

	Subordinated
	Indebtedness of the Company or any Guarantor, except (a) a payment of interest or principal on or after the date when due or within three business days prior thereto, (b) in

	acquisition or retirement or (c) payments on Indebtedness owed to the Company or a Guarantor; or






	(4)




	make
	any Investment other than a Permitted Investment (all such payments and other actions set forth in clauses (1) through (3) above and this

	(1)




	no
	Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would occur as a consequence thereof;






	(2)




	the
	Company would, at the time of such Restricted Payment and after giving pro forma effect thereto as if such Restricted Payment had been made at the
	beginning of the applicable four-quarter period, have been permitted to incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test set forth in the first
	paragraph of the covenant described below under the caption "Incurrence of Indebtedness;" and






	(3)




	such
	Restricted Payment, together with the aggregate amount of all other Restricted Payments made by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries after the
	Issue Date (excluding Restricted Payments permitted by clauses (2), (3), (4), (6), (7), (8), (9), (10), (11), (12) or (13) of the next succeeding paragraph, but including
	Restricted Payments permitted by clauses (1), (5) and (14) of such paragraph), is less than the sum, without duplication, of:






	(a)




	50%
	of the Consolidated Net Income of the Company for the period (taken as one accounting period) from July 1, 2012 to the end of the Company's most
	recently ended fiscal quarter for which internal financial statements are available at the time of such Restricted Payment (or, if such Consolidated Net Income for such period is a deficit, less 100%
	of such deficit); plus






	(b)




	100%
	of the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds and 100% of the Fair Market Value of securities or other property other than cash (including Capital Stock of

	Equity Interests of the Company (other than Disqualified Stock), other than Equity Interests (or Disqualified Stock or debt securities) sold to a Subsidiary of the Company or to an employee stock
	ownership plan or to a trust established by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for the benefit of their employees; plus






	(c)




	the
	amount by which Indebtedness is reduced on the Company's consolidated balance sheet upon the conversion or exchange (other than by a Subsidiary of the
	Company) subsequent to the Issue Date of any Indebtedness convertible or exchangeable for Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Company (plus the amount of any accrued interest then
	outstanding on such Indebtedness to the extent the obligation to pay such interest is extinguished less the amount of any cash, or the Fair Market Value of any property (as determined in good faith by

	ownership plan or to a trust established by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for the benefit of their employees); plus






	(d)




	an
	amount equal to the sum of (i) the net reduction in the Investments (other than Permitted Investments) made by the Company or any Restricted
	Subsidiary in any Person resulting from repurchases, repayments or redemptions of such Investments by such Person, proceeds realized on the sale of such Investments and proceeds representing the
	return of capital (excluding dividends and distributions to the extent included in Consolidated Net Income), in each case received by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary since the Issue Date, and
	(ii) to the extent such Person is an Unrestricted Subsidiary, the portion (proportionate to the Company's equity interest in such Subsidiary) of the Fair Market Value of the net assets of such
	Unrestricted Subsidiary at the time such Unrestricted Subsidiary is designated a Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however, that to the extent the foregoing sum exceeds, in the case of any such Person
	or Unrestricted Subsidiary, the amount of Investments (excluding Permitted Investments) previously made (and treated as a Restricted Payment) by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in such Person
	or Unrestricted Subsidiary since the Issue Date, such excess shall not be included in this clause (d) unless the amount represented by such excess has not been and will not be taken into
	account in one of the foregoing clauses (a)-(c).








	        The
	preceding provisions will not prohibit:






	(1)




	the
	payment of any dividend within 60 days after the date of declaration thereof, if at said date of declaration such payment would have complied

	(2)




	the
	redemption, repurchase, retirement, defeasance or other acquisition of any Subordinated Indebtedness of the Company or any Guarantor or of any Equity

	Interests of the Company (other than Disqualified Stock); provided that the amount of any such Net Cash Proceeds that are utilized for any such redemption, repurchase, retirement, defeasance or other
	acquisition shall be excluded from clause (3)(b) of the preceding paragraph;

	Restricted
	Payment by this covenant shall be evidenced by an officers' certificate which shall be delivered to the Trustee not later than five Business Days following the date of the making of any
	Restricted Payment. Such officers' certificate shall state that such Restricted Payment is permitted, together with a copy of any related resolution of the Board of Directors.




	        For
	purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, if a Restricted Payment meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Restricted Payments described in
	clauses (1)-(14) above, the Company, in its sole discretion, may order and classify, and subsequently reorder and reclassify, such Restricted Payment in any manner in compliance with this
	covenant.







	Incurrence of Indebtedness







	        The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, issue, assume,
	guarantee or otherwise become directly or indirectly liable, contingently or otherwise, with respect to (collectively, "incur") any Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt); provided, however, that the
	Company and any Guarantor may incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt), if the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Company's most recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which internal
	financial statements are available immediately preceding the date on which such additional Indebtedness is incurred would have been at least 2.0 to 1, determined on a pro forma basis (including a pro
	forma application of the Net Cash Proceeds therefrom), as if the additional Indebtedness had been incurred at the beginning of such four-quarter period.




	        The
	first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the incurrence of any of the following items of Indebtedness (collectively, "Permitted Indebtedness"):






	(1)




	the
	incurrence by the Company and any Guarantor of the Indebtedness under Credit Facilities; provided that the aggregate principal amount of all
	Indebtedness of the Company and the Guarantors outstanding at any time under this clause (1) under all Credit Facilities after giving effect to such incurrence does not exceed an amount equal
	to the greater of (a) $750.0 million less the aggregate amount of all principal repayments since the Issue Date under a Credit Facility that are made under clause (1) of the
	second paragraph of the covenant described under "Repurchase at the Option of HoldersAsset Sales" and (b) 30.0% of ACNTA;






	(2)




	the
	incurrence by the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries of Existing Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness described under clause (1),
	(3) or (6) of this paragraph);






	(3)




	the
	incurrence by the Company and the Guarantors of Indebtedness represented by (a) the old notes and the Subsidiary Guarantees, and (b) any
	new notes issued pursuant to the registration rights agreements in exchange for the old notes, and any Subsidiary Guarantees related thereto;






	(4)




	the
	incurrence by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness represented by Capital Lease Obligations, mortgage financings,
	industrial revenue bonds, purchase money obligations or other Indebtedness or preferred stock, or synthetic lease obligations, in each case, incurred for the purpose of financing all or any part of
	the purchase price or cost of design, development, construction, installation or improvement of property (real or personal and including Capital Stock), plant or equipment used in the business of the
	Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (in each case, whether through the direct purchase of such assets or the Equity Interests of any Person owning such assets), in an aggregate principal
	amount, taken together with Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof, not to exceed $50.0 million at any time outstanding;






	(5)




	the
	incurrence by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness in exchange for, or the Net Cash Proceeds of which
	are used to refund,

	refinance
	or replace, Indebtedness (other than intercompany Indebtedness) that was permitted by the applicable Indenture to be incurred under the first paragraph of this covenant or clause (2),
	(3), (4) or (13) or this clause (5) of this paragraph;






	(6)




	the
	incurrence by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of intercompany Indebtedness between or among the Company and any of its Restricted
	Subsidiaries; provided, however, that:






	(a)




	(i)
	if the Company is the obligor on such Indebtedness, such Indebtedness must be expressly subordinated to the prior payment in full in cash of all
	obligations with respect to the notes, and (ii) if a Guarantor is the obligor of such Indebtedness, such Indebtedness must be expressly subordinated to the prior payment in full in cash of all
	obligations of such Guarantor with respect to its Subsidiary Guarantee; and






	(b)




	(i)
	any subsequent issuance or transfer of Equity Interests that results in any such Indebtedness being held by a Person other than the Company or a
	Restricted Subsidiary thereof and (ii) any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person that is not either the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary thereof, shall be deemed, in
	each case, to constitute an incurrence of such Indebtedness by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, that was not permitted by this clause;








	(7)




	in-kind
	obligations relating to net oil and natural gas balancing positions arising in the ordinary course of business;






	(8)

	accrual of interest, accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest on any Indebtedness in the form of additional
	Indebtedness with the same terms, and the payment of dividends on Disqualified Stock, in the form of additional shares of the same class of Disqualified Stock;






	(9)




	any
	obligations in respect of completion bonds, performance bonds, bid bonds, appeal bonds, surety bonds, bankers acceptances, letters of credit, insurance
	obligations or bonds and other similar bonds and obligations incurred by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary in the ordinary course of business and any Guarantees or letters of credit functioning
	as or supporting any of the foregoing bonds or obligations;






	(10)




	any
	obligation (including deferred premiums) under Interest Rate Agreements, Currency Agreements and Commodity Agreements; provided, that such Interest
	Rate Agreements, Currency Agreements and Commodity Agreements are related to business transactions of the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries and are entered into for bona fide hedging purposes of
	the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or senior management of the Company);






	(11)




	any
	obligation arising from agreements of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary providing for indemnification, Guarantee, adjustment of purchase price,
	holdback, contingency payment obligation based on the performance of the acquired or disposed asset or similar obligations, in each case, incurred or assumed in connection with the acquisition or
	disposition of any business, asset or Capital Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary;






	(12)




	any
	obligation arising from the honoring by a bank or other financial institution of a check, draft or similar instrument drawn against insufficient funds
	in the ordinary course of business, provided, however, that such Indebtedness is extinguished within five Business Days of incurrence;






	(13)




	the
	incurrence by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Permitted Acquisition Indebtedness;






	47











	Table of Contents







	(14)




	the
	incurrence by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness arising from Guarantees of Indebtedness of joint ventures at any time
	outstanding not to exceed the greater of $50.0 million and 2.0% of ACNTA determined as of the date of incurrence of such Indebtedness after giving pro forma effect to such incurrence and the
	application of proceeds thereof; and






	(15)




	the
	incurrence by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of Indebtedness in addition to Indebtedness permitted by clauses (1) through
	(14) above or the first paragraph above in an aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) at any time outstanding not to exceed the greater of (a) $50.0 million
	and (b) 2.0% of the Company's ACNTA, determined as of the date of incurrence of such Indebtedness after giving effect to such incurrence and the application of the proceeds therefrom.






	        For
	purposes of determining compliance with this "Indebtedness" covenant:






	(1)




	in
	the event that an item of proposed Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Indebtedness described in
	clauses (1) through (15) above, or is entitled to be incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, the Company will be permitted to classify such item of Indebtedness (or
	any portion thereof) on the date of its incurrence and, subject to clause (2) below, may later reclassify such items of Indebtedness (or any portion thereof), in any manner that complies with
	this covenant, and only be required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one of such clauses or may include the amount and type of such Indebtedness partially in one such clause and
	partially in one or more other such clauses;






	(2)




	all
	Indebtedness outstanding on the date of the applicable Indenture under the Credit Facilities shall be deemed initially incurred on the Issue Date under
	clause (1) of the second paragraph of this covenant and not the first paragraph or clause (2) of the second paragraph of this covenant;






	(3)




	Guarantees
	of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit relating to, Indebtedness which is otherwise included in the determination of a particular
	amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;






	(4)




	if
	obligations in respect of letters of credit are incurred pursuant to the Credit Facility and are being treated as incurred pursuant to clause (1)
	of the second paragraph above and the letters of credit relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included;






	(5)




	the
	amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof
	determined in accordance with GAAP;






	(6)




	Indebtedness
	of any Person existing at the time such Person becomes a Restricted Subsidiary shall be deemed to have been incurred by the Company and the
	Restricted Subsidiary at the time such Person becomes a Restricted Subsidiary; and






	(7)




	the
	accrual of interest or dividends, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest on any Indebtedness in the form of
	additional Indebtedness with the same terms, the reclassification of preferred equity as Indebtedness due to a change in accounting principles, the payment of dividends on Disqualified Stock or
	preferred equity in the form of additional shares of the same class of Disqualified Stock or preferred equity will not be deemed to be an incurrence of Indebtedness or an issuance of Disqualified
	Stock or preferred equity for purposes of this covenant; provided, in each such case (other than preferred stock that is not Disqualified Stock), that the amount of any such accrual, accretion or
	payment is included in Fixed Charges of the Company as accrued.






	48

























	Table of Contents





	        For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the incurrence of Indebtedness, the U.S. dollar-equivalent principal amount
	of Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was incurred, in the case of term
	Indebtedness, or first committed, in the case of revolving credit Indebtedness; provided that if such Indebtedness is incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a foreign currency, and
	such refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. dollar-dominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such U.S.
	dollar-dominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being
	refinanced. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Company may incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a
	result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness, if incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced,
	shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.







	Liens







	        The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien on
	any property or asset now owned or hereafter acquired, or any income or profits therefrom or assign or convey any right to receive income therefrom, except Permitted Liens, to secure (a) any
	Indebtedness of the Company unless prior to, or contemporaneously therewith, the notes are equally and ratably secured for so long as such other Indebtedness is so secured, or (b) any
	Indebtedness of any Guarantor, unless prior to, or contemporaneously therewith, the Subsidiary Guarantee of such Guarantor is equally and ratably secured for so long as such other Indebtedness is so
	secured; provided, however, that if such Indebtedness is expressly subordinated to the notes or a Subsidiary Guarantee, the Lien securing such Indebtedness will be subordinated and junior to the Lien
	securing the notes or such Subsidiary Guarantee, as the case may be, with the same relative priority as such Indebtedness has with respect to the notes or such Subsidiary Guarantee.







	Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Subsidiaries







	        The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create or permit to exist or
	become effective any consensual encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to:






	(a)




	pay
	dividends or make any other distributions on its Capital Stock to the Company or any of the Company's Restricted Subsidiaries, or pay any Indebtedness
	owed to the Company or any of the Company's Restricted Subsidiaries;






	(b)




	make
	loans or advances to the Company or any of the Company's Restricted Subsidiaries; or






	(c)




	transfer
	any of its properties or assets to the Company or any of the Company's Restricted Subsidiaries.






	        However,
	the preceding restrictions will not apply to encumbrances or restrictions existing under or by reason of:






	(1)




	agreements
	existing on the Issue Date, including the Existing Credit Facility as in effect on the Issue Date;






	(2)




	any
	instrument governing Indebtedness or Capital Stock of a Person acquired by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries as in effect at the time of
	such acquisition (except to the extent such Indebtedness was incurred in connection with or in contemplation of such






	49











	Table of Contents







	acquisition),
	which encumbrance or restriction is not applicable to any Person, or the properties or assets of any Person, other than the Person, or the property or assets of the Person, so acquired,
	provided that, in the case of Indebtedness, such Indebtedness was permitted by the terms of the applicable Indenture to be incurred;






	(3)




	any
	agreement for the sale or other disposition of Capital Stock or assets of a Restricted Subsidiary that restricts distributions by such Restricted
	Subsidiary pending such sale or other disposition;






	(4)




	any
	amendment, restatement, modification, supplement, extension, renewal, refunding, replacement or refinancing of Indebtedness referred to in
	clauses (1) or (2), provided that the encumbrances or restrictions contained in the agreements governing the foregoing are not materially more restrictive, taken as a whole, than those
	contained in the agreements governing such Indebtedness;






	(5)




	cash
	or other deposits, or net worth requirements or similar requirements, imposed by suppliers, landlords or customers or required by insurance, security
	or bonding companies, or restrictions on cash or other deposits by parties under agreements entered into in the ordinary course of the Oil and Gas Business of the types described in the definition of
	Permitted Business Investments;






	(6)




	any
	applicable law, rule, regulation, order, approval, license, permit or similar restriction;






	(7)




	provisions
	limiting the disposition or distribution of assets or property or transfer of Capital Stock in joint venture agreements, asset sale agreements,
	sale-leaseback agreements, stock sale agreements, limited liability company organizational documents, and other similar agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business, consistent with past
	practice or with the approval of the Company's Board of Directors, which limitation is applicable only to the assets, property or Capital Stock that are the subject of such agreements;






	(8)




	any
	encumbrance or restriction contained in the terms of any Indebtedness permitted to be incurred under the applicable Indenture or any agreement pursuant
	to which such Indebtedness was incurred if either (x) the encumbrance or restriction applies only in the event of a payment default or a default with respect to a financial covenant in such
	Indebtedness or agreement or (y) the Company determines that any such encumbrance or restriction will not materially affect the Company's ability to make principal or interest payments on the
	notes and in either case such restrictions are not materially less favorable to Holders of notes than is customary in comparable financings, in each case as determined in good faith by the Board of
	Directors of the Company; and






	(9)




	with
	respect to clause (c) of the preceding paragraph only, any of the following encumbrances or restrictions:






	(a)




	customary
	non-assignment or consent provisions in leases entered into in the ordinary course of business;






	(b)




	purchase
	money obligations for property acquired in the ordinary course of business or otherwise permitted under the applicable Indenture that impose
	restrictions on the property so acquired;

	contract, or the assignment or transfer of any such lease, license, sub-license or other contract; and






	(f)




	customary
	restrictions on the disposition or distribution of assets or property in agreements entered into in the ordinary course of the Oil and Gas
	Business of the types described in the definition of Permitted Business Investments.








	Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets







	        The Company may not: (1) consolidate or merge with or into another Person (whether or not the Company is the surviving
	corporation); or (2) sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as
	whole, in one or more related transactions, to another Person, unless:






	(1)




	either:






	(a)




	the
	Company is the surviving corporation; or






	(b)




	the
	Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than the Company) or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease,
	conveyance or other disposition shall have been made is a Person existing under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;








	(2)




	the
	Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than the Company) or the Person to which such sale, assignment, transfer,
	lease, conveyance or other disposition shall have been made assumes all the obligations of the Company under the notes, the applicable Indenture and the applicable registration rights agreement
	pursuant to a supplemental indenture reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee;






	(3)




	immediately
	after such transaction no Default or Event of Default exists; and






	(4)




	either
	(a) the Company or the Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than the Company) will, on the date of such
	transaction after giving pro forma effect thereto and any related financing transactions as if the same had occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period, be permitted to incur at
	least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test set forth in the first paragraph of the covenant described above under the caption "Certain
	CovenantsIncurrence of Indebtedness" or (b) immediately after giving effect to such transaction on a pro forma basis and any related financing transactions as if the same had
	occurred at the beginning of the applicable four-quarter period, the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Company is equal to or greater than the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Company immediately
	before such transaction; and






	(5)




	the
	Company shall have delivered to the trustee an officers' certificate and an opinion of counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger, sale,
	assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition and such supplemental indenture (if any) comply with the applicable Indenture.






	        The
	surviving or transferee Person in any of the above transactions (if not the Company) will succeed to, and be substituted for the Company under the applicable Indenture and the notes
	and the Company (if not the surviving Person) will be fully released from its obligations under such Indenture and the notes, except in the case of a lease of all or substantially all of its assets.

	Table of Contents





	        For
	purposes of this covenant, the sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of one or more Subsidiaries
	of the Company, which properties or assets, if held by the Company instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all of the properties or assets of the Company on a consolidated
	basis, shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the properties or assets of the Company.




	        Although
	there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase "substantially all," there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in
	certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve "all or substantially all" of the properties or assets of a Person.




	        Clause (4)
	of this "Merger, Consolidation, or Sale of Assets" covenant will not apply to a sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of assets between or among
	the Company and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that are Guarantors.







	Transactions with Affiliates







	        The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any payment to, or sell, lease, transfer or
	otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any property or assets from, or enter into or make or amend any transaction, contract, agreement, understanding, loan, advance or
	Guarantee with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate (each, an "Affiliate Transaction") involving aggregate consideration to or from the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary in excess of
	$1.0 million, unless:






	(1)




	such
	Affiliate Transaction is on terms that are no less favorable to the Company or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that would have been
	obtained at the time of such transaction in arm's-length dealings by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary with a Person that is not an Affiliate; and






	(2)




	(a)
	the Company delivers to the trustee with respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions involving aggregate
	consideration to or from the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary in excess of $10.0 million, an officers' certificate certifying that such Affiliate Transaction complies with the requirements of
	clause (1) above; and






	(b)




	with
	respect to any Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions involving aggregate consideration to or from the Company or a
	Restricted Subsidiary in excess of $25.0 million, a majority of the Disinterested Members of the Board of Directors (or, if there is only one Disinterested Member, such Disinterested Member)
	have determined that the criteria set forth in clause (1) are satisfied with respect to such Affiliate Transaction(s) and have approved such Affiliate Transaction(s), as evidenced by a
	resolution delivered to the Trustee and certified by an officers' certificate as having been adopted by the Board of Directors.








	        The
	following items shall not be deemed to be Affiliate Transactions and, therefore, will not be subject to the provisions of the prior paragraph:






	(1)




	any
	employment or severance agreement or other employee, consulting service, termination or director-compensation agreement, arrangement or plan, (or any
	amendment thereto with respect thereto), or indemnification agreements, entered into by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary with officers and employees of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary
	thereof and the payment of compensation to officers and employees of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary thereof (including amounts paid pursuant to employee benefit plans, employee stock option
	or similar plans), so long as such agreement or payment is in the ordinary course of business or has been approved by a majority of the Disinterested

	transactions
	between or among the Company and/or its Restricted Subsidiaries;






	(3)




	Restricted
	Payments that, in each case, are permitted by the provisions of the Indentures described above under the caption "Restricted
	Payments" or Permitted Investments described in clauses (14) or (15) of the definition thereof;






	(4)




	loans
	or advances to employees, officers or directors in the ordinary course of business of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, in each case

	(5)




	any
	transactions undertaken pursuant to any contracts in existence on the Issue Date (as in effect on the Issue Date) and any renewals, replacements or
	modifications of such contracts (pursuant to new transactions or otherwise) on terms no less favorable to the holders of the notes than those in effect on the Issue Date;






	(6)




	in
	the case of (i) contracts for (A) drilling or other oil-field services or supplies, (B) the sale, storage, gathering or transport of
	hydrocarbons or (C) the lease or rental of office or storage space or (ii) other operation-type contracts, any such contracts that are entered into in the ordinary course of business on
	terms substantially similar to those contained in similar contracts entered into by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary and third parties or, if neither the Company nor any Restricted Subsidiary
	has entered into a similar contract with a third party, that the terms are no less favorable than those available from third parties on an arm's-length basis, as determined by a majority of the
	Disinterested Members of the Board of Directors of the Company (or, if there is only one Disinterested Member, such Disinterested Member);






	(7)




	transactions
	with a Person (other than an Unrestricted Subsidiary) that is an Affiliate of the Company solely because the Company owns, directly or through
	a Subsidiary, an Equity Interest in, or controls, such Person;






	(8)




	any
	sale or other issuance of Equity Interests (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Company to, or receipt of a capital contribution from, an Affiliate
	(or a Person that becomes an Affiliate) of the Company;






	(9)




	any
	Transaction between the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary on the one hand and any Person deemed to be an Affiliate solely because a director of such
	Person is also a director of the company or a Restricted Subsidiary, on the other hand; provided that such director abstains from voting as a director of the Company or the Restricted Subsidiary, as
	applicable, in connection with the approval of the transaction; and






	(10)




	Transactions
	with customers, clients, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or services, in each case in the ordinary course of the business of the
	Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries and otherwise in compliance with the applicable Indenture; provided that as determined by a majority of the Disinterested Members of the Board of Directors or
	the Company (or, if there is only one Disinterested Member, such Disinterested Member) or senior management of the Company, such Transactions are on terms that are no less favorable to the Company or
	the relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that would have been obtained in a comparable Transaction by the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person.

	Additional Subsidiary Guarantees







	        If, after the Issue Date, any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company that is not already a Guarantor guarantees any Indebtedness of the
	Company or any Guarantor under a Credit Facility, then that Subsidiary will become a Guarantor by executing a supplemental indenture and delivering it to the Trustee within 30 days of the date
	on which it guaranteed such Indebtedness.
	Any such guarantee shall be subject to release as described under "Subsidiary Guarantees."







	Business Activities







	        The Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, engage in any business other than the Oil and Gas Business,
	except to such extent as would not be material in the opinion of the Board of Directors (which opinion shall be reasonable and made in good faith) to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken
	as a whole.







	Reports







	        Whether or not required by the SEC, so long as any notes are outstanding, the Company will furnish to the Holders of notes, within the
	time periods specified in the SEC's rules and regulations:






	(1)




	all
	quarterly and annual financial information that would be required to be contained in a filing with the SEC on Forms 10-Q and 10-K if the Company
	were required to file such Forms, including a section on "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and, with respect to the annual information only, a
	report on the annual financial statements by the Company's certified independent public accountants; and






	(2)




	all
	current reports that would be required to be filed with the SEC on Form 8-K if the Company were required to file such reports.






	        If
	the Company has designated any of its Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by the preceding paragraph shall include
	a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, and in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
	Operations," of the financial condition and results of operations of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted
	Subsidiaries of the Company.




	        In
	addition, whether or not required by the SEC, the Company will file a copy of all of the information and reports referred to in clause (1) and (2) above with the
	SEC for public availability within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and regulations (unless the SEC will not accept such a filing). Each such filing will be deemed to satisfy the
	Company's obligation to furnish the filed information or report to the Holders.




	        In
	the event that any direct or indirect parent company of the Company becomes a guarantor of the notes, the Indentures will permit the Company to satisfy its obligations in this
	covenant with respect to financial information relating to the Company by furnishing financial information relating to such parent company; provided that the same is accompanied by consolidating
	information that explains in reasonable detail the differences between the information relating to such parent, on the one hand, and the information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries on a
	standalone basis, on the other hand.




	        In
	addition, the Company will agree that, for so long as any notes remain outstanding and are "restricted securities" under Rule 144 under the Securities Act, if at any time it is
	not required to file with the SEC the reports required by the preceding paragraphs, it will furnish to beneficial owners of Notes and to prospective investors, upon request, the information required
	to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.

	Covenant Termination





	        From and after the occurrence of an Investment Grade Rating Event, the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries will no longer be
	subject to the provisions of the Indentures described in "Repurchase at the Option of HoldersAsset Sales" or in "Certain Covenants" above under the following
	headings:






	




	"Restricted Payments,"








	




	"Incurrence of Indebtedness,"








	




	"Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Subsidiaries,"








	




	Clause (4) of "Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets,"








	




	"Transactions with Affiliates," and








	




	"Business Activities"






	(collectively,
	the "Eliminated Covenants"). As a result, after the date on which the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries are no longer subject to the Eliminated Covenants, the notes will be
	entitled to substantially reduced covenant protection.




	        After
	the foregoing covenants have been terminated, the Company may not designate any of its Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries pursuant to the second sentence of the definition
	of "Unrestricted Subsidiary."





	Events of Default and Remedies





	        Each of the following is an Event of Default:






	(1)




	default
	for 30 days in the payment when due of interest on the notes;






	(2)




	default
	in payment when due of the principal of or premium, if any, on the notes;






	(3)




	failure
	by the Company to comply with the provisions described under the caption or "Certain CovenantsMerger, Consolidation or
	Sale of Assets;"






	(4)




	failure
	by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to comply for 30 days after receipt of written notice from the Trustee or the Holders of
	25% in principal amount of the Notes with the provisions described under the captions "Repurchase at the Option of the HoldersChange of Control" and "Asset
	Sales" and "Certain CovenantsRestricted Payments," "Incurrence of Indebtedness," "Liens," "Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions
	Affecting Subsidiaries," "Transactions with Affiliates," "Additional Subsidiary Guarantees," and "Business Activities";






	(5)




	failure
	by the Company for 60 days (or 180 days with respect to the covenant described under "Certain
	CovenantsReports") after receipt of written notice from the Trustee or the Holders of 25% in principal amount of the Notes to comply with any of its other agreements in the applicable
	Indenture;






	(6)




	default
	under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money
	borrowed by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the






	55











	Table of Contents







	Company
	or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries), whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the date of the applicable Indenture, if that default:





	(a)




	is
	caused by a failure to pay principal of or premium, if any, or interest on such Indebtedness prior to the expiration of the grace period provided in such
	Indebtedness (a "Payment Default"); or






	(b)




	results
	in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its Stated Maturity, and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together
	with the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a Payment Default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates $25.0 million or more (the
	"cross-acceleration provision"); provided, however, that if any such Payment Default is cured or waived or any such acceleration rescinded, or such Indebtedness is repaid, within a period of
	30 days from the continuation of such Payment Default beyond the applicable grace period or the occurrence of such acceleration, as the case may be, such Event of Default and any consequential
	acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically rescinded, so long as such rescission does not conflict with any judgment or decree;









	(7)




	failure
	by the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of $25.0 million (net of any amounts
	covered by insurance or a binding indemnity agreement), which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days (the "Judgment Provision");






	(8)




	any
	Subsidiary Guarantee of a Guarantor shall be held in any judicial proceeding to be unenforceable or invalid or, except as permitted by the applicable
	Indenture, shall cease for any reason to be in full force and effect or any Guarantor, or any Person acting on behalf of any Guarantor, shall deny or disaffirm its obligations under its Subsidiary
	Guarantee (the "guarantee default provision"), in each case with respect to any Guarantor that is also a Significant Subsidiary or any group of Guarantors that, taken together, would constitute a
	Significant Subsidiary; and






	(9)




	certain
	events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary that is also a Significant Subsidiary or any group of
	Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary (the "bankruptcy provision").






	        In
	the case of an Event of Default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Company, any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary or any
	group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, all outstanding notes will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. If any
	other Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding notes may declare all the notes to be due and payable
	immediately. Under certain
	circumstances, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding notes may rescind an acceleration with respect to the notes and its consequences.




	        Holders
	of the notes may not enforce the applicable Indenture or the notes except as provided in such Indenture. Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in principal amount
	of the then outstanding notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from Holders of the notes notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default
	(except a Default or Event of Default relating to the payment of principal, premium or interest) if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest.




	        The
	Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding by notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of all of the notes waive any existing Default
	or Event of Default and its consequences under the applicable Indenture except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the payment of interest or premium on, or the principal of, the notes or a
	Default or Event




	56











	Table of Contents





	of
	Default in respect of a provision that under "Amendment, Supplement and Waiver" below cannot be amended without the consent of each Holder affected.




	        The
	Company is required to deliver to the Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with each Indenture. Upon becoming aware of any Default or Event of Default, the Company is
	required to deliver to the Trustee a statement specifying such Default or Event of Default.





	No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders





	        No director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner or stockholder of the Company or any Guarantor, as such, shall have any
	liability for any obligations of the Company or the Guarantors under the notes, the Indentures, the Subsidiary Guarantees, the registration rights agreements or for any claim based on, in respect of,
	or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder of notes by accepting a note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance
	of the notes. The waiver and release may not be effective to waive liabilities under the federal securities laws, and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.





	Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance





	        The Company may, at its option and at any time, elect to have all of its obligations discharged with respect to the outstanding notes
	and the applicable Indenture and all obligations of the Guarantors discharged with respect to their Subsidiary Guarantees ("Legal Defeasance") except for:






	(1)




	the
	rights of Holders of outstanding notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on such notes when such
	payments are due from the trust referred to below;






	(2)




	the
	Company's obligations with respect to the notes concerning issuing temporary notes, registration of notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen notes
	and the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust;






	(3)




	the
	rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee, and the Company's obligations in connection therewith; and






	(4)




	the
	Legal Defeasance provisions of such Indenture.






	        In
	addition, the Company may, at its option and at any time, elect to terminate its obligations under "Repurchase at the Option of HoldersChange of Control" and
	"Asset Sales" and under the covenants described under "Certain Covenants" (other than the covenant described under "Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets"),
	the operation of the Cross-Acceleration Provision, the Judgment Provision, the Guarantee Default Provision and (with respect only to Significant Subsidiaries) the Bankruptcy Provision described under
	"Events of Default and Remedies" above and the limitations contained in clause (4) of the first paragraph under "Certain CovenantsMerger, Consolidation or
	Sale of Assets" above (collectively, "Covenant Defeasance") and certain other covenants or obligations of the Company set forth in the applicable Indenture, and thereafter any omission to comply with
	such obligations or provisions will not constitute a Default or Event of Default.




	        The
	Company may exercise its Legal Defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of its Covenant Defeasance option. If the Company exercises its Legal Defeasance option, payment
	of the notes may not be accelerated because of any Event of Default. If the Company exercises its Covenant Defeasance option, payment of the notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default
	specified in clauses (4), (5), (6), (7), (8) or (with respect only to Significant Subsidiaries) (9) under "Events of Default and Remedies" above or because of the
	failure of the Company to comply with




	57











	Table of Contents





	clause (4)
	of the first paragraph under "Certain CovenantsMerger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets" above. If the Company exercises its Legal Defeasance or Covenant
	Defeasance option, each Guarantor will be released from its obligations with respect to its Subsidiary Guarantee.




	        In
	order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance:






	(1)




	the
	Company must irrevocably deposit with the Trustee, in trust, for the benefit of the Holders of the notes, cash in U.S. dollars, non-callable Government
	Securities, or a combination thereof, in such amounts as will be sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants, to pay the principal of, premium, if any,
	and interest on the outstanding notes on the Stated Maturity or on the applicable redemption date, as the case may be, and the Company must specify whether the notes are being defeased to Stated
	Maturity or to a particular redemption date;






	(2)




	in
	the case of Legal Defeasance, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming that
	(a) the Company has received from, or there has been published by, the Internal Revenue Service a ruling or (b) since the Issue Date, there has been a change in the applicable federal
	income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such Opinion of Counsel shall confirm that, the Holders of the outstanding notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for
	federal income tax purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if
	such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;






	(3)




	in
	the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee confirming
	that the Holders of the outstanding notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to federal income tax on
	the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;






	(4)




	no
	Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing either: (a) on the date of such deposit (other than a Default or Event of
	Default resulting from the borrowing of funds to be applied to such deposit); or (b) insofar as Events of Default from bankruptcy or insolvency events are concerned, at any time in the period
	ending on the 91st day after the date of deposit;






	(5)




	such
	Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under any material agreement or instrument
	(other than the Indenture) to which the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is bound;






	(6)




	the
	Company must have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that after the 91st day following the deposit, the trust funds
	will not be subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally;






	(7)




	the
	Company must deliver to the Trustee an officers' certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Company with the intent of preferring the
	Holders of notes over the other creditors of the Company with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors of the Company or others; and






	(8)




	the
	Company must deliver to the Trustee an officers' certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, stating that all conditions precedent relating to the Legal
	Defeasance or the Covenant Defeasance have been complied with.

	Satisfaction and Discharge





	        The Company may discharge its and the Guarantors' obligations under the Indentures while notes remain outstanding if (a) all
	outstanding notes have been delivered for cancellation, (b) all outstanding notes have become due and payable at their scheduled maturity or (c) all outstanding notes are scheduled for
	redemption, and the Company has deposited with the Trustee an amount sufficient to pay and discharge all outstanding notes, not previously delivered for cancellation, on the date of their scheduled
	maturity or the scheduled date of redemption.





	Amendment, Supplement and Waiver





	        Except as provided below, the Indentures, the notes and Subsidiary Guarantees may be amended with the consent of the Holders of at
	least a majority in principal amount of the series of notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, notes), and any
	existing default or compliance with any provision of the Indenture governing such series, the notes or the Subsidiary Guarantees may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in
	principal amount of the then outstanding notes (including consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for notes).




	        Without
	the consent of each Holder affected, an amendment, supplement or waiver may not (with respect to any notes held by a non-consenting Holder):






	(1)




	reduce
	the principal amount of notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver;






	(2)




	reduce
	the principal of or change the fixed maturity of any note or alter the provisions with respect to the redemption or repurchase of the notes (other
	than provisions relating to the covenants described above under the caption "Repurchase at the Option of Holders");






	(3)




	reduce
	the rate of or change the time for payment of interest on any note;






	(4)

	of a provision that cannot be amended without the consent of each Holder affected;






	(5)




	make
	any note payable in a currency other than that stated in the notes;






	(6)




	make
	any change in the provisions of such Indenture relating to waivers of past Defaults or the rights of Holders of notes to receive payments of principal
	of or premium, if any, or interest on the notes (except as permitted by clause (7) below);






	(7)




	waive
	a redemption or repurchase payment with respect to any note (other than a payment required by one of the covenants described above under the caption
	"Repurchase at the Option of Holders");






	(8)




	modify
	any Subsidiary Guarantee in any manner adverse to Holders of the notes or release any Guarantor from its obligations under its Subsidiary Guarantee
	except in accordance with the terms of such Indenture;






	(9)




	make
	any change in the ranking of the notes or the Subsidiary Guarantees in a manner adverse to the Holders of the notes or the Subsidiary Guarantees; or

	the preceding, without the consent of any Holder of notes, the Company, the Guarantors and the Trustee may amend or supplement the Indentures, the notes or the Subsidiary

	to
	cure any ambiguity, defect, inconsistency, omission or mistake;

	Concerning the Trustee





	        If the Trustee becomes a creditor of the Company or any Guarantor, the Indentures will limit its right to obtain payment of claims in
	certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions; however, if it acquires
	any conflicting interest after a Default has occurred and is continuing it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days, apply to the SEC for permission to continue or resign.

	Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding series of notes will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising
	any remedy available to the Trustee, subject to certain exceptions. If an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, the Trustee will be required, in the exercise of its power, to use the degree
	of care of a prudent person in the conduct of his own affairs. Subject to such provisions, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under the applicable
	Indenture at the request of any Holder of notes, unless such Holder shall have offered to the Trustee security and indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense as provided in
	such Indenture.

	of beneficial interests in a Global Note will be limited to persons who have accounts with DTC ("participants") or persons who hold interests through participants.




	        Ownership
	of beneficial interests in a Global Note will be shown on, and the transfer of that ownership will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC or its nominee (with
	respect to interests of participants) and the records of participants (with respect to interests of persons other than participants). Qualified institutional buyers may hold their interests in a
	Restricted Global Note directly through DTC if they are participants in such system, or indirectly through organizations that are participants in such system. Indirect access to the DTC system is
	available to organizations such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a participant, either directly or indirectly ("indirect
	participants").




	        Investors
	may hold their interests in a Regulation S Global Note through organizations that are participants in the DTC system, including Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V, as
	operator of the Euroclear System ("Euroclear"), and Citibank, N.A., as operator of Clearstream Banking, S.A. ("Clearstream"). Clearstream and Euroclear will hold interests in the
	Regulation S Global Notes on behalf of their participants through DTC.




	        So
	long as DTC, or its nominee, is the registered owner or holder of a Global Note, DTC or such nominee, as the case may be, will be considered the sole owner or holder of the notes
	represented by such Global Note for all purposes under the Indenture and the note. No beneficial owner of an interest in a Global Note will be able to transfer that interest except in accordance with
	DTC's applicable procedures, in addition to those provided for under the Indenture and, if applicable, those of Euroclear and Clearstream.




	        All
	payments on a Global Note will be made to DTC or its nominee, as the case may be, as the registered owner thereof. Neither the Company, the Guarantors, the Trustee nor any Paying
	Agent will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in a Global Note or for maintaining, supervising
	or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests.




	        We
	expect that DTC or its nominee, upon receipt of any payment in respect of a Global Note, will credit participants' accounts on the applicable payment date with payments in amounts
	proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in the principal amount of such Global Note as shown on the records of DTC. We also expect that payments by participants to owners of beneficial
	interests in a Global Note held through such participants will be governed by standing instructions and customary




	84











	Table of Contents





	practices,
	as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of customers registered in the names of nominees for such customers. Such payments will be the responsibility of the participants.




	        Transfers
	between participants in DTC will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with DTC rules and will be settled in same-day funds. Transfers between participants in Euroclear
	and Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures.




	        We
	expect that DTC will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of notes (including the presentation of notes for exchange as described below) only at the direction of one or
	more participants to whose account DTC interests in a Global Note are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of notes as to which such participant or
	participants has or have given such direction. However, if there is an Event of Default under the notes, DTC reserves the right to exchange the applicable Global Note for notes in certificated form
	("Certificated Notes"), which it will distribute to its participants and which may be legended as set forth under the heading "Transfer Restrictions."




	        We
	understand that: DTC is a limited purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New York, a "banking organization" within the meaning of New York Banking Law, a
	member of the Federal Reserve System, a "clearing corporation" within the meaning of the Uniform Commercial Code and a "clearing agency" registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of
	the Exchange Act. DTC was created to hold securities for its participants and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between participants through electronic book-entry
	changes in accounts of its participants, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of certificates.




	        Although
	DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream are expected to follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in a Global Note among participants of DTC,
	Euroclear and Clearstream, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued at any time. Neither the Company, the Guarantors, the
	Trustee nor any Paying Agent will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations
	under the rules and procedures governing their operations.






	Exchange of Global Notes for Certificated Notes






	        A Global Note is exchangeable for Certificated Notes if:






	(1)




	DTC
	(a) notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depositary for the Global Notes or (b) has ceased to be a clearing
	agency registered under the Exchange Act and in either event the Company fails to appoint a successor depositary within 90 days; or






	(2)




	there
	has occurred and is continuing an Event of Default and DTC notifies the Trustee of its decision to exchange the Global Notes for Certificated Notes.






	        In
	all cases, Certificated Notes delivered in exchange for any Global Note or beneficial interests in Global Notes will be registered in the names, and issued in any approved
	denominations, requested by or on behalf of DTC (in accordance with its customary procedures) and may bear the restrictive legend referred to in "Transfer Restrictions."

	CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES






	        The following is a summary based on present law of the material United States federal income tax considerations relating to the
	acquisition, ownership and disposition of the notes, but does not purport to be a complete analysis of all of the potential tax considerations relating thereto. This summary is based on the Internal
	Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), Treasury regulations, rulings and pronouncements of the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS"), and judicial decisions, all as of the date hereof. These
	authorities may be changed, perhaps retroactively, and are subject to different interpretations, so the United States federal income tax consequences may be different from those described herein. This
	summary assumes that the old notes and the new notes are held as capital assets (generally, property held for investment) and holders are investors who purchased the old notes for cash upon their
	original issue at their initial offering price.




	        This
	summary does not address tax considerations arising under the laws of any foreign, state or local jurisdiction or the effect of any tax treaty. In addition, this discussion does not
	address tax considerations that are the result of a holder's particular circumstances or of special rules, such as those that apply to holders subject to the alternative minimum tax, banks and other
	financial institutions, tax-exempt organizations, insurance companies, dealers or traders in securities or commodities, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, United States
	Holders (as defined below) whose "functional currency" is not the U.S. dollar, certain former citizens or former long-term residents of the United States, foreign governments or international
	organizations, persons who will hold the notes as a position in a hedging transaction, "straddle," "conversion transaction" or other risk reduction or integrated transaction, or partnerships
	(including any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes) or other pass-through entities or investors in such entities. If a partnership (including
	any entity treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes) holds new notes, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend upon the status of the
	partner and the activities of the partnership. If you are a partner of a partnership holding our new notes, you should consult your tax advisor. We have not sought any ruling from the IRS or opinion
	of counsel with respect to the statements made and conclusions reached in this summary, and there can be no assurance that the IRS will agree with and not challenge these statements and conclusions.







	        



	THIS SUMMARY DOES NOT REPRESENT A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES TO YOU IN LIGHT OF YOUR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES AND
	DOES NOT ADDRESS THE EFFECTS OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-UNITED STATES TAX LAWS. IT IS NOT INTENDED TO BE, AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED TO BE, LEGAL OR TAX ADVICE TO ANY PARTICULAR HOLDER OF NEW NOTES.
	YOU SHOULD SEEK ADVICE BASED ON YOUR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES FROM
	AN INDEPENDENT TAX ADVISOR WITH RESPECT TO THE APPLICATION TO SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL TAX LAWS AS WELL AS WITH RESPECT TO ANY TAX CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER THE LAWS OF ANY
	STATE, LOCAL OR OTHER TAXING JURISDICTION OR UNDER ANY APPLICABLE TAX TREATY.






	Exchange of the Notes





	        The new notes do not differ materially in kind or extent from the old notes and, as a result, your exchange of old notes for new notes
	will not constitute a taxable disposition of the old notes for United States federal income tax purposes. As a result, you will not recognize taxable income, gain or loss on such exchange, your
	holding period for the new notes generally will include the holding period for the old notes so exchanged, and your adjusted tax basis in the new notes generally will be the same as your adjusted tax
	basis in the old notes so exchanged.




	86











	Table of Contents






	United States Holders





	        The following is a summary of the material United States federal income tax consequences that will apply to you if you are a United
	States Holder of the new notes. Certain consequences to non-United States holders of the new notes are described under "Non-United States Holders" below. As used in this discussion, "United States
	Holder" means a beneficial owner of new notes that for United States federal income tax purposes is:






	




	an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States, including an alien individual who is a lawful permanent
	resident of the United States or who meets the "substantial presence" test under Section 7701(b) of the Code;








	




	a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes, created or
	organized in or under the laws of the United States, any political subdivision or state thereof, or the District of Columbia;








	




	an estate whose income is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source; or








	




	a trust (i) if its administration is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one
	or more "United States persons" (within the meaning of the Code) have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) that has a valid election in effect under
	applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States person.







	Payments of interest





	        Interest on the new notes generally will be taxable to you as ordinary income at the time it is received or accrued in accordance with
	your regular method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes.





	Disposition of the new notes





	        Upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of the new notes, you generally will recognize capital
	gain or loss equal to the difference between:






	




	the amount of cash proceeds and the fair market value of any property received on such disposition (less any amount
	attributable to accrued and unpaid interest on the notes that you have not previously included in income, which will generally be taxable as ordinary income); and








	




	your adjusted tax basis in the new notes.






	        Your
	adjusted tax basis in a new note generally will equal the cost of the new note to you. Any gain or loss that is recognized on the disposition of the new notes generally will be
	capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if you have held the new notes for more than one year at the time of disposition. Long-term capital gains of individuals, estates and
	trusts currently are taxed at reduced rates. Your ability to deduct capital losses is subject to certain limitations.





	Payments upon early redemptions and other circumstances





	        In certain circumstances (see "Description of the New NotesRegistration Rights;" "Optional Redemption;" and
	"Repurchase at the Option of HoldersChange of Control"), we may be entitled or obligated to redeem the new notes before their stated maturity date or obligated to pay a
	United States Holder additional amounts in excess of stated interest or principal on the new notes. We do not intend to treat the potential redemption or payment of any such amounts as part of or
	affecting the yield to maturity of any new notes. In the event such a contingency occurs, it would affect the amount and timing of the income (and possibly character) that a United States Holder must
	recognize. Our




	87











	Table of Contents





	determination
	is not, however, binding on the IRS and if the IRS were to challenge this determination, a United States Holder might be required to accrue income on the new notes at a higher yield and
	to treat as ordinary income (rather than capital gain) any income realized on the taxable disposition of a note before the resolution of the contingencies.





	Information reporting and backup withholding





	        In general, information reporting is required as to certain payments of interest on the new notes and on the proceeds of a disposition
	of the new notes unless you are a corporation or other exempt person and, if requested, certify such status. In addition, you will be subject to backup withholding on payments made to you of principal
	and interest on your new note and
	to payments of proceeds of a sale or other disposition of your new note if you are not exempt, you fail to properly furnish a taxpayer identification number or if the IRS has notified you that you are
	subject to backup withholding.




	        Backup
	withholding is not an additional tax. Any amount withheld from a payment under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a credit against your United States federal income
	tax liability and may entitle you to a refund, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.





	Non-United States Holders





	        The following is a summary of the material United States federal income tax consequences that will apply to you if you are a non-United
	States Holder of new notes. As used in this tax discussion, "non-United States Holder" means any beneficial owner of the new notes that is an individual, corporation, estate or trust that is not a
	United States Holder. The rules governing the United States federal income taxation of a non-United States Holder are complex, and no attempt will be made herein to provide more than a summary of
	certain of those rules.



	NON-UNITED STATES HOLDERS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF UNITED STATES FEDERAL, STATE AND OTHER TAX LAWS, AS WELL AS
	FOREIGN TAX LAWS, INCLUDING ANY REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.






	Payments of interest





	        Interest on the new notes will not be subject to United States federal income tax or withholding tax if the interest is not effectively
	connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States and if you qualify for the "portfolio interest" exemption. You will qualify for the portfolio interest exemption if
	you:






	




	do not own, actually or constructively, 10% or more of the combined voting power of all classes of our stock entitled to
	vote;








	




	are not a controlled foreign corporation related to us, directly or indirectly, actually or constructively, through stock
	ownership;








	




	are not a bank whose receipt of interest on the new notes is interest received pursuant to a loan agreement entered into
	in the ordinary course of your trade or business; and








	




	appropriately certify as to your foreign status.






	        You
	may generally meet the certification requirement listed above by providing to us or our agent a properly completed IRS Form W-8BEN. If the portfolio interest exemption is not
	available to you, then payments of interest on the new notes will be subject to United States federal withholding tax at a rate of 30% unless you certify on IRS Form W-8BEN as to your
	eligibility for a lower rate under an applicable income tax treaty.




	88











	Table of Contents





	        Interest
	that is effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent
	establishment maintained by you in the United States) is not subject to withholding if you provide a properly completed IRS Form W-8ECI. However, you generally will be subject to United States
	federal income tax on such interest on a net income basis at graduated rates applicable to United States persons generally. In addition, if you are a foreign corporation you may incur a branch profits
	tax on such interest equal to 30% of your effectively connected earnings and profits for the taxable year, as adjusted for certain items, unless a lower rate applies to you under a United States
	income tax treaty with your country of residence. For this purpose, you must include interest, gain and income on your new notes in the earnings and profits subject to United States branch profits tax
	if these amounts are effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States.





	Disposition of the notes





	        You generally will not be subject to United States federal income tax on any gain realized on the sale, exchange, redemption,
	retirement or other taxable disposition of the new notes (other than any amount allocable to accrued and unpaid interest, which generally will be taxable
	as interest and may be subject to the rules discussed above in "Payments of interest") unless:






	




	the gain is effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States (and, if required by an
	applicable income tax treaty, is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by you in the United States), in which case you generally will be subject to United States federal income tax in
	the same manner as a United States person, and if you are a foreign corporation, you may incur a branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or a lower applicable treaty rate) of your effectively connected
	earnings and profits, which will include such gain; or








	




	you are an individual present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year in which such
	disposition occurs and certain other conditions are met, in which case you will be subject to United States federal income tax at a 30% rate (or lower applicable treaty rate) on the gain, which may be
	offset by United States source capital losses.







	Information reporting and backup withholding





	        Payments to you of interest on the new notes (including amounts withheld from such payments, if any) generally will be required to be
	reported to the IRS and to you. United States backup withholding generally will not apply to payments to you of interest on the new notes if the statement described in "Payments of
	interest" is duly provided by you or you otherwise establish an exemption, provided that we do not have actual knowledge or reason to know that you are a United States person.




	        Payment
	of the proceeds of a sale of the new notes effected by the U.S. office of a U.S. or foreign broker will be subject to information reporting requirements and backup withholding
	unless you properly certify under penalties of perjury as to your foreign status and certain other conditions are met or you otherwise establish an exemption. Information reporting requirements and
	backup withholding generally will not apply to any payment of the proceeds of the sale of the new notes effected outside the United States by a foreign office of a broker. However, unless such a
	broker has documentary evidence in its records that you are a non-United States Holder and certain other conditions are met, or you otherwise establish an exemption, information reporting will apply
	to a payment of the proceeds of the sale of the new notes effected outside the United States by such a broker if it is:






	




	a United States person;








	




	a foreign person which derives 50% or more of its gross income for certain periods from the conduct of a trade or business
	in the United States;






	89











	Table of Contents







	




	a controlled foreign corporation for United States federal income tax purposes; or








	




	a foreign partnership that, at any time during its taxable year, has more than 50% of its income or capital interests
	owned by United States persons or is engaged in the conduct of a U.S. trade or business.






	        Backup
	withholding is not an additional tax. Any amount withheld from a payment under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a credit against your United States federal income
	tax liability, if any, and may entitle you to a refund, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.





	Foreign Account Tax Compliance





	        The Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act, enacted on March 18, 2010, would impose a 30% withholding tax on any payments
	on our obligations made to a foreign financial institution or non-financial foreign entity (including, in some cases, when such foreign financial institution or entity is acting as an intermediary),
	and on the gross proceeds of the sale or other disposition of our obligations, unless (i) in the case of a foreign financial institution, such institution enters into an agreement with the U.S.
	government to withhold on certain payments, and to collect and provide to the U.S. tax authorities substantial information regarding U.S. account holders of such institution (which includes certain
	equity and debt holders of such institution, as well as certain account holders that are foreign entities with U.S. owners), and (ii) in the case of a non-financial
	foreign entity, such entity provides the withholding agent with a certification identifying the direct and indirect U.S. owners of the entity. Under certain circumstances, a holder might be eligible
	for refunds or credits of such taxes. Although this legislation currently applies to payments made after December 31, 2012, the Treasury and the IRS have issued administrative guidance
	indicating that they plan to issue Treasury Regulations that will delay the effective date of the withholding regime so that withholding will only apply to payments made after December 31, 2013
	(in the case of interest payments) and December 31, 2014 (in the case of disposition proceeds). Proposed Treasury Regulations have been issued which, if finalized, would confirm the extension
	of the effective dates for withholding. Additionally, payments with respect to debt obligations that were outstanding on March 18, 2012 are not subject to these rules; however, proposed
	regulations not yet in effect would, if adopted, extend this grandfathering date to January 1, 2013. If these proposed regulations are adopted, withholding under these rules would not be
	required on the new notes. You are encouraged to consult with your own tax advisors regarding the possible implications of this legislation on the new notes.





	Legislation relating to net investment income





	        For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2012, legislation is scheduled to impose a 3.8% tax on the "net investment
	income" of certain United States individuals, and on the undistributed "net investment income" of certain estates and trusts. Among other items, "net investment income" generally includes interest and
	certain net gain from the disposition of property, less certain deductions.




	        Holders
	of the new notes should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the tax consequences of the legislation above.

	CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS






	        To the extent the new notes are held by an employee benefit plan subject to Title I of ERISA, or Section 4975 of the Code, the
	following are some considerations that should be taken into account. A fiduciary of an employee benefit plan subject to ERISA must determine that the holding of a new note is consistent with its
	fiduciary duties under ERISA. The fiduciary of an ERISA plan, as well as any other prospective investor subject to Section 4975 of the Code, must also determine that its holding of new notes
	does not result in a nonexempt prohibited transaction as defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code.




	        Similar
	state and/or local laws may apply to plans and entities holding plan assets that are not subject to Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code.

	Table of Contents
















	PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION






	        Each broker-dealer that receives new notes for its own account pursuant to the exchange offer must acknowledge that it will deliver a
	prospectus in connection with any resale of such new notes. This prospectus, as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, may be used by a broker-dealer in connection with resales of the
	new notes received in exchange for the old notes where such old notes were acquired as a result of market-making activities or other trading activities. We have agreed that, for a period of
	180 days after the effective date of this registration statement, we will make this prospectus, as amended or supplemented, available to any broker-dealer for use in connection with any such
	resale. In addition, until August 27, 2014 (90 days after the consummation of the exchange offer), all dealers effecting transactions in the new notes may be required to deliver a prospectus.




	        We
	will not receive any proceeds from any sale of the new notes by broker-dealers. New notes received by broker-dealers for their own account pursuant to the exchange offer may be sold
	from time to time in one or more transactions in the over-the-counter market, in negotiated transactions, through the writing of options on the new notes or a combination of such methods of resale, at
	market prices prevailing at the time of resale, at prices related to such prevailing market prices or negotiated prices. Any such resale may be made directly to purchasers or to or through brokers or
	dealers who may receive compensation in the form of commissions or concessions from any such broker dealer or the purchasers of any such new notes. Any broker-dealer that resells new notes that were
	received by it for its own account pursuant to the exchange offer and any broker or dealer that participates in a distribution of such new notes may be deemed to be an "underwriter" within the meaning
	of the Securities Act and any profit on any such resale of new notes and any commission or concessions received by any such persons may be deemed to be underwriting compensation under the Securities
	Act. The enclosed letter of transmittal states that, by acknowledging that it will deliver and by delivering a prospectus, a broker-dealer will not be deemed to admit that it is an "underwriter"
	within the meaning of the Securities Act.




	        For
	a period of 180 days after the consummation of the exchange offer, we will promptly send additional copies of this prospectus and any amendment or supplement to this
	prospectus to any broker-dealer that requests such documents as provided in the enclosed letter of transmittal. We have agreed to pay all expenses incident to the exchange offer (including the
	expenses of one counsel for the holders of the notes) other than commissions or concessions of any brokers or dealers and will indemnify the holders of the notes (including any broker-dealers) against
	certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act.
