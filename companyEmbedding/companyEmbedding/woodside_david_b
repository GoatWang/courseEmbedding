I buy property any size, anywhere, any cost.Over ten years experience in renovating homes, foreclosures, minor subdivision development, coaching and consulting for other investors, investment partnerships, financial analysis of homes and larger investment properties, and representing and negotiating for clients with my Utah real estate sales agent license. I have significant experience in performing real estate related financial and investment analyses, and I have developed multiple spreadsheet tools for that purpose.  Significant and on-going financial and cost analyses, project scheduling, and work planning were required for successful investment activities and fulfillment of fiduciary responsibilities to meet clients' expectations.  I have knowledge of Utah title and real estate law, and I am a member of the National Association of Realtors, the Utah Association of Realtors and the Salt Lake Board of Realtors.Team members: David B. WoodsideSystem Manager for Industrial Computed Tomography System1988  –  2001I provided Nondestructive Testing (NDT) engineering support as the System Manager and NDT Support Engineer for a large (16 MEV) High Energy Computed Tomography Inspection System (HECT) used to inspect large rocket motors manufactured by ATK for several Navy and customer's programs.  These duties included participating in the development of detailed inspection techniques and procedures in support of contractual requirements, working with inspection technicians and equipment operators, contributing to the ongoing maintenance and support of the equipment, and performing many detailed written and oral reports at company and customer facilities.Team members: David B. WoodsideManufacturing EngineerAs the manufacturing engineer for an Air Force Ordnance Development Program, my responsibilities included providing cost estimates in support of contract bidding and proposal activities, reviewing subcontractor manufacturing plans, auditing shop floor procedures and touch labor processes at several subcontractor facilities, and maintaining contractual documentation related to these functions.  I helped to assure the correct use of manufacturing disciplines, including tooling, procedures, facilities, testing and operator training.  Written and oral presentations were made for the customer, and I conducted process-proofing audits in subcontractor facilities to assure continuous production of reliable, reproducible hardware.  I served as a member of the program team which was responsible of ATK’s win of a $900,000 contract award fee.Team members: David B. WoodsideNDT Engineer for CT Inspection of Military Aircraft ComponentsI developed and implemented the Computed Tomography inspection plan for the ATK-manufactured composite “Pivot Shaft” tail-section component for the Air Force F22 fighter development program.  These inspections were adapted to and performed on the Air Force Advanced Rocket Nozzle (ARNIS) industrial CT System.  Project tasks included contributing to inspection fixture design and manufacturing, specifying, writing and implementing the inspection plan in shop floor work instructions, training equipment operators, reviewing and analyzing the inspection data and writing and presenting written project summary and inspection reports.Team members: David B. WoodsideComputer Automation of Ultrasonic Testing for Sub-scale Composite MaterialsI automated an inspection plan for an immersion ultrasonic inspection system previously implemented for sub-scale composite components in support of NASA Space Shuttle development program.  This automation involved integrating a computer and my developed software to control the motion control and data collection aspects of the system.  Through these efforts I  found and documented a previously unknown firmware bug in the scanning equipment, which the manufacturer corrected.  This inspection system was used successfully for several years and resulted in increased inspection efficiency and facility through-put.Team members: David B. WoodsideRocket Nozzle CT Inspection System Implementation1988  –  2001I investigated principles of the then relatively new industrial computed tomography inspection techniques.  I was the engineer in charge of implementing the $3 Million Air Force Advanced Rocket Nozzle Inspection System (ARNIS) and I developed the basic inspection methodologies using image processing techniques and principles of computed tomography for the implementation of routine inspections of rocket motors and components in a manufacturing production environment.  I developed the ARNIS operating procedures and developed the written inspection work instructions for multiple programs, trained technicians on the equipment operation and inspection techniques, and routinely prepared detailed, written inspection reports.  Many written and oral reports were made for ATK’s customers (Navy, Air Force, Great Britain, NASA/Delta, General Electric and others).Team members: David B. WoodsideAstrophysics Research Project1980  –  1980I wrote and submitted an original, small research project proposal to NASA, which was awarded to CSC.  For approximately six months I performed this contract work to support ongoing research by two NASA astrophysicist principal investigators with whom I was associated.  The project was follow-on work for my undergraduate project investigating the common-element abundances in the interstellar medium in the aftermath of supernovae events.  Through my independent self-directed research for this CSC contract, I modified and maintained FORTRAN computer codes and my efforts contributed to the ongoing NASA astrophysicists' research at GSFC.Team members: David B. WoodsideWeather Satellite Mission Analysist1979  –  1982I provided computer analysis and mission planning and support for three of the early weather satellite missions in the late 1970's and early 1980's for the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) program.  My work supported the customer's (NASA/NOAA) program at the Goddard Spaceflight Center (GSFC) in Greenbelt, Maryland, to plan and launch the satellites on Delta launch vehicles from Cape Canaveral and provide initial orbit insertion support and ongoing station keeping (space craft orbital maneuvers) support of the satellites.  My work on these projects involved routine use and maintenance of NASA and CSC FORTRAN computer programs used in support of the GOES missions.  For a separate project, I provided original programming code for a project in the early Space Shuttle missions.  For these projects, knowledge of the physics of orbital mechanics was routinely applied.Team members: David B.
