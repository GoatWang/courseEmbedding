                    The Apollo Beach community is a vibrant and rapidly growing part of the Southshore area. There is a phenominal local brewery (Four Stacks), a great CrossFit gym (Apoge CrossFit) and just down the street is some amazing pizza (East Coast Pizza) on Big Bend Road. I am very excited to call the area home and look forward to all the new neighbors to come because the new construction (and existing) home markets are BOOMING!
