Staub Cast Iron Cookware

Home  //  Cookware  //  Induction Cookware - Magnetic Induction Ready Cookware  //  Staub CookwareStaub CookwareWe're thrilled to offer this high-quality Staub enameled French cast iron cookware.  Chef's Resource is the only store that carries (almost) every single piece Staub makes, every size, every color. (Color availability varies by piece, all are available in their signature matte black).  Every piece is stocked in our warehouse (a section is shown in the picture), there are no special orders on our very large collection of Staub cast iron cookware.
Enameled cast iron is a traditional and strong material, perfect for low heat cooking.  It retains heat better than any material, including stainless steel and aluminum.  The equal distribution of heat will elimate hot spots, allowing you to cook the most delicate dishes.  All Staub products are enameled on the inside and out, including the black matte finish.  No seasoning is required and it will not react to acidic foods.

Staub CookwareHome-cooked meals are all about big flavors and tender feelings. That’s the essence of traditional American cuisine, rustic Tuscan-inspired meals and delicious French countryside cooking. Good times, great memories and the company of people you love – and that love you back – are hard to beat. At Williams-Sonoma, we believe that this kind of cooking is more than technique or following the recipe to the letter; it springs from the heart and tastes like it. That’s the essence and inspiration behind our Staub cookware. It gets you excited in the kitchen and fills the dining room with lots of emotion. Here’s what makes it so great for family-style meals.When you love to entertain family and friends, it’s a big help to have tools that are specifically designed for the task. Staub enameled cast-iron cookware comes in shapes and sizes that cater well to large groups of people. Wide cocottes make it easy to serve everything from homemade spaghetti to a tasty casserole. A paella pan gives Spanish cooking a delicious twist with perfectly-cooked rice, flavorful chicken and tons of different kinds of seafood. The size of the pan makes cooking for everyone easy.Family-style meals have a lot of benefits, both from the standpoint of parties and relationships. They’re a big hit because everyone feels relaxed. It’s like telling your guests, just come as you are and have a good time. Serving at the table creates an intimate connection between host and guests. They see the way your eyes light up as you give them your very best. Add some fine wine and you’re set for an evening of laughter and heartfelt conversation.Sharing meals together as a family is also a great way for parents to connect with teens and children. Everyone loves great food. With that kind of laidback ambience, and tasty family favorites that go straight to the heart, it’s a lot easier for youngsters to open up about their day. And since a tasty meal helps mom and dad to let go of any stress, they can focus on spending time together without worries.Staub cookware helps you get those signature deep flavors from your meals. How? For one thing, it distributes heat evenly throughout. That’s important because it lets the bottom and top of the pan or cocotte cook the same amount. And the more time proteins and veggies cook in a soup or stew, the more flavor they release. It also results in meat that is tender and moist at the same time.Enameled cast-iron cookware stays warm for a very long time. That’s awesome for stove top to dining room service. When you take the cover off of your cocotte or roaster, all of the sumptuous herb-filled vapors and aromas reach your guests, which opens up their appetite even more. Whether you serve right on the table or on a nearby buffet, use a trivet to have a safe place to set the pan and protect any wood surfaces too.Another thing that makes Staub cookware stand out are its bright and bold colors. They’re a way to express your personality in the kitchen, and accent your dining room design vision. Staub pots and pans immediately become ceramic masterpieces that delight the senses. Dark green, sapphire and wine red are a few possibilities that add style and intense emotion to the space. They create an ambience that can be romantic, elegant, rustic or modern, depending on your cooking and decorative inspirations.Staub cocottes and roasters come in many different shapes and sizes. Some are ideal for cooking a whole chicken together with roasted potatoes and rosemary or thyme. Others are just the right size for beloved side dishes like homemade macaroni and cheese or pot pies. Mini cocottes are great for individual servings of lasagna or chili. There are tons of possibilities. And since enameled cast-iron is so easy to clean – often some soap and water is sufficient – and dishwasher safe, you can get creative and still be done in a flash.

 Fry Pans & SkilletsWhether you’re making breakfast, throwing together a quick lunch or creating a culinary masterpiece for dinner, chances are you rely on skillets to get the job done. At Williams-Sonoma it’s easy to find a new favorite frying pan that stays by your side for years. We have the variety you need to handle recipes of any size and style. There are precision pieces for pros or workhorse skillets that take care of families day after day. They all have one thing in common: high-quality materials that produce excellent results. Having the right cooking utensils on hand is another big help.Relax with nonstick. Our advanced nonstick frying pans give you the easy cleanup and effortless browning you expect, but without harmful materials. All of our cookware is PFAO-free to keep your family safe. Hard-anodized aluminum is damage-resistant and consistent. It distributes heat quickly and evenly so foods cook exactly the way you want. And with three layers of nonstick coating, our skillets can even handle metal cooking utensils without flinching. Pick out a favorite spatula to use with eggs, pancakes and proteins.If you want to take nonstick to the next level, think ceramic. Virtually scratchproof and extremely stain-resistant, ceramic frying pans are a breeze to clean. Even sticky scrambled eggs are simple to wipe off thanks to the ultrasmooth surface. Expect professional results when searing proteins and browning chicken, meats, veggies and other ingredients. And best of all, ceramic is conducive to healthy eating since it lets you cook with very little or no oil at all. A mortar and pestle lets you add tons of natural flavor to dishes.Being able to control the temperature of your ingredients correctly plays a huge part in ending up with a tasty finished product. Our skillets are carefully crafted with smart materials that distribute heat evenly. That way you don’t have to worry about hotspots, sticking, burning and other disasters. Look for pieces with an aluminum or copper core – or several layers – to have a lot of control over heat. The result is food that’s juicy and done just right. An inner layer of stainless-steel is important to guarantee maximum even heating potential to bring out the fullness of flavor.All-Clad means pro. The All-Clad series of cookware is known – and loved – by professional chefs across the globe. That’s because it’s synonymous with unparalleled construction and multiple layers specially designed to enhance every aspect of cooking. Our All-Clad skillets are no different. Aluminum layers conduct and maintain heat throughout the surface, which is important for delicate dishes like omelets or ingredients that have to be cooked to the perfect degree.Enameled cast iron skillets are great for comfort foods and deep flavors. They have enough space for a full breakfast of pancakes, eggs and bacon – even at the same time if you’re in a hurry – right on the stove top. A beautiful enamel finish provides a nonstick cooking surface and means you can take things straight from kitchen to dining room table for easier serving. And when it comes to homemade potatoes au gratin, macaroni and cheese, or slow-cooked meats, cast iron can’t be beat. It can go directly from stove top – for searing or sautéing – to oven without missing a step. Wide handles make our skillets easy to work with and protect you from accidents. For entertaining, don’t forget to have stylish serveware on hand for you and your guests.Not all frying pans are made equal in size. So pick the right skillet for the job for enjoyable cooking. Medium 10" pans are good for searing proteins and cooking several different ingredients. When you feel like making a one-pot meal, larger 12" skillets with high sides come to the rescue. And for quick eggs, go with an 8"'/ pan instead. No matter what you choose, high-quality materials let you finish faster and spend time on the things you love the most. Use a food processor take even more work out of food prep.

Nonstick CookwareMake any meal more enjoyable for the cook with any of the nonstick cookware pieces youʼll find at Williams-Sonoma. Create a full English breakfast for the whole gang on one of our large nonstick griddles. The sausages and bacon will never stick to the cooking surface. Fry up a succulent platter full of fried chicken for the next office picnic in one of our deep, covered nonstick fry pans. They have ample space to completely cook the breading of any battered and then fried food to a mouthwatering golden brown while also evenly heating the foodʼs internal temperature to safe and healthy doneness. Nonstick pans are essential tools for making any sort of egg dish. If you donʼt ever want to deal with the seemingly cemented on mess of an overcooked egg dish again, use our omelet, crepe and frittata pans with quick-release finishes. After you easily slide your crepes, Dutch babies or French toast from the pan to the plate youʼre left with cookware that looks like it never saw an egg. Choose from three collections of Williams-Sonoma nonstick cookware, including ceramic and Open Kitchen lines, or select nonstick pans, casseroles and griddles from your favorite makers including Berndes, SCANPAN, GreenPan and All-Clad. Whether youʼre looking for nonstick cookware with a charcoal gray or creamy white exterior thereʼs a pan to match your kitchen decor and cooking needs.Nonstick cookware sets are available if youʼre seeking to refresh your kitchen equipment. Give a new homeowner an enjoyable start to their cooking adventures with a set of Calphalon or Swiss Diamond Pots, pans and lids. Both brandsʼ factories – as well as manufacturers of most of the nonstick cookware sets and individual pieces we offer – engineer their cookware to have convenient holes at the ends of handles to hang them from a pot rack suspended on your wall or ceiling. This is a great feature for professional chefs; in homes where storage space is limited; or in larger homes where you have an extra-high ceiling and need an accent to pull together and warm up the empty-seeming kitchen. A matching set of new cookware makes a beautiful display in any style of cooking space.If you prefer cookware with a polished or brushed stainless-steel exterior yet you want the ease of food release and cleanup provided by nonstick interiors, our All-Clad, Zwilling, SCANPAN and Williams-Sonoma Signature Thermo-Clad collections have the exterior finishes and nonstick interior qualities youʼre seeking. Some nonstick styles are designed to match our other stainless-steel cookware collections or you can mix and match styles to create a custom stainless-steel oven and stovetop set.Nonstick cookware isnʼt confined to use in the kitchen where itʼs safe, of course. We offer grill-ready nonstick tools that can take the great outdoors and let you deliver flame-kissed and smoky-sweet fish, kebabs and grilled vegetables to the table. Whether itʼs burgers-and-dogs night or youʼre camping and cooking under the stars youʼll love the sleek good looks and rugged performance of our traditional or high-heat grill sets. Make tasty corn, potatoes or seafood for a crowd with these sets and your grill or pack them along on your next RV or tenting adventure.If soups, chilis or steamed seafood are your thing, order a few large stockpots with nonstick interiors that wonʼt leave you scrubbing any scorched pot bottoms. You also have your choice of small and large nonstick saucepans, sauté pans, roasters, poachers and multi-pots. Enjoy cooking sauces and pasta that donʼt cling to the sides of the pan for dear life in the sink. Many styles of our nonstick cookware are safe for use in the dishwasher if you prefer not to hand wash your cookware. Stock up on a nonstick tool set or use heat-safe plastic or wooden utensils in most nonstick cookware to keep the interiors in the best condition and avoid scratches or nicks in the finish.

Cookware SetsDiscover the tools you need to whip up a variety of delicious meals in a single stop. Whether you are moving to a new home and starting from scratch, expanding your cookware collection or upgrading your kitchen tools, our cookware sets collection offer a wide variety of options. Clean up quickly on busy days with stainless-steel or nonstick pots and pans. Prepare meals like a professional chef with copper or cast-iron cookware sets. Prepare delicious delicacies with specialty cookware items, such as mini cocottes, casseroles, butter warmers and Dutch ovens. Williams-Sonoma offers cookware sets from brands, such as All-Clad, Mauviel, Staub and Le Creuset.Cookware sets can include a wide variety of different items and vary in size from two pieces to 30 pieces. Basic sets usually include some combination of saucepans, fry pans, saute pans and stockpots. These sets are good options if you are just starting out as they offer basic, versatile pieces that can cook several different dishes. They are also good choices if you have a small kitchen as they do not take up much space in your cabinets or shelves. Larger sets may include a few specialty items, such as Dutch ovens, sauciers or soup pots. They may also include accessories like pasta and steamer inserts, ladles, screens and racks. These sets work well in large kitchens with lots of storage space and can provide you with a professional setup for creating gourmet meals.Usually, cookware sets include pieces made from the same materials, but there are a few exceptions. For example, some sets may bundle stainless-steel pots and saucepans with nonstick fry and saute pans or consist of cast-iron cookware and ceramic bakeware. Various materials offer you different benefits in the kitchen. Stainless-steel is low maintenance and durable, which makes it a fantastic all-purpose cookware material. Wind down after a busy day with a delicious home-cooked meal and leave the cleanup to the dishwasher. Copper and cast-iron let you hone your inner chef. Pros prefer copper cookware because can heat up quickly and distributes heat evenly. This prevents hot spots that burn ingredients to the bottom of the pan. Cast-iron offers similar benefits, and because it is heavy-duty, you can enjoy years of use from your cookware. Nonstick is a lifesaver if you lead a hectic lifestyle, as the coating on the cookware interior takes mere minutes to clean.Storing your cookware can sometimes be an issue, but our collections feature a variety of solutions. If you are lucky enough to have a spacious kitchen, shelving can be a quick and easy way to expand your storage space enough to include that 30-piece cookware set. An island can also be a great choice, as it does double duty as a preparation area. If your kitchen is on the smaller side, a hanging pot rack can make an excellent option. This storage solution maximizes space and lets you show off your shiny stainless-steel or copper cookware set.Williams-Sonoma offers a great selection of accessories to go with your cookware items. Trivets let you bring your recipes straight from the stove to the table. Materials like wood, silicone and marble absorb heat, which protects your table from hot pots and pans. Pot handles and lids can get hot while you are cooking, so potholders are always handy to have in your kitchen. Dish towels can also protect your hands from warmer surfaces. Although some cookware sets include accessories, such as racks and ladles, smaller sets tend to lack utensils. Browse our collections for tools and accessories to stir, mix, blend, flip and serve your meals. Silicone and wood utensils help keep your nonstick cookware in excellent shape, whereas metal utensils can make an attractive countertop display.

Sauté PansEvery family needs a sauté pan. Busy moms and dads rely on them to make delicious one-pot meals that kids love. At Williams-Sonoma we have a huge variety to choose from. From nonstick and ceramic to stainless-steel and multi-ply offerings with an aluminum or copper core, both professionals and everyday cooks can find the sauté pan of their dreams. And with a ton of different sizes, you can create culinary masterpieces for your family, no matter how big it is. Don’t forget about pizza to make kids happy.Advanced nonstick pans are popular with parents, mainly because of how easy they are to use. All of our nonstick cookware is PFOA-free so you can stay worry-free. Making family favorites is a cinch in a large sauté pan, since there’s plenty of room to prepare whatever you can think of. Best of all, nonstick means effortless cleanup afterward. Just pop your pan in the dishwasher and you’re done. Hard-anodized aluminum conducts heat well for even cooking, and our special coatings are resistant to any kind of cooking utensils – even metal.Stainless-steel helps sauté pans do what they do best – perfect browning. Plus, it’s exceptionally durable and resistant to falls, scratches and just about anything else you throw at it. That’s why it’s a great choice for families. Our stainless-steel cookware is designed to last you a lifetime. An aluminum core adds superior heat-conductivity to ensure even cooking. And the lustrous surface of stainless-steel looks beautiful at the dining room table. Check out our other stainless-steel pieces for every occasion.If you want to equip your kitchen like a pro – or are a professional chef – the All-Clad D5 series is the way to go. All-Clad pieces are well-known and beloved by cooks around the world, thanks to their carefully designed alternating layers of aluminum and stainless-steel. They provide the best of both worlds: the quick heating and precise temperature control of aluminum and the long-lasting construction and non-reactive surface of stainless-steel. That way you get reliable – and incredible – results every time. Heat-resistant stainless-steel handles on both sides allow for easy manipulation without accidents. Professionals know that the right knives are also important for food prep and execution.Copper and copper-core sauté pans offer unmatched heating properties. Copper heats quickly and evenly. That means fast cooking and precise temperature control. No matter where you put your meats in the pan, they all brown equally and masterfully. Making stews or roasts is a lot easier in copper since it cooks all the way around, not just from below. A stainless-steel inner layer retains all of the heating benefits without affecting the flavor of your recipes.Brilliant enamel colors capture the attention of family and friends alike and add flair to any meal. Our enameled cast-iron sauté pans and Dutch ovens are versatile. Cast iron can easily be transferred directly from stove top to oven, so food is able to concentrate all of its juices and flavors for hours. And when it’s ready, all you have to do is take it straight from the kitchen to the table to serve hot. Always protect your table from hot cookware using a trivet. And because the pans are dishwasher-safe, you don’t have to scrub by hand.Nonstick ceramic cookware is another smart idea for quick and easy cooking. Our high-quality professional-grade ceramic coatings are resistant to staining and scratching, so working with them is a breeze. For healthy cooking, this is a great option, since you don’t need to use any oil to brown proteins and veggies like an expert. Ceramic sauté pans are specially designed for use with cutting-edge induction surfaces. And since they’re PFOA-, PFTE-, cadmium- and PFOS-free, you can rest easy knowing your family is safe.

Home  //  Cookware  //  Induction Cookware - Magnetic Induction Ready Cookware  //  Staub CookwareStaub CookwareWe're thrilled to offer this high-quality Staub enameled French cast iron cookware.  Chef's Resource is the only store that carries (almost) every single piece Staub makes, every size, every color. (Color availability varies by piece, all are available in their signature matte black).  Every piece is stocked in our warehouse (a section is shown in the picture), there are no special orders on our very large collection of Staub cast iron cookware.
Enameled cast iron is a traditional and strong material, perfect for low heat cooking.  It retains heat better than any material, including stainless steel and aluminum.  The equal distribution of heat will elimate hot spots, allowing you to cook the most delicate dishes.  All Staub products are enameled on the inside and out, including the black matte finish.  No seasoning is required and it will not react to acidic foods.

Staub CookwareHome-cooked meals are all about big flavors and tender feelings. That’s the essence of traditional American cuisine, rustic Tuscan-inspired meals and delicious French countryside cooking. Good times, great memories and the company of people you love – and that love you back – are hard to beat. At Williams-Sonoma, we believe that this kind of cooking is more than technique or following the recipe to the letter; it springs from the heart and tastes like it. That’s the essence and inspiration behind our Staub cookware. It gets you excited in the kitchen and fills the dining room with lots of emotion. Here’s what makes it so great for family-style meals.When you love to entertain family and friends, it’s a big help to have tools that are specifically designed for the task. Staub enameled cast-iron cookware comes in shapes and sizes that cater well to large groups of people. Wide cocottes make it easy to serve everything from homemade spaghetti to a tasty casserole. A paella pan gives Spanish cooking a delicious twist with perfectly-cooked rice, flavorful chicken and tons of different kinds of seafood. The size of the pan makes cooking for everyone easy.Family-style meals have a lot of benefits, both from the standpoint of parties and relationships. They’re a big hit because everyone feels relaxed. It’s like telling your guests, just come as you are and have a good time. Serving at the table creates an intimate connection between host and guests. They see the way your eyes light up as you give them your very best. Add some fine wine and you’re set for an evening of laughter and heartfelt conversation.Sharing meals together as a family is also a great way for parents to connect with teens and children. Everyone loves great food. With that kind of laidback ambience, and tasty family favorites that go straight to the heart, it’s a lot easier for youngsters to open up about their day. And since a tasty meal helps mom and dad to let go of any stress, they can focus on spending time together without worries.Staub cookware helps you get those signature deep flavors from your meals. How? For one thing, it distributes heat evenly throughout. That’s important because it lets the bottom and top of the pan or cocotte cook the same amount. And the more time proteins and veggies cook in a soup or stew, the more flavor they release. It also results in meat that is tender and moist at the same time.Enameled cast-iron cookware stays warm for a very long time. That’s awesome for stove top to dining room service. When you take the cover off of your cocotte or roaster, all of the sumptuous herb-filled vapors and aromas reach your guests, which opens up their appetite even more. Whether you serve right on the table or on a nearby buffet, use a trivet to have a safe place to set the pan and protect any wood surfaces too.Another thing that makes Staub cookware stand out are its bright and bold colors. They’re a way to express your personality in the kitchen, and accent your dining room design vision. Staub pots and pans immediately become ceramic masterpieces that delight the senses. Dark green, sapphire and wine red are a few possibilities that add style and intense emotion to the space. They create an ambience that can be romantic, elegant, rustic or modern, depending on your cooking and decorative inspirations.Staub cocottes and roasters come in many different shapes and sizes. Some are ideal for cooking a whole chicken together with roasted potatoes and rosemary or thyme. Others are just the right size for beloved side dishes like homemade macaroni and cheese or pot pies. Mini cocottes are great for individual servings of lasagna or chili. There are tons of possibilities. And since enameled cast-iron is so easy to clean – often some soap and water is sufficient – and dishwasher safe, you can get creative and still be done in a flash.

 Fry Pans & SkilletsWhether you’re making breakfast, throwing together a quick lunch or creating a culinary masterpiece for dinner, chances are you rely on skillets to get the job done. At Williams-Sonoma it’s easy to find a new favorite frying pan that stays by your side for years. We have the variety you need to handle recipes of any size and style. There are precision pieces for pros or workhorse skillets that take care of families day after day. They all have one thing in common: high-quality materials that produce excellent results. Having the right cooking utensils on hand is another big help.Relax with nonstick. Our advanced nonstick frying pans give you the easy cleanup and effortless browning you expect, but without harmful materials. All of our cookware is PFAO-free to keep your family safe. Hard-anodized aluminum is damage-resistant and consistent. It distributes heat quickly and evenly so foods cook exactly the way you want. And with three layers of nonstick coating, our skillets can even handle metal cooking utensils without flinching. Pick out a favorite spatula to use with eggs, pancakes and proteins.If you want to take nonstick to the next level, think ceramic. Virtually scratchproof and extremely stain-resistant, ceramic frying pans are a breeze to clean. Even sticky scrambled eggs are simple to wipe off thanks to the ultrasmooth surface. Expect professional results when searing proteins and browning chicken, meats, veggies and other ingredients. And best of all, ceramic is conducive to healthy eating since it lets you cook with very little or no oil at all. A mortar and pestle lets you add tons of natural flavor to dishes.Being able to control the temperature of your ingredients correctly plays a huge part in ending up with a tasty finished product. Our skillets are carefully crafted with smart materials that distribute heat evenly. That way you don’t have to worry about hotspots, sticking, burning and other disasters. Look for pieces with an aluminum or copper core – or several layers – to have a lot of control over heat. The result is food that’s juicy and done just right. An inner layer of stainless-steel is important to guarantee maximum even heating potential to bring out the fullness of flavor.All-Clad means pro. The All-Clad series of cookware is known – and loved – by professional chefs across the globe. That’s because it’s synonymous with unparalleled construction and multiple layers specially designed to enhance every aspect of cooking. Our All-Clad skillets are no different. Aluminum layers conduct and maintain heat throughout the surface, which is important for delicate dishes like omelets or ingredients that have to be cooked to the perfect degree.Enameled cast iron skillets are great for comfort foods and deep flavors. They have enough space for a full breakfast of pancakes, eggs and bacon – even at the same time if you’re in a hurry – right on the stove top. A beautiful enamel finish provides a nonstick cooking surface and means you can take things straight from kitchen to dining room table for easier serving. And when it comes to homemade potatoes au gratin, macaroni and cheese, or slow-cooked meats, cast iron can’t be beat. It can go directly from stove top – for searing or sautéing – to oven without missing a step. Wide handles make our skillets easy to work with and protect you from accidents. For entertaining, don’t forget to have stylish serveware on hand for you and your guests.Not all frying pans are made equal in size. So pick the right skillet for the job for enjoyable cooking. Medium 10" pans are good for searing proteins and cooking several different ingredients. When you feel like making a one-pot meal, larger 12" skillets with high sides come to the rescue. And for quick eggs, go with an 8"'/ pan instead. No matter what you choose, high-quality materials let you finish faster and spend time on the things you love the most. Use a food processor take even more work out of food prep.

Nonstick CookwareMake any meal more enjoyable for the cook with any of the nonstick cookware pieces youʼll find at Williams-Sonoma. Create a full English breakfast for the whole gang on one of our large nonstick griddles. The sausages and bacon will never stick to the cooking surface. Fry up a succulent platter full of fried chicken for the next office picnic in one of our deep, covered nonstick fry pans. They have ample space to completely cook the breading of any battered and then fried food to a mouthwatering golden brown while also evenly heating the foodʼs internal temperature to safe and healthy doneness. Nonstick pans are essential tools for making any sort of egg dish. If you donʼt ever want to deal with the seemingly cemented on mess of an overcooked egg dish again, use our omelet, crepe and frittata pans with quick-release finishes. After you easily slide your crepes, Dutch babies or French toast from the pan to the plate youʼre left with cookware that looks like it never saw an egg. Choose from three collections of Williams-Sonoma nonstick cookware, including ceramic and Open Kitchen lines, or select nonstick pans, casseroles and griddles from your favorite makers including Berndes, SCANPAN, GreenPan and All-Clad. Whether youʼre looking for nonstick cookware with a charcoal gray or creamy white exterior thereʼs a pan to match your kitchen decor and cooking needs.Nonstick cookware sets are available if youʼre seeking to refresh your kitchen equipment. Give a new homeowner an enjoyable start to their cooking adventures with a set of Calphalon or Swiss Diamond Pots, pans and lids. Both brandsʼ factories – as well as manufacturers of most of the nonstick cookware sets and individual pieces we offer – engineer their cookware to have convenient holes at the ends of handles to hang them from a pot rack suspended on your wall or ceiling. This is a great feature for professional chefs; in homes where storage space is limited; or in larger homes where you have an extra-high ceiling and need an accent to pull together and warm up the empty-seeming kitchen. A matching set of new cookware makes a beautiful display in any style of cooking space.If you prefer cookware with a polished or brushed stainless-steel exterior yet you want the ease of food release and cleanup provided by nonstick interiors, our All-Clad, Zwilling, SCANPAN and Williams-Sonoma Signature Thermo-Clad collections have the exterior finishes and nonstick interior qualities youʼre seeking. Some nonstick styles are designed to match our other stainless-steel cookware collections or you can mix and match styles to create a custom stainless-steel oven and stovetop set.Nonstick cookware isnʼt confined to use in the kitchen where itʼs safe, of course. We offer grill-ready nonstick tools that can take the great outdoors and let you deliver flame-kissed and smoky-sweet fish, kebabs and grilled vegetables to the table. Whether itʼs burgers-and-dogs night or youʼre camping and cooking under the stars youʼll love the sleek good looks and rugged performance of our traditional or high-heat grill sets. Make tasty corn, potatoes or seafood for a crowd with these sets and your grill or pack them along on your next RV or tenting adventure.If soups, chilis or steamed seafood are your thing, order a few large stockpots with nonstick interiors that wonʼt leave you scrubbing any scorched pot bottoms. You also have your choice of small and large nonstick saucepans, sauté pans, roasters, poachers and multi-pots. Enjoy cooking sauces and pasta that donʼt cling to the sides of the pan for dear life in the sink. Many styles of our nonstick cookware are safe for use in the dishwasher if you prefer not to hand wash your cookware. Stock up on a nonstick tool set or use heat-safe plastic or wooden utensils in most nonstick cookware to keep the interiors in the best condition and avoid scratches or nicks in the finish.

Cookware SetsDiscover the tools you need to whip up a variety of delicious meals in a single stop. Whether you are moving to a new home and starting from scratch, expanding your cookware collection or upgrading your kitchen tools, our cookware sets collection offer a wide variety of options. Clean up quickly on busy days with stainless-steel or nonstick pots and pans. Prepare meals like a professional chef with copper or cast-iron cookware sets. Prepare delicious delicacies with specialty cookware items, such as mini cocottes, casseroles, butter warmers and Dutch ovens. Williams-Sonoma offers cookware sets from brands, such as All-Clad, Mauviel, Staub and Le Creuset.Cookware sets can include a wide variety of different items and vary in size from two pieces to 30 pieces. Basic sets usually include some combination of saucepans, fry pans, saute pans and stockpots. These sets are good options if you are just starting out as they offer basic, versatile pieces that can cook several different dishes. They are also good choices if you have a small kitchen as they do not take up much space in your cabinets or shelves. Larger sets may include a few specialty items, such as Dutch ovens, sauciers or soup pots. They may also include accessories like pasta and steamer inserts, ladles, screens and racks. These sets work well in large kitchens with lots of storage space and can provide you with a professional setup for creating gourmet meals.Usually, cookware sets include pieces made from the same materials, but there are a few exceptions. For example, some sets may bundle stainless-steel pots and saucepans with nonstick fry and saute pans or consist of cast-iron cookware and ceramic bakeware. Various materials offer you different benefits in the kitchen. Stainless-steel is low maintenance and durable, which makes it a fantastic all-purpose cookware material. Wind down after a busy day with a delicious home-cooked meal and leave the cleanup to the dishwasher. Copper and cast-iron let you hone your inner chef. Pros prefer copper cookware because can heat up quickly and distributes heat evenly. This prevents hot spots that burn ingredients to the bottom of the pan. Cast-iron offers similar benefits, and because it is heavy-duty, you can enjoy years of use from your cookware. Nonstick is a lifesaver if you lead a hectic lifestyle, as the coating on the cookware interior takes mere minutes to clean.Storing your cookware can sometimes be an issue, but our collections feature a variety of solutions. If you are lucky enough to have a spacious kitchen, shelving can be a quick and easy way to expand your storage space enough to include that 30-piece cookware set. An island can also be a great choice, as it does double duty as a preparation area. If your kitchen is on the smaller side, a hanging pot rack can make an excellent option. This storage solution maximizes space and lets you show off your shiny stainless-steel or copper cookware set.Williams-Sonoma offers a great selection of accessories to go with your cookware items. Trivets let you bring your recipes straight from the stove to the table. Materials like wood, silicone and marble absorb heat, which protects your table from hot pots and pans. Pot handles and lids can get hot while you are cooking, so potholders are always handy to have in your kitchen. Dish towels can also protect your hands from warmer surfaces. Although some cookware sets include accessories, such as racks and ladles, smaller sets tend to lack utensils. Browse our collections for tools and accessories to stir, mix, blend, flip and serve your meals. Silicone and wood utensils help keep your nonstick cookware in excellent shape, whereas metal utensils can make an attractive countertop display.

Sauté PansEvery family needs a sauté pan. Busy moms and dads rely on them to make delicious one-pot meals that kids love. At Williams-Sonoma we have a huge variety to choose from. From nonstick and ceramic to stainless-steel and multi-ply offerings with an aluminum or copper core, both professionals and everyday cooks can find the sauté pan of their dreams. And with a ton of different sizes, you can create culinary masterpieces for your family, no matter how big it is. Don’t forget about pizza to make kids happy.Advanced nonstick pans are popular with parents, mainly because of how easy they are to use. All of our nonstick cookware is PFOA-free so you can stay worry-free. Making family favorites is a cinch in a large sauté pan, since there’s plenty of room to prepare whatever you can think of. Best of all, nonstick means effortless cleanup afterward. Just pop your pan in the dishwasher and you’re done. Hard-anodized aluminum conducts heat well for even cooking, and our special coatings are resistant to any kind of cooking utensils – even metal.Stainless-steel helps sauté pans do what they do best – perfect browning. Plus, it’s exceptionally durable and resistant to falls, scratches and just about anything else you throw at it. That’s why it’s a great choice for families. Our stainless-steel cookware is designed to last you a lifetime. An aluminum core adds superior heat-conductivity to ensure even cooking. And the lustrous surface of stainless-steel looks beautiful at the dining room table. Check out our other stainless-steel pieces for every occasion.If you want to equip your kitchen like a pro – or are a professional chef – the All-Clad D5 series is the way to go. All-Clad pieces are well-known and beloved by cooks around the world, thanks to their carefully designed alternating layers of aluminum and stainless-steel. They provide the best of both worlds: the quick heating and precise temperature control of aluminum and the long-lasting construction and non-reactive surface of stainless-steel. That way you get reliable – and incredible – results every time. Heat-resistant stainless-steel handles on both sides allow for easy manipulation without accidents. Professionals know that the right knives are also important for food prep and execution.Copper and copper-core sauté pans offer unmatched heating properties. Copper heats quickly and evenly. That means fast cooking and precise temperature control. No matter where you put your meats in the pan, they all brown equally and masterfully. Making stews or roasts is a lot easier in copper since it cooks all the way around, not just from below. A stainless-steel inner layer retains all of the heating benefits without affecting the flavor of your recipes.Brilliant enamel colors capture the attention of family and friends alike and add flair to any meal. Our enameled cast-iron sauté pans and Dutch ovens are versatile. Cast iron can easily be transferred directly from stove top to oven, so food is able to concentrate all of its juices and flavors for hours. And when it’s ready, all you have to do is take it straight from the kitchen to the table to serve hot. Always protect your table from hot cookware using a trivet. And because the pans are dishwasher-safe, you don’t have to scrub by hand.Nonstick ceramic cookware is another smart idea for quick and easy cooking. Our high-quality professional-grade ceramic coatings are resistant to staining and scratching, so working with them is a breeze. For healthy cooking, this is a great option, since you don’t need to use any oil to brown proteins and veggies like an expert. Ceramic sauté pans are specially designed for use with cutting-edge induction surfaces. And since they’re PFOA-, PFTE-, cadmium- and PFOS-free, you can rest easy knowing your family is safe.

Staub 4.25-Quart Coq au Vin Cocotte in Cherry



                                This beautiful Coq Au Vin cocotte from Staub has been created and perfected in the style of the French oven and commemorates the traditional French poultry dish in size, shape, and appearance.
                            

 Cast iron construction retains and distributes heat evenly, allowing for a consistently textured and thoroughly cooked meal. Extra heavy lid locks in moisture for more flavorful poultry dishes.  Lid interior is dimpled with precisely-positioned bumps meant to drip evaporated juices back onto the cooking food for convenient self-basting.  Exceptional heat retention keeps food hot even long after cocotte is taken off a stovetop or out of the oven.  Enamel coating is highly chip resistant and impervious to discoloration.  Side handles for secure handling. Equipped with nickel-plated rooster lid handle and comes with a standard replacement Staub cocotte knob.  Dishwasher and oven safe.  Suitable for use on all stove types.  Imported.  Limited lifetime warranty.

					Due to the superior construction of the Staub 2 3/4 quart round cocotte lids and nickel steel knob in France, less humidity can escape during the cooking process. 10% more moisture is retained inside the Staub cocotte after 55 minutes cooking time, Oven Safe up to 500 degrees F, than in products from competitors. The self basting system consisting of distributed spikes over the whole inside flat lid ensures a continuous rainfall effect over the food inside the cocotte. The Staub self basting system in the lid is 9 times more effective than conventional lids.Made in FranceManufacturer's Warranty: LifetimeProduct Size: 10.6" x 9.25" x 4.5". Round Cocottes by Staub.

†Offer Details: Offer expires December 31, 2017.  Valid only for new Bing Ads customers who are first party recipients of the offer email. A new Bing Ads customer is one that has not advertised on Bing Ads before. Enter promotional coupon code and spend $25 (applies to threshold and prepaid accounts) to receive $100 in Bing Ads credits. Limit one promotion code per new Bing Ads customer. Promotional code must be redeemed within thirty (30) days of Bing Ads new customer account creation. Ad campaign costs accrued before receiving a credit, as well as costs accrued after all credits are used, will be charged to the payment method associated with the Bing Ads account. If customer payment fails, the coupon amount will not be applied.  Ads will continue to run and accrue costs after any promotional credit has been used up. Any portion of the credit not used within ninety (90) days of credit redemption will expire and can't be carried over even if the Bing Ads Customer switches their payment method. Offer valid only to residents of the United States. In order for the offer to be valid, a form of payment must be entered into your account prior to redemption of the promotional code and prior to your account going live to take advantage of the credit. This offer may not be combined with any other offer, promotional code coupon or discount, separated, redeemed for cash, transferred, sold, or bartered. Microsoft, in its sole discretion, can close your account for any suspected coupon abuse. Refund of the $25 is not permitted.  See Bing Ads Terms and Conditions for more details at sign-up. Other terms and conditions may apply.  Microsoft reserves the right to cancel, change, or suspend this offer at any time without notice.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
