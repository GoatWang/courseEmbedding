About Our Company
National Research Company – Over 60 years of providing products and services to the super abrasives industry.
Founded in 1950, National Research Company began in the formative years of the super abrasives industry. Having previous experience with both the development of natural diamond as an industrial abrasive, as well as, the tungsten carbine tool industry; the company first concentrated on supplying natural diamond for various industrial products. Along with this focus, there was a growing expertise in developing the technology to recycle diamond generated by the grinding of tungsten tooling.
Throughout the early years, the demand quickly exceeded supply and the recycling technology developed by National Research Company provided diamonds for the marketplace, as well as, a compliment of cost savings for both the diamond product manufacturers and consumers. With years of exposure to both sides of the industry, National Research Company formulated a basic philosophy which the company has followed since its inception: Provide the product manufacturers with a super abrasive which offers consistency in performance.

National Research Development Corporation v Commissioner of Patents

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

In Australian patent law, the NRDC case, i.e. National Research Development Corporation v Commissioner of Patents (1959) 102 CLR 252, has been important in clarifying what is meant by "manner of manufacture" in respects of patent applications.
The references to the Patents Act in this case refer to the Australian Patents Act 1952 (Cth) which was later repealed by the introduction of the Patents Act 1990.

Facts[edit]
The National Research Development Corporation (NRDC) discovered a new method to apply known chemicals to the soil so as to kill weeds but not the crops. The chemicals were known to science but were never used in the process of eradicating weeds. NRDC applied for a patent for the new process.
The Commissioner of Patents rejected the application on the grounds that it was not a "manner of manufacture" under section 6 of the Statute of Monopolies because

the invention was neither a new saleable product nor a new process for producing a saleable product
the invention involved an agricultural process which could not be a manner of manufacture
the invention was merely a new use for an existing product

NRDC appealed under s. 49(4) to the Court as the Appeal Tribunal for the purposes of the Act. The case was argued before a Full Court.
The complete specification in the present case contains six claims. Those numbered 4, 5 and 6 are for selective herbicidal compositions, and are not here in question. Claims 1, 2 and 3 are in these terms:

A method for eradicating weeds from crop areas containing a growing crop selected from leguminous fodder crops of the genera Trifolium and Medicago, celery and parsnip.
A method for the control of weeds of the type of charlock, creeping thistle and annual nettle in a lucerne (alfalfa) crop.
A method for the control of weeds of the type of charlock, creeping thistle and annual nettle in a clover crop.

The Commissioner did not consider the new process a manner of manufacture and argued that the definition of invention is restricted to vendible products and processes for their production, and excludes all agricultural and horticultural processes.
The appellant (NRDC), argued that the new process can be considered a "manner of manufacture" subject to the definition in the Patents Act 1990 and grant of privilege under s. 6 of the Statute of Monopolies if a process produces, either immediately or ultimately, an economically useful result.
Issues[edit]
The issue for the court was to determine if this new process of weed – killing constituted a "manner of manufacture" and could therefore be considered a patentable invention.
The court had to consider whether it is enough that a process produces a useful result or whether it is necessary that some physical thing is either brought into existence or so affected as the better to serve man's purposes.
Legal issues considered[edit]

NRDC brought the appeal under s49 Patents Act 1952 which sets out the ground for acceptance of a patent request.
Definition of "manner of manufacture" contained within section 6 of the Statute of Monopolies
Section 6 Patents Act 1952; definition of "patent" as a "letters patent for an invention". This definition is now enclosed in section 18(1) Patents Act 1990
The Deputy Commissioner, and on the authority of Re Application by Standard Oil Development Co. (1951) 68 RPC 114 decided, in respect of each of the three claims, that the method claimed was not a manner of manufacture, his reason being that it did not result in any vendible product.[1]
of Patents v Microcell Ltd;[2] the Commissioner alleged that NRDC's new process was merely a new use for an existing product pursuant to the precedent set in this case
G.E.C.'s Application (1943) 60 RPC 1; A test for assessing whether a method or process is a manner of manufacture was formulated in this case. It was held that a method or process is a manner of manufacture if it




(a) results in the production of some vendible product or
(b) improves or restores to its former condition a vendible product or
(c) has the effect of preserving from deterioration some vendible product to which it is applied[3]



The outcome of the NRDC case, reduced these rules to guidelines and the notion of "vendible" and "product" should be given a broad interpretation, pursuant to the broad interpretation of "manner of manufacture" in section 6 of the Statute of Monopolies.
Decision[edit]
(i) Processes may be patented provided that it produces a material advantage and has a new and useful effect that produces a physical product.[4]
(ii) NRDC's new process made use of existing chemicals that had never been used in eradicating weeds. A new use of a known substance is patentable provided the use takes advantage of a previously unknown property.[5] That is it must be used in a way that it has never been used or thought to use previously. Therefore, in this case, it is the process not the article that constitutes the invention.[5]
(iii) The outcome of this new process was only arrived at by scientific ingenuity and research and is considered a vendible product because it created an artificial state of affairs in respect of weeds and crops and achieved an economically useful result.
(iv) Agricultural and horticultural processes are not outside the limits of patentable inventions provided they are not excluded by any other of the "traditional principles" as in the case of Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken v Mirabella International[6] and the new agricultural and horticultural processes produce a new and useful product.[7]

In Australian patent law, the NRDC case, i.e. National Research Development Corporation v Commissioner of Patents (1959) 102 CLR 252, has been important in clarifying what is meant by "manner of manufacture" in respects of patent applications.
The references to the Patents Act in this case refer to the Australian Patents Act 1952 (Cth) which was later repealed by the introduction of the Patents Act 1990.

Facts[edit]
The National Research Development Corporation (NRDC) discovered a new method to apply known chemicals to the soil so as to kill weeds but not the crops. The chemicals were known to science but were never used in the process of eradicating weeds. NRDC applied for a patent for the new process.
The Commissioner of Patents rejected the application on the grounds that it was not a "manner of manufacture" under section 6 of the Statute of Monopolies because

the invention was neither a new saleable product nor a new process for producing a saleable product
the invention involved an agricultural process which could not be a manner of manufacture
the invention was merely a new use for an existing product

NRDC appealed under s. 49(4) to the Court as the Appeal Tribunal for the purposes of the Act. The case was argued before a Full Court.
The complete specification in the present case contains six claims. Those numbered 4, 5 and 6 are for selective herbicidal compositions, and are not here in question. Claims 1, 2 and 3 are in these terms:

A method for eradicating weeds from crop areas containing a growing crop selected from leguminous fodder crops of the genera Trifolium and Medicago, celery and parsnip.
A method for the control of weeds of the type of charlock, creeping thistle and annual nettle in a lucerne (alfalfa) crop.
A method for the control of weeds of the type of charlock, creeping thistle and annual nettle in a clover crop.

The Commissioner did not consider the new process a manner of manufacture and argued that the definition of invention is restricted to vendible products and processes for their production, and excludes all agricultural and horticultural processes.
The appellant (NRDC), argued that the new process can be considered a "manner of manufacture" subject to the definition in the Patents Act 1990 and grant of privilege under s. 6 of the Statute of Monopolies if a process produces, either immediately or ultimately, an economically useful result.
Issues[edit]
The issue for the court was to determine if this new process of weed – killing constituted a "manner of manufacture" and could therefore be considered a patentable invention.
The court had to consider whether it is enough that a process produces a useful result or whether it is necessary that some physical thing is either brought into existence or so affected as the better to serve man's purposes.
Legal issues considered[edit]

NRDC brought the appeal under s49 Patents Act 1952 which sets out the ground for acceptance of a patent request.
Definition of "manner of manufacture" contained within section 6 of the Statute of Monopolies
Section 6 Patents Act 1952; definition of "patent" as a "letters patent for an invention". This definition is now enclosed in section 18(1) Patents Act 1990
The Deputy Commissioner, and on the authority of Re Application by Standard Oil Development Co. (1951) 68 RPC 114 decided, in respect of each of the three claims, that the method claimed was not a manner of manufacture, his reason being that it did not result in any vendible product.[1]
of Patents v Microcell Ltd;[2] the Commissioner alleged that NRDC's new process was merely a new use for an existing product pursuant to the precedent set in this case
G.E.C.'s Application (1943) 60 RPC 1; A test for assessing whether a method or process is a manner of manufacture was formulated in this case. It was held that a method or process is a manner of manufacture if it




(a) results in the production of some vendible product or
(b) improves or restores to its former condition a vendible product or
(c) has the effect of preserving from deterioration some vendible product to which it is applied[3]



The outcome of the NRDC case, reduced these rules to guidelines and the notion of "vendible" and "product" should be given a broad interpretation, pursuant to the broad interpretation of "manner of manufacture" in section 6 of the Statute of Monopolies.
Decision[edit]
(i) Processes may be patented provided that it produces a material advantage and has a new and useful effect that produces a physical product.[4]
(ii) NRDC's new process made use of existing chemicals that had never been used in eradicating weeds. A new use of a known substance is patentable provided the use takes advantage of a previously unknown property.[5] That is it must be used in a way that it has never been used or thought to use previously. Therefore, in this case, it is the process not the article that constitutes the invention.[5]
(iii) The outcome of this new process was only arrived at by scientific ingenuity and research and is considered a vendible product because it created an artificial state of affairs in respect of weeds and crops and achieved an economically useful result.
(iv) Agricultural and horticultural processes are not outside the limits of patentable inventions provided they are not excluded by any other of the "traditional principles" as in the case of Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken v Mirabella International[6] and the new agricultural and horticultural processes produce a new and useful product.[7]

Advanced Search

                There are 3 types of search. Please only use one option at a time.
                
1) Build a boolean search string.
Ensure that document matches include...

...all of these word(s):



...and optionally include these word(s):



...but do not have these word(s):




2) Search for a phrase:

Enter your phrase:




3) Search on part of a word:

Enter the first few characters of a word:




Submit



Information on how to use Search

                    There are 2 types of basic queries: Terms and Phrases.
                    A Term is a single word search.
                    A Phrase would wrap a string of words in quotes and find matches on the extact string.
                

Boolean Operators
You can combine basic queries with Boolean operators to form a more complex query. Boolean operators define the relationships between Terms or Phrases. Our search supports the following Boolean operators: AND, "+", OR, NOT and "-". Please note that Boolean operators must be all uppercase.
                

AND
example search: default AND document
                    This is the default operator. It will be used if there is no Boolean operator between two terms. For example:
                    default document is the same as default AND document. In this case both terms need to exist within a listing to find a match on that listing.The + character is synonymous with using AND.
                

OR
example search: default OR document
                    In this case just one of the terms needs to exist within a listing to find a match on that listing.
                

NOT
example search: default NOT "document type"
                    The NOT operator excludes documents that contain the term (or phrase) after NOT. So a listing match would have to include the word default but not the phrase "document type". The - character is synonymous with using NOT.
                

Wildcard/Prefix queries
You can perform "wildcard" or "prefix" queries using the '*' operator. Whereas all of the previous search found exact matches on the whole term or phrase, a wildcard search will find partial matches.
                    example search: ehr*
                    This query will match all documents containing words beginning with the prefix 'ehr' like the word Ehrlichia.

RSI Alert: National Research Now Oversold
The DividendRank formula at Dividend Channel ranks a coverage universe of thousands of dividend stocks, according to a proprietary formula designed to identify those stocks that combine two important characteristics — strong fundamentals and a valuation that looks inexpensive. National Research Corp presently has an excellent rank, in the top 25% of the coverage universe, which suggests it is among the top most "interesting" ideas that merit further research by investors.

National Research Corp.: A 'Controlled Company' Earning Economic Profits - National Research Corp (NASDAQ:NRCIA) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»National Research Corp.: A 'Controlled Company' Earning Economic ProfitsJun.27.17 | About: National Research (NRCIA) Joseph Harry Value, growth at reasonable price, long only, contrarianSummaryFounder and CEO controls the company through 'B' shares.This allows a longer-term orientation and aligned shareholder goals.Capital allocation ratios indicate an excellent business.Discrepancies in the price of the different share classes.I stumbled upon National Research Corporation (NRCIA) (NRCIB) running a stock screener for small and mid-caps that earn high returns on invested capital, and was instantly intrigued. The company is "controlled" by its founder and current CEO, Michael D. Hays, who signs the annual letter 'fellow owner'. While allotting so much power in the hands of one individual can entail risk, it also can mean better alignment between the company and its shareholders. The owner-operator issue Taken from the annual report, we can see the ownership structure of the company below: 

 Hays owns over half the 'B' class shares, which are entitled to one vote per share, and over a quarter of the lesser 'A' shares, which are entitled to only one-one-hundredth (1/100th) of one vote per share. The 'B' shares constitute 94% of the total voting power related to the company. The company also has a staggered board, another potential defense mechanism if takeover attempts were ever an issue. The company does note in the annual report that five out of the six board members are independent. There is no official chairman role, however, because:  The Board believes its current leadership structure is appropriate at this time since it establishes the Company’s chief executive officer as the primary executive leader with one vision and eliminates ambiguity as to who has primary responsibility for the Company’s performance.  It has designated a "lead director" instead, but for all intents and purposes, an investment in NRC Health inherently involves putting a lot of trust in CEO Hays, who as an "owner-operator" has most of the control over not only voting concerns, but also the strategic vision and direction of the overall company. It should also be noted that his overall salary for fiscal 2016 was far from excessive at $248,396, with $127,400 of it being his base salary.
 Hays appears to be a capable capital allocator The current founder and CEO of NRC Health seems to being doing a great job, judging by the company's capital allocation metrics. I created the below chart in Excel to examine the company's return on invested capital. 

 NRC Health has a notable track record of achieving above-average returns on invested capital over the past decade, and fiscal 2016 wasn't any different. The company has hardly any "off-balance sheet" operating leases and hardly any debt in its overall capital structure.  Adding to its strong balance sheet, the company has also consistently turned 18% to 20% (or more, according to data from Morningstar) of revenues into free cash flow each year as well. Free cash flow has exceeded net income each of the last ten years, too, so it could be argued that sustainable, high quality earnings are another positive that can be added to the list. The equity slice, and the effects of different share classes Next I'd like to take a look at return on equity. I broke NRC Health's ROE down into five different pieces to see what's been driving it over the last few years. 

 We can see operating margins bounced back in 2016, and management has boosted efficiency as well, at least judging by the increase in asset turnover. Higher margins and better asset turn have allowed higher ROE in 2016, despite less magnification from leverage than in 2015, and only a moderate increase in 2016 from 2014. This is an area that could likely be improved in a few ways:
 1.) Tax reform: NRC Health's ROE would be boosted if taxes in the US were lowered, judging by its relatively high tax rate. 2.) More leverage: A higher leverage ratio could boost ROE. It's hard to find fault with management's capital allocation track record, however, at least in my opinion. The dual share class is one area of concern to consider, though. The 'A" shares are highly liquid, but the 'B' shares are the opposite. There has also been dramatic performance discrepancies between the two as well. 

NRCIA data by YCharts Dividends are also dramatically different between the two share classes, as well as valuations. The 'B' shares trade at 16.64 times 2016 earnings and yield 5%, but aren't very liquid. The liquid, lesser-voting-power 'A' shares trade at 56 times 2016 diluted earnings and yield only 1.33%. Conclusion There seems to be a big disconnect in the different share classes, and unless I buy the less-liquid 'B' shares, it appears I have no shareholder rights and am just along for the ride. The 'A' shares are largely owned by Mr. Hays' trust as well. I'm still trying to figure out management's motives for the recap that created the separate share classes, as well as why there's such a wide discount. While I'm a fan of the business as a whole, I'm not so sure I like the dual share classes. As of now, I'm leaning more towards the 'B' shares, if at all. If anyone has more added insight into the dual share class, and/or benefits of both, please share in the comment section below.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

The LegalZoom 3-step process was developed by attorneys from some of the most prestigious law firms in America. There are no complex instructions to follow and nothing to download or print. Simply answer a few questions and get started on
              setting up your corporation.

Here's how it works:

Complete the Incorporation Questionnaire
						Complete our simple questionnaire. With LegalZoom, you can choose to form a new corporation or incorporate an existing business. You can also select provisions to help you guard against personal liability.
We Create and File Your Incorporation Papers
						We create and file the Articles of Incorporation (or, in some states, the "Certificate of Formation" or "Certificate of Incorporation") with the Secretary of State (or in some states, the "Department of State" or "Corporation Commission"). We even create company-specific bylaws and organizational minutes.
Final Wrap-Up
						When we receive your filed Articles of Incorporation back from the state, we send them to you along with the rest of your formation documents, as well as easy instructions regarding next steps.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.
