Best Questions to Ask a Kitchen Remodeling Contractor Contractor


Are you union or non-union?

This really only matters if you have a preference, but it is good to ask. If you have a strong ideological belief about unions or nonunions, it's perfectly acceptable to make a decision based on the preference.



What is your projected timeline for the Kitchen Remodeling project in Post Falls?

Though a standard question, it's important to ask. Most contractors will tell you how long they expect the job to take without you asking. If they don't volunteer that information, be sure to ask. It's also helpful to ask if that's a hard finish date, meaning that it's the definite finish date. If it's a soft finish date, it may be extended for any number of reasons.



Do you hire properly documented Kitchen Remodeling workers?

This will be answered when you ask if all employees are licensed. The only way to obtain a legitimate tradesman's license is to be a legal or naturalized citizen of the US. The company may employ people in positions that don't require a license, however, so it's wise to inquire.



Is your bill for Kitchen Remodeling in Post Falls an estimate or a final price?

This is very important, since an estimate is just that. Many contractors will submit a "paper estimate", meaning they've written the estimate down on paper. The bill is the true amount owed and will almost always say "Invoice" or "Bill" at the top of the page. The bill should also list the date it was issued, the due date of payment, and a list of services rendered.

He leads the team that builds integrated funding and marketing partnerships with corporations that work with National Geographic to further its mission to inspire people to care about the planet.  

In addition, he leads fundraising efforts for the Global Exploration Fund, a new National Geographic initiative to create a network of regional offices to fund grants for scientific research, underwrite innovative exploration programs and present a series of public programs.
 
Prior to joining National Geographic, Bennett was chief advancement officer of Safe Kids Worldwide, an international injury prevention organization. In this role, he was responsible for the fundraising, communications and public policy functions of an organization with over 350 affiliates in the United States and operations in 17 other countries.
 
His previous experience includes serving as vice president of United Cerebral Palsy of America and as director of the Fundraising and Sponsorship Group of Odell, Simms & Lynch, a consulting firm that provides services to nonprofit organizations. Early in his career, Bennett worked in federal politics as a finance director for two United States Senate campaigns and as a fundraiser for a national political party.
 
He is actively involved in community service — he is currently chairman of the board of Capital City Public Charter School, an award-winning institution in the District of Columbia that serves children from kindergarten through 12th grade.
