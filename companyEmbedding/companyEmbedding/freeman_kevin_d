He will explain that there is no one size fits all solution as events are happening quickly and the challenges can morph quickly. Just as a football team must plan for a variety of offensive strategies and attacks, investors must be prepared to strategically adjust.

Editorial Reviews


From the Publisher
“America’s political and military leaders may be ignoring our economy’s vulnerability to foreign attack, but our enemies aren’t. The information in Game Plan is essential for protecting your family from the devastation that economic warfare would bring. Being the messenger for this kind of warning may not be much fun, but I can’t think of anyone better than Kevin Freeman to ring the bell.”GLENN BECK, #1 bestselling author of MIRACLES AND MASSACRES"As Kevin Freeman points out, America is facing a global economic war which has direct threats for your family, your job, and your life savings. Yet, despite his five-year effort to warn Washington, willful blindness appears to be at work, preventing our leadership from protecting you. Reading Game Plan will provide the hidden truth about the economic threats targeting you and provide you the actionable steps you should take to protect your family."LT. GEN. WILLIAM G. “JERRY” BOYKIN (U.S.A. RET.), former commander of Special Forces Command and the Green Berets and former deputy under secretary of defense for intelligence“No one has done more to warn our government about the threat of financial terrorism than Kevin Freeman. His new book Game Plan provides a clear strategy for Americans to follow in order to protect themselves against an inevitable attack. If Washington continues its dysfunction, it will become even more essential for average citizens to know how to defend their finances.”CONGRESSMAN STEVE STOCKMAN (R-Tex.)"Kevin Freeman understands the threat of financial terrorism as well as anyone. You'd have to be negligent to ignore his timely advice about protecting your family from the economic attacks that are clearly on the horizon."FRANK KEATING,President and CEO, American Bankers Association, former governor of Oklahoma"Kevin Freeman is a national treasure. His ability to synthesize economic and national security is unsurpassed  and of incalculable importance in the conflict of our time: the War for the Free World."FRANK GAFFNEY, President and Founder, Center for Security Policy“The threat of financial terrorism is very real, and nobody knows that threat more thoroughly than Kevin Freeman. In this book, he'll tell you how to deal with the possibility of financial collapse, and give you hope for the future, too.”BEN SHAPIRO, New York Times bestselling author of "Bullies: How the Left's Culture of Fear and Intimidation Silences America""Game Plan is an important look at one of the most significant threats to U.S. security: Cyber attacks and other efforts designed to cripple the economy. Must reading for those interested in protecting national security.”BILL GERTZ, senior editor of The Washington Free Beacon and national security columnist at The Washington Times"This work is a new National Security Primer. If our elected leaders, national security, intelligence and military officials ignore his well-researched analysis, 9-11 could look like child's play. Moreover, our technology and industry leaders (those who by virtue of daily global challenges understand his remarkable vector) will hopefully start lively chatter in their communities about the nature of this potential immense and perhaps imminent calamity. Serious scholars will hopefully take the critical decision to ask "Why have we missed this series of interlocking threats?" Academia owes the nation a rigorous review of this work. It simply cannot be ignored. Markets matter. Our nation matters. This book matters.”HON. THOMAS W. O'CONNELL, Former Assistant Secretary of Defense, Special Operations 2003-7

Meet the Author



Kevin D. Freeman, a senior fellow at the Center for Security Policy and one of the world’s leading experts on economic warfare and financial terrorism, wrote a special report for the Department of Defense uncovering the deliberate attacks that took place during the U.S. financial collapse of 2008. That report was the basis of Secret Weapon: How Economic Terrorism Brought Down the U.S. Stock Market and Why It Can Happen Again (2012). A protégé of the legendary investor Sir John Templeton, Freeman is the founder and CEO of Freeman Global Investment Counsel and lives with his family in the Dallas–Fort Worth area.
