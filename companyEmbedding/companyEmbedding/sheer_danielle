 Beautycounter Lip Sheer Review 
 Danielle Bisbano - Monday, January 20, 2014 
 
I have a confession to make.  I have been almost silent about the first color cosmetic product in the Beautycounter line even though it has been out for months.  Even though I am a makeup artist and even though I love it.  Even though I use it and even though, like everything else in the line, it is amazing.  I have been quiet because, well, it's not cheap.  We all have budgets, I get it.  But then Christy Coleman (Beautycounter's celebrity makeup artist) said that you can also use the Lip Sheers as a blush and I thought, "hmmmmmm".  It took me forever to remember to do it (no idea why) but, oh my, was she right.  Not only can you use it as a blush, it is actually quite fantastic.  It has amazing staying power and beautiful color.  So now that you can multitask with one beautifully packaged, non-toxic, vanilla scented wonder . . .  I'm telling you about it!   

A little 411 on these babies.  Six shades in all: Petal, Twig, Coral, Rose, Currant and Plum (in order per the pic above).  Here is the breakdown:
Petal: Beautifully soft, light pink.  Very sheer.  Perfect for non-lipstick wearers or when you want a truly soft wash of natural color.
Twig: Have you spent the better part of your teenage and adult life searching for the perfect nude lip color?  Me, too.  The search is over.  You're welcome.  

Coral: Can't really elaborate on the shade all that much . . . "coral" is a perfectly perfect description. 

Rose: Deeper pink than Petal. Very romantic and pretty. 

Currant: Lovely reddish-brown.  More intense shade.  Classic. Not as red as the picture.

Plum: Beautiful purple-toned red.  Lovely. 

These shades were formulated to look good on every skin tone so you just have to pick the one you like the best.  The shades most suited as a blush are Coral, Rose, Currant and Plum.  The darker the shade, the more staying power in general.  In fact, Currant and Plum most definitely have a stain factor to them.  They are also my personal favorites as blushes, Plum being my number one.  I am a big fan of a flushed cheek look and Plum really does the trick. 

The texture of the Lip Sheers is kind of hard to describe.  They are their own little enigma.  They are not really a lipstick or a lip balm or a lip stain or a lip gloss.  They are kind of just the best parts of all of those things.  They go on like butter.  Seriously.  They smell like vanilla and feel beautifully soft on your lips.  The packaging makes you feel kinda sorta super special when you put it on, too.  All fancy like.  See???

 (Twig pictured here)

Currant and Plum are especially versatile.  One coat will give you a sheer wash of color.  A second coat right on top of that adds intensity and impact.  Top any of these shades off with the Beautycounter Lip Shine ($24) and you will add gloss and a slight shimmer, giving you yet another completely different look.  

Locals can borrow one from me if you want to try before you buy!  The Beautycounter Lip Sheers are $28 each.  If you want to get yourself the perfect nude color (Twig), the perfect day to evening color (Plum) and the gloss, try The Quintessential Collection for $75.  Want it all?  The Complete Collection retails for $175.
Now you know!

Danielle Sheer is passionate about the law — and about technology. She considers herself “a company person,” and she’s found a great match in her current role as the first vice president and general counsel of Carbonite Inc., a seven-year-old public tech company that provides online backup services.




 


“I’d say my biggest accomplishment is successfully advancing the legal function as the ‘go-to’ team for the business,” Sheer said. “The world is made up of many different types of attorneys; my kind are the builders and the problem solvers.”
Sheer — who previously worked in the corporate practice of the New York law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP, where she learned to advise technology companies on matters related to mergers and acquisitions and IPOs — founded and developed the in-house legal function at Carbonite in 2009 and helped guide the company successfully to its initial public offering in August 2011. This was at a time, she observed, when many other companies with IPO ambitions were not so lucky. “It is a special opportunity to be on the inside of a rapidly growing company while also keeping in perspective that the outside world is just trying to understand who you are and what your mission is,” she said. Sheer also played a key role in helping Carbonite secure its first patents issued by the USPTO and establish its China operation in Beijing. And, she finds time to run Carbonite’s legal internship program that has seen all of the company’s interns successfully secure legal employment post-graduation. Ultimately, Sheer’s business philosophy is a simple one: “Ask questions, lots of questions. If the answers aren’t in plain-English, keep asking.”
