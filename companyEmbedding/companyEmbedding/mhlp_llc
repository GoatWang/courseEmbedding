But before you start sending out dozens of emails and making phone calls, sit down and think about your project. What's your budget? What is the scope of your project? Will you need more than one type of professional to complete your home improvement project? Can you afford to complete the full project now, or should you tackle it bit by bit?Once you've settled on your project’s priorities, budget and scope, it's time to start researching home design professionals. Don't sell yourself short and settle on the first professional you set your sights on. Make sure that you're working with someone local, who can get to the jobsite easily and efficiently. Look into the person’s reviews, ask to speak with former clients and to see previous jobs in person. Take a good look at their portfolio photos: How similar are these projects to your own? Be honest — that mansion might look beautiful, but it might not have a lot in common with your little bungalow.Reach out to multiple professionals — especially for larger projects — and don't settle for the first bid you hear. Comparing multiple Charleston, WV professionals' bids and experiences can help you find the one that’s best for you. Ask a lot of questions now, so you won't have unexpected answers later.Find a home design professional on Houzz. Narrow down your search by type of professional and location.

15 Charleston, WV Real Estate AgentsA successful home purchase or sale nearly always starts with a good agent or broker. Real estate is a complex and continually changing business, and Charleston agents and brokers are trained and educated in its many rules, regulations and standards. They have the inside scoop on different Charleston, WV neighborhoods and areas and know what constitutes a fair price in the market. Hiring a pro also means you won’t have to deal directly with the prospective buyers or sellers, which may save you some tension. More

What does an agent or broker do?Although the terms “agent” and “broker” often are used interchangeably, they’re not the same thing. Generally, a broker must have more specialized education as well as licensing, and as a result is legally authorized to execute a real estate transaction. Brokers usually play a more administrative role in the real estate process. An agent, by contrast, is a salesperson hired by a broker to interact with and handle the legwork for the clients. You can find more real estate agents in South Charleston, Saint Albans, Cross Lanes, Dunbar and Nitro.A buyer’s agent represents a home buyer or seller in a real estate transaction. A buyer’s agent will find Charleston, WV property listings that match your needs, works with the seller’s agent to schedule showings and accompanies you on visits to tour the home. If you’re interested in the house, the agent handles price negotiations and other terms of the sale, and coordinates the appropriate paperwork.A seller’s agent will help you determine a listing price for a Charleston, WV property and can suggest repairs, upgrades and staging ideas to boost the home’s appeal. He or she is in charge of marketing the house to prospective buyers and other agents through signage, websites, print ads, open houses and other methods. As with a buyer’s agent, a seller’s agent represents you in negotiating the sale.Questions to ask a prospective agent or broker: How long have you been in the business? How long have you worked in this area? Do you work full time or part time in this business? Do you represent buyers or sellers exclusively, or both? What are your professional affiliations? For sellers: How will you market my home? For buyers: How will you find homes that might interest me? Have you had recent sales in the neighborhoods that I might interested in? Can you provide me with references? What license(s) do you have? How do you charge? What do your services include? Will I be working with anyone else? Find an agent or broker on Houzz. Narrow your search in the Professionals section of the website to West Virginia agents and brokers. If you’re in the market to buy or sell a home, you may be interested in hiring other professionals as well.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
