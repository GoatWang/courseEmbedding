Richard L. Franklin





  Richard L. Franklin, the Australian philosopher, developed an idea of indeterministic (libertarian) freedom as the "selective directing of attention" in our thoughts, which develop intentions preparatory to actions. This rough idea seems to be in much earlier thought (e.g., William James's Principles of Psychology), and Franklin seems unaware of the importance of the concept of focusing attention in modern psychology and cognitive science.

Franklin is enthusiastic about analytical language philosophical techniques inspired by Ludwig Wittgenstein which dis-solve philosophical problems.

He is not embarrassed to say that such a concept puts human freedom outside the natural causal order, which he believes is causal and deterministic. His view is thus in the category of "metaphysical" freedoms such as agent causation, non-occurrent causation, and contra-causal freedom. He cites R. M. Hare, Wilfred Sellars, Richard Taylor, and others as holding similar views.
   


Excerpts from Franklin's Freewill and Determinism

  (Routledge, Kegan, Paul, 1968)

THE PROBLEM (pp.1-5)Fra

The problem of freewill is always with us. Both libertarianism and determinism, and each in many forms, have been proved to the satisfaction of innumerable protagonists; while to the satisfaction of innumerable others the conflict has been dissolved, has been shown to rest on misunderstandings of the concepts involved. The thesis of this book is both more modest and more ambitious than any of these. It is more modest in that, though I have argued for one particular view, I have not claimed to present conclusive reasons for it; and in fact I have tried to show in what respects, and on what grounds, it could and would be rationally rejected by many men. It is more ambitious in that I believe I have placed the problem in a new perspective. I have suggested why there is this never-ending dispute; what underlies the contentions of each position; why at a given period one may be in the ascendent over others; why the protagonists so easily, in fact almost inevitably, overstate their cases; and finally, what might offer the best chance of future progress.

Let us begin with a simple statement of the problem, and of the positions which may be adopted. Men do not often doubt that in most circumstances they can freely decide between one course of action and another, in a way that certainly inanimate objects, and presumably also animals, cannot. Nor, in the realm of morals, do they often doubt that unless a man chose freely he cannot properly be praised or blamed for his action. These beliefs give rise to a problem, however, when they are considered together with other frequently held ones which may seem to leave no place for such freedom. There thus arises the philosophical problem of freewill. Historically the difficulty has often been that of reconciling freedom with beliefs in God's omniscience or foreordination of all things, which raise what may be called questions of predestination. In the present climate of opinion among British philosophers these issues have been largely handed over to theologians, and for reasons of space I shall largely have to leave them there. I am concerned with another set of considerations which give rise to what may be called the problem of determinism.

People not only make choices, they explain why choices are made and they predict what they will be. If we reflect on what is involved in explanation or prediction we may conclude that they always involve some more or less explicit and more or less precise generalisation to the effect that this sort of thing occurs in this sort of situation. The ideal limit of such a generalisation is a causal or scientific law to which there are no exceptions. Moreover, on further reflection we may decide we cannot doubt that such laws exist, even if undiscovered. For we can hardly doubt that in principle all that occurs is fully explicable, and only this ideal limit, it may seem, would give a really satisfactory explanation. In traditional language the Law of Causation, that every event has a cause, is equivalent to the Principle of Sufficient Reason, 'by virtue of which', as Leibniz formulates it, we consider that no fact can be real or existing and no proposition can be true unless there is a sufficient reason, why it should be thus and not otherwise, even though in most cases these reasons cannot be known to us.

And on this Principle (together with the Principle of Contradiction), he said, all our reasoning is based., Yet the existence of such causal laws may seem to imply that for a given agent in a given situation only one course of action is a real possibility, and may thus seem incompatible with his freedom.

To this general problem philosophers return many different answers, but they may conveniently be grouped into three types. One position is that our distinctive human power to choose implies 'contra-causal' or undetermined freedom. This is libertarianism. It divides into various forms, which differ as to whether all or only some, and if so which, choices imply indeterminism. For example, one form holds that we have undetermined freedom only when facing up to moral demands.

The second group consists of philosophers who accept the incompatibility which the libertarian alleges between causality and at least the usual notion of freedom; accept, as he does not, the principle of universal causation; and thus reject the belief in freedom. These are par excellence determinists. We may, however, distinguish two sub-groups. First, there are those who aim to break to men the news that they are in no significant sense free. Secondly, there are those who set out to reconcile determinism with some consciously transformed notion of freedom. They agree that the common or unphilosophical notion of freedom inclines to libertarianism, but argue that this is a vulgar error, and that true freedom is, say, the recognition of necessity.
The less that such a philosopher emphasises or concedes that his view of freedom is not the common one, the more he merges into a third group. These deny that the suggested incompatibility between freedom and universal causation exists at all. They refuse to save the notion of freedom by transforming it; they believe it is not the common man but the philosopher who is confused. Since, they suggest, we all assume both that we are free and that
all events can be explained, it is for the philosopher to show by careful analysis how these beliefs fit together, and not to sacrifice either to the other. If we thus examine carefully what is under our noses we will discover what we might have expected: that the apparent conflict is due to various conceptual errors, such as, in the realm of morals, a faulty analysis of the concept of responsibility, or of the assertion that the agent 'could have done something else'. We will then see that what we all mean by freedom, and not some truncated or transformed account of it, is compatible with, and perhaps requires, determinism.
Traditionally there are only two classifications, 'libertarian' and 'determinist', to apply to all these positions; for the word 'indeterminist', which is sometimes found, seems to be nothing but a synonym for 'libertarian'. This leads to little confusion, except In the case of the third group of philosophers. 'Libertarian' suggests to them that we have an undetermined freedom, and 'determinist' that we are not as free as we thought; and it is the very point of their contention that both these suggestions are wrong. Since they claim that on a proper analysis the problem dissolves, I find it sometimes useful to call them `dissolutionists'. In general, there are some contexts, such as that of clarifying the precise libertarian position, where it is convenient to call all denials of libertarianism 'determinist'; and others, including many ethical ones, where the threefold classification is more helpful. But all such nomenclature is merely a matter of convenience, and I do not wish to pin on anyone a label to which he would object. 1


1 A determinist is commonly defined as one who asserts that all choices are caused. It might therefore seem that dissolutionism is necessarily a species of determinism, namely that which asserts the compatibility of determinism with freedom. But it is in fact a cross-classification. Some dissolutionists profess to be agnostic about universal causation, and therefore are not determinists. They maintain merely that whether or not choices are caused, they may still be free.
   


The central issue may be put in terms of a contrast between two notions, which may be called self-determinism and indeterminism. No one other than an absurd fatalist would suggest that a man is in normal circumstances at the mercy of his environment, as a rudderless boat is driven by the waves. It is we who decide how to act, and act as we decide. We respond to situations with more or less intelligence and integrity. Another person, or we in a different mood, might respond to the same situation quite differently. No account of a man's environment and external stimuli would usually enable us to know what he will do; the answer will depend on his own deliberation and choice. We might express this manifest ability of human beings to transcend a mere immediate reaction to stimuli by saying that they are self-determined. But this is quite compatible with saying that there are causal or scientific laws (for example, psychological ones about thought-processes, or physiological ones about brain-processes) which govern an agent's decision. The fact that a full causal account would have to be enormously complicated, that it would have to include statements about the agent as well as about his environment, and that it cannot in practice be achieved, does not show that it is in principle unobtainable. So self-determinism is compatible with determinism; indeed it is the only intelligent form of determinism. The determinist says that this self-determinism is the only sense (if any) in which a man is free, and the dissolutionist adds that it is in fact all we mean when we speak of human freedom. The libertarian, however, denies this. He insists that such laws, if they existed, would be incompatible with our most basic conception of freedom. His view may be put by saying that man's freedom is undetermined.1


1 He often objects to this word, for it may suggest that undetermined choices are purely random, and thus concede too much to the determinist. But I here use it only to refer to the feature of the libertarian position that it denies complete causal determinism, and this negative feature is appropriately expressed by a negative word.
   



THE SELECTIVE DIRECTING OF ATTENTION (pp.71-79)
   
 In day-dreams, and in other relaxed or lazy moments, we may be conscious, in one sense of that vague word, without paying attention to anything. But as soon as we become involved in, or concerned with, any situation or train of thought we start to pay attention to it. The activities, such as choices, with which the freewill debate is concerned, are primarily ones which are performed attentively. It is this difficult and fundamental notion of attention which I wish to examine.

Though it is possible, with difficulty, to pay attention to more than one thing at once, our consciousness is normally focused on one. The focus, however, often changes, as when our attention is distracted by something else while we are engaged on some matter to which, in general, it is directed. It is not easy, however, to decide how often this occurs. We might be tempted to try to answer the question by paying attention to some topic, and at the same time noticing how often our attention is distracted. But if we do we are apt to find that what we had taken to be our reasonably sustained power of concentration dissolves into a kaleidoscope of shifting phenomena. Let someone read this paragraph while paying heed to the question how often his attention wanders ; and almost at once, I think, it will. The buzzing of a fly, the memory of a past holiday, wondering what the time is or whether the whole procedure is absurd—such things as these will immediately intervene. Moreover, if he succeeds in reaching the end of the paragraph he will find he can hardly remember much of it. This suggests that the whole approach is at fault, for it involves precisely that attempt to focus consciousness on more than one thing at once which we find so difficult. We are here so exercised in the second-order activity of trying to notice what we are conscious of, that we lose almost entirely our first-order capacity to concentrate on anything at all. If, on the other hand, forgetting this peculiar exercise, someone should, after reading a paragraph with attention, ask himself whether his attention had wandered, I think he will normally be unable to recollect that it had. This cannot be merely because these wanderings are immediately forgotten. For, apart from the inherent implausibility of that suggestion, there is the unquestionable difference in the speed and comprehension of his reading.

The capacity to pay attention doubtless varies greatly between individuals. Certain cases, such as the very highest reaches of disciplined religious meditation, are almost different in kind from achievements in the lower range. No doubt also in each individual the power varies in accordance with many factors. It is much greater when we are attracted to some subject matter than when we force ourselves to concentrate on it. It is also much greater when the subject matter on which we focus is itself changing; for example, most people can read a book, that is, keep their attention on a progression of words and sentences, for a much longer period than they can fixedly contemplate a single unchanging object. But for present purposes these matters need not concern us, and the following points which I have made are sufficient. One may be conscious without paying attention to anything. Activity of any sort, however, including coherent and connected thought, involves paying attention. Our power to do so can be exercised without break for much longer than we might conclude from the unfortunate attempt to introspect the process while it goes on. Yet nevertheless it is an essential feature of our paying attention, in all but the rarest and most highly disciplined cases, that the focus of our consciousness is continually changing.

It is these changes of focus which I wish to consider, and I wish to ask whether one can appropriately apply to them certain distinctions that have often been recognised in other contexts. The first distinction is that between an action and an occurrence, or between what a man does and what happens to him. This, as I shall later mention, seems an essential distinction in philosophy of mind. The second one is drawn, within the realm of action or activity, between an act and a choice. On some occasions a man may simply act, without any deliberate selection of his course of action, while on other occasions he chooses between two possible courses of conduct. The notion of a choice, as here used, implies that alternatives are considered, and all but one rejected. How, if at all, do these notions apply to the paying of attention?

A philosopher might be inclined to say that changes in our attention are mental acts, as opposed to occurrences such as twinges of pain. For if we put aside special cases, as when a subject attracts us with a virtually hypnotic power, or repels us so strongly as to produce a mental blockage, we may agree that we can always control the movement of our attention, even if only with difficulty. But to say that we can control it is not to say that we do. Our attention is continually being attracted by what we would like to think about, or distracted from what we are or ought to be thinking about, or, as it were, rebuffed by the dullness or unpleasantness of the subject matter. These influences account for the direction taken by a vast amount of our thinking, particularly in our less disciplined moments. They are part of our mental activity, in the sense that they are what goes on while we think. Yet in another sense they are what happens to us, rather than what we do. We seem therefore driven (though such moves are perilous in philosophy) to draw a further distinction, within the realm of mental activity, between the relatively passive and the more fundamentally active. In fact I think we must apply the distinctions between occurrence, action and choice in this more minute field, as we are accustomed to do in larger scale activities.

The cases where the movement of our attention is attracted, distracted or rebuffed involve nothing which, in the strictest sense, we do. A distinct, if rarer, phenomenon is the active switching of attention from one thing to another. A man who has to decide a matter may suddenly notice that he is day-dreaming about some topic suggested by his earlier train of thought, and the very realisation of this fact is enough to cause him to direct his attention immediately back to the issue he has to decide. This directing is quite different in kind from the unconscious distraction which led him to the day-dream, and as compared to the latter it is activity as opposed to what happened to him. Yet it is hardly a choice. He did not decide to stop day-dreaming, rather the realisation that he was day-dreaming led to his stopping it. Now within this directing of attention, which is itself a sub-class of the changes in our attention, there is a yet smaller sub-sub-class which seems to me to correspond strictly to the notion of a choice; and indeed it is a genuine choice, though of a minute kind. This arises when we consciously decide between pursuing, or dwelling on, this consideration or that. Whether our deliberation is concerned to reach some truth or some decision about how to act, we may be faced with a situation which can be described by saying that we are aware of two trains of thought which we might dwell on, and that we select one and we decide to pursue it rather than the other. I shall call this the selective directing of attention, and it is on this notion that I shall concentrate in the next section.

I have no definite suggestion as to how often the selective directing of attention may occur. I suspect that the frequency of its occurrence varies from individual to individual, and it surely varies according to the type of thought involved. Certainly it represents only a small proportion of the changes in our attention, but these changes as a whole are so frequent that even this sub-sub-class of them need not be a rare phenomenon. My own view would be that for any normal person, engaged in rigorous or careful thought, it is a common occurrence. In any case, the distinctions which I have attempted to draw do seem to me to apply to the very difficult phenomena in question, even if in certain cases the line between the various categories may be somewhat blurred. It follows that it is unconvincing to reduce the process of thought to any account which presents it merely as an interplay of attractive and distractive influences. Undoubtedly such influences occur, and govern a vast amount of our thinking. Further, we may have psychological evidence to suppose that there are others, of the existence or power of which we are frequently unaware. But if we attempt to reduce all mental activity to the passive interplay of various influences, the result is not a satisfactory piece of philosophical psychology.

Before going further I must relate my remarks to a discussion in Professor Stuart Hampshire's important book Thought and Action. 1 The issue arises from a passage where he is concerned to emphasise the difference between thought and action. 2 He is right, I think, basically to take the side of Spinoza against Descartes on this point, and to say that reaching a conclusion is not analogous to an act of will. We do not decide to believe, we decide or realise that we believe; and if the process has been honest, the conclusion is independent of our will. He is right also in the hints he gives of the necessary qualifications to this position, and his indications of the way in which our will to believe or disbelieve may influence the thinking process. Finally, he is right in saying that this may have deep moral implications. The difference arises when he argues that what goes on in us when we think systematically cannot be described as an action, because the will plays no part in it.

2 Op. cit., pp. 153 et seq.
   


Thought, when it is most pure, is self-directing, as in the exercise of the intellect in deduction and in the following of an argument. When I use the active verbs of will and speak of directing my thoughts to a certain topic, or of concentrating my attention on it, I still contrast these acts of will, which start the process, from the process itself. Thought begins on its own path, governed by its universal rules, when the preliminary work of the will is done. No process of thought could be punctuated by acts of will, voluntary switchings of attention, and retain its status as a continuous process of thought. 1


1 Op. cit., pp. 153-4, my emphasis.
   

The point is impressive if we concentrate on the case of following an argument, or of expounding one when we have worked it out. Here the direction of thought is in an intelligible sense controlled by the argument, and the only element of will involved is that of renewing our attention if we notice that it has flagged.2 Perhaps this is all Hampshire meant. But in original or constructive thinking, the directing of attention seems ubiquitous and essential. Certainly from time to time it may lead to the recognition of a conceptual connection. 'Of course this follows from that,' we may say, or, 'But this won't go with what I concluded previously.' Still, the movement of our thought is directed not by a chain of argument but by our groping for one. It is controlled by the argument, not as the movement of a train is controlled by the rails, but only as that of an explorer is controlled by the country. In the last resort, if the italicised sentence of Hampshire's were true, then creative thinking would not be 'a continuous process of thought'.


4. INDETERMINISM AS THE SELECTIVE DIRECTING OF ATTENTION

I now argue that a libertarianism which is rationally constructed out of the common view of choice should locate its indeterminism in the selective directing of attention. In the first place, this suggestion is surely thoroughly congruous with the four cases where I suggested that the common view would insist on indeterminism. In a clash between what is believed to be our duty and temptation, what actually happens at the moment of decision? Is it not that we either direct our attention to the fact that this is our duty, and refuse to think about the attractiveness of the other course; or alternatively dwell on the attractiveness of the other course, and simply try to put our duty out of our mind as best we can? The second case of honesty in deliberation is even clearer, for it was defined by reference to the difficulty of keeping our attention fixed on matters which we ought to consider. The third case was that of moral perplexity. Here the position would seem to be that, having found no satisfactory rational solution of our dilemma and still being obliged to choose, we simply by an act of will direct our attention to one course rather than the other. Finally, in relation to the whole sphere of original thinking, does not the originality lie in the selection of one aspect after another for attention, in the hope of seeing familiar things in a new light, making new connections or questioning established ones? All else that there is even in genius is surely an achievement which either comes or does not; whence and how it does is a matter on which common men have no opinion and the learned no consensus. Creative freedom is exercised in grappling with the matter, not in achieving the result.

This may be reinforced by another consideration. In so far as the common view is based on the selective directing of attention, the most obvious cases of indeterminism will be those where the directing is most obvious. All such frequent activities are commonly best thrown into relief when we experience difficulty in performing them. The difficulties in selectively directing our attention are of two sorts: (a) The keeping of our attention fixed on some chosen consideration, in the face of some counter-consideration which attracts us or makes a demand on our attention; (b) when we are faced with difficulty in ordering a complicated set of material, and must therefore direct our attention systematically over the whole of it. We may add, as a cross-classification, that the directing of attention may be apparent either (i) as a decision or act of choice at the end of deliberation, or (ii) as an element in the deliberation itself. Now the four suggested paradigms of indeterminism represent fairly well the four possible combinations of these elements. Moral libertarianism is case (a) (i), where the choice, rather than the deliberation, is to be exercised in the face of the attraction to dwell on other matters. The second example is case (a) (ii), the third case is (b) (i) and the fourth is (b) (ii). The fact that these cases fit so neatly into this classification gives some support to the view that the classification expresses their underlying principle.

My suggestion seems equally compatible with cases where the actual choice is thought of as self-determined. First we may put aside cases where a man acts, as we often do in small matters, without really noticing what he is doing. The notion of directing attention, let alone of selectively directing it, need here hardly arise, but also we hardly speak of choice. Where there is choice between alternatives there is doubtless some selective directing of attention, but in some cases it is, as it were, essentially irrelevant to the final outcome. Sometimes the result of deliberation is to bring us to see that only one course really has anything (from our point of view) to commend it. We might say that the deliberation had its elements of indeterminism, in the sense that we might have explored either this or that aspect first, etc., but that the eventual decision did not. Again, a man may be of such firm character that he knows in advance that, however much he directs his attention to various aspects of his situation, it will not alter his decision. This, for example, might be Luther's case. Here one might say that though the precise course of the deliberation was undetermined the outcome was never in doubt. These seem to me the sort of cases where the common view would say that, given the man's character, only one course was a real possibility for him.

The picture at which we arrive is that in serious cases of deliberation and choice there is a frequent selective directing of attention, which I suggest should be seen as the basis of libertarianism. But its significance varies from case to case. Sometimes it may affect no more than the trivial details of a path which in general we could have predicted that the agent would traverse. There are innumerable intermediate cases in which it becomes relatively more important. At the other end of the range its existence in a given situation may be crucial. A man's whole action, and even his whole future, may depend on the minute movement of thought by which he chooses to attend to one consideration rather than to another. It is a matter of profound importance for our conception of man whether or not we see such a movement as only a special case of general laws, and thus as an example of what would always happen if just this situation should repeat itself.

I have spoken of this position as a rational reconstruction of the common view of choice. I do not suggest that the directing of attention is the only consideration which might commonly lead men to a belief in indeterminism. In fact I suspect that at least two other matters, related to each other, would play a part. The first is what I may call the lack of expectation of precise prediction. In understanding human conduct, and indeed generally outside the realm of the exact sciences, we must normally employ generalisations which are expected to have occasional exceptions; and this may incline men to the view that no precise regularities could in principle be obtained. The second related matter is the obvious fact of sheer human uniqueness. After all, if two candidates were to submit examination answers which were even largely the same in wording, the presumption that they were not independently produced would be irrebuttable. Yet both these considerations seem to me to lack cogency. My basic reason for this, which will emerge more fully when I discuss determinism, is frankly conceptual rather than based on the phenomenology of choice and action. It is that if the sorts of complexity and uniqueness which I have just mentioned cannot even in principle be reduced to regularities, in however complicated a way, then it would seem that they simply cannot be explained at all; whereas cases of the selective directing of attention allow an explanation of a radically different and non-determinist sort. The result is that I would not wish to defend any libertarianism other than that which I have outlined. I do not directly appeal to the common view in support of my position, as if to a majority verdict. But I believe my position is not only largely consistent with what most men would hold, but also is held for reasons which would appeal to them. Henceforth I shall call the view I have outlined 'libertarianism'. I shall now turn to consider some of the ways in which it has been alleged that the problem dissolves.
   



5. ASSESSMENT OF THE ISSUES (pp.304-309)

I must begin by stating my own position. I have elaborated a libertarian view based on the selective directing of attention, which I have presented as the most defensible form of the doctrine. In terms of the current debate this is the position I would hold. But it would be more accurate to say I am not a determinist. For if I had to bet on what the future holds I would put my money on the suggestion mentioned in Chapter II, Section 3, that the future course of discovery would produce what I called a scientific transformation of the problem. This suggestion is that an adequate neurophysiology will eventually erode the assumption usually made by determinist and libertarian alike; namely the assumption that we could in principle specify with unlimited pre vision the state of affairs which would turn out to be, or fail to be, a sufficient condition for its successor. The eroding of this assumption might occur in either of two ways. The first is that the relevant phenomena in the brain might be so minute that Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle (assuming that it is not itself superseded) would suffice to raise a necessary imprecision in the specification of the total situation. Or, secondly, a new sort of complexity, hitherto completely unknown, might be brought to light. In other words, the 'emergent levels of relations between neurons in masses' postulated by Bullock, might in crucial cases be such that the concepts required for determinism were inapplicable. 1 Any such scientific transformation would seem, however, for reasons I shall mention, to be much more akin to libertarianism than determinism.
   

1 T. H. Bullock in Behavior and Evolution, eds. A. Roe amd G. G. Simpson,  p. 166. Both these seem to me fundamentally different conceptions from the suggestion which has sometimes been made that the activity of a 'mental force' might be empirically discovered by its influence on a physical system, namely the brain, which otherwise would behave in a different manner in accordance with the relevant laws of physics.
   

My reasons for holding this view are various. In the first place, I am aware of more than those I can state here, though the others are, like the ones I shall mention, persuasive only. This seems to me appropriate. For if we are seeking to draw together separate puzzles into a coherent account which offers an ultimate explanation, then it would follow that the debate must be discursive. It would be impossible to indicate in advance what might be relevant, or to confine the discussion within set limits. A persuasive consideration drawn from one field may have to be balanced against an opposing one drawn from another. I shall here make one point, not with thoroughness but as an illustration of this discursiveness. It is that there are significant links between the whole debate about freewill and traditional religious beliefs. I do not mean to suggest that no theist can be a determinist. But there are, I think, relatively subterranean and easily missed elements of congruity which lead from theism to a denial of determinism, if not vice versa. I see in fact more than one such element, but one will do as illustration.

Traditional morality rests on desert and an ethic of intentions. As we might expect (whatever the problems of temporal and logical priority), this is paralleled in the traditional religious notion of a final moral accounting. Determinists who reject the traditional moral values for an ethic of consequences would have to reject or transform this religious notion too; what they could put in its place, if so minded, will not concern me here. I have argued, however, that a determinist may keep something like the traditional moral values, based on respect for personality, by substituting for the ontological responsibility of libertarianism a responsibility of self-acceptance. My present question is whether a parallel conceptual move could be made in the religious sphere.

It might seem a priori certain that it could be. For surely the theist's categories derive in the first place from our ideal of human personality at its best, before being transformed in an attempt to do justice to the notion of a being worthy of worship. If moral goodness is a pre-eminent constituent of our ideal, how could it fail to have analogical application to the divine? But the issue is not nearly so simple. For the relation of divine to human is fundamentally different from the relation of man to man, and it would seem to me that there are difficulties which might well be insuperable in any analogical extension at all.

First, I have suggested that an ethic of self-acceptance might have to justify the infliction of penalties on those who denied their responsibility by falling back on a social pressure view. In human relationships this would be entirely legitimate; society must Survive. But is there a divine analogue? God has no need to protect himself. Any notion of justified penalties, therefore, could get going only if there were self-acceptance. In traditional language God could justly condemn to hell only those who admitted they deserved it. Secondly, what good reason could they have for admitting it? I can understand what it would be, as between man and man, rationally to accept oneself and others as responsible agents, despite the belief that one could not (nomically) have done otherwise. For in whatever sense I may be responsible for my act, at least it is clear that those before whom I acknowledge it are not responsible for it. But in what sense would it be rational to accept responsibility before a being which had created me to be the very entity which, being just as it was, must commit the sins for which responsibility is being attributed? The closest human analogies might well seem to be, not with mature admission of one's faults, but with neurotic and compulsive guilt-feelings. Finally, if a man did in fact accept responsibility for his sins, his doing so would of course also be predetermined. Again, as between man and man, this need not destroy the seriousness and legitimacy of the attitude, since the others do not cause me to accept my responsibility. But God, in the last resort, would be the cause, and this does seem to destroy moral seriousness. A ventriloquist does not prove himself right by getting his dummy to agree with him.

My suggestion is that, even if a determinist wished to retain the notion of desert by basing it on self-acceptance, the move which seems possible in the purely moral sphere may be impossible in the religious. In arguing this I have of course partly transgressed my self-denying ordinance, and have taken sides on the theological question of whether predestination can be reconciled with the justice of God. For though I have not discussed how the crucial texts of a revelation are to be interpreted, I have in effect suggested that, even if they implied both predestination and divine justice (which in the case of Christianity I strongly doubt), there would remain a conceptual point, of the sort where philosophers have professional competence. It is that`justice' could (logically) be here employed only in a Pickwickian sense which was incompatible with its ordinary meaning. But my purpose has not been to pronounce even on the latter issue. It has been only to illustrate by means of an example the ramifications in which we may be involved in any final assessment of the freewill issue. Contemporary philosophy has found great profit in the method of isolating small and precise problems for individual treatment. It is therefore all the more important to insist that there may be some issues, including the present, where this method is inapplicable.

By this illustration I have tried to indicate the point of my proviso that I have more reasons for denying determinism than those now mentioned. For I would wish to elaborate a view within which the denial appeared as rationally integrated with, rather than incongruously attached to, other beliefs about man and the universe as a whole. I cannot attempt this now, but I can give my final assessment of the considerations discussed in this book.

To many philosophers it has seemed that reflection on practical and on theoretical reason tends to lead in different directions, and thus to provide the central tension in the freewill problem. Reflection on how we decide (whether in general or solely in moral situations) raises the demand for indeterminism; reflection on how we explain a fact to be the case leads naturally to a belief in regularity. I would agree that this is the natural division of the matters to be considered, but I do not think the dichotomy is as neat as this. I find that in both areas the arguments against determinism seem the stronger; though in the first case perhaps more than in the second, and in neither case for conclusive reasons. I shall begin with practical reason.

First, I repeat that the natural view of choice is not determinist, and that determinism must be an attitude superimposed on an earlier view. It is an attitude which I cannot achieve. I am, for example, quite unable to agree with Freud that we are inclined to believe in the undetermined freedom of our trivial but not of our fundamental choices. On the contrary, there stand out in my mind several important issues of past years where it seems to me, even now, that I well might have decided the other way, in which case my life would have been notably different to what it is. Further, at the more minute level of careful introspection, I think that the selective directing of attention is of fundamental importance. I am prepared to believe that all other phenomena which occur in deliberation, such as the attractions and distractions which play so large a part in it, are determined by causes of which I am not necessarily aware. For otherwise, since we do not in such cases select or choose our train of thought, there would be no reason why the outcome should be this rather than that. But the selective directing of attention alone seems to demand that we apply it to the notion of a deliberate choice between alternatives. Both its sheer phenomenological distinctiveness, and its importance for life and conduct, seem to me so great that I am not embarrassed to make it the exception to a general assumption of the determinism of mental phenomena.

Secondly, the moral issues also weigh deeply with me. The morality of an ethic of intentions, based on respect for personality, seems to me so important, and so well justified when understood, that I could not abandon it. I can understand, as I have tried to indicate, that a determinist could base a broadly similar morality on self-acceptance rather than indeterminism. But still it would be in an important sense a new morality. Here the onus of proof is very relevant. I do not feel at liberty to change my conception of man in such a fundamental respect unless the change is forced upon me.

1 Product Liability by Franklin P. Brannen, Jr. * Richard L. Sizemore ** and Jacob E. Daly *** This Article surveys recent developments in Georgia product liability law. 1 It covers noteworthy cases decided during the survey period by Georgia appellate courts, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, and United States district courts located in Georgia. In addition, this Article discusses relevant legislative enactments by the Georgia General Assembly revising the Official Code of Georgia Annotated ( O.C.G.A. ). I. STRICT LIABILITY Georgia s product liability practice is centered upon O.C.G.A. section , which provides that the manufacturer of personal property sold as new is strictly liable to individuals who are injured by that property. 2 To establish a strict liability claim under this statute, a plaintiff must prove that (1) the defendant was the manufacturer of the product; (2) the product was defective when it left the control of the manufacturer; and (3) the product s defective condition proximately caused the injury to the plaintiff. 3 The purpose of the statute is to ensure that the costs * Counsel in the firm of King & Spalding LLP, Atlanta, Georgia.

ADAMS, III, 3132 314 MERCER LAW REVIEW [Vol. 58 of injuries resulting from defective products are borne by the manufacturers that put such products on the market. 4 A. Manufacturers and Product Sellers Because the manufacturer is in the best position to discover dangerous product defects and determine how to correct such defects, product liability actions for strict liability can be brought only against the manufacturer of a product. In Georgia, an entity is classified as a manufacturer if (1) the entity actually designs or manufactures the product; (2) the entity is a manufacturer of a component part that failed and caused injury to the plaintiff; or (3) the entity is an assembler of component parts who then sells the assembled item as a single item under its own trade name. 5 Despite these seemingly broad definitions, courts strictly construe the Georgia strict liability statute, 6 holding that it only applies to actual manufacturers those entities that have an active role in the production, design, or assembly of products and placing them in the stream of commerce. 7 While manufacturers are subject to strict liability in Georgia, product sellers are specifically excluded from such liability pursuant to O.C.G.A. section This statute defines a product seller as a person who leases or sells and distributes; installs; prepares; blends; packages; labels; markets; or assembles pursuant to a manufacturer s plan, intention, design, specifications, or formulations; or repairs; maintains; or otherwise is involved in placing a product in the stream of commerce. 9 Because an entity may simultaneously display the traits of a manufacturer and a product seller, courts are often required to evaluate the undisputed evidence to determine whether the Georgia strict liability statute applies. In many instances, the dispute is the subject of a motion for summary judgment in which the defendant argues that it is GEORGIA LAW OF TORTS 25-8 (2007 ed.). 4. ADAMS, supra note Freeman v.

Id (a).3 2006] PRODUCT LIABILITY 315 not subject to strict liability because it is merely a product seller. Such was the case in Tomlinson v. ResQline, Inc. 10 In Tomlinson the plaintiffs sued for damages arising from personal injuries Herbert Tomlinson sustained while using an evacuation system comprised of a cable and harness. The plaintiffs contended that ResQline, Inc. and Carl Stahl Sava Industries, Inc. ( Sava ) were strictly liable because they designed, manufactured, assembled, marketed, and sold the system. 11 The evacuation system, known as the SafirRosetti ResQline System, was designed by Moshe Mellor and was marketed and sold by ResQline. 12 Sava, a manufacturer of cables and harnesses, was contacted by ResQline and asked to supply a cable with a minimum breaking strength of 1,300 pounds. Because Sava did not manufacture such a cable, Sava purchased the cable from another company, Indusco, Inc. Upon receipt of the cable from Indusco, Sava tested the cable to ensure that it met ResQline s specifications, modified both ends of the cables in accordance with ResQline s instructions, and sent the cable to ResQline so that it could be incorporated into the system. Sava did not participate in the integration of the cable assembly into the System. 13 Relying upon O.C.G.A. section (b)(2), the plaintiffs alleged that Sava was strictly liable because it manufactured the defective cable and cable system that caused the plaintiff s injuries. Sava denied liability for the plaintiff s injuries, arguing in its motion for summary judgment that it was merely a product seller and was not liable as a manufacturer on grounds of strict liability. 14 The district court agreed with Sava, observing that Sava simply assembled the cable pursuant to the plan, intention, design, specifications, and formulation of ResQline. 15 Because Sava did not manufacture the cable, did not play an active role in the design or selection of the cable, and did not participate in the integration of the cable assembly into the system, 16 the court determined that Sava was not the manufacturer of a defective component part the failure of which caused plaintiff s injury. 17 Accordingly, the 10.

In Boyce v. Gregory Poole Equipment Co., 19 the plaintiff brought a product liability/wrongful death action arising out of a forklift accident. At the time of his death, the decedent, Robyn Embry, was operating a stand-up forklift that lacked a rear guard. When Embry s forklift made contact with a parked forklift, the forks on the parked forklift entered the operator s compartment and fatally injured Embry. As a result, the plaintiff asserted a strict liability claim against Gregory Poole Equipment Company, alleging that the forklift Embry was operating should have been equipped with a rear guard. 20 The forklift Embry was operating was designed and manufactured by Material Handling Associates ( MHA ) and Caterpillar. It was sold to Embry s employer by Gregory Poole Equipment Company ( Gregory Poole ). Because the general manager of Gregory Poole served on the advisory board of the MHA design team for the forklift, the plaintiff maintained that Gregory Poole also manufactured the product and was therefore liable under Georgia s strict liability statute. 21 The trial court disagreed with the plaintiff s argument and granted Gregory Poole s motion for summary judgment on the plaintiff s strict liability claim. 22 After reviewing the evidence submitted in support of Gregory Poole s motion, the Georgia Court of Appeals concluded that Gregory Poole could not be held strictly liable because it was merely a seller of a product manufactured by MHA. 23 In making this decision, the court rejected the plaintiff s claim that Gregory Poole became a manufacturer simply because its employee served on the advisory board for the design team of the manufacturer. 24 As the court observed, the strict liability statute must be strictly construed to apply to actual manufacturers or designers only Id Ga. App. 891, 605 S.E.2d 384 (2004). 20. Id. at 891, 605 S.E.2d at Id. at 894, 605 S.E.2d at Id. at , 605 S.E.2d at For a discussion of the plaintiff s failure to warn claims, see infra Part II.B Ga. App. at 894, 605 S.E.2d at Id. 25. Id.5 2006] PRODUCT LIABILITY 317 While the courts in Tomlinson and Boyce granted summary judgment in favor of product sellers, the Georgia Court of Appeals recently permitted a plaintiff to survive summary judgment because there was some evidence that the product seller also had significant input in the manufacture of the product. In Buchan v. Lawrence Metal Products, Inc., 26 the plaintiff brought suit for injuries he sustained when the vinyl, retractable tape on a crowd-control barrier detached from a metal post and struck him on the arm. The plaintiff s claims were based on theories of negligence and strict liability. The defendant, Lawrence Metal Products, Inc. ( Lawrence Metal ), moved for summary judgment on the plaintiff s strict liability claims, asserting that there was no evidence that it manufactured the Tensabarrier crowd-control system. According to Lawrence Metal, the retractable tape cassettes used in the system were designed and manufactured by another company, and Lawrence Metal merely produced the metal posts in which the cassettes were inserted. The trial court granted Lawrence Metal s motion, finding that Lawrence Metal could not be held liable on theories of negligence or strict liability because it was merely a seller of the product. The trial court concluded that Lawrence Metal was not a manufacturer, despite the fact that Lawrence Metal manufactured the metal posts and labeled, marketed, and sold the crowd-control system. 27 The Georgia Court of Appeals re-evaluated the evidence and reversed the trial court s ruling. 28 While the court of appeals recognized that Lawrence Metal did not have a role in the design or production of the retractable tape cassette, the court concluded that Lawrence Metal had an active role in the production, design, and assembly of the overall system. 29 The court was persuaded by the fact that the system consists of both the cassettes and the posts, the system cannot function without the posts, and the plaintiff alleged that the system and not just the tape cassette was defective. 30 Considering its role as assembler of the crowd-control system and sole designer and producer of the component intended to hold the retractable tape in place, there is evidence that Lawrence Metal had significant input into the manufacture of the crowd-control system. 31 Because Lawrence Metal func Ga.

Recall Evidence While evidence of a product recall may be admissible to show that a defect was present when the product left the manufacturer, it does not relieve a plaintiff from proving that the alleged defect proximately caused his or her injuries. 33 Strict liability is imposed for injuries which are the proximate result of product defects, not for the manufacture of defective products. Unless the manufacturer s defective product can be shown to be the proximate cause of the injuries, there can be no recovery. 34 In Cadwell v. General Motors Corp., 35 the plaintiff brought a product liability suit for injuries she sustained when she lost control of her 1995 Chevrolet Blazer and struck a telephone pole. The plaintiff claimed, among other things, that defects in the vehicle s braking system proximately caused her injuries, and she sought damages under theories of strict liability and negligence. Although the plaintiff retained an expert to offer opinions regarding these alleged defects, the district court excluded the expert s opinions because they did not meet the Daubert standards for relevancy, reliability, and admissibility. 36 Without an expert to support her allegations, the plaintiff relied solely upon evidence of the recall of a component found within the braking system of 1995 Chevrolet Blazers. 37 Recognizing that the plaintiff had very little evidence to support her theories of liability, General Motors moved for summary judgment on the plaintiff s strict liability and negligence claims. 38 The district court granted General Motors s motion, observing that [a] recall letter alone is insufficient to create a jury issue regarding a product defect. 39 While the court agreed that the 1995 Chevrolet Blazer was within the population of vehicles subject to a recall because of problems associated 32.

FAILURE TO WARN A. General A manufacturer who has reason to anticipate that its product has the potential for doing harm when used for a particular purpose may be required to give adequate warning of the danger. 42 The manufacturer s duty to warn depends upon a number of factors, including the foreseeability of the use in question, the type of danger involved, and the foreseeability of the user s knowledge of the danger. 43 If the manufacturer has a duty to warn, the manufacturer may breach the duty by (1) failing to adequately warn of the product s potential risks; or (2) failing to adequately communicate the warning to the user. 44 Failure to adequately communicate a warning generally requires an evaluation of the location and presentation of the warning, including the color, font size, and use of symbols to draw attention to the warning. 45 In addition to establishing a duty to warn and a breach on the part of the manufacturer, the plaintiff must also establish that the breach proximately caused the plaintiff s injuries. In cases premised upon the content or sufficiency of a warning, the plaintiff s failure to actually read the instructions or warning may prevent the plaintiff from recovering Id. at * Id. at * Wright v.

In Camden Oil Co. v. Jackson, 49 the plaintiff sued an oil company and a truck bed manufacturer for severe burns he sustained while filling a portable container with gasoline. The plaintiff contended that the defendants failed to adequately warn him of the risks associated with filling a portable container with gasoline at a self-service pump. The record revealed that a warning located near the self-service pump stated, among other things: Portable containers must be placed on the ground prior to filling to avoid explosion or fire from static electricity. 50 At the time the plaintiff sustained his injuries, the portable container he was filling was sitting in the bed of his truck not on the ground. 51 During his deposition, the plaintiff acknowledged that he did not see or read this warning. Given this admission, the oil company moved for summary judgment on the plaintiff s claim that (1) the content of the warning was inadequate; and (2) the oil company s efforts to communicate the warning were inadequate. 52 The trial court denied the defendant s motion and the oil company appealed. 53 After reviewing the evidence, the Georgia Court of Appeals determined that summary judgment was warranted with respect to the plaintiff s contention that the warning posted next to the pump was inadequate. 54 The court observed that a jury should not be allowed to consider the adequacy of the contents of the warning as a basis for imposing liability on the oil company when the plaintiff did not read the warning. 55 Because the plaintiff did not read the warning, the court concluded that the warning 47.

In Wright v. Case Corp., 63 the plaintiff sustained serious injuries after he parked and prepared to exit a loader he was using to perform a landscaping job. The plaintiff asserted that he raised the seat bar on the loader in an effort to engage the operator presence system, a system that locks the controls of the operator s bucket and engages the parking brake. As the plaintiff was sliding out of the loader, the loader moved, and the plaintiff was struck on the back of the head by a protective cage surrounding the loader.

Duties of Entities Other Than Manufacturers Manufacturers are not the only entities subject to failure to warn claims. Product sellers, for instance, may have a duty to warn of dangers when the seller knows, or should know, the particular use of the product and risks from such use. 69 However, the product seller s duty is generally limited to those circumstances in which the seller is aware of a danger either not communicated by the manufacturer s warning or substantively different from the dangers the manufacturer has included in a warning label. 70 Similarly, a product seller generally does not have a duty to discover hidden defects in a product. However, if the seller inspects or tests its product, it has assumed a duty to exercise ordinary care in making its investigation and can be liable if it negligently fails to discovery the defect Id. at * Id. at * For a discussion of the expert witness issues in this case, see infra Part IV.A. 66.

Gregory Poole Equipment Co., 72 the plaintiffs brought a wrongful death action arising out of the injuries Robyn Embry sustained while operating a forklift that was distributed and sold by Gregory Poole. The plaintiffs filed strict liability and negligence claims against Gregory Poole, asserting, among other things, that Gregory Poole was aware of the rear guard, knew it was a desirable safety device, and breached its duty to warn its customers of the dangers associated with operating the forklift without it. Because the manufacturer of the forklift did not provide any warning labels or warnings regarding the danger of other forklifts entering the operator s compartment, the plaintiffs asserted that Gregory Poole should have warned the purchaser about the forklift and described optional safety equipment. Additionally, the plaintiffs maintained that Gregory Poole had investigated the product s expected use and advised Embry s employer, Ecolab, regarding the type of equipment and safety devices that should be used in its business. Because Ecolab relied upon the superior knowledge of Gregory Poole, the plaintiffs maintained that Gregory Poole also assumed a duty to warn Ecolab of any patent defects with the product. Finally, the plaintiff contended that Gregory Poole may have intentionally withheld information regarding the rear-guard door in an effort to avoid potential failure to warn claims resulting from similar accidents. 73 To support these allegations, the plaintiffs provided evidence that Gregory Poole made an extensive investigation of the forklift in 1994, nearly four years before Embry was killed while operating the forklift. The plaintiffs also submitted evidence that Ecolab requested information from Gregory Poole regarding the safety of the forklift as early as 1996, soon after another Ecolab employee was injured on the forklift. 74 Despite this evidence, the trial court granted Gregory Poole s motion for summary judgment on the plaintiffs failure to warn claims. 75 The Georgia Court of Appeals reversed the trial court s ruling, observing that the independent investigation and inquiry by Gregory Poole created a jury question regarding whether Gregory Poole had a duty to advise of the existence of the rear-guard door and the risk of not using the guard Ga.

K-Mart Corp. 77 recently determined that a pharmacist does not have a heightened duty to warn consumers of every possible side effect of a drug. 78 There, the plaintiff filled a prescription at a pharmacy in the defendant s store. According to the plaintiff, the pharmacist did not provide warnings as to potential side effects of the drug, and the plaintiff thereafter suffered an extremely rare allergic reaction. The plaintiff filed suit against the store, alleging that the failure to warn of potential side effects of the drug was a violation of the standard of care for pharmacists. The plaintiff asserted that the store had a duty to warn her of all potential side effects based upon regulations of the Georgia State Board of Pharmacy, which require pharmacists to counsel patients about their medication. The trial court disagreed with the plaintiff s assertion and granted the defendant s motion for summary judgment on this claim. 79 The Georgia Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court s ruling, determining that the plaintiff had not established that the store had a heightened duty to warn of potential side effects. 80 While the regulations of the Board of Pharmacy require pharmacists to offer counseling to their customers, the court observed that the topics are determined by the pharmacists and may include common side or adverse effects. 81 As a result, the court determined that the regulations do not impose a duty on a pharmacist to identify every remote possible side effect, such as the rare allergic reaction that the plaintiff suffered. 82 In Talton v. Arnall Golden Gregory LLP, 83 the Georgia Court of Appeals examined whether a legally cognizable duty can be established when there is absolutely no privity between the plaintiff and the defendant. 84 In Talton the plaintiff brought a negligence action for injuries resulting from contaminated cadaver tissue that was inserted in his knee during outpatient surgery.

The plaintiff alleged that AGG negligently recommended and prepared an inadequate warning label for the cadaver tissue with knowledge that third parties would ultimately rely upon the information contained in the label. 85 AGG filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiff s failure to warn claim, asserting, among other things, that (1) it had no duty as a matter of law to warn non-clients of the risks associated with the tissue; (2) it could not control whether its client actually relied upon their advice; (3) it could not control the information their client ultimately included in the warning; (4) the plaintiff never had the opportunity to review or rely upon the warning label; and (5) the plaintiff s physician was responsible for informing plaintiff of the risks of using the cadaver tissue. 86 The trial court granted AGG s motion and the plaintiff appealed. 87 The Georgia Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court s ruling, rejecting the three different theories the plaintiff offered to support his claim that AGG had a duty to warn of the risks associated with the CryoLife cadaver tissue. 88 First, the court rejected the plaintiff s assertion that AGG s duty to warn was premised upon the fact that it was reasonably foreseeable that third parties would rely upon the information AGG provided during the course of its representation of CryoLife. 89 The court of appeals rejected this theory outright, determining that the plaintiff failed to demonstrate that AGG ever intended for its advice to be disclosed to or relied upon by third parties. 90 The court observed that the information AGG provided to CryoLife was confidential and intended solely for the consideration and use by CryoLife. 91 The court further observed that AGG had no control over whether CryoLife actually followed its advice. 92 The court also rejected the plaintiff s claim that AGG owed a duty to him under section 324A of the Restatement [of Torts], which addresses 85.

PROXIMATE CAUSE Proof that a manufacturer s product proximately caused the plaintiff s injuries is an essential element of all product liability claims, whether the plaintiff is proceeding under a strict liability or negligence theory. 98 Without a showing of proximate cause, there can be no recovery. 99 Liability is imposed for injuries that proximately result from the use of a defective product, not for the mere manufacture of a defective product. 100 Trial courts often struggle to define proximate cause, particularly when instructing a jury. The Georgia Court of Appeals has described this dilemma as follows: Although many legal scholars have attempted to lay down a single standard to determine proximate causation,... no satisfactory universal formula has emerged. Instead, proximate cause is always to 93. Id. at 26, 622 S.E.2d at Id. 95. Id. 96. Id. 97. Id. at 26-27, 622 S.E.2d at See, e.g., O.C.G.A (b)(1) (2000); Steinberg v.

The best use that can be made of the authorities on proximate cause is merely to furnish illustrations of situations which judicious men upon careful consideration have adjudged to be on one side of the line or the other. 101 Although the concept of proximate cause eludes precise definition, a well-established principle of Georgia law provides that in cases involving the negligence of multiple tortfeasors, the negligence of each tortfeasor must be a contributing factor in the plaintiff s injury to be considered a proximate cause of it: Where the injury is the result of the concurring negligence of two or more parties, they may be sued jointly or severally. All may be sued jointly, notwithstanding different degrees of care may be owed by the different defendants It is well settled that an action may be maintained against two joint tort-feasors whose negligence contributes to produce an injury, even though the same obligations do not rest upon each with respect to the person injured. It is sufficient to support a recovery if the negligence of both be a contributing cause, even though one owes to the person injured a higher degree of care, and even though there be differing degrees of negligence by each. 102 Because, as this principle recognizes, there may be more than one proximate cause of an injury, the term proximate cause is not synonymous with the term dominant cause. 103 During the survey period, the Georgia Supreme Court again considered the definition of proximate cause. In John Crane, Inc. v. Jones, 104 the plaintiff s decedent filed a complaint against several manufacturers of asbestos products alleging that he contracted mesothelioma because of occupational exposure to asbestos dust from their products. After the decedent died the following year, the plaintiff amended the complaint to add claims for wrongful death and loss of consortium. All the defendants except John Crane either were dismissed or filed for bankruptcy 101. John Crane, Inc. v. Jones, 262 Ga.

Where several negligent acts may have produced plaintiff s injury, to be considered the proximate cause an individual defendant s tortious conduct must constitute a contributing factor in bringing about the plaintiff s damages. Now, to hold an individual defendant liable, the plaintiff must introduce sufficient evidence to allow a jury to find that more than likely, their exposure to a particular defendant s product was a factor in producing their injuries. 106 John Crane agreed with this instruction except for the omission of the word substantial before contributing factor. 107 The jury returned a verdict against John Crane for $1,975, The trial court denied John Crane s motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and for a new trial, and John Crane appealed to the Georgia Court of Appeals. 109 The court of appeals affirmed. 110 The Georgia Supreme Court framed the issue on which it granted certiorari as follows: Where separate tortious acts allegedly committed by multiple defendants may have combined to produce the plaintiff s injury, must each individual tortfeasor s conduct constitute a substantial contributing factor in the injury in order to be considered a proximate cause thereof? 111 John Crane argued that the trial court and the court of appeals erred because the substantial factor formulation is consistent with Georgia law, has been widely accepted throughout the country, and is justified by public policy considerations. 112 The supreme court held each of these arguments to be unavailing. 113 First, requiring a tortfeasor s contribution to the plaintiff s injury to be substantial would be contrary to, not consistent with, longstanding 105.

Carmichael 123 ) through the following subsection: If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact in any cause of action to understand the evidence or determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise, if: (1) The testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data which are or will be admitted into evidence at the hearing or trial; (2) The testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and (3) The witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case. 124 The code section reinforces the adoption of Daubert by explicitly allowing Georgia courts to seek guidance from the decisions of the United States Supreme Court in Daubert, Joiner, Kumho Tire, and other federal court interpretations of these decisions. 125 In the first Georgia appellate court review of this new evidentiary standard, Moran v.

App. 96, 622 S.E.2d 439 (2005) Id. at 98, 622 S.E.2d at 441.19 2006] PRODUCT LIABILITY 331 vehicle. 128 But the trial court found that the expert witness did not use a reliable methodology and had not reliably applied the methodology to the facts of the case as required by O.C.G.A. sections (b)(2) and (3). 129 The court of appeals affirmed the exclusion of this testimony, holding that there was no evidence that the methodology of the plaintiff s expert witness (1) was widely used in the automotive field; (2) had a known rate of error; or (3) had been subject to any peer review. 130 What impact does the adoption of the Daubert standard have on lawsuits in Georgia state courts? This same expert had been permitted to offer similar testimony in the previous trial of the same matter that had taken place before the Georgia legislature adopted the Daubert standard. 131 On retrial, with the new evidentiary standard, the expert witness was excluded, and the defendant was granted a directed verdict, which was later affirmed on appeal. 132 It is important to note that the court of appeals was assessing whether the Daubert standard was appropriately applied to the testimony of the plaintiff s expert witness not whether any constitutional provision invalidated the application of the Daubert principles. 133 Given the relative zeal with which tort reform issues have been litigated at the trial court level, it is only a matter of time before additional appellate decisions will offer perspective on this new evidentiary standard in Georgia state courts. Because O.C.G.A. section permits the trial courts to use federal court decisions for guidance in their Daubert analyses, it is important for Georgia practitioners to stay abreast of Daubert opinions from federal courts. 134 Three opinions from Georgia federal district courts within the survey period show how exacting the Daubert standard can be Id. at 97-98, 622 S.E.2d at Id. at 98, 622 S.E.2d at 441; O.C.G.A (b)(2), (3) Moran, 276 Ga.

General Motors Corp., 135 involved testimony from a GM-trained mechanic who opined that an air bag system should have deployed in a single vehicle accident involving a Chevrolet Blazer. In response to the Daubert challenge, the plaintiff contended that the experience of the mechanic in the automotive repair field and the certification from his GM training were sufficient to opine whether the air bag should have deployed. 136 But the trial court found that the expert met none of the Daubert criteria. 137 The expert could not answer engineering and design questions regarding the air bag system, nor could he answer questions regarding the injuries sustained by the plaintiff. 138 The trial court concluded that the expert witness did not understand the relevant physics principles, had never reviewed any literature on air bag systems, had not performed any diagnostic testing of the subject vehicle, did not know how air bag sensors work, did not know how to interpret data from the air bag computer, had never been an expert witness before, and had no medical training. 139 Because the expert had only general opinions and no specific expert knowledge in the area of air bag system engineering, the trial court excluded his testimony. 140 In Wright v. Case Corp., 141 the defendant moved, pursuant to Rule and Daubert, to exclude the testimony of the plaintiff s expert witness, who offered testimony that the loader used by the plaintiff was defective. The plaintiff responded that this witness was qualified because the expert was a licensed mechanical engineer. 143 But the trial court disagreed. 144 Because the expert lacked knowledge regarding the type of loader at issue (for example, he was not familiar with the mechanics of the loader until he was retained in this lawsuit), his engineering certification was of little value when assessing his qualifica No. 5:04-CV-72(WDO), 2005 U.S. Dist.

Cadwell v. General Motors Corp., No. 5:04-CV- 72(WDO), 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4437 (M.D. Ga. Jan. 25, 2006). For a discussion of the grant of summary judgment in this case, see supra Part I.B No. 1:03-CV-1618-JEC, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7683 (N.D. Ga. Feb. 1, 2006) FED. R. EVID Id. at * Id. at *9.21 2006] PRODUCT LIABILITY 333 tion to testify as an expert witness. 145 The court emphasized that because the expert lacked critical knowledge regarding the design and function of the loader, the expert s engineering degree must have been of little value in providing relevant knowledge; thus, the fact that the expert had an engineering degree was not an important factor in the Daubert analysis. 146 Similarly, the trial court found that the expert witness had not followed a reliable methodology in reaching his engineering conclusions. 147 The witness had performed no testing of his alternative designs, was unaware of any literature that discussed the merits of his alternative designs, and could not identify any other models that incorporated his alternative designs. 148 The witness admitted that he merely was providing concepts regarding how the loader could be improved. 149 But the trial court emphasized that Daubert s reliability prong requires more than conceptualizing possibilities. 150 Because the testimony of the expert witness did not satisfy the Daubert criteria, the court excluded the testimony. 151 Treating physicians also must comply with the requirements of Daubert before offering opinion testimony. In Leathers v. Pfizer, Inc., 152 the trial court excluded the testimony of a treating physician who had been offered to provide causation evidence linking the plaintiff s ingestion of Lipitor, a medicine commonly proscribed to reduce cholesterol, to the plaintiff s muscle pain Id. at * Id Id. at * Id. at * Id. at * Id. at *14 (quoting McGee v.

                            Has this provider ever cancelled your appointment on you last minute?
                        

                            They try not to, but sometimes it happens.
                        

                            Did you leave the office feeling satisfied with your visit?
                        

                            Completely!
                        

                            Did you spend a lot of time in the waiting room at this provider's office?
                        

                            The wait wasn't terrible, but it wasn't the best
                        

                            Was this provider argumentative or easily angered?
                        

                            Not at all, they were one of the kindest, most attentive individuals I've ever met
                        

                            Was this family doctor's staff friendly?
                        

                            Yes

                            Yes

                            Yes, I could tell they were cleaned regularly
                        

                            Is this provider willing to pursue advice from other providers when necessary?

Together with useful Tables, chronological Observations and entertaining Remarks.” In fine condition, modern boards, light toning, staining, and small loss to the upper right corner of title page, minor chipping to page edges. Rare and desirable.

Published under the pseudonym “Richard Saunders” by American statesman and inventor Benjamin Franklin, Poor Richard’s Almanack appeared continuously each year from 1732 to 1758. Containing meteorological, astrological and astronomical information as typical almanacs of the period contained, Poor Richard’s Almanac is chiefly remembered as a repository for Franklin’s unique aphorisms and proverbs which live on in contemporary American English. With print runs reaching 10,000 per year, the pamphlet sold exceptionally well and became a source of both economic success and fame for its author.
