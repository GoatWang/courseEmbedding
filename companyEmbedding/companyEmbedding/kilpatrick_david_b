David Raczkowski, Ph.D., focuses his practice on patent prosecution and counseling. He has experience in patent portfolio management and development, and client counseling. He works with clients to identify inventions from general product specifications and evaluate patentability to determine patent strategy for a single patent application or across a patent family. His experience also involves preparing validity/invalidity, non-infringement and freedom-to-operate analysis, and in identifying possible infringement by competitor’s products, as well as drafting claims to cover a competitor’s products.
His representative fields of technology include bioinformatics; medical diagnostics; data analysis of biological data; image processing; machine learning and artificial intelligence; databases and cloud computing; programmable logic (e.g., I/O circuits and timing, and software design of circuits); computer hardware, such as graphics processing and hard drives; data transmission, including error checking; networking; control systems for energy management; nanotechnology (e.g. carbon nanotubes); power supplies; and financial transactions and other Internet commerce.
Prior to joining the legal profession, Dr. Raczkowski conducted research as a postdoctoral fellow in scientific computing and computational physics at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Specific areas of research included scaling software to run on massively parallel machines (up to 1,000 processors), optimization methods for the solution of differential equations in electronic structure calculations, molecular dynamics calculations and improved efficiency of sparse matrix multiplications. Areas of research in materials science and physics included investigations into defects in silicon and silicon carbide, yttrium dopants in zirconia, carbon nanotubes, and quantum well effects in metallic alloys exhibiting giant magnetoresistance.
Dr. Raczkowski was recognized as a 2013, 2014 and 2015 Northern California "Rising Star" for Intellectual Property by Super Lawyers magazine.

Job Details
               Applied Natural Gas Fuels produces, markets, and sells liquefied natural gas ("LNG") to transportation, industrial, and municipal markets in the western United States and northern Mexico. It offers turn-key fuel solutions to its customers, including delivery of clean LNG fuel, equipment storage, fuel dispensing equipment and fuel loading facilities. Applied processes LNG at its liquefaction processing plant (the "Plant") located in Topock, Arizona. The Plant sits on 26 acres of land just off the I-40 interstate highway at the California/Arizona border, and is one of only a few LNG production facilities in the western U.S. with capacity sufficient to service retail, wholesale, and industrial end users. Applied also supplies LNG and CNG to retail stations located in Barstow and Ontario, California. In addition to the Plant, Applied operates 34 LNG trailers and 10 mobile fueling units from its Distribution and Logistics Terminal in Fontana. Southern California and its surrounding area is one of the largest markets in the U.S. for clean, vehicle-grade LNG. This market has been the focus of the company's efforts for over ten years. In recent years, various governmental agencies in California, Arizona and surrounding areas have enacted environmental and clean air regulations that have served to encourage fleet operators to convert portions of their vehicle fleets to cleaner fuel alternatives such as LNG. Applied sells a majority of its LNG to municipal and other governmental agencies, as well as to commercial fleet customers (e.g. refuse companies, major ports, large municipal fleets, and other commercial trucking fleets). These customers typically operate their own LNG-powered vehicle fleets and fueling stations. Applied also sells LNG to industrial customers for non-vehicle use, with planned future expansion in this market. Primary customers in California include municipal fleets such as Orange County Transportation Authority city buses and garbage trucks, Cities of Barstow, Long Beach, Redlands, and San Bernardino, as well as commercial vehicles like those belonging to United Parcel Service, and garbage-disposal fleets, including Burrtec Waste and Recycling and Waste Management, up and down the California coast.

Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

                                                    Reuters – 
                                                    11:04 AM ET 06/09/2017
                                                


Asian spot LNG prices were steady this week, with supply availability from projects in Asia-Pacific balancing new demand and uncertainty over the impact of a row between top LNG exporter Qatar and fellow Gulf states. Spot prices for July delivery edged up by five cents to $5.45 per million British thermal units, while August traded at the same level.

Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.
