Woodward Governors for Engines and Steam Turbines In 1870 our founder, Amos Woodward, invented a responsive, noncompensating governor for water wheels. Since then, we’ve been leveraging those basic mechanical governor principles into the world’s best mechanical, hydraulic, and electronic governors for engines and steam turbines. Our governors are used worldwide to provide reliable and precise control of speed and output in power generation, marine, pump, compression, and vehicle applications.
Woodward also provides global support through an extensive network of AISFs (Authorized Independent Service Facilities) that have been trained by Woodward to support governors in every corner of the world. Many of these AISFs also have the engineering capability to provide upgrade to an electronic control for enhanced control capabilities. These companies are identified as RTRs (Recognized Turbine Retrofitters). For a complete list of AISFs and RTRs, see the World Wide Directory.

Woodward, Inc. is the world's oldest and largest independent designer, manufacturer, and service provider of control systems and control system components (e.g. fuel pumps, engine controls, actuators, air valves, fuel nozzles, and electronics) for aircraft engines, industrial engines and turbines, power generation and mobile industrial equipment.
Woodward, Inc. was founded as The Woodward Governor Company by Amos Woodward in 1870. Woodward Governor Company initially made controls for waterwheels (first patent No. 103,813) and then moved to hydro turbines. In the 1920s and 1930s Woodward began designing controls for diesel and other reciprocating engines and for industrial turbines. Also in the 1930s, Woodward developed a governor for variable-pitch aircraft propellers. And when the United States military's first turbine-powered aircraft successfully flew, its GE engine had a Woodward control. Starting in the 1950s, Woodward began designing electronic controls, first analog and then digital units.

Historical Information[edit]
The journey began in Rockford, Illinois in 1870 with Amos W. Woodward's invention of a noncompensating mechanical waterwheel governor (U.S. patent No. 103,813).[4] Thirty years later his son, Elmer, patented the first successful mechanical compensating governor for hydraulic turbines (U.S. patent No. 583,527).[5] In 1933, the company became more diversified by expanding its product line to include diesel engine controls (U.S. patent No. 2,039,507)[6] and aircraft propeller governors (British patent No. 470,284).[7] Woodward governors followed the rapid advancement of diesel engine applications for railroads, maritime and electrical generation in many fields. The advent of gas turbine engines for aircraft and industrial uses offered still more opportunities for Woodward designed fuel controls. And, of course, the science of electronics has added impetus to this industry.
Elmer E. Woodward conceived, designed and developed the first successful propeller control in 1933.[7] This model PW-34 propeller governor is on display at the Udvar-Hazy annex of the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum.[8] Today, approximately 75% of all propeller-driven aircraft use Woodward AES controls.[citation needed] A growing number of general aviation and commuter aircraft rely on Woodward AES overspeed governors, synchronizers and synchophasers for the turboshaft, turboprops and reciprocating engines. As engine controls have moved toward electric-based systems, Woodward has responded with a line of electric propeller controls.[citation needed] The engines that are controlled by Woodward Aircraft engines systems are from Honeywell (TPE331), General Electric (CT7), Pratt & Whitney Canada (PT6A series), Raytheon, Vans, and Rotax Corporations to name a few. To continue the history journey and for more historical facts and figures the oldwoodward.com website has the world wide web's largest collection of historical facts on the Woodward Governor Company.
Modern Day Company[edit]
As of 2007, Woodward Governor Company became a $1 billion company with establishments all across the globe including: Japan, China, Europe and many others.[2]
On January 26, 2011, the company announced that shareholders have approved the name change to Woodward, Inc.[9]

Woodward, Inc. is the world's oldest and largest independent designer, manufacturer, and service provider of control systems and control system components (e.g. fuel pumps, engine controls, actuators, air valves, fuel nozzles, and electronics) for aircraft engines, industrial engines and turbines, power generation and mobile industrial equipment.
Woodward, Inc. was founded as The Woodward Governor Company by Amos Woodward in 1870. Woodward Governor Company initially made controls for waterwheels (first patent No. 103,813) and then moved to hydro turbines. In the 1920s and 1930s Woodward began designing controls for diesel and other reciprocating engines and for industrial turbines. Also in the 1930s, Woodward developed a governor for variable-pitch aircraft propellers. And when the United States military's first turbine-powered aircraft successfully flew, its GE engine had a Woodward control. Starting in the 1950s, Woodward began designing electronic controls, first analog and then digital units.

Historical Information[edit]
The journey began in Rockford, Illinois in 1870 with Amos W. Woodward's invention of a noncompensating mechanical waterwheel governor (U.S. patent No. 103,813).[4] Thirty years later his son, Elmer, patented the first successful mechanical compensating governor for hydraulic turbines (U.S. patent No. 583,527).[5] In 1933, the company became more diversified by expanding its product line to include diesel engine controls (U.S. patent No. 2,039,507)[6] and aircraft propeller governors (British patent No. 470,284).[7] Woodward governors followed the rapid advancement of diesel engine applications for railroads, maritime and electrical generation in many fields. The advent of gas turbine engines for aircraft and industrial uses offered still more opportunities for Woodward designed fuel controls. And, of course, the science of electronics has added impetus to this industry.
Elmer E. Woodward conceived, designed and developed the first successful propeller control in 1933.[7] This model PW-34 propeller governor is on display at the Udvar-Hazy annex of the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum.[8] Today, approximately 75% of all propeller-driven aircraft use Woodward AES controls.[citation needed] A growing number of general aviation and commuter aircraft rely on Woodward AES overspeed governors, synchronizers and synchophasers for the turboshaft, turboprops and reciprocating engines. As engine controls have moved toward electric-based systems, Woodward has responded with a line of electric propeller controls.[citation needed] The engines that are controlled by Woodward Aircraft engines systems are from Honeywell (TPE331), General Electric (CT7), Pratt & Whitney Canada (PT6A series), Raytheon, Vans, and Rotax Corporations to name a few. To continue the history journey and for more historical facts and figures the oldwoodward.com website has the world wide web's largest collection of historical facts on the Woodward Governor Company.
Modern Day Company[edit]
As of 2007, Woodward Governor Company became a $1 billion company with establishments all across the globe including: Japan, China, Europe and many others.[2]
On January 26, 2011, the company announced that shareholders have approved the name change to Woodward, Inc.[9]

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

Woodward, Inc. is the world's oldest and largest independent designer, manufacturer, and service provider of control systems and control system components (e.g. fuel pumps, engine controls, actuators, air valves, fuel nozzles, and electronics) for aircraft engines, industrial engines and turbines, power generation and mobile industrial equipment.
Woodward, Inc. was founded as The Woodward Governor Company by Amos Woodward in 1870. Woodward Governor Company initially made controls for waterwheels (first patent No. 103,813) and then moved to hydro turbines. In the 1920s and 1930s Woodward began designing controls for diesel and other reciprocating engines and for industrial turbines. Also in the 1930s, Woodward developed a governor for variable-pitch aircraft propellers. And when the United States military's first turbine-powered aircraft successfully flew, its GE engine had a Woodward control. Starting in the 1950s, Woodward began designing electronic controls, first analog and then digital units.

Historical Information[edit]
The journey began in Rockford, Illinois in 1870 with Amos W. Woodward's invention of a noncompensating mechanical waterwheel governor (U.S. patent No. 103,813).[4] Thirty years later his son, Elmer, patented the first successful mechanical compensating governor for hydraulic turbines (U.S. patent No. 583,527).[5] In 1933, the company became more diversified by expanding its product line to include diesel engine controls (U.S. patent No. 2,039,507)[6] and aircraft propeller governors (British patent No. 470,284).[7] Woodward governors followed the rapid advancement of diesel engine applications for railroads, maritime and electrical generation in many fields. The advent of gas turbine engines for aircraft and industrial uses offered still more opportunities for Woodward designed fuel controls. And, of course, the science of electronics has added impetus to this industry.
Elmer E. Woodward conceived, designed and developed the first successful propeller control in 1933.[7] This model PW-34 propeller governor is on display at the Udvar-Hazy annex of the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum.[8] Today, approximately 75% of all propeller-driven aircraft use Woodward AES controls.[citation needed] A growing number of general aviation and commuter aircraft rely on Woodward AES overspeed governors, synchronizers and synchophasers for the turboshaft, turboprops and reciprocating engines. As engine controls have moved toward electric-based systems, Woodward has responded with a line of electric propeller controls.[citation needed] The engines that are controlled by Woodward Aircraft engines systems are from Honeywell (TPE331), General Electric (CT7), Pratt & Whitney Canada (PT6A series), Raytheon, Vans, and Rotax Corporations to name a few. To continue the history journey and for more historical facts and figures the oldwoodward.com website has the world wide web's largest collection of historical facts on the Woodward Governor Company.
Modern Day Company[edit]
As of 2007, Woodward Governor Company became a $1 billion company with establishments all across the globe including: Japan, China, Europe and many others.[2]
On January 26, 2011, the company announced that shareholders have approved the name change to Woodward, Inc.[9]

Woodward, Inc. is the world's oldest and largest independent designer, manufacturer, and service provider of control systems and control system components (e.g. fuel pumps, engine controls, actuators, air valves, fuel nozzles, and electronics) for aircraft engines, industrial engines and turbines, power generation and mobile industrial equipment.
Woodward, Inc. was founded as The Woodward Governor Company by Amos Woodward in 1870. Woodward Governor Company initially made controls for waterwheels (first patent No. 103,813) and then moved to hydro turbines. In the 1920s and 1930s Woodward began designing controls for diesel and other reciprocating engines and for industrial turbines. Also in the 1930s, Woodward developed a governor for variable-pitch aircraft propellers. And when the United States military's first turbine-powered aircraft successfully flew, its GE engine had a Woodward control. Starting in the 1950s, Woodward began designing electronic controls, first analog and then digital units.

Historical Information[edit]
The journey began in Rockford, Illinois in 1870 with Amos W. Woodward's invention of a noncompensating mechanical waterwheel governor (U.S. patent No. 103,813).[4] Thirty years later his son, Elmer, patented the first successful mechanical compensating governor for hydraulic turbines (U.S. patent No. 583,527).[5] In 1933, the company became more diversified by expanding its product line to include diesel engine controls (U.S. patent No. 2,039,507)[6] and aircraft propeller governors (British patent No. 470,284).[7] Woodward governors followed the rapid advancement of diesel engine applications for railroads, maritime and electrical generation in many fields. The advent of gas turbine engines for aircraft and industrial uses offered still more opportunities for Woodward designed fuel controls. And, of course, the science of electronics has added impetus to this industry.
Elmer E. Woodward conceived, designed and developed the first successful propeller control in 1933.[7] This model PW-34 propeller governor is on display at the Udvar-Hazy annex of the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum.[8] Today, approximately 75% of all propeller-driven aircraft use Woodward AES controls.[citation needed] A growing number of general aviation and commuter aircraft rely on Woodward AES overspeed governors, synchronizers and synchophasers for the turboshaft, turboprops and reciprocating engines. As engine controls have moved toward electric-based systems, Woodward has responded with a line of electric propeller controls.[citation needed] The engines that are controlled by Woodward Aircraft engines systems are from Honeywell (TPE331), General Electric (CT7), Pratt & Whitney Canada (PT6A series), Raytheon, Vans, and Rotax Corporations to name a few. To continue the history journey and for more historical facts and figures the oldwoodward.com website has the world wide web's largest collection of historical facts on the Woodward Governor Company.
Modern Day Company[edit]
As of 2007, Woodward Governor Company became a $1 billion company with establishments all across the globe including: Japan, China, Europe and many others.[2]
On January 26, 2011, the company announced that shareholders have approved the name change to Woodward, Inc.[9]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
