	THE PARTIES*






	Issuing Entity/Trust





	Fifth Third Auto Trust 20[    ]-[    ], a Delaware statutory trust, will be the
	

	issuing entity

	 of the notes. The principal assets of the issuing entity will be a pool of receivables which are motor vehicle retail installment sales contracts and/or installment loans that are secured by new and used automobiles
	and light-duty trucks.





	Depositor





	Fifth Third Holdings Funding, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly owned special purpose subsidiary of FTH LLC, is the 

	depositor

	 of the issuing entity. The depositor will sell the
	receivables to the issuing entity. [An affiliate of the depositor] [The depositor] will be the initial holder of the issuing entitys certificates.




	You may contact the depositor by mail at 1701 Golf Road, Tower I, 9


	th



	Floor, Rolling Meadows, Illinois 60008, or by calling (847) 354-7341.






	Seller





	Fifth Third Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, known as 

	Sponsor/Servicer





	Fifth Third Bank, an Ohio corporation, known as the 

	Ohio Bank

	
	or the 

	servicer

	, will service the receivables held by the issuing entity. The servicer






	will be entitled to receive a servicing fee for each collection period. The 

	servicing fee

	 for any payment date will be an amount equal to
	the product of (1) [    ]% per annum; (2) one-twelfth (or, in the case of the first payment date, [a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days from but not including the [initial] cut-off date to and
	including the last day of the first collection period and the denominator of which is 360] [one-sixth]) and (3) the net pool balance of the receivables as of the first day of the related collection period (or as of the [initial] cut-off date,
	in the case of the first collection period). As additional compensation, the servicer will be entitled to retain all supplemental servicing fees. The servicing fee, together with any portion of the servicing fee that remains unpaid from prior
	payment dates, will be payable on each payment date from funds on deposit in the collection account with respect to the collection period preceding such payment date, including funds, if any, deposited into the collection account from the reserve
	account.

	Bank together as the 

	originators

	. Approximately [    ]% of the receivables were originated by the Michigan Bank and [    ]% of the receivables were originated by the Ohio Bank. Any
	receivables originated by the Ohio Bank and/or the Michigan Bank will first be sold to the seller. On the closing date, the seller will sell all

	The issuing entity will also issue a subordinated and non-interest bearing
	

	certificate

	, which is not offered hereby, which represents an equity interest in the issuing entity and is not offered hereby). The certificateholder will be entitled on each payment date only to amounts remaining after payments
	on the notes and payments of issuing entity expenses and other required amounts on such payment date.




	The notes are issuable in a minimum
	denomination of $[    ] and integral multiples of $[    ] in excess thereof.




	 






	The issuing entity expects to issue the notes on
	or about [            ], which we refer to as the 

	closing date

	.





	INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL





	The issuing entity will pay interest on the
	notes monthly, on the [15


	th



	] day of each month (or, if that day is not a business day, on the next business day), which we refer to as the 

	payment
	date

	. The first payment date is [            ]. On each payment date, payments on the notes will be made to holders of record as of the last business day preceding that payment
	date (except in limited circumstances where definitive notes are issued), which we refer to as the 

	record date

	.






	Interest Payments




	 






	





	 





	Interest on the notes will accrue from and including the prior payment date (or, with respect to the first payment date, from and including the closing date) to
	but excluding the following payment date.






	 






	





	 





	Interest accrued as of any payment date but not paid on that payment date will be payable on the next payment date, together with interest on such amount at the
	applicable interest rate (to the extent lawful).






	 






	





	 





	The issuing entity will pay interest on the Class A-1 notes [and the Class A-4 notes] on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed during the
	period for which interest is payable and a 360-day year. This means that the interest due on each payment date for the Class A-1 notes [and the Class A-4 notes, as applicable] will be the product of (i) the outstanding principal
	balance of the related class of notes, (ii) the applicable interest rate and (iii) the actual number of days from and including the previous payment date (or, in the case of the first payment date, from and including the closing date) to
	but excluding the current payment date divided by 360.






	 






	





	 





	The issuing entity will pay interest on the Class A-2 notes, the Class A-3 notes [and the Class A-4 notes] [and the Class B notes] on the









	 




	S-6







	Table of Contents







	 





	basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. This means that the interest due on each payment date for the Class A-2 notes, the
	Class A-3 notes, [the Class A-4 notes] [and the Class B notes] will be the product of (i) the outstanding principal balance of the related class of notes, (ii) the applicable interest rate and (iii) 30 (or in the case of the
	first payment date, [    ]), divided by 360.






	 






	





	 





	Interest payments on all classes of Class A notes will have the same priority. [Interest payments on the Class B notes will be subordinated to interest
	payments and, in specified circumstances, principal payments of the Class A notes.]








	Principal Payments




	 






	





	 





	[The issuing entity will not pay principal on the notes on any payment date occurring during the revolving period]






	 






	





	 





	The issuing entity will generally pay principal on the notes monthly on each payment date [, occurring during the amortization period] in accordance with
	the payment priorities described below under 

	 Priority of Payments.

	






	 






	





	 





	The issuing entity will make principal payments of the notes based on the amount of collections and defaults on the receivables during the prior collection
	period.






	 






	





	 





	This prospectus supplement describes how available funds and amounts on deposit in the reserve account are allocated to principal payments of the notes.






	 






	





	 





	On each payment date, prior to the acceleration of the notes following an event of default, which is described below under 

	 Interest and Principal
	Payments after an Event of Default

	, the issuing entity will distribute funds available to pay principal of the notes in the following order of priority:






	 





	 





	(1)







	first,

	to the Class A-1 notes, until the Class A-1 notes are paid in full;







	 








	 





	(2)







	second,

	to the Class A-2 notes, until the Class A-2 notes are paid in full;






	 





	 





	(3)







	third,

	to the Class A-3 notes, until the Class A-3 notes are paid in full;






	 





	 





	(4)







	fourth,

	to the Class A-4 notes until the Class A-4 notes are paid in full; and






	 





	 





	[(5)







	fifth

	, to the Class B notes, until the Class B notes are paid in full.]








	Interest and Principal Payments after an Event of Default





	On each payment
	date after an event of default under the indenture occurs [(other than an event of default based on the issuing entitys breach of a covenant, representation or warranty)] and the notes are accelerated, after payment of certain amounts to the
	trustees and the servicer [and the swap counterparty], interest on the Class A notes will be paid ratably to each class of Class A notes and principal payments of each class of notes will be made first to Class A-1 noteholders until
	the Class A-1 notes are paid in full. Next, the noteholders of all other classes of notes will receive principal payments, ratably, based on the aggregate outstanding principal amount of each remaining class of notes. [After interest on and
	principal of all of the Class A notes are paid in full, interest and principal payments will be made to noteholders of the Class B notes.] On each payment date after an event of default under the indenture occurs and the notes are accelerated
	as the result of the issuing entitys breach of a covenant, representation or warranty, after payment of certain amounts to the trustees, the servicer and the swap counterparty, interest on the Class A notes will be paid ratably to each
	class of Class A notes [followed by interest on the Class B notes]. Principal payments of each class of notes will then be made first to the Class A-1 noteholders until the Class A-1 notes are paid in full. Next, the noteholders of
	all other classes of Class A notes will receive principal payments, ratably, based on the outstanding principal amount of each remaining class of Class A notes until those other classes of Class A notes are paid in full. [Next, the
	Class B noteholders will receive principal payments until the Class B notes are paid in full.] See 

	Description of the Purchase Agreement, the Sale







	 




	S-7







	Table of Contents






	and Servicing Agreement and the Indenture  Rights Upon Event of Default

	 in this prospectus supplement.




	If an event of default has occurred but the notes have not been accelerated, then interest and principal payments will be made in the priority set forth
	below under 

	Priority of Payments.

	





	Optional Redemption of the Notes





	The servicer will have the right at its option to exercise a 

	clean-up call

	 and to purchase the receivables and the other issuing
	entity property (other than the reserve account) from the issuing entity on any payment date if, either before or after giving effect to any payment of principal required to be made on that payment date, the then-outstanding net pool balance of the
	receivables is less than or equal to [10]% of [the sum of (i)] the initial net pool balance [and (ii) the initial pre-funding deposit amount, if any]. (We use the term 

	net pool balance

	 to mean, as of any date, the aggregate
	outstanding principal balance of all receivables (other than defaulted receivables) of the issuing entity on such date.) If the servicer[, or any successor to the servicer], purchases the receivables and other issuing entity property (other than the
	reserve account) the repurchase price will equal the greater of (a) the unpaid principal amount on the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon up to but excluding that payment date (after giving effect to all distributions due on that
	payment date) and (b) the fair market value of the receivables and other issuing entity property (other than the reserve account), plus all amounts owing to the swap counterparty as of that payment date. It is expected that at the time this
	option becomes available to the servicer, or any successor to the servicer, only the Class A-4 notes [and the Class B notes] will be outstanding.




	Notice of redemption under the indenture must be given by the indenture trustee not later than [10] days prior to the applicable redemption date to each holder of notes. All notices of redemption will state:
	(i) the redemption date; (ii) the redemption price; (iii) that the record date otherwise applicable to that redemption date is not applicable and that payments will be made only upon presentation and surrender of those notes, and the
	place where those notes are to be






	surrendered for payment of the redemption price; (iv) that interest on the notes will cease to accrue on the redemption date; and (v) the CUSIP
	numbers (if applicable) for the notes. In addition, the issuing entity will notify each rating agency listed under 

	 Ratings

	 below upon redemption of the notes.





	EVENTS OF DEFAULT





	The occurrence of any one of the following events will be
	an 

	event of default

	 under the indenture:



	 






	





	 





	a default in the payment of any interest on any note [of the Controlling Class] when the same becomes due and payable, and such default shall continue for a
	period of five business days;






	 






	





	 





	default in the payment of the principal of any note at the related final scheduled payment date or the redemption date;






	 






	





	 





	any failure by the issuing entity to duly observe or perform in any material respect any of its material covenants or agreements in the indenture, which failure
	materially and adversely affects the interests of the noteholders, and which continues unremedied for 90 days after receipt by the issuing entity of written notice thereof from the indenture trustee or noteholders evidencing a majority of the
	outstanding principal amount of the notes [of the Controlling Class];






	 






	





	 





	any representation or warranty of the issuing entity made in the indenture proves to be incorrect in any material respect when made, which failure materially and
	adversely affects the rights of the noteholders, and which failure continues unremedied for 90 days after receipt by the issuing entity of written notice thereof from the indenture trustee or noteholders evidencing at least a majority of the notes
	[of the Controlling Class]; and






	 






	





	 





	the occurrence of certain events (which, if involuntary, remain unstayed for more than 90 days) of bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or liquidation of the
	issuing entity.







	Notwithstanding the foregoing, a delay in or failure of performance referred to under the first four
	bullet






	 




	S-8







	Table of Contents





	points above for a period of 120 days will not constitute an event of default if that delay or failure was caused by force majeure or other similar
	occurrence.




	The amount of principal required to be paid to noteholders under the indenture, however, generally will be limited to amounts
	available to make such payments in accordance with the priority of payments. Thus, the failure to pay principal of a class of notes due to a lack of amounts available to make such a payment will not result in the occurrence of an event of default


	until the final scheduled payment date for that class of notes.





	ISSUING ENTITY PROPERTY





	The primary assets of the issuing entity will be a pool of retail motor vehicle installment sales contracts and/or installment loans secured by a
	combination of new and used automobiles and light-duty trucks. We refer to these contracts and loans as 

	receivables

	, to the pool of those receivables as the 

	receivables pool

	 and to the persons who financed their
	purchases or refinanced existing obligations with these contracts and loans as 

	obligors

	. The receivables were underwritten in accordance with the originators respective underwriting criteria.




	The receivables identified on the schedule of receivables delivered by the FTH LLC on the closing date will be transferred to the depositor by FTH LLC
	and then transferred by the depositor to the issuing entity. The issuing entity will grant a security interest in the receivables and the other issuing entity property to the indenture trustee on behalf of the noteholders [and the swap
	counterparty].




	The 

	issuing entity property

	 will include the following:



	 






	





	 





	the receivables, including collections on the receivables after the applicable cut-off date (the cut-off date for the receivables sold to the issuing entity on
	the closing date is [                        ], which we refer to as the [initial] 

	cut-off date

	, [and the
	cut-off date for the receivables sold to the issuing entity on a Funding Date, the 

	subsequent cut-off date

	, is the date specified in the notice relating to that Funding Date)];







	 









	





	 





	security interests in the vehicles financed by the receivables, which we refer to as the 

	financed vehicles

	;






	 






	





	 





	all receivable files relating to the original motor vehicle retail installment sales contracts and/or loans evidencing the receivables;






	 






	





	 





	[rights under the interest rate swap agreement and payments made by the swap counterparty under the interest rate swap agreement;]






	 






	





	 





	any other property securing the receivables;






	 






	





	 





	all rights of the originator under agreements with the dealers relating to receivables;






	 






	





	 





	rights to proceeds under insurance policies that cover the obligors under the receivables or the financed vehicles;






	 






	





	 





	amounts on deposit in the accounts owned by the issuing entity and permitted investments of those accounts;






	 






	





	 





	rights of the issuing entity under the sale and servicing agreement and of the depositor, as buyer, under the purchase agreement; and






	 






	





	 





	the proceeds of any and all of the above.








	STATISTICAL INFORMATION





	The statistical information in this prospectus is based on the receivables as of
	[    ], which we refer to as the cut-off date. [The statistical distribution of the characteristics of the actual receivables pool will vary somewhat from the statistical distribution of those characteristics in this
	prospectus because the actual pool will be a subset of the receivables in the statistical pool. Any variance between the characteristics of the statistical pool and the actual pool will not be material.]




	As of the close of business on the cut-off date, the receivables in the [statistical] pool described in this prospectus had:

	an aggregate receivables balance of $[            ];






	 






	





	 





	a weighted average contract rate of [    ]%;









	 




	S-9

	





	 





	a weighted average original maturity of [    ] months; and






	 






	





	 





	a weighted average remaining maturity of [    ] months.







	In addition to the purchase of receivables from the issuing entity in connection with the servicers exercise of its clean-up call option as described above under
	

	Interest and Principal  Optional Redemption of the Notes,

	 receivables may be purchased from the issuing entity by the depositor or sponsor, in connection with the breach of certain representations and warranties concerning
	the characteristics of the receivables, and by the servicer, in connection with the breach of certain servicing covenants, as described under 

	The Servicer.

	





	[SUBSEQUENT RECEIVABLES]





	[On the closing date,
	$[            ] of the proceeds from the sale of the notes by the issuing entity will be deposited in an account, which we refer to as the 

	pre-funding account

	. The amount
	deposited in the pre-funding account on the closing date represents [    ]% of the initial aggregate principal balance of the receivables (including the expected aggregate principal balance of the subsequent receivables). During
	the Funding Period, the issuing entity will use the funds, if any, on deposit in the pre-funding account to acquire additional receivables from the depositor, which we refer to as 

	subsequent receivables

	, for an amount equal to the
	purchase price for the receivables on each date (no more than once a week) which we refer to as a 

	Funding Date

	. Subsequent receivables must meet certain eligibility criteria as described in 

	The Receivables Pool 
	Criteria Applicable to Selection of Receivables

	 in this prospectus supplement.




	The Funding Period will begin on the closing
	date and will end on the earliest to occur of:



	 





	 





	





	 





	[            ] full calendar months following the closing date;






	 





	 





	





	 





	the date on which the amount in the pre-funding account is $[10,000] or less; or






	 





	 





	





	 





	the occurrence of an event of default under the indenture.







	 






	On the
	first payment date following the termination of the Funding Period, the indenture trustee will withdraw any funds remaining on deposit in the pre-funding account (excluding investment earnings) and distribute them to the noteholders. See
	

	Description of the Purchase Agreement, Sale and Servicing Agreement and the Indenture  Pre-Funding Account

	.]





	[THE REVOLVING PERIOD]





	[The issuing entity will not make payments of principal on the notes on payment dates occurring
	during the revolving period.




	The 

	revolving period

	 consists of the collection periods from the closing date through
	[              ], and the related payment dates. We refer to the collection periods and the related payment dates following the revolving period as the 

	amortization
	period

	.




	If an early amortization event occurs, the revolving period will terminate early, and the amortization period will
	begin. See 

	The Notes  The Revolving Period

	 in this prospectus supplement.




	On each payment date related to the
	revolving period, amounts otherwise available to make principal payments on the notes will be applied to purchase additional receivables from the depositor for the purpose of maintaining the initial aggregate principal balance of the receivables.




	The amount of additional receivables will be determined by the amount of cash available from payments and prepayments on existing
	receivables. [There are no stated limits on the amount of additional receivables allowed to be purchased during the revolving period in terms of either dollars or percentage of the initial aggregate principal balance of the receivables.] [Insert the
	maximum amount of additional assets that may be acquired during the revolving period and the percentage of the asset pool that may be acquired during the revolving period, to the extent applicable, in accordance with Item 1103(a)(5) of
	Regulation AB.] See 

	additional receivables from the depositor.]




	Receivables acquired during the revolving period must meet certain eligibility criteria as
	described in 

	The Receivables Pool  Criteria Applicable to Selection of Receivables

	 in this prospectus supplement.





	PRIORITY OF PAYMENTS





	On each payment date, except after the acceleration of the notes following an event of default, the
	indenture trustee will make the following payments and deposits from available funds in the collection account (including funds, if any, deposited into the collection account from the reserve account [and amounts, if any, paid by the swap
	counterparty)] in the following amounts and order of priority:



	 





	 





	





	 






	first,

	to the servicer, for reimbursement of outstanding advances;






	 





	 





	

	notes;






	 





	 





	

	





	 






	eleventh,

	any remaining funds will be distributed to the certificateholder.







	The final distribution to any noteholder will be made only upon surrender and cancellation of the physical certificate representing that noteholders notes at an office or agency of the
	indenture trustee specified in a notice from the indenture trustee, in the name of and on behalf of the issuing entity. If any notes are not surrendered for cancellation, any funds held by the indenture trustee or any paying agent for the payment of
	any amount due with respect to any note after the indenture trustee has taken certain measures to locate the related noteholders and those measures have failed, will be distributed to the holder of the issuing entitys certificates.




	Amounts deposited in the principal distribution account will be paid to the noteholders of the notes as described under 

	The Notes 
	Payments of Principal.

	





	CREDIT ENHANCEMENT





	The credit enhancement provides protection for the [Class A notes and the Class B] notes against losses and delays in payment or other shortfalls of cash flow. The credit enhancement for the notes will be the
	[subordination of the certificate,] [the reserve account,] [the yield supplement overcollateralization amount,] [overcollateralization (in addition to the yield supplement overcollateralization amount)] and the excess interest on the receivables. If
	the credit enhancement is not sufficient to cover all amounts payable on the notes, the losses will be allocated to the notes by maturity, with notes having a later scheduled final maturity date generally bearing the risk of loss before notes having
	an earlier final scheduled maturity. See also 

	Risk Factors  Your


	share of possible losses may not be proportional

	 and 

	Description of the Transfer Agreements and the Administration Agreement  Priority of
	Payments.

	






	 




	 




	S-11







	Table of Contents





	The credit enhancement for the notes will be as follows:



	 
















	[Class A notes]





	  





	[Subordination of principal payments of the Class B notes, which will have an initial note balance of $[    ],] the reserve account and excess interest
	on the receivables.














	[Class B notes]





	  





	[The reserve account and excess interest on the receivables]









	[Subordinated Certificates]





	[The certificate [will have an initial principal balance of $[    ] (approximately [    ]% of the aggregate initial principal amount of the notes and the
	certificate) and] will be subordinated to the notes to provide credit enhancement for the notes because [no payments will be made on the certificate until the notes have been paid in full.] [no payments will be made on the certificate after an event
	of default until the notes have been paid in full.] See 

	Priority of Payments

	 above. The certificate is not offered to you under this prospectus supplement.]





	[Subordination of Payments on the Class B Notes]





	[As long as the Class A
	notes remain outstanding, payments of interest on any payment date on the Class B notes will be subordinated to payments of interest on the Class A notes and certain other payments on that payment date (including principal payments of the
	Class A notes in specified circumstances), and payments of principal of the Class B notes will be subordinated to all payments of principal of and interest on the Class A notes and certain other payments on that payment date. If the notes
	have been accelerated after an event of default under the indenture [(other than events of default based on the issuing entitys breach of covenant, representation or warranty)], all payments on the Class B notes will be subordinated to all
	payments on the Class A notes until the Class A notes are paid in full. See 

	Description of the Transfer Agreements and the Administration Agreement  Priority of Payments May change Upon an Event of Default

	 in this
	prospectus supplement.]







	Reserve Account





	On the closing date, the depositor will deposit from the proceeds of the sale of the notes
	$[            ] ([    ]% of the initial [adjusted] pool balance) in cash into the reserve account[, plus an amount expected to cover the negative carry with respect to
	the accrued interest on that portion of the note balance equal to amounts on deposit in the pre-funding account and earnings on funds, if any, on deposit in the pre-funding account]. [(We use the term 

	adjusted pool balance

	 to
	mean, as of any date, the net pool balance at that time, minus the yield supplement overcollateralization amount (as described below) as of that date.)] Collections on the receivables and other available funds, to the extent available after payments
	and deposits of higher priority are made, will be added to the reserve account on each payment date until the amount on deposit in the reserve account is equal to the specified reserve account balance (as described below).




	On each payment date, available funds will be deposited in the reserve account in accordance with the priority of payments described above until the
	amount on deposit in the reserve account equals the specified reserve account balance. Except as provided in the following paragraph, the 

	specified reserve account balance

	 is, on any payment date, the lesser of
	(a) $[            ] (which is approximately [    ]% of the initial adjusted pool balance) and (b) the aggregate outstanding balance of the notes after giving
	effect to all payments of principal on that payment date.




	However, if:



	 






	





	 





	the specified reserve reduction trigger is met on the [    ] payment date, the specified reserve account balance will be reduced to
	$[    ] ([    ]% of the initial adjusted pool balance) on that payment date and will remain at $[    ] for each payment date thereafter; or






	 






	





	 





	the specified reserve reduction trigger is met on the [    ] payment date, the specified reserve account balance will be reduced to
	$[    ] ([    ]% of the initial adjusted pool balance) on that payment date (regardless of whether the specified reserve reduction trigger was met on









	 




	S-12







	Table of Contents







	 





	the [    ] payment date) and will remain at $[    ] for each payment date thereafter.







	The 

	specified reserve reduction trigger

	, as used in the preceding paragraph, will be met for the applicable payment date if the
	cumulative net loss ratio for that payment date is (x) less than [    ]% on the [        ] payment date or (y) less than [    ]% on the
	[        ] payment date. If the specified reserve reduction trigger is met on the applicable payment date, we will notify noteholders of the reduction in the specified reserve account balance through
	disclosure of the change in the monthly servicers certificate. The 

	cumulative net loss ratio

	 means, for any payment date, the ratio (expressed as a percentage) computed by dividing (a) the excess of the aggregate
	outstanding principal balance of all defaulted receivables over aggregate liquidation proceeds and recoveries for all defaulted receivables by (b) the net pool balance as of the cut-off date.




	On each payment date, the issuing entity will withdraw funds from the reserve account to cover any shortfalls in the amounts required to be paid on that
	payment date with respect to clauses [

	first

	] through [

	seventh

	] under 

	Priority of Payments

	 above.




	On any
	payment date, if the amount in the reserve account exceeds the specified reserve account balance, the excess will be transferred to the collection account and distributed on that payment date [as available funds] [to the holder of the issuing
	entitys certificates]. See 

	Description of the Transfer Agreements and the Administration Agreement  The Accounts  The Reserve Account

	 in this prospectus supplement.





	[Overcollateralization]





	[Overcollateralization is the amount by which the adjusted pool balance exceeds the outstanding principal amount of the notes. Overcollateralization means that there will be additional assets (in addition to the yield supplement
	overcollateralization amount described below) generating collections that will be available to cover credit losses on the receivables. The initial amount of overcollateralization will be $[    ], or [    ]% of
	the initial adjusted pool balance.]




	 







	[Yield Supplement Overcollateralization Amount]





	[The yield supplement overcollateralization amount is equal to the sum of the amount for each receivable equal to the excess, if any, of (x) the scheduled payments due on the receivable for each future collection
	period discounted to present value as of the end of the preceding collection period at the APR of that receivable over (y) the scheduled payments due on the receivable for each future collection period discounted to present value as of the end
	of the preceding collection period at a discount rate equal to the greater of the APR of that receivable and [    ]%.




	As of the closing date, the yield supplement overcollateralization amount will equal $[    ], which is approximately [    ]% of the initial adjusted pool balance. The yield supplement
	overcollateralization amount will decline on each payment date. The yield supplement overcollateralization amount is intended to compensate for low APRs on some of the receivables and is in addition to the overcollateralization referred to above.




	See 

	Description of the Transfer Agreements and the Administration Agreement  Yield Supplement Overcollateralization
	Amount

	 in this prospectus supplement for more detailed information about the yield supplement overcollateralization amount.]





	[Excess Interest]





	[Because more interest is expected to be paid by the obligors in respect of the receivables than is
	necessary to pay the related servicing fee[, any net swap payment] and interest on the notes each month, there is expected to be 

	excess interest

	. Any excess interest will be applied on each payment date as an additional source of
	available funds for distribution in accordance with the 

	Priority of Payments

	 described above.]





	[INTEREST RATE SWAP]





	On the closing date, the issuing entity will enter into a transaction pursuant to an interest rate swap agreement with the swap
	counterparty to hedge the floating interest rate on the [Class A-4 notes]. The interest rate swap for the [Class A-4 notes] will have an initial notional amount equal to the note balance






	 




	S-13







	Table of Contents





	of the [Class A-4 notes] on the closing date, and that notional amount will decrease by the amount of any principal payments made on the [Class A-4 notes].




	The notional amount under the interest rate swap will at all times be equal to the note balance of the [Class A-4 notes].




	In general, under the interest rate swap agreement on each payment date, the issuing entity will be obligated to pay the swap counterparty a fixed rate
	payment based on a per annum fixed rate of [    ]% multiplied by the notional amount of the interest rate swap, and the swap counterparty will be obligated to pay a per annum floating interest rate payment based on LIBOR plus
	[    ]% multiplied by the notional amount of the interest rate swap. Payments (other than swap termination payments) on the interest rate swap will be exchanged on a net basis. Any 

	net swap payment

	 owed by the
	issuing entity to the swap counterparty on the interest rate swap ranks higher in priority than all payments on the notes.




	The interest
	rate swap agreement may be terminated upon an event of default or other termination event specified in the interest rate swap agreement. If the interest rate swap agreement is terminated due to an event of default or other termination event, a
	termination payment may be due to the swap counterparty by the issuing entity out of available funds.




	If the issuing entity fails to make
	a net swap payment due under the interest rate swap agreement, if performance under the interest rate swap agreement would be illegal or if a bankruptcy event occurs with respect to the issuing entity, a 

	senior swap termination
	payment

	 may be due that is pro rata with payments of interest on the Class A notes and is higher in priority than payments of principal on the Class A notes [and Class B notes]. 

	Subordinated swap termination
	payments

	, which may be due because of an event of default or termination event under the interest rate swap agreement not involving the issuing entitys failure to make a net swap payment, the illegality of performance under the
	interest rate swap agreement or a bankruptcy event with respect to the issuing entity, will be subordinate to payments of principal and interest on the Class A notes [and Class B notes].




	 






	The issuing entitys obligation to pay any net swap payment and any other amounts due under the interest rate swap agreement is secured under the indenture by the issuing entity property.




	For a more detailed description of the interest rate swap agreement and the swap counterparty, see 

	The Notes  Interest Rate
	Swap Agreement

	 and 

	The Swap Counterparty

	 in this prospectus supplement.]




	[Insert financial information for
	any credit enhancement provider liable or contingently liable to provide payments representing 10% or more of the cash flow supporting the notes in accordance with Item 1114(b) of Regulation AB.]





	TAX STATUS





	Mayer Brown LLP,
	special federal tax counsel to the depositor, is of the opinion that (i) for federal income tax purposes, the issuing entity will not be classified as an association taxable as a corporation and the issuing entity will not be treated as a
	publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation and (ii) the [Class A notes and the Class B] notes will be characterized as indebtedness for United States federal income tax purposes.




	Each holder of a note, by acceptance of a note, will agree to treat the note as indebtedness for federal, state and local income and franchise tax
	purposes.




	We encourage you to consult your own tax advisor regarding the federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and
	disposition of the notes and the tax consequences arising under the laws of any state or other taxing jurisdiction.




	See 

	Material
	Federal Income Tax Consequences

	 in this prospectus supplement and in the accompanying prospectus.





	CERTAIN ERISA
	CONSIDERATIONS





	Subject to the considerations disclosed in 

	Certain ERISA Considerations

	 in this prospectus
	supplement and the accompanying prospectus, the [Class A notes and the Class B] notes may be purchased by employee benefit plans and accounts. An employee benefit plan, any other retirement plan,






	 




	S-14







	Table of Contents





	and any entity deemed to hold plan assets of any employee benefit plan or other plan should consult with its counsel before purchasing the notes.




	See 

	Certain ERISA Considerations

	 in this prospectus supplement and in the accompanying prospectus.





	[MONEY MARKET INVESTMENT]





	[The
	Class A-1 notes will be eligible for purchase by money market funds under paragraph (a)(10) of Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. If you are a money market fund contemplating a purchase of Class A-1 notes, you


	should consult your counsel before making a purchase.]





	RATINGS





	It is a condition to the issuance of the notes that, on the closing date, each class of notes will receive at least the following ratings from [Standard & Poors Ratings Services, a
	division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.,] [Moodys Investors Service, Inc.] and [Fitch Ratings]:

	[Ratings on the notes will be monitored by the rating agencies listed above while the notes are
	outstanding.] [Although the rating agencies are not contractually obligated to monitor the ratings on the notes, we believe that the rating agencies will continue to monitor the transaction while the notes are outstanding.] Ratings on the notes may
	be lowered, qualified or withdrawn at any time. A rating is based on each rating agencys independent evaluation of the receivables and the availability of any credit enhancement for the notes. A rating, or a change or withdrawal of a rating,
	by one rating agency will not necessarily correspond to a rating, or a change or a withdrawal of a rating, from any other rating agency.

Amended and Restated

Trust Agreement
(2013-A)







Trust Estate and the making of
distributions to the Certificateholders and the
Noteholders.

The Owner Trustee is hereby
authorized to engage in the foregoing activities on behalf of the
Issuer. Neither the Issuer nor the Owner Trustee on behalf of the
Issuer shall engage in any activity other than in connection with
the foregoing or other than as required or authorized by the terms
of this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents.

SECTION 2.4 Appointment of the
Owner Trustee . The Depositor hereby appoints the Owner Trustee
as trustee of the Issuer effective as of the date hereof, to have
all the rights, powers and duties set forth herein.

SECTION 2.5 Initial Capital

Trust . The Owner Trustee hereby declares that it will hold the
Trust Estate in trust upon and subject to the conditions set forth
herein for the use and benefit of the Certificateholders, subject
to the obligations of the Issuer under the Transaction Documents.
It is the intention of the parties hereto that the Issuer
constitute a statutory trust under the Statutory Trust Act and that
(i) this Agreement constitute the governing instrument of such
statutory trust and (ii) for United States federal, state and
local income, franchise and value added tax purposes, the Issuer
shall be treated as a grantor trust of the type described in
Treasury Regulation section 301.7701-4(c), with the assets of the
Issuer constituting the Receivables and other assets held by the
Issuer, and the Notes constituting non-recourse debt of the
Certificateholder(s), provided that if it is successfully asserted
by the appropriate tax authorities that the Issuer is not properly
characterized as a grantor trust of the type described in Treasury
Regulation section 301.7701-4(c), the Issuer shall be treated, for
United States federal, state and local income, franchise and value
added tax purposes, as (A) a disregarded entity if there is
only one beneficial owner of the Certificates and any Notes that
are treated as equity in the Issuer, or (B) a partnership
(other than an association or publicly traded partnership taxable
as a corporation) if there is more than one beneficial owner of the
Certificates and any Notes that are treated as equity in the
Issuer, with the assets of the partnership being the Receivables
and other assets held by the Issuer, the partners of the
partnership being the Certificateholders and the holders of the
Notes that are treated as equity in the Issuer, and the remaining
Notes constituting indebtedness of the partnership. The parties
hereto and each Certificateholder, by acceptance of a Certificate,
agree to treat the Issuer in accordance with the intention that the
Issuer be characterized as a grantor trust of the type described in
Treasury Regulation section 301.7701-4(c) and, unless otherwise
required by appropriate taxing authorities or by law, not to take
any action or, direct any other party to take any action,
inconsistent therewith, including, but not limited to, modifying,
or directing any other party to modify, the terms of a Receivable
unless the modification is a Permitted Modification. The provisions
of this Trust Agreement shall be interpreted consistent with and to
further this intention of the parties. The parties agree that,
unless otherwise required by appropriate tax authorities, the
Issuer will file or cause to be filed

Amended and Restated

Trust Agreement
(2013-A)






annual or other necessary tax returns, reports
and other forms consistent with the foregoing characterization of
the Issuer for United States federal, state and local income,
franchise and value added tax purposes. No election will be made by
or on behalf of the Issuer to be classified as an association
taxable as a corporation for United States federal income tax
purposes. Effective as of the date hereof, the Owner Trustee shall
have all rights, powers and duties set forth herein and, to the
extent not inconsistent herewith, in the Statutory Trust Act with
respect to accomplishing the purposes of the Issuer. The Owner
Trustee filed the Certificate of Trust with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware as required by Section 3810(a) of the
Statutory Trust Act, such filing hereby being ratified and approved
in all respects. Notwithstanding anything herein or in the
Statutory Trust Act to the contrary, it is the intention of the
parties hereto that the Issuer constitute a “business
trust” within the meaning of Section 101(9)(A)(v) of the
Bankruptcy Code.

SECTION 2.7 Organizational
Expenses; Liabilities of the Holders .

(a) The Servicer shall pay
organizational expenses of the Issuer as they may arise.

Estate . Legal title to all the Trust Estate shall be vested at
all times in the Issuer as a separate legal entity.

SECTION 2.9 Representations and
Warranties of the Depositor . The Depositor hereby represents
and warrants to the Owner Trustee that:

(a) Existence and Power . The
Depositor is a limited liability company validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware and has, in
all material respects, all power and authority required to carry on
its business as now conducted. The Depositor has obtained all
necessary licenses and approvals in each jurisdiction where the
failure to do so would materially and adversely affect the ability
of the Depositor to perform its obligations under the Transaction
Documents.

(b) Authorization and No
Contravention . The execution, delivery and performance by the
Depositor of each Transaction Document to which it is a party
(i) have been duly authorized by all necessary action on the
part of the Depositor and (ii) do not contravene or constitute
a default under (A) any applicable law, rule or regulation,
(B) its organizational instruments or (C) any material
agreement, contract, order or other instrument to which it is a
party or its property is subject (other than violations of such
laws, rules, regulations, indenture or agreements which do not
affect the legality, validity or enforceability of any of such
agreements and which, individually or in the aggregate, would not
materially and adversely affect the transactions contemplated by,
or the Depositor’s ability to perform its obligations under,
the Transaction Documents to which it is a party).

Amended and Restated

Trust Agreement
(2013-A)







(c) No Consent Required . No
approval, authorization or other action by, or filing with, any
Governmental Authority is required in connection with the
execution, delivery and performance by the Depositor of any
Transaction Document other than (i) UCC filings,
(ii) approvals and authorizations that have previously been
obtained and filings which have previously been made and
(iii) approvals, authorizations or filings which, if not
obtained or made, would not have a material adverse effect on the
ability of the Depositor to perform its obligations under the
Transaction Documents to which it is a party.

(d) Binding Effect . Each
Transaction Document to which the Depositor is a party constitutes
the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Depositor
enforceable against the Depositor in accordance with its terms,
except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, receivership,
conservatorship or other similar laws affecting creditors’
rights generally and, if applicable the rights of creditors of
limited liability companies from time to time in effect or by
general principles of equity or other similar laws of general
application relating to or affecting the enforcement of
creditors’ rights generally and subject to general principles
of equity.

(e) No Proceedings . There is
no action, suit, Proceeding or investigation pending or, to the
knowledge of the Depositor, threatened against the Depositor which,
either in any one instance or in the aggregate, would result in any
material adverse change in the business, operations, financial
condition, properties or assets of the Depositor, or in any
material impairment of the right or ability of the Depositor to
carry on its business substantially as now conducted, or in any
material liability on the part of the Depositor, or which would
render invalid this Agreement or the Receivables or the obligations
of the Depositor contemplated herein, or which would materially
impair the ability of the Depositor to perform under the terms of
this Agreement or any other Transaction Document.

(f) Situs of Issuer . The
Issuer shall be located in the State of Delaware (it being
understood that the Issuer may have bank accounts located and

the extent that the Depositor is a Certificateholder.

Trust Agreement
(2013-A)







SECTION 3.2 Authentication of
Certificates . (a) Concurrently with the sale of the
Transferred Assets to the Issuer pursuant to the Sale Agreement,
the Owner Trustee shall cause the initial Certificate to be
executed on behalf of the Issuer, authenticated and delivered to or
upon the written order of the Depositor, signed by its chairman of
the board, its president, its chief financial officer, its chief
accounting officer, any vice president, its secretary, any
assistant secretary, its treasurer or any assistant treasurer,
without further corporate action by the Depositor.

(b) The Certificates shall represent
100% of the beneficial interest in the Issuer and shall, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be fully paid and
nonassessable.

SECTION 3.3 Form of the
Certificates . The initial Certificate, upon issuance, will be
a typewritten, definitive Certificate, substantially in the form of
Exhibit A hereto and shall be registered in the name of
Fifth Third Holdings Funding, LLC or its nominee as the initial
registered owner thereof.

SECTION 3.4 Registration of
Certificates . The Owner Trustee, in its capacity as
“Certificate Registrar” shall maintain at its office
referred to in Section 2.2 , or at the office of any
agent appointed by it and approved in writing by the
Certificateholders at the time of such appointment, a register (the
“ Certificate Register ”) for the registration
and transfer of any Certificate, and the Owner Trustee or such
agent shall promptly notify the Indenture Trustee of any change in
the registered ownership of a Certificate. Prior to the presentment
for registration of transfer of any Certificate, the Owner Trustee
and the Indenture Trustee or any agent of the Owner Trustee, the
Indenture Trustee and the Depositor may treat the Person in whose
name any Certificate is registered (as of the applicable Record
Date) as the owner of such Certificate for the purpose of receiving
distributions on such Certificate and for all other purposes
whatsoever and unless the Certificate Register is notified of such
change in ownership the only available recourse such transferee
shall have shall be to the person in whose name the related
Certificate is registered. For the avoidance of doubt, the records
maintained by the Owner Trustee in the Certificate Register with
respect to each Certificate and its related registered owner are
intended to cause the Certificates to be issued in registered form,
within the meaning of Treasury Regulation section 5f.103-1(c), and
shall record (a) the Percentage Interest in all of the assets
of and the right to distributions from, the Issuer evidenced by
each Certificate and (b) all distributions made to each
Certificateholder with respect to the Issuer’s
assets.

SECTION 3.5 Transfer of
Certificates . (a) Any Certificateholder may assign,
convey or otherwise transfer all or any of its right, title and
interest in the related Certificate; provided ,
that:

(i) (a) such transferee is either an
Affiliate of the Depositor or (b) (1) is a Qualified
Institutional Buyer, (2) is aware that the sale of the
Certificates to it is being made in reliance on the exemption from
registration provided by Rule 144A, and (3) is acquiring the
Certificates for its own account or for one or more accounts, each
of which is a Qualified Institutional Buyer, and as to each of
which the owner exercises sole investment discretion or for resale
pursuant to Rule 144A;

Amended and Restated

Trust Agreement
(2013-A)







(ii) such transferee understands
that the Certificates will bear the applicable legends set forth in
Section 3.5(g) ;

(iii) such transferee understands
that the Certificates are being offered only in a transaction not
involving any public offering in the United States within the
meaning of the Securities Act, none of the Certificates have been
or will be registered under the Securities Act, and, if in the
future the transferee decides to offer, resell, pledge or otherwise
transfer the Certificates, such Certificates may only be offered,
resold, pledged or otherwise transferred in accordance with this
Agreement and the applicable legend on such Certificates set forth
below;

(iv) such transferee understands
that an investment in the Certificates involves certain risks,
including the risk of loss of all or a substantial part of its
investment under certain circumstances. The transferee has had
access to such financial and other information concerning the
Issuer and the Certificates as it deemed necessary or appropriate
in order to make an informed investment decision with respect to
its purchase of the Certificates. The transferee has such knowledge
and experience in financial and business matters that the
transferee is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its
investment in the Certificates, and the transferee and any accounts
for which it is acting are each able to bear the economic risk of
the holder’s or of its investment;

(v) such transferee will not offer,
transfer, pledge, sell or otherwise dispose of the Certificates or
any interest in the Certificates to any Person in any manner, or
solicit any offer to buy, transfer, pledge or otherwise dispose of
the Certificates or any interest in the Certificates from any
Person in any manner, or make any general solicitation by means of
general advertising or in any other manner, or take any other
action that would constitute a distribution of the Certificates
under the Securities Act or that would render the disposition of
the Certificates a violation of Section 5 of the Securities
Act or any other applicable securities laws or require registration
pursuant thereto, and will not authorize any Person to act on its
behalf, in such manner with respect to the Certificates;

(vi) the Owner Trustee and the
Issuer determine (based on the advice of counsel or such other
information as they deem necessary or advisable) that the transfer
complies with the requirements of clauses (d)  and
(e)  of this Section 3.5 ;

(vii) such Certificate may not be
acquired by or for the account of or with the assets of a Benefit
Plan or a governmental, church, non-U.S. or other plan which is
subject to any Similar Law;

(viii) the transferee provides a
Certificate Investor Representation Letter substantially in the
form of Exhibit B ; and

(ix) such transferee acknowledges
that the Issuer, the Owner Trustee, the Placement Agent and others
will rely upon the truth and accuracy of the
 












 



7


 


Amended and Restated

Trust Agreement
(2013-A)







acknowledgements, representations,
warranties and agreements in this Section 3.5 and
agrees that if any of the acknowledgements, representations,
warranties or agreements made by it in connection with its purchase
of the Certificates are no longer accurate, the transferee will
promptly notify the Issuer, the Owner Trustee and the Placement
Agent.

Each Certificateholder will
represent and warrant that it is not (and will not be) a Benefit
Plan or a governmental, church, non-U.S. or other plan which is
subject to any Similar Law and is not (and will not be) accepting
or holding such Certificate (or any interest therein) on behalf of
or with assets of a Benefit Plan or a governmental, non-U.S. or
church plan which is subject to Similar Law. The Owner Trustee
shall have no duty to independently determine that the requirement
in (vi) above is met and shall incur no liability to any
Person in the event the Certificateholder does not comply with such
restrictions. Subject to the transfer restrictions contained herein
and in the Certificates, any Certificateholder may transfer all or
any portion of the Percentage Interest evidenced by such
Certificate upon surrender thereof to the Owner Trustee accompanied
by the documents required by this Section. Such transfer may be
made by a registered Certificateholder in person or by his attorney
duly authorized in writing upon surrender of the Certificate to the
Owner Trustee accompanied by (a) a written instrument of
transfer in the form of the “Assignment” attached to
the Form of Certificate attached hereto as Exhibit A and
with such signature guarantees and evidence of authority of the
Persons signing the instrument of transfer as the Owner Trustee may
reasonably require; provided, however , that the Owner
Trustee shall not require the signature of the Depositor to be
medallion guaranteed for the transfers from the Depositor to the
applicable transferees on the date hereof, (b) an executed
direction letter regarding registration of such transfer in the
form attached hereto as Exhibit D , and (c) the
documents required by Sections 3.5(a)(viii) and
3.5(e) hereof. Promptly upon the receipt of such documents
and receipt by the Owner Trustee of the transferor’s
Certificate, the Owner Trustee shall record the name of such
transferee as a Certificateholder and its Percentage Interest in
the Certificate Register and issue, execute and deliver to such
Certificateholder a Certificate evidencing such Percentage
Interest. In the event a transferor transfers only a portion of its
Percentage Interest, the Owner Trustee shall register and issue to
such transferor a new Certificate evidencing such
transferor’s new Percentage Interest and shall issue, execute
and deliver to such transferee a new Certificate evidencing such
transferee’s Percentage Interest. Subsequent to each transfer
of beneficial interest and upon the issuance of the new Certificate
or Certificates, the Owner Trustee shall cancel and destroy the
Certificate surrendered to it in connection with such transfer. The
Owner Trustee may treat, for all purposes whatsoever (other than
for purposes of clauses (d)  and (e)  of
this Section 3.5 ), the Person in whose name any
Certificate is registered as the sole owner of the Percentage
Interest evidenced by such Certificate.

(b) As a condition precedent to any
registration of transfer under this Section 3.5 , the
Owner Trustee may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover
the payment of any tax or taxes or other governmental charges
required to be paid in connection with such transfer.

(c) The Owner Trustee shall not be
obligated to register any transfer of a Certificate unless the
transferee has certified to the Owner Trustee that such transfer
does not

(2013-A)






violate any of the transfer restrictions stated
herein including, but not limited to clauses (d)  and
(e)  of this Section 3.5 . The Owner
Trustee shall not be liable to any Person for registering any
transfer based on such certifications.

(d) No transfer shall be permitted
if such transfer is effected through an established securities
market or secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof)
within the meaning of Code section 7704 and any proposed, temporary
or final Treasury regulations thereunder.

(e) Each registered owner of and, if
different, each owner of a beneficial interest in, a Certificate
that is a “United States person” (as defined in Code
section 7701(a)(30)) shall deliver to the Owner Trustee, the
Administrator and the Certificate Paying Agent two properly
completed and duly executed originals of U.S. Internal Revenue
Service Form W-9 (or applicable successor form) certifying that it
is not subject to backup withholding. Each registered owner of and,
if different, each owner of a beneficial interest in, a Certificate
that is not a “United States person” shall deliver to
the Owner Trustee, the Administrator and the Certificate Paying
Agent two properly completed and duly executed originals of U.S.
Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN (Certification of Foreign
Status as Beneficial Owner), IRS Form W-8IMY (Certification of

Business), or any successors to such IRS forms (i) to permit
the Owner Trustee, the Administrator and the Certificate Paying
Agent to make payments to the purchaser without, or at a reduced
rate of, withholding, (ii) to enable the Issuer to qualify for
a reduced rate of withholding in any jurisdiction from or through
which the Issuer receives payments on its assets, or (iii) to
enable the Owner Trustee, the Administrator and the Certificate
Paying Agent to satisfy any reporting or other obligations under
any applicable tax law, and will update or replace such form,
certification or other information as necessary in accordance with
its terms or its subsequent amendments.

The applicable Internal Revenue

becomes a Certificateholder under this Agreement and from time to
time thereafter as prescribed by applicable law or upon the request
of the Certificate Paying Agent.

In addition, each registered owner
of and, if different, each owner of a beneficial interest in, a
Certificate that is not a “United States person” within

or transferee is a non-U.S. person whether it is a foreign
financial institution (“ FFI ”) as defined in
Code section 1471(d)(4) or a non-financial foreign entity as
defined in Code section 1472(d) (“ non-FFI
”).

If a purchaser, beneficial owner or
transferee of a Certificate is, or would be, a FFI, such FFI shall
represent (or shall be deemed by acceptance of its Certificate or
interest therein to represent) to the Issuer and Owner Trustee that
it has met (or will meet as soon as applicable guidance is issued
by the IRS) the reporting requirements of Code section 1471(b)
(“ FFI Reporting Obligations ”), and such FFI
shall further represent and agree that it shall continue to meet
its FFI Reporting Obligations and has not made (and will not
make) the election to be withheld upon pursuant to Code
section 1471(b)(3). If a purchaser, beneficial owner or transferee
of a Certificate is, or would be, a non-FFI such non-FFI shall,
when applicable law requires a non-FFI to meet the reporting
requirements of Code section 1472(b) either (i) represent (or
shall be deemed by acceptance of its Certificate or interest
therein to represent) to the Issuer and Owner Trustee that it does
not have (or will not have as soon as applicable guidance is issued
by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service) any substantial United States
owners within the meaning of Code section 1472(b)(1)(A) or
(ii) provide to the Issuer and Owner Trustee the name,
address, and taxpayer identification number of each of its
substantial United States owners and any other information required
by Code section 1472.

Each purchaser, beneficial owner and
subsequent transferee of Certificates or an interest therein will
be required or deemed to acknowledge that the Issuer may provide
such information and any other information concerning its
investment in the Certificates to the U.S. Internal Revenue
Service. In addition, each purchaser, beneficial owner and
subsequent transferee of Certificates or an interest therein will
be required or deemed to understand and acknowledge that the Issuer
has the right, hereunder, to withhold on any beneficial owner of an
interest in a Certificate that fails to comply with the foregoing
requirements.

(f) If a Responsible Officer of
Owner Trustee becomes aware that (1) a transfer or attempted
or purported transfer of any Certificate or interest therein was
consummated in compliance with the provisions of this
Section 3.5 on the basis of a materially incorrect
certification from the transferor or purported transferee,
(2) a transferee failed to deliver to the Owner Trustee the
certificate required to be delivered under
Section 3.5(a)(viii) or (3) the Certificateholder of any
Certificate or interest therein is in material breach of any
representation or agreement set forth in any certificate or any
deemed representation or agreement of such Certificateholder, the
Owner Trustee will direct the Certificate Registrar not to register
such attempted or purported transfer and, if a transfer has been
registered, such transfer shall be absolutely null and void ab
initio and shall not operate to transfer any rights to the
purported transferee (such purported transferee, a
“Disqualified Transferee”) and the last preceding
Certificateholder of such Certificateholder that was not a
Disqualified Transferee shall be restored to all rights as a
Certificateholder thereof retroactively to the date of the
purported transfer of such Certificate by such
Certificateholder.

(g) Each Certificate will bear a
legend to the following effect:

REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE
“SECURITIES ACT”) OR ANY OTHER APPLICABLE SECURITIES OR
“BLUE SKY” LAWS OF ANY STATE OR OTHER JURISDICTION. THE
HOLDER HEREOF, BY PURCHASING THIS CERTIFICATE, AGREES THAT THIS
CERTIFICATE MAY BE RESOLD, ASSIGNED, PLEDGED OR OTHERWISE
TRANSFERRED ONLY IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS
OF THE SECURITIES ACT OR ANY OTHER APPLICABLE SECURITIES OR
“BLUE SKY” LAWS AND ONLY PURSUANT TO RULE 144A UNDER
THE SECURITIES ACT (“RULE 144A”) TO A PERSON THAT THE
HOLDER REASONABLY BELIEVES IS A QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYER
WITHIN THE MEANING OF RULE 144A (A “QIB”), PURCHASING
FOR ITS OWN ACCOUNT OR THE ACCOUNT OF A QIB, WHOM THE HOLDER HAS
INFORMED THAT THE REOFFER, RESALE OR OTHER TRANSFER IS BEING MADE

Certificate is surrendered to the Owner Trustee, or (ii) the
Owner Trustee receives evidence to its satisfaction that any
Certificate has been destroyed, lost or stolen, and upon proof of
ownership satisfactory to the Owner Trustee together with such
security or indemnity on behalf of the Issuer as may be requested
by the Owner Trustee to save it harmless, then, in the absence of
notice to the Owner Trustee that such Certificate has been acquired
by a protected purchaser, the Owner Trustee shall execute and
deliver a new Certificate for the same Percentage Interest in the
Issuer as the Certificate so mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen,
of like tenor and bearing a different issue number, with such
notations, if any, as the Owner Trustee shall determine. Upon the
issuance of any new Certificate under this Section 3.6
, the Issuer or Owner Trustee may require the payment of a sum
sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may
be imposed in connection with any transfer or exchange of the
Certificate and any other reasonable expenses (including the
reasonable fees and expenses of the Issuer and the Owner Trustee)
connected therewith. If, after the delivery of such new Certificate
a protected purchaser of the original Certificate in lieu of which
such new Certificate was issued presents such original Certificate
for transfer or payment, the Issuer and Owner Trustee shall be
entitled to recover such new Certificate from the Person to whom it
was delivered or any Person taking title therefrom, except a
protected purchaser, and the Issuer and Owner Trustee shall be
entitled to recover upon the security or indemnity provided
therefor to the extent of any loss, damage, cost or expense
incurred by the Issuer and Owner Trustee, in connection therewith.
Any duplicate Certificate issued pursuant to this
Section 3.6 shall constitute complete and indefeasible
evidence of ownership in the Issuer, as if originally issued,
whether or not the lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate shall be
found at any time. The provisions of this Section 3.6 are
exclusive and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other
rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of
mutilated, defaced, destroyed, lost or stolen
Certificates.

SECTION 3.7 Appointment of the
Certificate Paying Agent . The Certificate Paying Agent shall

Association shall be permitted to resign as Certificate Paying

Trustee. If Wilmington Trust, National Association shall no longer
be the Certificate Paying Agent, the Administrator shall appoint a
successor to act as Certificate Paying Agent (which shall be a bank

Certificate Paying Agent or any additional Certificate Paying Agent
appointed by the Administrator to execute and deliver to the Owner
Trustee a written agreement in which such successor Certificate
Paying Agent or additional Certificate Paying Agent shall agree
with the Owner Trustee that, as Certificate Paying Agent, such
successor Certificate Paying Agent or additional Certificate Paying
Agent shall hold all sums, if any, held by it for payment to the
Certificateholders in trust for the benefit of the
Certificateholders entitled thereto until such sums shall be paid
to such Certificateholders. Subject to applicable laws, with
respect to the escheat of funds, the Certificate Paying Agent shall
return all funds that have remained unclaimed by a
Certificateholder for two years to the Owner Trustee. Immediately
upon its removal, a Certificate Paying Agent shall return all funds
(including any unclaimed funds) in its possession to the Owner
Trustee. The rights, protections and indemnities of the Owner
Trustee under Article VII and Section 8.2 and
9.2 of this Agreement shall apply to the Owner Trustee also
in its role as Certificate Paying Agent for so long as the Owner
Trustee shall act as Certificate Paying Agent and, to the extent

initially appoints the Owner Trustee to serve as its agent for the
foregoing purposes. The Issuer shall give prompt written notice to
the Owner Trustee of the location, and of any change in the
location, of any such office or agency. If at any time the Issuer
shall fail to maintain any such office or agency or shall fail to
furnish the Owner Trustee with the address thereof, such

Agent shall withdraw from the Certificate Distribution Account and
distribute to the Certificateholders, pro rata based on the
Percentage Interest of each Certificateholder, all funds received

Agreement. Subject to the lien of the Indenture, the Certificate
Paying Agent shall promptly distribute to the Certificateholders
all other amounts (if any) received by the Certificate Paying Agent
on behalf of the Issuer in respect of the Trust Estate (pro rata
based on the Percentage Interest of each such Certificateholder).
After the termination of the Indenture in accordance with its
terms, the Certificate Paying Agent shall distribute all amounts
received (if any) by the Owner Trustee on behalf of the Issuer in
respect of the Trust Estate in accordance with the provisions of
this Agreement. If any withholding tax is imposed on any Issuer

(but such authorization shall not prevent the
Owner Trustee from contesting any such tax in appropriate
proceedings and withholding payment of such tax, if permitted by
law, pending the outcome of such proceedings). The amount of any
withholding tax imposed with respect to a Certificateholder shall
be treated as cash distributed to such Certificateholder at the
time it is withheld by the Issuer and remitted to the appropriate
taxing authority. If there is a possibility that withholding tax is
payable with respect to a distribution or income allocation, the
Owner Trustee may in its sole discretion withhold such amounts in
accordance with this Section 5.1 . If a
Certificateholder wishes to apply for a refund of any such
withholding tax, the Owner Trustee shall reasonably cooperate with
such Certificateholder in making such claim so long as such

Issuer is required to be treated as a partnership for United States
federal income tax purposes, the Certificateholder that is a United
States Person within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30)
holding the largest Certificate Percentage Interest shall be
designated the “tax matters partner” of the Issuer
pursuant to Code section 6231(a)(7)(A) of the Code and shall sign

Certificateholders would be described in the preceding sentence

1065 if the Issuer is treated as a partnership for United States
federal income tax purposes) and make such elections as from time
to time may be required or appropriate under any applicable state
or federal statute or any rule or regulation thereunder so as to
maintain the Issuer’s tax characterization as described in
Section 2.6 hereof, (d) cause applicable tax
returns to be signed in the manner required by law and
(e) collect or cause to be collected any withholding tax as
described in and in accordance with Section 5.1 with

an Eligible Account, the Owner Trustee (or the Servicer on behalf
of the Owner Trustee, if the Certificate Distribution Account is
not then held by the Owner Trustee or an Affiliate thereof) shall
within ten (10) Business Days establish a new Certificate
Distribution Account as an Eligible Account and shall transfer any
cash then on deposit in the Certificate Distribution Account to
such new Certificate Distribution Account.

in respect of the assets of the Issuer and neither the Certificate
Paying Agent nor the Owner Trustee shall apply any such amounts
toward the purchase of additional assets on behalf of the Issuer;

Investments but only until the next Payment Date, when they shall
be distributed.

(or cause to be discharged) all of its responsibilities
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents and to administer the Issuer in the interest of the
Certificateholders, subject to Transaction Documents, and in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Owner Trustee shall be deemed to have discharged
its duties and responsibilities hereunder and under the Transaction
Documents to the extent the Administrator has agreed in the
Administration Agreement to perform any act or to discharge any
duty of the Issuer or the Owner Trustee hereunder or under any
Transaction Document, and the Owner Trustee shall not be liable for
the default or failure of the Administrator to carry out its
obligations under the Administration Agreement and shall have no
duty to monitor the performance of the Administrator or any other
Person under the Administration Agreement or any other document.

SECTION 6.3 Action upon
Instruction . (a) Subject to Article IV , and in

time by written instruction of the Certificateholders pursuant to
Article IV .

(b) Subject to
Section 7.1 , the Owner Trustee shall not be required
to take any action hereunder or under any Transaction Document if
the Owner Trustee shall have reasonably determined or been advised
by counsel that such action is likely to result in liability on the
part of the Owner Trustee or is contrary to the terms hereof or of
any Transaction Document or is otherwise contrary to
law.

(c) Whenever the Owner Trustee is
unable to decide between alternative courses of action permitted or
required by the terms of this Agreement or any Transaction Document
or is unsure as to the application of any provision of this
Agreement or any Transaction Document or any such provision is
ambiguous as to its application, or is, or appears to be, in
conflict with any other applicable provision, or in the event that
this Agreement permits any determination by the Owner Trustee or is
silent or is incomplete as to the course of action that the Owner
Trustee is required to take with respect to a particular set of
facts, the Owner Trustee shall promptly give notice (in such form
as shall be appropriate under the circumstances) to the
Certificateholders requesting instruction as to the course of
action to be adopted or application of such provision, and to the
extent the Owner Trustee acts or refrains from acting in good faith
in accordance with any written instruction of the Majority
Certificateholders (or, if specifically required, all
Certificateholders) received, the Owner Trustee shall not be liable
on account of such action or inaction to any Person. If the Owner
Trustee shall not have received appropriate instruction within ten
days of such notice (or within

(2013-A)







such shorter period of time as
reasonably may be specified in such notice or may be necessary
under the circumstances) it may, but shall be under no duty to,
take or refrain from taking such action, not inconsistent with this
Agreement or the Transaction Documents, as it shall deem to be in
the best interests of the Certificateholders, and shall have no
liability to any Person for such action or inaction.

(d) The Owner Trustee shall be under
no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it
by this Agreement, or to institute, conduct or defend any
litigation, at the request, order or direction of any
Certificateholder or any other Person, unless such
Certificateholder or such Person has offered to the Owner Trustee
security or indemnity satisfactory to it against the costs,
expenses and liabilities that may be incurred by the Owner Trustee
(including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and expenses of
its counsel) therein or thereby, including such advances as the
Owner Trustee shall reasonably request.

the conditions set forth in this Agreement, FTH LLC does hereby

Exhibit A (“ Assignment ”) delivered
on the Closing Date and (b) the Receivables Sale Agreement
(the “ Purchased Assets ”). The sale, transfer,

with the Receivables or the other assets and properties conveyed
hereunder or any agreement, document or instrument related

amount agreed to between FTH LLC and the Purchaser, and, to the
extent not paid in cash by the Purchaser, shall be paid by a
capital contribution by FTH LLC in an undivided interest in such
Purchased Assets that increases its equity interest in the
Purchaser in an amount equal to the excess of the estimated fair
market value of the Purchased Assets over the amount of cash paid

Purchase Agreement
(2014-2)







SECTION 3.2 Representations and
Warranties of FTH LLC as to each Receivable . FTH LLC hereby
makes the representations and warranties set forth on Schedule
I as to the Receivables sold, contributed, transferred,
assigned, set over and otherwise conveyed to the Purchaser under
this Agreement on which such representations and warranties the
Purchaser relies in acquiring the Receivables. Such representations
and warranties shall survive the conveyance of the Receivables to
the Issuer under the Sale Agreement and the Grant of the
Receivables by the Issuer to the Indenture Trustee pursuant to the
Indenture. Notwithstanding any statement to the contrary contained
herein or in any other Transaction Document, FTH LLC shall not be
required to notify any insurer with respect to any Insurance Policy
obtained by an Obligor or to notify any Dealer about any aspect of
the transaction contemplated by the Transaction
Documents.

SECTION 3.3 Repurchase upon
Breach . Upon discovery by or notice to the Purchaser or FTH
LLC of a breach of any of the representations and warranties set
forth in Section 3.2 with respect to any Receivable at
the time such representations and warranties were made which
materially and adversely affects the interests of the Issuer or the
Noteholders, the party discovering such breach or receiving such
notice shall give prompt written notice thereof to the other party;
provided , that delivery of a Servicer’s Certificate
which identifies the Receivables that are being or have been
repurchased shall be deemed to constitute prompt notice of such
breach; provided , further , that the failure to give
such notice shall not affect any obligation of FTH LLC hereunder.
If the breach materially and adversely affects the interests of the
Issuer or the Noteholders, then FTH LLC shall either
(a) correct or cure such breach or (b) repurchase such
Receivable from the Purchaser, in either case on or before the
Payment Date following the end of the Collection Period which
includes the sixtieth (60 th ) day (or, if FTH LLC elects, an earlier
date) after the date that FTH LLC became aware or was notified of
such breach. Any such breach or failure will be deemed not to have
a material and adverse effect if such breach or failure does not
affect the ability of the Purchaser (or its assignee) to receive
and retain timely payment in full on such Receivable. Any such
purchase by FTH LLC shall be at a price equal to the Repurchase
Price. In consideration for such repurchase, FTH LLC shall make (or
shall cause to be made) a payment to the Purchaser equal to the
Repurchase Price by depositing such amount into the Collection
Account prior to 11:00 a.m., New York City time on the date of such
repurchase, if such repurchase date is not a Payment Date or, if
such repurchase date is a Payment Date, then prior to the close of
business on the Business Day prior to such repurchase date. Upon
payment of such Repurchase Price by FTH LLC, the Purchaser shall
release and shall execute and deliver such instruments of release,
transfer or assignment, in each case without recourse or
representation, as may be reasonably requested by FTH LLC to
evidence such release, transfer or assignment or more effectively
vest in FTH LLC or its designee any Receivable and the related
Purchased Assets repurchased pursuant hereto. It is understood and
agreed that the obligation of FTH LLC to purchase any
Receivable as described above shall constitute the sole remedy
respecting such breach available to the Purchaser.

SECTION 3.4 Protection of
Title .

(a) FTH LLC shall authorize and file
such financing statements and cause to be authorized and filed such
continuation and other statements, all in such manner and in such
places as may be required by law fully to preserve, maintain and
protect the interest of the Purchaser under this Agreement in the
Receivables (other than any Related Security with
respect

Purchaser therein cannot be perfected by the filing of a financing
statement). FTH LLC shall deliver (or cause to be delivered) to the
Purchaser file-stamped copies of, or filing receipts for, any
document filed as provided above, as soon as available following

(iii) any change in FTH LLC’s name and shall have taken
all action prior to making such change (or shall have made
arrangements to take such action substantially simultaneously with
such change, if it is not practicable to take such action in
advance) reasonably necessary or advisable in the opinion of the
Purchaser to amend all previously filed financing statements or
continuation statements described in paragraph (a)
 above. FTH LLC will at all times maintain its
“location” within the United States.

(c) FTH LLC shall maintain (or shall
cause the Servicer to maintain) its computer systems so that, from
time to time after the conveyance under this Agreement of the
Receivables, the master computer records (including any backup
archives) that refer to a Receivable shall indicate clearly the
interest of the Purchaser (or any subsequent assignee of the
Purchaser) in such Receivable and that such Receivable is owned by
such Person. Indication of such Person’s interest in a
Receivable shall not be deleted from or modified on such computer
systems until, and only until, the related Receivable shall have
been paid in full or repurchased.

(d) If at any time FTH LLC shall
propose to sell, grant a security interest in or otherwise transfer
any interest in motor vehicle receivables to any prospective
purchaser, lender or other transferee, FTH LLC shall give to such
prospective purchaser, lender or other transferee computer tapes,
records or printouts (including any restored from backup archives)
that, if they shall refer in any manner whatsoever to any
Receivable, shall indicate clearly that such Receivable has been
sold and is owned by the Purchaser (or any subsequent assignee of
the Purchaser).

SECTION 3.5 Other Liens or
Interests . Except for the conveyances and grants of security
interests pursuant to this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents, FTH LLC shall not sell, pledge, assign or transfer the
Receivables or other property transferred to the Purchaser to any
other Person, or grant, create, incur, assume or suffer to exist
any Lien (other than Permitted Liens) on any interest therein, and
FTH LLC shall defend the right, title and interest of the Purchaser
in, to and under such Receivables or other property transferred to
the Purchaser against all claims of third parties claiming through
or under FTH LLC.

SECTION 3.6 Perfection
Representations, Warranties and Covenants . FTH LLC hereby
makes the perfection representations, warranties and covenants set

transfer its business and assets as a whole or substantially as a
whole, (ii) resulting from any merger, sale, transfer,

anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if FTH LLC enters into any of the foregoing
transactions and is not the surviving entity, FTH LLC will deliver
to the Indenture Trustee an Opinion of Counsel either

thereto have been executed and filed that are necessary to preserve
and protect the interest of the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee,
respectively, in the Receivables, or (B) stating that, in the
opinion of such counsel, no such action is necessary to preserve

MISCELLANEOUS

	Auto Trust 2008-1 (the Issuer) to transfer $201,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 2.73023% Auto Loan Asset Backed Class A-1 Notes (the 

	, and together with the Class A-1 Notes, the Class A-2-A Notes, the
	Class A-2-B Notes, the Class A-3-A Notes and the Class A-4-B Notes, the 

	Class A Notes

	) to the several underwriters set forth on








	Schedule I

	(each, an 

	Underwriter

	 and collectively, the 

	Underwriters

	), for whom you are acting as representatives
	(the 

	Representatives

	). The Issuer will also issue an additional $33,000000 aggregate principal amount of Class A-4-A Notes (the Retained Class A-4-A Notes), $20,925,000 aggregate principal amount of 5.51%

	Notes

	). The Retained Class A-4-A Notes, the Class B
	Notes, the Class C Notes and the Class D Notes initially will be retained by the Depositor. The Notes will be issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of March 31, 2008 (as amended, supplemented or modified from time to time, the
	

	Indenture

	), between the Issuer and The Bank of New York, as indenture trustee (in such capacity, the 

	Indenture Trustee

	). The Notes will be secured by the assets of the Issuer. The assets of the Issuer include,
	among other things, motor vehicle retail installment sale contracts or installment loans secured by a combination of new or used automobiles or light-duty trucks (the 

	Receivables

	) and certain related rights. The Receivables will
	be sold to the Issuer by the Depositor and will be serviced for the Issuer by Fifth Third Bank, an Ohio banking corporation (the 

	Ohio Bank

	), as servicer (in such capacity, the 

	Servicer

	).




	Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in

	Appendix A

	to the Sale and Servicing
	Agreement, dated as of March 31, 2008 (as amended, supplemented or modified from time to time, the 

	Sale and Servicing Agreement

	), among the Servicer, the Issuer, the Depositor and the Indenture Trustee. Pursuant to Rule
	15c6-1(d) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 

	Exchange Act

	), the Underwriters, the Depositor, and the Ohio Bank hereby agree that the 

	Closing Date

	 shall be March 31, 2008, 10:00 a.m.,
	New York City time (or at such other place and time on the same or other date as shall be agreed to in writing by the Representatives and the Depositor).




	The Depositor has prepared and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 

	Commission

	) in accordance with the provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and
	regulations of the Commission thereunder (collectively, the 

	Securities Act

	), a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (having the registration number 333-144316), including a form of prospectus, relating to the Notes. The
	registration statement as amended has been declared effective by the Commission not more than three years prior to the Closing Date or, the Depositor has prepared and filed (before the expiration of such three year period) with the Commission in
	accordance with the provisions of the Securities Act, a new shelf registration statement on Form S-3 and such new registration statement includes unsold securities covered by the earlier registration statement, which such unsold securities may
	continue to be offered and sold until the earlier of the effective date of the new registration statement or 180 days after the third anniversary of the initial effective date of the prior registration statement, as permitted pursuant to paragraph
	(a)(5) of Rule 415 of the Securities Act. If any post-effective amendment has been filed with respect thereto, prior to the execution and delivery of this Underwriting Agreement (this 

	Agreement

	), the most recent such amendment is
	effective upon filing with the Commission pursuant to Rule 462 of the Securities Act or has been declared effective by the Commission. Such registration statement, as amended at the time of effectiveness, including all material incorporated by
	reference therein and including all information (if any) deemed to be




	 




	2







	part of the registration statement at the time of effectiveness pursuant to Rule 430B under the Securities Act, is referred to in this Agreement as the
	

	Registration Statement

	. The Depositor proposes to file with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act (

	Rule 424(b)

	) a supplement (the 

	Prospectus Supplement

	) to the
	prospectus included in the Registration Statement (such prospectus, in the form it appears in the Registration Statement or in the form most recently revised and filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) is hereinafter referred to as the
	

	Base Prospectus

	) relating to the Notes and the method of distribution thereof. The Base Prospectus and the Prospectus Supplement, together with any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, is hereinafter referred to as the
	

	Prospectus

	.




	Prior to 1:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) (U.S.) on March 26, 2008 (i.e., the date and time
	the first Contract of Sale (as defined below) for the Notes (the 

	Time of Sale

	) was entered into as designated by the Representatives), the Depositor had prepared a preliminary prospectus, dated March 26, 2008 (subject to
	completion). As used herein, 

	Preliminary Prospectus

	 means, with respect to any date or time referred to herein, the most recent preliminary Prospectus (as amended or supplemented, if applicable), which has been prepared and
	delivered by the Depositor to the Underwriters in accordance with the provisions hereof.




	Pursuant to this Agreement, and
	subject to the terms hereof, the Depositor agrees to sell to the Underwriters, the respective principal amount of each class of Class A Notes set forth opposite the name of such Underwriter on

	Schedule I

	.

	. Each of the Depositor and the Ohio Bank severally represents and warrants (as to
	itself) to the Underwriters, as of the date hereof (unless specified otherwise) and as of the Closing Date, as follows:




	(a) (i) The Depositor has prepared and filed the Registration Statement with the Commission in accordance with the provisions of the Securities Act, including a form of prospectus, relating to the Notes. The registration statement as
	amended has been declared effective by the Commission. The conditions to the use of a registration statement on Form S-3 under the Securities Act, as set forth in the General Instructions to Form S-3, and the conditions of Rule 415 under the
	Securities Act, have been satisfied with respect to the Registration Statement. No stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued, and no proceeding for that purpose has been instituted or threatened by the
	Commission.




	(ii) On the most recent effective date of the Registration Statement, the Registration
	Statement conformed in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, and did not include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
	the statements therein not misleading and, on the Closing Date, the Registration Statement and, on the date hereof and on the Closing Date, the Prospectus will conform in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act,
	and (x) the Registration Statement will not include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and (y) the Prospectus
	and the Designated Static Pool Information (as defined below), taken together, will not contain any untrue statement of a material

	fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
	they were made, not misleading;

	provided

	,

	however

	, that the foregoing does not apply to (I) that part of the Registration Statement which constitutes the Statements of Eligibility of Qualification (Form T-1) of the Indenture
	Trustee or other indenture trustees under the Trust Indenture Act or (II) Underwriter Information (as defined in

	Section 9(b)

	hereof). As used herein the term 

	Designated Static Pool Information

	 shall mean the static
	pool information referred to in the Preliminary Prospectus, including the static pool information set forth in

	Appendix A

	 

	Static Pool Information Regarding Certain Previous Receivables Pools

	 but deemed to be excluded
	from the Registration Statement and Prospectus pursuant to Item 1105(d) of Regulation AB.




	(iii) The
	Preliminary Prospectus and the Designated Static Pool Information, taken together at the Time of Sale did not, and at the Closing Date will not, include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
	therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (it being understood that no representation or warranty is made with respect to the omission of pricing and price-dependent
	information, which information shall of necessity appear only in the final Prospectus);

	provided

	,

	however

	, that this representation and warranty shall not apply to any statements or omissions made in reliance upon and in conformity
	with information contained in or omitted from the Preliminary Prospectus based upon Underwriter Information (as defined in

	Section 9(b)

	hereof).




	(iv) Other than the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus, the Issuer (including its agents and representatives other than the Underwriters in their capacity as such) has not made, used,
	prepared, authorized, approved or referred to and will not prepare, make, use, authorize, approve or refer to any written communication, including any free writing prospectus (both as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities
	Act), that constitutes an offer to sell or solicitation of any offer to buy the Notes.




	(b) The documents incorporated by
	reference in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto (other than documents filed by Persons other than the Depositor), when they became or become effective under the Securities
	Act or were or are filed with the Commission under the Exchange Act, as the case may be, conformed or will conform in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations
	of the Commission thereunder.




	(c) As of the Closing Date and as of the date hereof, each of the Depositors and
	Issuers representations and warranties in the Transaction Documents will be true and correct.




	(d) The execution,

	contemplated hereby and thereby, have been duly authorized by all necessary limited liability

	company or corporate action on the part of the Depositor or the Ohio Bank, respectively. Neither the execution and delivery by the Depositor or the Ohio
	Bank, as applicable, of such instruments, nor the performance by the Depositor or the Ohio Bank, respectively, of the transactions herein or therein contemplated, nor the compliance by the Depositor or the Ohio Bank, as applicable, with the
	provisions hereof or thereof, will (i) conflict with or result in a breach of any of the terms and provisions of, or constitute a default under, any of the provisions of the limited liability company agreement, certificate of formation,
	articles of incorporation or by-laws, as applicable, of such entity, (ii) result in a material conflict with any of the provisions of any judgment, decree or order binding on the Depositor or the Ohio Bank, as applicable, or its properties,
	(iii) conflict with any of the provisions of any material indenture, mortgage, agreement, contract or other instrument to which the Depositor or the Ohio Bank, as applicable, is a party or by which it is bound, (iv) conflict with,
	contravene or constitute a violation of any law, statute, ordinance, rule or regulation to which it is subject, or (v) result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any of the Depositors or the Ohio
	Banks, as applicable, property pursuant to the terms of any such indenture, mortgage, contract or other instrument.




	(e) The Depositor or the Ohio Bank, as applicable, has duly executed and delivered this Underwriting Agreement and, as of the Closing Date, will have duly executed and delivered each Transaction Document to which it is a party. When
	executed and delivered by the parties thereto, each of the Indenture and each Transaction Document to which the Depositor or the Ohio Bank is a party will constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Depositor or the Ohio Bank, as
	applicable, enforceable against such entity in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that the enforceability thereof may be subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, conservatorship, moratorium or other similar laws
	now or hereafter in effect relating to creditors rights in general and to general principles of equity. All approvals, authorizations, consents, filings, orders or other actions of any person, corporation or other organization, or of any
	court, governmental agency or body or official (except with respect to the securities laws of any foreign jurisdiction or the state securities or Blue Sky laws of various jurisdictions), required in connection with the valid and proper
	authorization, issuance and sale of the Notes pursuant to this Underwriting Agreement and the Indenture have been or will be taken or obtained on or before the Closing Date.




	(f) The Notes, when validly issued pursuant to the Indenture and sold to the Underwriters pursuant to this Underwriting Agreement, will conform in all material respects to the descriptions
	thereof contained in the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus and will be validly issued and entitled to the benefits and security afforded by the Indenture. As of the Closing Date, the Issuers pledge of the Receivables to the Indenture
	Trustee pursuant to the Indenture will vest in the Indenture Trustee, for the benefit of the Noteholders and the Swap Counterparty, a perfected security interest therein, subject to no prior lien, mortgage security interest, pledge, adverse claim,
	charge or other encumbrance, except as may be permitted by the terms of the Transaction Documents.




	(g) Neither the
	Depositor nor the Ohio Bank nor anyone acting on their behalf has taken any action that would require registration of the Depositor or the Issuer under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 

	Investment Company Act

	);
	nor will the




	 




	5







	Depositor or the Ohio Bank act, nor has either of them authorized nor will either of them authorize any person to act, in such manner.




	(h) There are no actions, suits or proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of the Depositor or the Ohio Bank, threatened against the
	Depositor or the Ohio Bank before or by any governmental authority that (i) assert the invalidity or unenforceability of this Underwriting Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents, (ii) seek to prevent the issuance or sale of
	the Notes or the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this Underwriting Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents, (iii) seek any determination or ruling that would materially and adversely affect the performance by
	the Depositor or the Ohio Bank of its obligations under this Underwriting Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents or the collectibility or enforceability of the Receivables, (iv) relate to the Depositor or the Ohio Bank that would
	materially and adversely affect the federal or applicable state income, excise, franchise or similar tax attributes of the Notes or (v) could reasonably have a material adverse effect on the Noteholders.




	(i) As of the Closing Date and as of the date hereof, the Ohio Banks representations and warranties in the Transaction Documents
	(other than the representations and warranties concerning the characteristics of the Receivables which representations and warranties will be true and correct in all material respects as of the date set forth in the applicable Transaction Document)
	will be true and correct.




	(j) The Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (the
	

	Trust Indenture Act

	), as amended.




	(k) Since December 31, 2007, there has not occurred any material
	adverse change, or any development involving a prospective material adverse change, in or affecting the condition, financial or otherwise, earnings, business or operations of the Depositor or the Ohio Bank and their respective subsidiaries, taken as
	a whole, except as disclosed to you in writing prior to the date hereof.




	(l) The Depositor acknowledges that in connection
	with the offering of the Notes: (1) the Underwriters have acted at arms length, are not agents of, and owe no fiduciary duties to, the Depositor or any other person, (2) the Underwriters owe the Depositor only those duties and
	obligations set forth in this Agreement and (3) the Underwriters may have interests that differ from those of the Depositor. The Depositor waives to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law any claims it may have against the Underwriters
	arising from an alleged breach of fiduciary duty in connection with the offer of the Notes.




	(m) As of the Closing Date,
	there are no contracts or documents that are required to be filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement that have not been so filed.




	(n) The Depositor was not, on the date on which the first bona fide offer of the Notes sold pursuant to this Agreement was made, an ineligible issuer as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act.




	 




	6







	(o) As of the Closing Date, the Transaction Documents will conform in all material
	respects to the description thereof contained in the Registration Statement, the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus, as then amended and supplemented.

	(a) If not already
	effective, the Depositor will use its best efforts to cause the Registration Statement, and any amendment thereto, to become effective. If the Registration Statement has become or becomes effective pursuant to Rule 430A, or filing of the

	order.




	(c) If, during the period in which the Prospectus is required by federal securities law or regulation to be
	delivered in connection with sales by any Underwriter or dealer, any event occurs as a result of which the Prospectus, as then amended or supplemented, would include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary

	qualify the Notes for offer and sale under the securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as you reasonably shall request, and will maintain all such qualifications for so long as required for the distribution of the Notes and, thereafter, to
	the extent required by such jurisdictions;

	provided

	, that in connection therewith the Depositor and the Ohio Bank shall not be required to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not now so qualified or to take any action which
	would subject it to general or unlimited service of process in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject.




	(g) From
	the date hereof until the retirement of the Notes, or until none of the Underwriters maintains a secondary market in the Notes, whichever occurs first, the Depositor will deliver to each of the Underwriters, through the Representatives, the annual

	Documents.




	(j) To the extent, if any, that any of the ratings assigned to the Notes by any of the rating agencies that
	initially rate the Notes are conditional upon the furnishing of documents or the taking of any other actions by the Depositor or the Ohio Bank, as the case may be, the relevant party shall furnish, or cause to be furnished, such documents and take
	any such other actions as promptly as possible.

	party

	) promptly shall notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought (the 

	indemnifying party

	) in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified party, shall retain counsel reasonably
	satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party and any others the indemnifying party may designate in such proceedings and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such
	proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless: (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified party agree on
	the retention of such counsel at the indemnifying partys expense, (ii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time
	after notice of commencement of the action or (iii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both parties by the same counsel
	would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in respect of the legal expenses of any indemnified party in connection with any proceeding or related
	proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed promptly as they are
	incurred. Such counsel shall be designated in writing by the Depositor, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to

	subsection (a)

	, and by the Representatives, in the case of parties indemnified pursuant to

	subsection (b)

	 and

	(c)

	. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled




	 




	16







	with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party from and against any
	loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified
	party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the
	subject matter of such proceeding and (ii) does not include any statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of such indemnified party.




	(e) If the indemnification provided for in this Section is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under

	subsection (a)

	,

	(b)

	 or

	(c)

	, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses,
	claims, damages or liabilities referred to in

	subsection (a)

	,

	(b)

	 or

	(c)

	: (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Depositor, the Ohio Bank, the Issuer and their
	affiliates on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Notes, or (ii) if the allocation provided by

	clause (i)

	is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not
	only the relative benefits referred to in

	clause (i)

	but also the relative fault of the Depositor, the Ohio Bank, the Issuer and their affiliates on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the statements or
	omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Depositor, the Ohio Bank, the Issuer and their affiliates on the one hand and the
	Underwriters on the other in connection with the offering of the Notes shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses other than underwriting discounts and commissions received by
	the Underwriters) received by the Depositor, the Ohio Bank, the Issuer and their affiliates bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other
	things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Depositor, the Ohio Bank, the Issuer or their affiliates or by any
	Underwriter, and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The Underwriters respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section are
	several in proportion to the respective principal amounts of Notes they have purchased hereunder, and not joint.




	(f) The
	parties hereto agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation
	that does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the preceding paragraph
	shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the other
	provisions of this Section, no Underwriter (except as may be provided in the agreement among Underwriters relating to the offering of the Notes) shall be required to contribute any amount in




	 




	17







	excess of the amount by which the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriter exceed the amount of any damages that such
	Underwriter otherwise has been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act)
	shall be entitled to contribution or indemnity from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this Section are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies that otherwise may be
	available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.




	SECTION 10.


	Defaults by an Underwriter


	. If any one
	or more Underwriter(s) fail(s) to purchase and pay for any of the Notes agreed to be purchased by such Underwriter(s) hereunder, and such failure constitutes a default in the performance of its or their obligations under this Agreement, the
	remaining Underwriter(s) shall be obligated severally to take up and pay for (in the respective proportions that the amount of Notes set forth opposite their names in

	Schedule I

	bears to the aggregate amount of Notes set forth opposite
	the names of all the remaining Underwriter(s)) the Notes that the defaulting Underwriter(s) agreed but failed to purchase;

	provided, however

	, that if the aggregate amount of Notes that the defaulting Underwriter(s) agreed but failed to
	purchase exceeds 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes, the remaining Underwriter(s) shall have the right to purchase all, but shall not be under any obligation to purchase any, of the Notes, and if such nondefaulting Underwriter(s) do not
	purchase all the Notes, this Agreement will terminate without liability to any nondefaulting Underwriter. In the event of a default by any Underwriter as set forth in this Section, the Closing Date shall be postponed for such period, not exceeding
	seven days, as the remaining Underwriter(s) shall determine in order that the required changes in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements may be effected. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall
	relieve any defaulting Underwriter(s) of any liability to the Depositor, the Ohio Bank, their affiliates or any nondefaulting Underwriter(s) for damages occasioned by its default hereunder.




	SECTION 11.


	Offering Communications


	. Other than the Preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus, each Underwriter severally
	represents, warrants and agrees with the Ohio Bank and the Depositor that it has not made, used, prepared, authorized, approved or referred to and will not prepare, make, use, authorize, approve or refer to any written communication (as
	defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) that constitutes an offer to sell or solicitation of an offer to buy the Notes, including, but not limited to any ABS informational and computational materials as defined in Item 1101(a)
	of Regulation AB under the Securities Act unless such Underwriter has obtained the prior written approval of the Ohio Bank and the Depositor;

	provided

	,

	however

	, each Underwriter may prepare and convey to one or more of its potential
	investors without the consent of the Ohio Bank, the Depositor or any of their respective affiliates one or more written communications (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) in the form of (i) an Intex CDI file that does
	not contain any Issuer Information (as defined below) other than Issuer Information included in the Preliminary Prospectus previously filed with the Commission or (ii) other written communication containing no more than the following:
	information contemplated by Rule 134 under the Securities Act and included or to be included in the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, as well as a column or other entry showing the status of the subscriptions for the Notes and/or expected
	pricing parameters of the Notes (each




	 




	18







	such written communication, an 

	Underwriter Free Writing Prospectus

	). As used herein, the term 

	Issuer Information

	 means
	any information of the type specified in clauses (1)  (5) of footnote 271 of Commission Release No. 33-8591 (Securities Offering Reform), other than Underwriter Derived Information. As used herein, the term 

	Underwriter
	Derived Information

	 shall refer to information of the type described in clause (5) of footnote 271 of Commission Release No. 33-8591 (Securities Offering Reform) when prepared by any Underwriter, including traditional
	computational and analytical materials prepared by the Underwriter.




	(a) Each Underwriter severally represents, warrants
	and agrees with the Ohio Bank and the Depositor that:




	(i) each Underwriter Free Writing Prospectus prepared
	by it will not, as of the date such Underwriter Free Writing Prospectus was conveyed or delivered to any prospective purchaser of Notes, include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit any material fact necessary to make the statements
	contained therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;

	provided

	,

	however

	, that no Underwriter makes such representation, warranty or agreement to the extent such untrue statements or omissions were
	made in reliance upon and in conformity with information contained in the Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus or any written information furnished to the related Underwriter by the Ohio Bank or the Depositor specifically for use therein which
	information was not corrected by information subsequently provided by the Ohio Bank or the Depositor to the related Underwriter prior to the time of use of such Underwriter Free Writing Prospectus;




	(ii) each Underwriter Free Writing Prospectus prepared by it shall contain a legend substantially in the form of and in
	compliance with Rule 433(c)(2)(i) of the Securities Act, and shall otherwise conform to any requirements for free writing prospectuses under the Securities Act;




	(iii) each Underwriter Free Writing Prospectus prepared by it shall be delivered to the Ohio Bank and the Depositor no
	later than the time of first use (which shall be no earlier than the date of the first use of the Preliminary Prospectus);

	provided

	,

	however

	, if the date of first use is not a Business Day, such delivery shall occur no later than 5:00
	p.m. (Eastern Time) on the first Business Day preceding such date of first use;




	(iv) none of the
	information in any Underwriter Free Writing Prospectus will conflict with the information then contained in the Registration Statement or any prospectus or prospectus supplement that is a part thereof;




	(v) such Underwriter has in place, and covenants that it shall maintain, internal controls and procedures which it
	reasonably believes to be sufficient to ensure full compliance with all applicable legal requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the generation and use of Underwriter Free Writing Prospectuses in
	connection with the offering of the Notes. In addition, such Underwriter shall, for a period of at least three years after the date hereof, maintain written and/or electronic records of the following:




	 




	19







	a. any Underwriter Free Writing Prospectus used by such Underwriter to
	solicit offers to purchase Notes to the extent not filed with the Commission;




	b. regarding each Underwriter
	Free Writing Prospectus delivered by such Underwriter to an investor, the date of such delivery and identity of such investor; and




	c. regarding each Contract of Sale entered into by such Underwriter, the date, identity of the investor and the terms of such Contract of Sale, as set forth in the related confirmation of trade; and




	(vi) such Underwriter shall file any Underwriter Free Writing Prospectus that has been distributed by such Underwriter in
	a manner reasonably designed to lead to its broad, unrestricted dissemination within the later of two business days after such Underwriter first provides this information to investors and the date upon which the Depositor is required to file the
	Prospectus Supplement with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3) of the Securities Act or otherwise as required under Rule 433 of the Securities Act;

	provided

	,

	however

	, that such Underwriter shall not be required to file any
	Underwriter Free Writing Prospectus to the extent such Underwriter Free Writing Prospectus includes information in a free writing prospectus, Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus previously filed with the Commission or that does not
	contain substantive changes from or additions to a free writing prospectus previously filed with the Commission.




	SECTION 12.


	No Bankruptcy Petition


	. Each Underwriter covenants and agrees that, before the date that is one year and one day after the payment in full of all notes issued by the Issuer or any other common law or statutory
	trust, limited liability company or limited partnership formed by the Depositor in connection with the issuance of securities, it will not institute against, or join any other person in instituting against, the Depositor, the Issuer or any other
	such trust, limited liability company or limited partnership any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation proceedings or other proceedings under any Federal or state bankruptcy or similar law.




	SECTION 13.


	Survival of Representations and Obligations


	. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations,
	warranties and other statements set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement or contained in certificates of officers submitted pursuant hereto shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation or statement as
	to the results thereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Notes. If for any reason the purchase of the Notes by the Underwriters is not consummated, the Depositor shall remain responsible for the expenses to be paid or reimbursed
	pursuant to Section 6 and the obligations pursuant to Section 9 shall remain in effect. If for any reason the purchase of the Notes by the Underwriters is not consummated, other than termination of this Agreement pursuant to
	Section 10, the Depositor will reimburse the Underwriters severally, upon demand, for all out-of-pocket expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel) incurred by any Underwriter in connection with the offering of the Notes.
