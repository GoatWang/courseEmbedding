					Full Description



Radisys Corporation (Radisys), incorporated on March 18, 1987, is a services acceleration company. The Company's application aware traffic distribution platforms, real-time media processing products and wireless access technologies enable service providers to virtualize and monetize their networks. The Company's products and services are organized into two segments: Software-Systems, and Embedded Products and Hardware Services.Software-SystemsThe Company's Software-Systems segment consists of three product families: FlowEngine, MediaEngine and CellEngine. Also included in the Software-Systems segment is its Professional Service organization. FlowEngine focuses on the communication and content provider traffic management market. FlowEngine is a family of products designed to classify and distribute session data flows to network processing resources. FlowEngine products enable communication and content service providers to transition towards network functions virtualization (NFV) architectures by integrating a targeted subset of edge routing, data center switching, and load balancing functionality along with software-defined networking (SDN) control.The Company's MediaEngine products are designed into the Internet Protocol (IP) multimedia subsystem (IMS) core of telecom networks and provide the necessary media processing capabilities required for applications, such as audio conferencing, Voice over Long-Term Evolution (VoLTE), Voice over wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi) (VoWifi), Rich Communications Services (RCS) and Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC). The Company sells a complete high-density system, the MediaEngine MPX-12000, as well as a virtualized software-only virtualized MediaEngine software (vMRF) when its customers choose other lower-density processing platforms. The Company's MediaEngine provides the media processing capability that enables service providers to deliver audio, video or other multimedia services over their all-IP networks.The Company's CellEngine software, which includes its TotalENodeB LTE and Femtotality third-generation (3G) software products, provides the communication linkage between wireless end user devices and mobile core networks through small cell base stations that mobile carriers are deploying to optimize wireless network spectrum utilization and coverage. Its focus is providing software applications, which enable small 3G and LTE operator-controlled, low-power wireless base stations (known as small cells, femtocells, enterprise femtocells and picocells) that enable cellular coverage and provide capacity for homes and enterprises, as well as metropolitan and rural areas.Embedded Products and Hardware ServicesThe Company's Embedded Products and Hardware Services segment provides customers with hardware based products targeted at the communications and healthcare markets. Products within this segment fall under primary categories, including T-Series Advanced Telecommunications Computing Architecture (ATCA) Platforms, Component Object Model (COM) Express and Rackmount Servers, and Other Products. Its segment's products are predominantly hardware-based products that enable the control and movement of data in both 3G and LTE telecom networks. Its products enable network elements for applications, such as Deep Packet Inspection (DPI), policy management and intelligent gateways (security, femto and LTE gateways).The Company's T-Series ATCA product family includes a suite of fully integrated, application ready, software-rich hardware products that are ATCA-based and modular in nature and enable configuration for a range of applications. Based on the standard ATCA form factor, the T-Series ATCA platforms integrate various key products and applications to enable functions within the wireless network core. Its products consist of carrier blades, chassis, disk modules, line cards, and processing and switch modules. The COM Express and Rackmount Servers are targeted primarily at the medical imaging, test and measurement, and aerospace and defense markets. The Company has two primary product families in this category, which include Computer-on-Module Express and Rack Mount Servers. Its Other products comprise of products that are primarily custom built pre-ATCA-based telecommunication products based on earlier technology standards.The Company competes with Corsa, Noviflow, Dialogic, Dolby, Compunetix, HP, Nokia Solutions and Networks, Aricent Group, NodeH, Artesyn Embedded Technologies, Advantech Co, ADLink Technologies and Kontron AG.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

History[edit]
RadiSys was founded in 1987 as Radix Microsystems in Beaverton, Oregon, by former Intel engineers Dave Budde and Glen Myers.[3][4][5] The first investors were employees who put up $50,000 each, with Tektronix later investing additional funds into the company.[5] Originally located in space leased from Sequent Computer Systems, by 1994 the company had grown to annual sales of $20 million.[6] The company's products were computers used in end products such as automated teller machines to paint mixers.[5] On October 20, 1995, the company became a publicly traded company when it held an initial public offering (IPO).[7] The IPO raised $19.6 million for RadiSys after selling 2.7 million shares at $12 per share.[7]
In 1996, the company moved it headquarters to a new campus in Hillsboro, and at that time sales reached $80 million and the company had a profit of $9.6 million that year with 175 employees.[5][8] Company co-founder Dave Budde left the company in 1997, with company revenues at $81 million annually at that time.[9] The company grew in part by acquisitions such as Sonitech International in 1997,[10] part of IBM's Open Computing Platform unit[11] and Texas Micro in 1999,[12] all of S-Link in 2001,[13] and Microware also in 2001.[14] RadiSys also moved some production to China in order to take advantage of the lower manufacturing costs.[15]
In 2002, the company had grown to annual revenues of $200 million, and posted a profit in the fourth quarter for the first time in several quarters.[16] That year Scott Grout was named as chief executive officer of the company and C. Scott Gibson became the chairman of the board,[17] both replacing Glen Myers who co-founded the company.[18] The company sold off its signaling gateway line in 2003.[19]
They raised $97 million through selling convertible senior notes in November 2003.[20] In 2004, the company stopped granting stock options to employees and transitioned to giving restricted shares for some compensation.[21] RadiSys grew to annual revenues of $320 million by 2005.[22] The company continued to grow through acquisitions such as a $105 million deal that added Convedia Corp. in 2006.[23][24] RadiSys continued buying assets when it purchased part of Intel's communications business for about $30 million in 2007.[25] After five-straight quarterly losses, the company posted a profit of $481,000 in their 2009 fourth quarter.[26]
In May 2011, the company announced they were buying Continuous Computing for $105 million in stock and cash.[27] Once the transaction was completed in July 2011, Continuous' CEO Mike Dagenais became the CEO of RadiSys.[27][28][29] Dagenais left the company in October 2012 with former CFO Brian Bronson taking over as CEO.[28]
Operations[edit]

The company's headquarters are located in the Dawson Creek Industrial Park adjacent to the headquarters of FEI Company in Hillsboro, Oregon, within the Portland metropolitan area. Radisys in 2015 had approximately 700 employees located in offices in the United States (Oregon), India ([Bangalore]), China (Shenzhen), and Canada (Burnaby, BC).[1] Overall, the company only builds about 15 percent of their products, with the remainder outsourced to other companies.[1]
Products[edit]
Radisys supports two markets: communications networking and commercial systems.[1] The latter makes products for use in the testing, medical imaging, defense, and industrial automation fields.[1] For example, end-products that Radisys' is a supplier to original equipment manufacturers include items such as MRI scanners, ultrasound equipment, logic analyzers, and items used in semiconductor manufacturing.[1] Communications networking equipment includes those for wireless communications, switches, distribution of video, and internet protocol based networking equipment.[1]
The company has engineering groups, working on computer architecture, systems integration, embedded operating systems such as OS-9, application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) design, and middleware. Its platforms and building blocks are based on custom form factors as well as industry standards such as AdvancedTCA, COM Express, CompactPCI, and PCI. In 2009, Radisys' biggest customers were Philips Healthcare, Agilent, Fujitsu, Danaher Corporation, and Nokia Siemens Network (NSN).[1] NSN was the largest single customer, totaling over 43% of revenues.[1]

Radisys supports two markets: communications networking and commercial systems.[1] The latter makes products for use in the testing, medical imaging, defense, and industrial automation fields.[1] For example, end-products that Radisys' is a supplier to original equipment manufacturers include items such as MRI scanners, ultrasound equipment, logic analyzers, and items used in semiconductor manufacturing.[1] Communications networking equipment includes those for wireless communications, switches, distribution of video, and internet protocol based networking equipment.[1]
The company has engineering groups, working on computer architecture, systems integration, embedded operating systems such as OS-9, application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) design, and middleware. Its platforms and building blocks are based on custom form factors as well as industry standards such as AdvancedTCA, COM Express, CompactPCI, and PCI. In 2009, Radisys' biggest customers were Philips Healthcare, Agilent, Fujitsu, Danaher Corporation, and Nokia Siemens Network (NSN).[1] NSN was the largest single customer, totaling over 43% of revenues.[1]

 Professional ServicesFaster Time to Market, Less Risk with Radisys Professional Services 






















With the improved flexibility and programmability, we can accelerate introduction of new services that have large and small traffic flows, including cloud-based applications, video optimization and IoT. Radisys’ FlowEngine technology will help us deploy a cost-effective, intelligent front end traffic distributor that normalizes traffic at a single point in the network for high throughput and low latency.— Damascene JoachimpillaiDirector, Internet Services Architecture, Verizon Labs 





















Partnering with Radisys on media processing is a great example of how Nokia Networks can extend its portfolio with solutions from partner companies. In this case, the Radisys product family extends our end-to-end VoLTE/VoWiFi solution. We’re able to quickly provide operators with the right media processing solution for their VoLTE deployment, whether it’s a virtualized solution or not.— Michael CleverSenior Vice President of Core, Nokia Networks 





















Network modernization will rely on solutions such as DCEngine that meet service provider needs with open source hardware and software technologies.— Damascene JoachimpillaiArchitect, Cloud Hardware, Network & Security, Verizon Labs 





















Radisys’ leadership for an open, vendor-agnostic solution for central office transformation will be critical in providing turn-key CORD Pods that will accelerate development and adoption of CORD, enabling ground-breaking network transformation. — Guru ParulkarExecutive Director, ON.Lab 





















ZTE is a long-time customer of Radisys, having deployed Radisys’ hardware MRF portfolio for many years to provide the critical media processing for our value-added services, such as voicemail and ring-back tones, used by more than 600 million subscribers around the world.  As we looked to transition our VAS service offerings to the cloud, we made the strategic decision to standardize across our IP service delivery solutions on Radisys’ virtualized MRF. This will allow ZTE to rapidly deploy new interactive multimedia services such as VoWiFi and WebRTC, while reducing our customers’ total cost of ownership.— Huang XiaobingDirector of VAS product planning department, ZTE Corporation

CEQM67/HM65 



Type 6, 95x125mm COM, 2nd Gen Intel Core i7





The CEQM67 and CEHM65 combine the next generation quad-core performance Intel Core i7 processor and the Mobile Intel QM67 Express chipset with Radisys design expertise to provide breakthrough processing performance on a basic size Type 6 COM Express Revision 2.0 module.The basic size 95mm x 125mm module is ideal for compute intensive applications such as medical imaging, communications, military–aerospace and test and measurement applications that require high levels of processing performance.Radisys delivers the CEQM67 module in a COM Express Revision 2.0, Type 6 pin out, enabling customers to take advantage of new technology such as Digital Display Ports while boosting features and performance with up to 16GB memory, additional PCI Express lanes, and improved storage, graphics and audio. The CEQM67 module provides Trusted Platform Module (TPM) support as well as support for Intel Advanced Management Technology (AMT) enabling remote access and diagnostics via the Radisys Embedded Software Platform (eSP).The Radisys CE family of COM Express products enable customers to start designing at the same time as processor release, saving months of development time and resources. OEM focus can remain on core competencies such as software and application development rather than high speed circuit design. Planned feature changes, demand fluctuations and performance upgrades can be handled without product re–designs using the CE family. CE modules can reduce service repair inventories, and simplify upgrades, contributing to the success of the product over its lifetime.

History[edit]
RadiSys was founded in 1987 as Radix Microsystems in Beaverton, Oregon, by former Intel engineers Dave Budde and Glen Myers.[3][4][5] The first investors were employees who put up $50,000 each, with Tektronix later investing additional funds into the company.[5] Originally located in space leased from Sequent Computer Systems, by 1994 the company had grown to annual sales of $20 million.[6] The company's products were computers used in end products such as automated teller machines to paint mixers.[5] On October 20, 1995, the company became a publicly traded company when it held an initial public offering (IPO).[7] The IPO raised $19.6 million for RadiSys after selling 2.7 million shares at $12 per share.[7]
In 1996, the company moved it headquarters to a new campus in Hillsboro, and at that time sales reached $80 million and the company had a profit of $9.6 million that year with 175 employees.[5][8] Company co-founder Dave Budde left the company in 1997, with company revenues at $81 million annually at that time.[9] The company grew in part by acquisitions such as Sonitech International in 1997,[10] part of IBM's Open Computing Platform unit[11] and Texas Micro in 1999,[12] all of S-Link in 2001,[13] and Microware also in 2001.[14] RadiSys also moved some production to China in order to take advantage of the lower manufacturing costs.[15]
In 2002, the company had grown to annual revenues of $200 million, and posted a profit in the fourth quarter for the first time in several quarters.[16] That year Scott Grout was named as chief executive officer of the company and C. Scott Gibson became the chairman of the board,[17] both replacing Glen Myers who co-founded the company.[18] The company sold off its signaling gateway line in 2003.[19]
They raised $97 million through selling convertible senior notes in November 2003.[20] In 2004, the company stopped granting stock options to employees and transitioned to giving restricted shares for some compensation.[21] RadiSys grew to annual revenues of $320 million by 2005.[22] The company continued to grow through acquisitions such as a $105 million deal that added Convedia Corp. in 2006.[23][24] RadiSys continued buying assets when it purchased part of Intel's communications business for about $30 million in 2007.[25] After five-straight quarterly losses, the company posted a profit of $481,000 in their 2009 fourth quarter.[26]
In May 2011, the company announced they were buying Continuous Computing for $105 million in stock and cash.[27] Once the transaction was completed in July 2011, Continuous' CEO Mike Dagenais became the CEO of RadiSys.[27][28][29] Dagenais left the company in October 2012 with former CFO Brian Bronson taking over as CEO.[28]
Operations[edit]

Radisys in 2015 had approximately 700 employees located in offices in the United States (Oregon), India ([Bangalore]), China (Shenzhen), and Canada (Burnaby, BC).[1] Overall, the company only builds about 15 percent of their products, with the remainder outsourced to other companies.[1]
Products[edit]
Radisys supports two markets: communications networking and commercial systems.[1] The latter makes products for use in the testing, medical imaging, defense, and industrial automation fields.[1] For example, end-products that Radisys' is a supplier to original equipment manufacturers include items such as MRI scanners, ultrasound equipment, logic analyzers, and items used in semiconductor manufacturing.[1] Communications networking equipment includes those for wireless communications, switches, distribution of video, and internet protocol based networking equipment.[1]
The company has engineering groups, working on computer architecture, systems integration, embedded operating systems such as OS-9, application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) design, and middleware. Its platforms and building blocks are based on custom form factors as well as industry standards such as AdvancedTCA, COM Express, CompactPCI, and PCI. In 2009, Radisys' biggest customers were Philips Healthcare, Agilent, Fujitsu, Danaher Corporation, and Nokia Siemens Network (NSN).[1] NSN was the largest single customer, totaling over 43% of revenues.[1]

Radisys in 2015 had approximately 700 employees located in offices in the United States (Oregon), India ([Bangalore]), China (Shenzhen), and Canada (Burnaby, BC).[1] Overall, the company only builds about 15 percent of their products, with the remainder outsourced to other companies.[1]
Products[edit]
Radisys supports two markets: communications networking and commercial systems.[1] The latter makes products for use in the testing, medical imaging, defense, and industrial automation fields.[1] For example, end-products that Radisys' is a supplier to original equipment manufacturers include items such as MRI scanners, ultrasound equipment, logic analyzers, and items used in semiconductor manufacturing.[1] Communications networking equipment includes those for wireless communications, switches, distribution of video, and internet protocol based networking equipment.[1]
The company has engineering groups, working on computer architecture, systems integration, embedded operating systems such as OS-9, application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) design, and middleware. Its platforms and building blocks are based on custom form factors as well as industry standards such as AdvancedTCA, COM Express, CompactPCI, and PCI. In 2009, Radisys' biggest customers were Philips Healthcare, Agilent, Fujitsu, Danaher Corporation, and Nokia Siemens Network (NSN).[1] NSN was the largest single customer, totaling over 43% of revenues.[1]

History[edit]
RadiSys was founded in 1987 as Radix Microsystems in Beaverton, Oregon, by former Intel engineers Dave Budde and Glen Myers.[3][4][5] The first investors were employees who put up $50,000 each, with Tektronix later investing additional funds into the company.[5] Originally located in space leased from Sequent Computer Systems, by 1994 the company had grown to annual sales of $20 million.[6] The company's products were computers used in end products such as automated teller machines to paint mixers.[5] On October 20, 1995, the company became a publicly traded company when it held an initial public offering (IPO).[7] The IPO raised $19.6 million for RadiSys after selling 2.7 million shares at $12 per share.[7]
In 1996, the company moved it headquarters to a new campus in Hillsboro, and at that time sales reached $80 million and the company had a profit of $9.6 million that year with 175 employees.[5][8] Company co-founder Dave Budde left the company in 1997, with company revenues at $81 million annually at that time.[9] The company grew in part by acquisitions such as Sonitech International in 1997,[10] part of IBM's Open Computing Platform unit[11] and Texas Micro in 1999,[12] all of S-Link in 2001,[13] and Microware also in 2001.[14] RadiSys also moved some production to China in order to take advantage of the lower manufacturing costs.[15]
In 2002, the company had grown to annual revenues of $200 million, and posted a profit in the fourth quarter for the first time in several quarters.[16] That year Scott Grout was named as chief executive officer of the company and C. Scott Gibson became the chairman of the board,[17] both replacing Glen Myers who co-founded the company.[18] The company sold off its signaling gateway line in 2003.[19]
They raised $97 million through selling convertible senior notes in November 2003.[20] In 2004, the company stopped granting stock options to employees and transitioned to giving restricted shares for some compensation.[21] RadiSys grew to annual revenues of $320 million by 2005.[22] The company continued to grow through acquisitions such as a $105 million deal that added Convedia Corp. in 2006.[23][24] RadiSys continued buying assets when it purchased part of Intel's communications business for about $30 million in 2007.[25] After five-straight quarterly losses, the company posted a profit of $481,000 in their 2009 fourth quarter.[26]
In May 2011, the company announced they were buying Continuous Computing for $105 million in stock and cash.[27] Once the transaction was completed in July 2011, Continuous' CEO Mike Dagenais became the CEO of RadiSys.[27][28][29] Dagenais left the company in October 2012 with former CFO Brian Bronson taking over as CEO.[28]
Operations[edit]

The company's headquarters are located in the Dawson Creek Industrial Park adjacent to the headquarters of FEI Company in Hillsboro, Oregon, within the Portland metropolitan area. Radisys in 2015 had approximately 700 employees located in offices in the United States (Oregon), India ([Bangalore]), China (Shenzhen), and Canada (Burnaby, BC).[1] Overall, the company only builds about 15 percent of their products, with the remainder outsourced to other companies.[1]
Products[edit]
Radisys supports two markets: communications networking and commercial systems.[1] The latter makes products for use in the testing, medical imaging, defense, and industrial automation fields.[1] For example, end-products that Radisys' is a supplier to original equipment manufacturers include items such as MRI scanners, ultrasound equipment, logic analyzers, and items used in semiconductor manufacturing.[1] Communications networking equipment includes those for wireless communications, switches, distribution of video, and internet protocol based networking equipment.[1]
The company has engineering groups, working on computer architecture, systems integration, embedded operating systems such as OS-9, application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) design, and middleware. Its platforms and building blocks are based on custom form factors as well as industry standards such as AdvancedTCA, COM Express, CompactPCI, and PCI. In 2009, Radisys' biggest customers were Philips Healthcare, Agilent, Fujitsu, Danaher Corporation, and Nokia Siemens Network (NSN).[1] NSN was the largest single customer, totaling over 43% of revenues.[1]

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
