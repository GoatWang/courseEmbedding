Early life and education[edit]
Sternlicht was born in New York City in 1960[5] and grew up in Connecticut, the son of a Holocaust survivor from Poland,[6] Maurycy Sternlicht.[7] His father worked as a plant manager; his mother, Harriet, was from New York and worked as a biology teacher and stockbroker.[7] In 1982, he graduated magna cum laude, with honors, from Brown University. In 1986, he received his MBA with distinction from Harvard Business School.[2] After graduation, he went to work for JMB Realty, a real estate investment company, in Chicago where he learned the real estate business. In 1989, after the real estate market collapsed, he was laid off and went into business on his own.[8]
Career[edit]
Sternlicht was able to raise $20 million from the wealthy Ziff (see William Bernard Ziff, Jr.) and Burden families of New York which he used to purchase loans from the Resolution Trust Corporation, created by the federal government to hold the real estate assets left over from the savings-and-loan crisis.[8] In 1991, Sternlicht launched Starwood Capital Group. His goal was to buy up multi-family apartment buildings that were being auctioned off in the government’s bailout of the savings and loan crisis.[9]
In 1993, Sternlicht sold the portfolio to real estate magnate Sam Zell for more than 20 percent of Zell’s Equity Residential Properties Trust. When Zell took the company public that year, Starwood saw more than a 100 percent return. Sternlicht later began to purchase hotel sites, focusing on combining his passions of architecture and real estate finance.
Under Sternlicht’s leadership, Starwood Capital Group today ranks as one of the largest and most successful investment firms focused on real estate. For the past twenty years, it has structured investment transactions with an asset value exceeding $47 billion.[4] Starwood's funds have invested in more than 70,000 apartment units, more than 2200 hotels, over 44 million square feet of office properties, 39 million square feet of retail and over 46,000 acres of land in residential subdivisions.[10][11] Today the firm manages approximately $33 billion of investor capital on behalf of its high-net-worth and institutional partners and public shareholders.[12]
From 1995 through early 2005, Sternlicht was Chairman and CEO of Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc., a company he founded in 1995. Sternlicht has been credited as a dynamic and innovative hotel leader, creating new products and programs with immediate global appeal. He has been named the King of Hotels,[13] creating W Hotels, perhaps the world’s most successful “boutique” brand. Some of his other innovations include the creation of Westin’s “Heavenly Bed,” “Heavenly Bath,” “Westin Workout,” and Starwood Preferred Guest, the world’s first frequent traveler program with “no blackouts.” [2]
Awards[edit]
In 2004, he was named America’s Best Lodging CEO by Institutional Investor magazine.[14] Sternlicht was inducted into the Interior Design Magazine Hall of Fame.[15]
In 2010, Sternlicht was named Executive of the Year and Investor of the Year by Commercial Property Executive.[16] Global peer-voting polls sponsored by Private Equity Real Estate magazine named Sternlicht as the Global Industry Figure of the Year and as North American Industry Figure of the Year in 2010, his second consecutive year in this category.[17]
Board positions[edit]
Sternlicht is a trustee of his alma mater, Brown University. He serves on the Board of Directors of the Estée Lauder Companies,[18] Restoration Hardware,[19] TriPointe Homes,[20] Baccarat,[21] Mammoth Mountain,[22] and Advisory Board of Zelnick Media.[23] He serves as Chairman of the Board of Robin Hood Foundation[24] and is on the boards of the Real Estate Roundtable,[25] Pension Real Estate Association (PREA),[26] the Dreamland Community Theatre,[27] the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation’s National Leadership Advocacy Program[22] and the Business Committee for the Arts.[28]
Personal life[edit]
He is married to Mimi (née Reichert) Sternlicht.[7][29]

Early life and education[edit]
Sternlicht was born in New York City in 1960[5] and grew up in Connecticut, the son of a Holocaust survivor from Poland,[6] Maurycy Sternlicht.[7] His father worked as a plant manager; his mother, Harriet, was from New York and worked as a biology teacher and stockbroker.[7] In 1982, he graduated magna cum laude, with honors, from Brown University. In 1986, he received his MBA with distinction from Harvard Business School.[2] After graduation, he went to work for JMB Realty, a real estate investment company, in Chicago where he learned the real estate business. In 1989, after the real estate market collapsed, he was laid off and went into business on his own.[8]
Career[edit]
Sternlicht was able to raise $20 million from the wealthy Ziff (see William Bernard Ziff, Jr.) and Burden families of New York which he used to purchase loans from the Resolution Trust Corporation, created by the federal government to hold the real estate assets left over from the savings-and-loan crisis.[8] In 1991, Sternlicht launched Starwood Capital Group. His goal was to buy up multi-family apartment buildings that were being auctioned off in the government’s bailout of the savings and loan crisis.[9]
In 1993, Sternlicht sold the portfolio to real estate magnate Sam Zell for more than 20 percent of Zell’s Equity Residential Properties Trust. When Zell took the company public that year, Starwood saw more than a 100 percent return. Sternlicht later began to purchase hotel sites, focusing on combining his passions of architecture and real estate finance.
Under Sternlicht’s leadership, Starwood Capital Group today ranks as one of the largest and most successful investment firms focused on real estate. For the past twenty years, it has structured investment transactions with an asset value exceeding $47 billion.[4] Starwood's funds have invested in more than 70,000 apartment units, more than 2200 hotels, over 44 million square feet of office properties, 39 million square feet of retail and over 46,000 acres of land in residential subdivisions.[10][11] Today the firm manages approximately $33 billion of investor capital on behalf of its high-net-worth and institutional partners and public shareholders.[12]
From 1995 through early 2005, Sternlicht was Chairman and CEO of Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc., a company he founded in 1995. Sternlicht has been credited as a dynamic and innovative hotel leader, creating new products and programs with immediate global appeal. He has been named the King of Hotels,[13] creating W Hotels, perhaps the world’s most successful “boutique” brand. Some of his other innovations include the creation of Westin’s “Heavenly Bed,” “Heavenly Bath,” “Westin Workout,” and Starwood Preferred Guest, the world’s first frequent traveler program with “no blackouts.” [2]
Awards[edit]
In 2004, he was named America’s Best Lodging CEO by Institutional Investor magazine.[14] Sternlicht was inducted into the Interior Design Magazine Hall of Fame.[15]
In 2010, Sternlicht was named Executive of the Year and Investor of the Year by Commercial Property Executive.[16] Global peer-voting polls sponsored by Private Equity Real Estate magazine named Sternlicht as the Global Industry Figure of the Year and as North American Industry Figure of the Year in 2010, his second consecutive year in this category.[17]
Board positions[edit]
Sternlicht is a trustee of his alma mater, Brown University. He serves on the Board of Directors of the Estée Lauder Companies,[18] Restoration Hardware,[19] TriPointe Homes,[20] Baccarat,[21] Mammoth Mountain,[22] and Advisory Board of Zelnick Media.[23] He serves as Chairman of the Board of Robin Hood Foundation[24] and is on the boards of the Real Estate Roundtable,[25] Pension Real Estate Association (PREA),[26] the Dreamland Community Theatre,[27] the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation’s National Leadership Advocacy Program[22] and the Business Committee for the Arts.[28]
Personal life[edit]
He is married to Mimi (née Reichert) Sternlicht.[7][29]

Early life and education[edit]
Sternlicht was born in New York City in 1960[5] and grew up in Connecticut, the son of a Holocaust survivor from Poland,[6] Maurycy Sternlicht.[7] His father worked as a plant manager; his mother, Harriet, was from New York and worked as a biology teacher and stockbroker.[7] In 1982, he graduated magna cum laude, with honors, from Brown University. In 1986, he received his MBA with distinction from Harvard Business School.[2] After graduation, he went to work for JMB Realty, a real estate investment company, in Chicago where he learned the real estate business. In 1989, after the real estate market collapsed, he was laid off and went into business on his own.[8]
Career[edit]
Sternlicht was able to raise $20 million from the wealthy Ziff (see William Bernard Ziff, Jr.) and Burden families of New York which he used to purchase loans from the Resolution Trust Corporation, created by the federal government to hold the real estate assets left over from the savings-and-loan crisis.[8] In 1991, Sternlicht launched Starwood Capital Group. His goal was to buy up multi-family apartment buildings that were being auctioned off in the government’s bailout of the savings and loan crisis.[9]
In 1993, Sternlicht sold the portfolio to real estate magnate Sam Zell for more than 20 percent of Zell’s Equity Residential Properties Trust. When Zell took the company public that year, Starwood saw more than a 100 percent return. Sternlicht later began to purchase hotel sites, focusing on combining his passions of architecture and real estate finance.
Under Sternlicht’s leadership, Starwood Capital Group today ranks as one of the largest and most successful investment firms focused on real estate. For the past twenty years, it has structured investment transactions with an asset value exceeding $47 billion.[4] Starwood's funds have invested in more than 70,000 apartment units, more than 2200 hotels, over 44 million square feet of office properties, 39 million square feet of retail and over 46,000 acres of land in residential subdivisions.[10][11] Today the firm manages approximately $33 billion of investor capital on behalf of its high-net-worth and institutional partners and public shareholders.[12]
From 1995 through early 2005, Sternlicht was Chairman and CEO of Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc., a company he founded in 1995. Sternlicht has been credited as a dynamic and innovative hotel leader, creating new products and programs with immediate global appeal. He has been named the King of Hotels,[13] creating W Hotels, perhaps the world’s most successful “boutique” brand. Some of his other innovations include the creation of Westin’s “Heavenly Bed,” “Heavenly Bath,” “Westin Workout,” and Starwood Preferred Guest, the world’s first frequent traveler program with “no blackouts.” [2]
Awards[edit]
In 2004, he was named America’s Best Lodging CEO by Institutional Investor magazine.[14] Sternlicht was inducted into the Interior Design Magazine Hall of Fame.[15]
In 2010, Sternlicht was named Executive of the Year and Investor of the Year by Commercial Property Executive.[16] Global peer-voting polls sponsored by Private Equity Real Estate magazine named Sternlicht as the Global Industry Figure of the Year and as North American Industry Figure of the Year in 2010, his second consecutive year in this category.[17]
Board positions[edit]
Sternlicht is a trustee of his alma mater, Brown University. He serves on the Board of Directors of the Estée Lauder Companies,[18] Restoration Hardware,[19] TriPointe Homes,[20] Baccarat,[21] Mammoth Mountain,[22] and Advisory Board of Zelnick Media.[23] He serves as Chairman of the Board of Robin Hood Foundation[24] and is on the boards of the Real Estate Roundtable,[25] Pension Real Estate Association (PREA),[26] the Dreamland Community Theatre,[27] the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation’s National Leadership Advocacy Program[22] and the Business Committee for the Arts.[28]
Personal life[edit]
He is married to Mimi (née Reichert) Sternlicht.[7][29]

                ‘You can’t give away a house,’ Starwood Capital CEO says
            



                Sternlicht says he’s now taken up residence in Florida
            



Barry Sternlicht, chairman and chief executive officer of Greenwich, Connecticut-based Starwood Capital Group, said the town may be the worst housing market in the U.S., and that he now officially lives in Florida.“You can’t give away a house in Greenwich,” Sternlicht said Tuesday at the CNBC Institutional Investor Delivering Alpha Conference in New York.The town -- about 30 miles (48 kilometers) northeast of midtown Manhattan and home to some of the country’s largest hedge funds -- is seeing a pile-up of houses on the market and prices that are faltering as properties linger. Home sales in the second quarter fell 18 percent from a year earlier to 169 deals, according to appraiser Miller Samuel Inc. and brokerage Douglas Elliman Real Estate.








At the same time, new listings surged 27 percent. The absorption period, or the time it would take to sell all the homes on the market at the current pace, was 12 months, compared with 7.7 months a year earlier, Miller Samuel and Douglas Elliman said.Sternlicht said that he’s been a resident of Florida since July 1, a move he made because taxes in Connecticut got too high -- and his kids didn’t want to visit.Tax Rate“Connecticut got too close to the Manhattan tax rates,” he said. “We used to have no taxes.”




Sternlicht said that high income taxes made all of Fairfield County, Connecticut, a “terrible” place to live, and that declining home prices are reflecting that.In Greenwich, the median home price fell 7.5 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier to $1.76 million, Miller Samuel and Douglas Elliman said. It remains among the costliest housing markets in the country.




In June 2008, Sternlicht tried to sell his 5.8-acre (2.3-hectare) Greenwich property, a gated estate with tennis and shuffleboard courts and a swimming pool. After multiple price cuts and one increase, the home was no longer listed for sale by early 2010.— With assistance by Joshua Fineman

  The reasonably healthy U.S. economy is doing little to assuage investor concerns about the stock market, and all the conflicting signs makes it feel like we're "standing in quicksand," Starwood Capital Group chief Barry Sternlicht said Tuesday. 
  "It feels like the market is telling you the party is over," Sternlicht told CNBC's "Squawk Box," citing concerns about low liquidity. "Everyone feels like we haven't seen what's around the corner, behind the curtain, and we're nervous." 
  The slowing Chinese economy has put a question mark on whether the rest of the world may also get dragged lower. 

  But for now, he said, "the facts look pretty good — the United States, in particular looks pretty good, England looks pretty good, [and] Eastern European countries ... look pretty good."

  "Housing sat out most of the recovery, but it's actually doing pretty well," said Sternlicht, whose $45 billion investment firm has a heavy emphasis in real estate. 
  He characterized rentals as "very strong;" hotels as showing "pretty good numbers" from the low end to the high end; and malls as OK. 
  "The biggest issues in the housing market are jobs. They can't find the workers" because of the low labor-participation rate at a time of nearly full employment, he said. "It's not demand." 
  Warning about signs of wage inflation, he said, "when it's there it will be too late." 
  That's partly the reason he wants the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates. "We don't need these rates. The economy doesn't need these rates," he said, arguing the hike should have happened two years ago. 
  Echoing comments from former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke on "Squawk Box" on Monday, Sternlicht called for more leadership and policy action from government agencies outside the central bank to help support growth.

  Sternlicht expressed concern that the leading candidates on the Republican side — Donald Trump, Ben Carson, and Carly Fiorina — are not career politicians, which could create uncertainty about how they'd handle the gridlock in Washington.

Company Brief
Starwood Capital Group (starwoodcapital.com) is a private investment firm formed by Barry Sternlicht in 1991. It is focused on global real estate, hotel management, oil and gas, energy infrastructure, and securities trading. Starwood Capital’s funds have invested in approximately 77,000 multifamily/condo units, 2,490 hotels, 50 million square feet of office properties, 48 million square feet of retail, and 49,000 lots of land in residential subdivisions. The firm currently manages more than $42 billion in assets on behalf of its high-net-worth and institutional partners. It employs approximately 690 employees, plus 470 employees in its loan-servicing business. The firm maintains offices in Greenwich (headquarters), Atlanta, San Francisco, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, Chicago, and Miami, and affiliated offices in London, Luxembourg, Paris, Frankfurt, and Sao Paulo.
Is this a time of opportunity or a time to wait-and-see?
There is always something to do and it is always about risk and reward, but the tail risk in the world is so much greater than it was before this past financial crisis.
We are investing now because our macro view is that there is a great deal of liquidity in the world. There are also very few alternatives for investors so money is coming out of the bond and treasury markets, and searching for yield across all the asset classes. It’s late in the cycle now. The drop in interest rates has been working for so many years that you’re seeing capitulation today from many capital providers. They simply can’t take less than 1 percent yields on 60 percent of the world’s treasuries. Yet, as investors become nervous that rates are going to rise, they may pull back sharply because nobody wants to invest in a rising interest rate environment. The consensus today, which makes me nervous, is that rates will remain low pretty much everywhere for a very long time. There will be plenty of time to get out if the rates do rise. People tend not to be clairvoyant.
We just closed our newest $5.4-billion global opportunity fund. We’ve seen how the flow of funds has changed, how currencies are becoming increasingly volatile and how, given the political global uncertainty, investors are leaving unstable regimes to invest in more stable places like the U.S. Maybe they want to buy that office building in New York or that hotel in Manhattan, but a part of the equation may also be that they need to diversify out of their local currency and ride the U.S. dollar, which is likely to get stronger. Foreign capital needs to buy something that is not controversial so they will buy an office building, a hotel, or an apartment complex.
When we determine where to invest today, we’re very focused on whether we can lose our money and about the likelihood of achieving our return target. Instead of having certainty that an investment will earn 20 percent per annum, we now must create a “bell curve” for the expected returns and evaluate the possibility of earning 30 percent, as well as the chances of losing your capital. It isn’t about the static IRR per se on the piece of paper; it’s about the shape of the curve and the range of possible outcomes you have to make or to lose your capital.
Based on that, our asset class is very well positioned to benefit from a low-rate environment in a very significant way. In the real estate world, you can still achieve very good risk-adjusted returns relative to other asset classes, and you’ll enjoy some protection from inflation. There is a hard asset, and if inflation were to come back and get out of control, this is a better place to hide capital than most. Of course, it also depends on which individual asset and property type you choose in real estate.
Are real estate and energy complementary or do you see them as two separate businesses?
They’re two separate businesses, but we follow the same discipline investing in both. We look at supply and demand, yield on cost, what we’re going to earn on the dollar, and creating as secure of a longer-term income stream for the energy investment as possible. 
If we’re buying a plant, we look at replacement costs to ensure that we are not paying more than it cost to build. The same discipline issue relates to all real estate like office buildings. There is also the issue of obsolescence. Buildings that aren’t wired properly or don’t offer the systems you need make replacement cost irrelevant. You have to ascertain if the technology is going to be obsolete and if that plant can be competitive.
Especially in our early investments in the electrical grid, we would get a long-term contract – essentially a lease from a power company – to take all of the power that runs through that cable. We did that in Long Island and in New York City, and they were very successful investments.
Now we have branched out into wind, solar, and other transmission infrastructure, as well as power plants.
Where is innovation taking place today at Starwood Capital?
We’re innovative, but we can be more so. Big data is going to have an impact on all of our businesses and we haven’t mastered that yet. We don’t do our daily tasks much differently than we did 10 years ago, so it’s going to be a new frontier for us to change how we do business.
Our innovation is much like my tenure at Starwood Hotels – it has come more from the product side. At Starwood Hotels, it was about the W, the Heavenly Bed, the curved shower rod, bringing Aveda cosmetics to the room, getting rid of the armoire in the hotel, and doing duvet covers. Everything we did was heresy at the time, but I didn’t care even if we lost our AAA Mobile Four Star rating, because I felt that consumers would be happier with the changes we made. Everyone followed us because it was about applying common sense.
We also had a willingness to break rules. Our only rule was to pay attention to the customers and let them lead us to the right answer.
Other than ethics, there are few things in business on which you can’t change your opinion. All of our work to create a brand revolves around reinforcing the central theme of the brand. For our new 1 Hotels, it is more than a brand – it’s a cause. Our cause is making the earth a little bit better a little bit at a time. It’s why we call it 1 Hotels – it’s one world, and whatever we each do to the environment, to protect it or to harm it, impacts our neighbors.
With 1 Hotels, we wanted to make a difference in the world, and if people copied us, we’d be happy. We knew we’d find our niche, but it’s innovation that gets me up in the morning. One of my greatest strengths is my awareness that you have to roll with the world and change all the time. You have to be open to the feedback that the marketplace provides you in order to change what you’re doing. 
When I entered the hotel business, I did a survey on the 10 things guests cared about most in choosing a hotel. Nowhere on that list was the comfort of the bed. Just 10 years later, when you survey the industry, the comfort of the bed comes in at around number three. Great innovation is about making things you do every day better.
Is it more about being an innovator or being a disruptor?
Both. Good innovation is going to disrupt.
I come at it with a broader paintbrush today – if we help society, we’ll be rewarded. If that has an echo effect across the landscape, it’s really great. I also think the innovator “wins” the space.
The hotel industry in particular has been cursed and blessed by two things: If you own a hotel in Manhattan, you don’t necessarily care what is happening at a hotel in Tokyo. So you have this insular mentality that you can continue to do what you have been doing and people will come. But there can be someone you don’t know about who can put you out of business tomorrow.
We recently bought a large group of malls because the mall has been a place people visit to have access to a variety of stores. Today, retail shops are going to have to up their game and figure out why people should get off their computers and make an inconvenient trip to a store. Stores have to innovate and they’re doing it. They’re thinking about the channel shift and they’re mutually complimentary – the online guys are going into brick-and-mortar and the brick-and-mortar guys are going online. People are using the Internet to research and then coming to the store to make the purchase. In some markets where retailers closed stores, online sales fell precipitously. Perhaps that’s why mall occupancies are at record highs.
Like any business, everyone has to get better at their game to win.


The entrance of the 
		    Baccarat Hotel & Residences - New York

Is it hard to communicate the purpose behind 1?
It’s actually easier to build a brand today in the Internet age. It’s so easy for people to discover you, the good and the bad. If I’m going somewhere, I might check the ratings of the hotel or look at what TripAdvisor says. You can’t hide anymore.
It’s all about affinity groups, and that is what the web allows us to do better. We come together around our group, be it via social media like with Instagram, or another outlet. It’s micro-marketing and if we’re good at it, we’re going to save ourselves a lot of money, and we’re going to own our demographic, and identify and understand what our customer likes today. It’s much better than it was 10 years ago.
How big can the 1 brand become?
As big as our ambition as long as we deliver top returns and we’re still having fun. It’s not just opening hotels but what we do after that. I enjoy having people who care about the environment as my associates and leadership team. We will grow at the pace we can handle, and when people see what we’ve done with both Baccarat Hotels and 1 Hotels, they’re going to know this isn’t cookie-cutter. We’re going to have to get our construction costs in line so we can go into cities that don’t have the high rate profile of places like Miami or New York. We can go to London, Rome, Los Angeles, Boston, and San Francisco, and we expect to be in those markets over time.
What is the vision for Baccarat?
For over 250 years, Baccarat has perfected their crystal. If you go to the packaging line in the factory in Baccarat, France, which has been standing for several hundred years, there are all of these trolley carts with glasses and candlesticks. When you pick them up and ask why they’re not in the packing line, they’ll say it’s because they’re not perfect. Yet, I can’t ever find the flaw.
For 250 years, they never sacrificed quality. That was our inspiration to bring perfect service into the hotel space. You would be shocked at the number of problems people have at hotels. In no other industry could you disappoint 50 percent of your customers and still have them come back because it’s no better elsewhere.
We can do this more easily at the high end than at the low end because we’re building an incredibly loyal base. We want to be the home-away-from-home for the people that can pay that price all over the world.
It empowers your employees to satisfy the customers and that makes the experience of working in a hotel that much better.
With your awareness of attention to detail, are you ever satisfied?
It’s really annoying for those who work with me. I need to celebrate our successes more. Still, you have to always look ahead. I feel responsible to my investors and partners. I’m very proud of what I did at the Baccarat in New York and I like to reflect on that. We did sell the hotel for the highest price per room ever achieved in North America. Details are core to an exquisite brand.
Do you get as much joy out of giving back as you do from the business success?
I love it. The benefit of being successful is being able to give back. This is the fruit of my labor. I can uniquely give resources, consulting, and money. It’s not the best use of my time and resources to stand in a soup kitchen, but one day, I will do that as well.•

Barry Sternlicht, Starwood Hotels and Resorts – Adweek                       FollowfacebooktwitterinstagramlinkedinFeed Subscribe     Brand MarketingAgenciesDigitalTV / VideoCreativity          Brand MarketingBarry Sternlicht, Starwood Hotels and ResortsBy Mike Beirne|October 10, 2005ShareBy Mike Beirne|October 10, 2005ShareThanks to Barry Sternlicht, hotel kingpin J.W. Marriott Jr. has taken a keen interest in the threadcounts of cotton bed sheets. Sternlicht also explains why InterContinental Hotels tapped Back Lot Productions, the retail consultants behind the Hollywood Video stores, to design its New Age boutique brand, Indigo.During his 10-year reign as chairman of Starwood Hotels & Resorts, Sternlicht transformed a real estate investment company worth less than $10 million into a $15 billion hotel empire. His two biggest innovations–the W boutique hotel chain and Westin Heavenly Bed–revived the hospitality industry by establishing the practice of branding amenities that were once considered mundane.In stark contrast to major airlines, today’s hotels address consumer lifestyles and are no longer stuck padding margins with the cheapest mattress, furniture and food money can buy.“When people go on the road, they want to be productive, they want a good night’s sleep and they want to eat well. There wasn’t any hotel product that was delivering that,” said Eric Sieb, president the Sieb Organization, a hospitality consulting firm based in Phoenix. “Barry has made being on the road bearable.”To say nothing of profitable. Operating income from Starwood’s North American hotels jumped 49% to $664 million last year, with a 12.1% increase in revenue per available room among same-store units, versus the 7.8% industry average. If its forecast for 10-12% growth is correct, annual net income in 2005 will increase 39% to $484 million.Sternlicht, 44, left the company in May to focus on running his real estate investment firm, Starwood Capital, and declined to be interviewed for this story (more on that later). His recognition as one of Brandweek’s Marketers of the Year, it should be noted, does not come from being first. Choice Hotels installed Serta Quality Sleepers four years before Westin Heavenly Bed’s 1999 debut, but failed to promote the product with distinct branding. Ian Schrager had been creating hotels around nightclubs for years with chic meeting places like Morgans in New York and Mondrian in Los Angeles.Yet no other hotelier in recent memory has managed to create the same “wow” factor for new products and services. Far from cringing at the fake bathroom countertops or laughing at the immovable art above the bed, consumers are ordering W furniture from catalogs and purchasing the Heavenly Bed at Nordstrom.Even industry rivals tip their hats to Sternlicht’s accomplishments.“You really have to give Starwood their due with what they’ve done with Heavenly Bed,” said Mark Snyder, svp-brand management at Holiday Inn Hotels and Resorts. “Remembering when that was coming out, the category thought they were nuts. We thought they were nuts. But [they’ve taken] the basics of a hotel stay and done them very dramatically.”Now, the industry is playing catch-up. Marriott’s new bed, part of a $190 million upgrade, won’t be completed until next year; the category leader also is contemplating a boutique brand. Radisson launched a recent ad blitz touting its new Sleep Number beds. Crowne Plaza rolled its Sleep Advantage program complete with hotel quiet zones, guaranteed wakeup calls, lavender spray and relaxation CD. Hilton Hotels is installing Hilton Suite Dreams bedding into its full family of brands. Mid-tier lodger Choice Hotels, meanwhile, entered the “lifestyle” boutique sector with Cambria Suites, and Hyatt intends to convert AmeriSuites into the stylish Hyatt Place.that Sternlicht triggered a movement in hotel branding is especially impressive given that he is not a formally trained marketer. After earning his MB A at Harvard Business School (with a liberal arts degree from Brown University), he began closing real estate deals for JMB, Chicago. In 1991, he founded Starwood Capital Group, Greenwich, Conn., and in 1994, formed Starwood Hotels, White Plains, N.Y., after acquiring control of Hotel Investors Trust, a nearly bankrupt company. Three years later, he outbid Hilton to buy ITT Sheraton for $14.6 billion. Later in 1997, he acquired Westin Hotels for $1.8 billion.Early on, Sternlicht discovered loopholes in the tax code that enabled Starwood to own and manage hotels and distribute shareholder dividends without paying taxes. That practice ended when competitors alerted the Clinton administration and Congress passed the IRS Restructuring Bill, which limited the benefits of a pair-shared real estate investment trust (REIT). Starwood Hotels converted to a corporate tax-paying C corporation in 1999.Before buying a conversion property, hotel companies typically look at factors such as room sizes and available space for conferences. Sternlicht tossed those requirements aside and bought hotels, including the dumpy Doral Inn in midtown Manhattan, based on whether its Lexington Avenue location would make it profitable.While young and gifted–he was chairman of one of the world’s top hotel companies at age 36–Sternlicht was also impetuous and lacked operating experience. Critics argued that he overpaid for Sheraton and Westin; analysts said he was in over his head. They appeared to be right when Starwood’s stock took a dive in 1999 while it wrestled with an $8 billion debt.Nine senior executives left the company during 1999 and 2000, and the assimilation of former competitors Westin and Sheraton was looking like an operations nightmare. Sternlicht’s image didn’t fare any better. Stories questioned whether an executive preoccupied with paint schemes and carpet patterns was CEO material. In demoting former CEO and college pal Richard Nanula–whom journalists cast as Starwood’s guiding and stable leader–Sternlicht was dubbed petty.“There was a lot of turnover, and Barry is always the grass-is-greener type of guy,” said David Van Kalspeek, vp-sales for MGM Grand, a Sheraton and Starwood vet. “There were a lot of times when he would throw an idea out there and not understand the impact it had on a company this size. He might be having cocktails with somebody and then on Monday morning, you get a note saying we should be doing [this or that]. Did he intend for a note to throw the whole organization into a tizzy? No. But those kinds of things from the chairman do. Some people liked it; some people dealt with it, and some didn’t.”Managers knew where their ideas stood with Sternlicht because he was very direct, even gruff, said a former Starwood executive who wished to remain anonymous. While his detail-oriented style sometimes bordered on interference, the exec said, ultimately his intent was to arrive at the best possible answer.Starwood is now being led by Coca-Cola veteran Steven Heyer, who declined to allow company executives to be interviewed for this story. Sternlicht had recruited Heyer to be CEO and, according to one former manager, there are “sensibilities” between the two.That could mean feud. Sternlicht and Heyer squared off during a press conference in September 2004, vying to answer questions first and contradicting each other. On the surface, perhaps, Heyer, who last year was passed over for the top job at Coca-Cola, doesn’t want his predecessor’s accomplishments to overshadow his own vision.Or possibly Sternlicht has learned to be a better CEO, said former Starwood CMO Keith Ferrazzi, founder of the Los Angeles based consultancy Ferrazzi Greenlight. “People have got to give Barry credit for growing as a leader of that company,” Ferrazzi said. “Maybe he’s being sensitive enough to Steve, saying, ‘Hey this is your ship, and I don’t want to steal the limelight.’ Barry would be thrilled that this story is being written, but [he wouldn’t want to] embrace it in a way that would subjugate Steve. Not doing so shows a lot of maturity in his leadership style.”The stories of “Barry’s bravado”–which many say killed his bid to acquire Wyndham Hotels and rubbed subordinates the wrong way–are repeated more often than the accounts of Barry, the family man, Barry the diabetes fundraiser and Barry the practitioner of self-deprecating humor.“Confidence in some cases can be mistaken for arrogance,” opined consultant Sieb, “because people are envious about what he had been able to do.”in the mid ’90s, as consumers were stuffing their homes with Viking stoves and affordable luxuries from Bed, Bath & Beyond, Sternlicht saw a void in the hotel business: Travelers were sacrificing their sophisticated lifestyle upon stepping inside a hotel room. The glitzy Four Seasons, Ritz-Carlton and St. Regis were exceptions, but those brands were too stuffy for a younger generation of well-heeled travelers and too pricey for road warriors’ T&E reports.Around the time of the Westin deal, Sternlicht was working with architect David Rockwell on the first W Hotel in New York. The project was racking up enormous costs, however, and Sternlicht decided that using a high-priced architect wasn’t the way to go.Instead, he sought out Hilary Billings during a business trip to Los Angeles. Billings, then vp-product development at Pottery Barn, had built the retailer’s catalog business with contemporary and casual merchandise like coir rugs made of coconut husks and curtains with iron rods that dressed the home like a private retreat.As a buyer, Billings had done her share of traveling, sleeping on 100% cotton sheets, down comforters and luxury bedding in European hotels. She was all too disappointed with the U.S lodging experience of a foam pillow, polyester sheets and a terrible mattress. Though initially she was not interested in jumping to the hotel category, her interest and Sternlicht’s vision came together during that first meeting.“What he was looking for was very clear,” said Billings, Starwood’s svp-brand development and design until 1999, when she left for the dot-corn gift company RedEnvelope. (She’s now a part-time brand consultant.) “We had a different emphasis. His was a sort of hip experience for the hotel customer. Mine was more focused on the business traveler because I saw that was where the biggest gap was.”At the time, boutique hotels delivered high design to leisure travelers but lacked the conference rooms, Internet access and quality business centers that road warriors found at the Westins, Sheratons, Hihons, Hyatts and Marriotts. Sternlicht wanted to bring back the Algonquin days of the hotel as a meeting place, and update it with hip restaurants and clubs so that locals, too, had a place to hang their hats.Billings and her creative team of 15 employees worked in San Francisco, insulated from the corporate culture clash in White Plains between the risk takers of Starwood and the more conservative Sheraton and Westin hotel veterans. Some carried an asset management approach, but Sternlicht pushed marketing to the forefront of the organization and plucked product development from the operations domain to exist as a marketing function. He tore down geographic divisions of management and assigned responsibilities by brands. Ferrazzi arrived in 1999, and hired Scott Williams to lead the creative services unit that served as Starwood’s in-house marketing agency.In hindsight, it seems incredible that W was launched with little market analysis or brand position research. Rather, W was simply put in front of the consumer so they could respond to it. Some Starwood honchos labeled the project as a “crazy Barry idea,” but there was no mistaking their boss’ passion for it.“Barry said to me, 75% of the time a guest spends in the hotel room is on the bed,” recalled Billings. “[I figured] if we can make that experience great, just think about what it would do for the hotel. Rather than thinking about the cost, he was thinking about the experience.”Still, the new brand had to compete on cost with Westin and Sheraton. Billings’ team removed the armoire and invested in a luxury bed, a longer mahogany desk with a sleek TV, chaise lounges and shelving for the closet. In her biggest stroke of genius, she recommended replacing the seemingly bulletproof, floral-colored bed spread with a linen-colored duvet, cotton sheets and down pillows.Operations staff fought against bedding that had to be cleaned frequently, but Sternlicht loved the idea. He increased the number and load capacity of hotel laundry machines so the W bed could be rolled out to all hotels. Billings started retrofitting Westin beds the following year, and the all-white Heavenly Bed quickly became the symbol of the brand.Sternlicht’s wife, Mimi, came up with the enigmatic name W, which was meant to signify witty, warm and wonderful. Billings said she loved W because it had a built-in logo. The first W opened to oohs and aahs in New York in December 1998.Far from fading, the 19 W Hotels continue to be seen as sophisticated and relevant. The power of minimalist furnishings and a hot nightclub can last only so long, but W is enduring thanks to promotional events such as W Happenings, which inject the brand into the local scene with art previews, celebrity book readings, film screenings, DJ classes and concerts by Moby and the Wallflowers. Signature products such as “Whatever, Whenever”–the 24-hour room, laundry and concierge service–are perfect for guests who want style without sacrificing service. Partnering with Bliss has made its spa services top-notch.“It turned out to be a great product for him, not only for W itself but it also had spillover effect onto the luster of Starwood,” said Van Kalspeek.The buzz spread with minimal traditional marketing. Print ads by DDB Chicago focused on amenities, followed by a campaign from Gwhiz Entertainment, New York, to position W as an experience with the mantra, “There are hotels you stay in. And one that stays in you.” A guerrilla stunt featured models in a mock boxers-versus-briefs boxing match atop a W in Chicago to promote specially designed Joe Boxer underwear for W guests. (RDA, New York, is W’s current agency. Deutsch, New York, handles Westin and Sheraton.)As its guest satisfaction ratings soared, W soon migrated to the rest of the portfolio. Thousands of beds and signature sheets and pillows were sold to consumers. Westin had a little fun with its “Who’s the best in bed?” print campaign, yet the newly minted brand pushed its way to the upscale/luxury tier above the Pritzker family-owned Hyatt, which had invested little in modernization until last year.In 2001, Westin introduced the Heavenly Shower, featuring dual showerheads, curved rod, oversized cotton towels and kimono terry robes. Sternlicht and Westin svp Sue Brash fixed cramped hotel exercise rooms by partnering with Reebok to create spacious fitness centers with state-of-the-art-equipment, specially designed workouts, and fitness and wellness classes.The once-drab Sheraton also received a lift with a $750 million, three-year renovation that included sleigh beds, branded the Sheraton Sweet Sleeper and the Sheraton Service Promise, offering instant discounts, loyalty club points or money-back satisfaction guarantees. Lounging pillows and fluffy duvets also have made their way into the midscale Four Points by Sheraton brand with the Four Points Bed.“Starwood may not be the first hotel with a great bed, a spa or even with an experience, but it is the first to articulate it to a growing travel market,” said Tom Thomas, founder of Tom Thomas & Co., a branding consultancy in New York. “Sternlicht may not have the imprimatur of a great hotelier, but he is great at being certain that the discipline and the seamlessness of his vision are executed.”Sternlicht’s investment firm recently acquired Le Meridien’s assets, to be managed by Starwood Hotels & Resorts. Heyer’s team will spin some of the new properties into lifestyle brands using dynamics such as branded entertainment that made Coke ubiquitous. Heyer brought in Javier Benito from Coke to be CMO; Nike and Starbucks vet Scott Bcdbury is a brand advisor and Hollywood talent agency Creative Artists Agency is on his roster.Starwood Hotels is said to be in talks to sell half its 140-owned properties (it manages a total of 752 hotels), ostensibly to raise money while real estate values are peaking. Already, more W Hotels and condominiums are in the pipeline for Las Vegas and the Maldives, and a mid-tier version, currently dubbed Project XYZ, will launch during 2007.“They’ve made a big push in becoming managers of their properties,” said Matt Quinn, travel analyst at Zacks Investment Research, Chicago. “[Hotel owners] say, ‘This company does a great job with their brands, and we want to be a part of that.”Photograph by Adam Nadel/AP Photo Sharehttp://adweek.it/2jGzhJK copy    Subscribe to Adweek Today!
