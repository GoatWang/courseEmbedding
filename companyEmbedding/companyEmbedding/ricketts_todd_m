Background[edit]
Ricketts is the son of Marlene Margaret (Volkmer) and J. Joseph Ricketts, who founded Ameritrade when Tom was eight years old. Ricketts Senior let it be known that he wanted his children to establish themselves through their own hard work and would not be allowed to join TD Ameritrade until they reached the age of 30.[5]
Ricketts is the eldest of four children. His younger brother J. Peter Ricketts, who lives in Omaha, is the 40th and current Governor of Nebraska[6] and was the unsuccessful Republican nominee for the 2006 U.S. Senate race in Nebraska.[7] Younger sister Laura Ricketts, a lawyer, developed and runs Ecotravel.com and serves on the board of directors of Lambda Legal.[8] Laura, Todd Ricketts, Tom Ricketts and his wife Cecelia and their five children all live in Wilmette, Illinois.
University of Chicago[edit]
In 1984, Ricketts moved from Omaha to Chicago in order to attend the University of Chicago. Just out of high school, he moved in with his younger brother Peter, also a student at the University of Chicago.[9] Ricketts received a bachelor's degree from the university in 1988 and returned to receive his Master of Business Administration in 1993. Ricketts's relationship with the university continued after graduation with reception of the Distinguished Young Alumni award from the university's Graduate School of Business.[10] The award is presented for, among other things, recognition of extraordinary career success, outstanding leadership, and influence in the business community to support the school and current students. In addition, as an alumnus Ricketts has been generous with donations to the university. This has included both volunteering his time and establishing an endowment for the New Year Scholarship Fund. Named after his joy of celebrating the Chinese New Year, the scholarship not only funds promising students but also allows for those students to meet with Ricketts and the other members of the endowment.[11]
Chicago Cubs[edit]

In April 2007, Sam Zell announced his intention to acquire the Chicago-based Tribune Company. After acquiring the Tribune, Zell announced that he would sell the Cubs and related entities including Wrigley Field and a 25% share of SportsNet Chicago.[9][12] Under bankruptcy protection, the sale of the Cubs and the 25% interest in SportsNet Chicago would raise needed funds for the ailing Tribune company. The Ricketts family bid, headed by Thomas S. Ricketts, was selected as the winning bid on January 22, 2009.[3] The family bid included all four siblings (Peter, Tom, Laura, and Todd) and both parents. Forbes estimated that the ownership stake in the Chicago Cubs represents $642 million out of the total $900 million bid made by Ricketts.[12]
Tom Ricketts has said that his love for the Chicago Cubs started during the 1984 season when he was 18 years old and moved to Chicago to attend university. Later, Tom and his brother Pete lived in an apartment over the "Sports Corner" at Addison and Sheffield, across the street from Wrigley Field. He met his wife Cecelia in the Wrigley bleachers and simply states that "my family and I are Cubs fans".[9] The bid was reviewed by Major League Baseball and other stake holders. Although several close friends told the press about Ricketts's deep love for the Cubs, the Ricketts family decided not to court media attention until the bid was accepted by all parties.[9]
On July 6, 2009, the Chicago Tribune reported that Tom Ricketts and family had reached an agreement with the Tribune Company to purchase the Cubs, Wrigley Field, and 25% of Comcast SportsNet Chicago for close to $900 million, as was originally reported. The contract was sent to commissioner Bud Selig for approval.[13] Final approval came by a unanimous vote of the other MLB owners in an October 6, 2009 conference call.[4] On October 27, 2009, the Ricketts family, with Thomas S. Ricketts as board chairman, officially took over 95% ownership of the Chicago Cubs, Wrigley Field, and 25% ownership of Comcast SportsNet Chicago. The Tribune opted to retain a 5% ownership stake in the team.[14]
Business history[edit]




Ricketts in 2011


With his father J. Joseph Ricketts and his brother J. Peter Ricketts, Thomas Ricketts currently serves as a director of TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation. In addition he serves as chairman and CEO of Incapital LLC.[1] Ricketts spent one summer early in life working at TD Ameritrade, giving customers stock quotes over the phone. This was his only work experience with the company before being invited to join as a director later in life.[15]
Mesirow Financial and ABN AMRO[edit]
When Ricketts finished undergraduate studies (1988), he joined the Chicago Board Options Exchange as a market maker. Ricketts held this position until 1994, shortly after finishing his MBA. From 1995 to 1996, he served as vice president with Mesirow Financial until moving to ABN AMRO as vice president in their brokerage division.[1] Ricketts is credited with pioneering the idea of using the Internet and other technologies to help companies sell their investment-grade bonds directly to retail investors, as opposed to limiting sales only to institutions.[15][16] He helped launch the first successful version of this system while at ABN AMRO. In 1999 he left ABN AMRO to found Incapital.[1]
Incapital LLC[edit]
Thomas Ricketts co-founded Chicago-based Incapital LLC in 1999.[1] The securities and investment banking firm has since expanded with two additional offices in Boca Raton, Florida and London, England.[17] Currently, Ricketts serves as Incapital chairman and chief executive officer. Forbes describes the company as a "technologically-oriented investment bank focused exclusively on the underwriting and distribution of fixed income products to individual investors. Incapital underwrites for several major U.S. corporations through its InterNotesSM product platform".[1]

He is also a director of TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation as well as the son of Ameritrade founder J.

In January 2009, a Ricketts family bid led by Thomas Ricketts was chosen as the winning bidder for the Chicago Cubs. The bid was estimated to total around $875 million for the team and related assets.[3] The sale was approved unanimously by the owners of the other 29 Major League Baseball teams that October.[4] Ricketts was introduced as the chairman of the Cubs on October 31, 2009. The transaction closed in late October 2009. All four siblings (Pete, Tom, Laura, and Todd) and both parents share interest in the team through their family trust.

Background[edit]
Ricketts is the son of Marlene Margaret (Volkmer) and J. Joseph Ricketts, who founded Ameritrade when Tom was eight years old. Ricketts Senior let it be known that he wanted his children to establish themselves through their own hard work and would not be allowed to join TD Ameritrade until they reached the age of 30.[5]
Ricketts is the eldest of four children. His younger brother J. Peter Ricketts, who lives in Omaha, is the 40th and current Governor of Nebraska[6] and was the unsuccessful Republican nominee for the 2006 U.S. Senate race in Nebraska.[7] Younger sister Laura Ricketts, a lawyer, developed and runs Ecotravel.com and serves on the board of directors of Lambda Legal.[8] Laura, Todd Ricketts, Tom Ricketts and his wife Cecelia and their five children all live in Wilmette, Illinois.
University of Chicago[edit]
In 1984, Ricketts moved from Omaha to Chicago in order to attend the University of Chicago. Just out of high school, he moved in with his younger brother Peter, also a student at the University of Chicago.[9] Ricketts received a bachelor's degree from the university in 1988 and returned to receive his Master of Business Administration in 1993. Ricketts's relationship with the university continued after graduation with reception of the Distinguished Young Alumni award from the university's Graduate School of Business.[10] The award is presented for, among other things, recognition of extraordinary career success, outstanding leadership, and influence in the business community to support the school and current students. In addition, as an alumnus Ricketts has been generous with donations to the university. This has included both volunteering his time and establishing an endowment for the New Year Scholarship Fund. Named after his joy of celebrating the Chinese New Year, the scholarship not only funds promising students but also allows for those students to meet with Ricketts and the other members of the endowment.[11]
Chicago Cubs[edit]

In April 2007, Sam Zell announced his intention to acquire the Chicago-based Tribune Company. After acquiring the Tribune, Zell announced that he would sell the Cubs and related entities including Wrigley Field and a 25% share of SportsNet Chicago.[9][12] Under bankruptcy protection, the sale of the Cubs and the 25% interest in SportsNet Chicago would raise needed funds for the ailing Tribune company. The Ricketts family bid, headed by Thomas S. Ricketts, was selected as the winning bid on January 22, 2009.[3] The family bid included all four siblings (Peter, Tom, Laura, and Todd) and both parents. Forbes estimated that the ownership stake in the Chicago Cubs represents $642 million out of the total $900 million bid made by Ricketts.[12]
Tom Ricketts has said that his love for the Chicago Cubs started during the 1984 season when he was 18 years old and moved to Chicago to attend university. Later, Tom and his brother Pete lived in an apartment over the "Sports Corner" at Addison and Sheffield, across the street from Wrigley Field. He met his wife Cecelia in the Wrigley bleachers and simply states that "my family and I are Cubs fans".[9] The bid was reviewed by Major League Baseball and other stake holders. Although several close friends told the press about Ricketts's deep love for the Cubs, the Ricketts family decided not to court media attention until the bid was accepted by all parties.[9]
On July 6, 2009, the Chicago Tribune reported that Tom Ricketts and family had reached an agreement with the Tribune Company to purchase the Cubs, Wrigley Field, and 25% of Comcast SportsNet Chicago for close to $900 million, as was originally reported. The contract was sent to commissioner Bud Selig for approval.[13] Final approval came by a unanimous vote of the other MLB owners in an October 6, 2009 conference call.[4] On October 27, 2009, the Ricketts family, with Thomas S. Ricketts as board chairman, officially took over 95% ownership of the Chicago Cubs, Wrigley Field, and 25% ownership of Comcast SportsNet Chicago. The Tribune opted to retain a 5% ownership stake in the team.[14]
Business history[edit]




Ricketts in 2011


With his father J. Joseph Ricketts and his brother J. Peter Ricketts, Thomas Ricketts currently serves as a director of TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation. In addition he serves as chairman and CEO of Incapital LLC.[1] Ricketts spent one summer early in life working at TD Ameritrade, giving customers stock quotes over the phone. This was his only work experience with the company before being invited to join as a director later in life.[15]
Mesirow Financial and ABN AMRO[edit]
When Ricketts finished undergraduate studies (1988), he joined the Chicago Board Options Exchange as a market maker. Ricketts held this position until 1994, shortly after finishing his MBA. From 1995 to 1996, he served as vice president with Mesirow Financial until moving to ABN AMRO as vice president in their brokerage division.[1] Ricketts is credited with pioneering the idea of using the Internet and other technologies to help companies sell their investment-grade bonds directly to retail investors, as opposed to limiting sales only to institutions.[15][16] He helped launch the first successful version of this system while at ABN AMRO. In 1999 he left ABN AMRO to found Incapital.[1]
Incapital LLC[edit]
Thomas Ricketts co-founded Chicago-based Incapital LLC in 1999.[1] The securities and investment banking firm has since expanded with two additional offices in Boca Raton, Florida and London, England.[17] Currently, Ricketts serves as Incapital chairman and chief executive officer. Forbes describes the company as a "technologically-oriented investment bank focused exclusively on the underwriting and distribution of fixed income products to individual investors. Incapital underwrites for several major U.S. corporations through its InterNotesSM product platform".[1]

Background[edit]
Ricketts is the son of Marlene Margaret (Volkmer) and J. Joseph Ricketts, who founded Ameritrade when Tom was eight years old. Ricketts Senior let it be known that he wanted his children to establish themselves through their own hard work and would not be allowed to join TD Ameritrade until they reached the age of 30.[5]
Ricketts is the eldest of four children. His younger brother J. Peter Ricketts, who lives in Omaha, is the 40th and current Governor of Nebraska[6] and was the unsuccessful Republican nominee for the 2006 U.S. Senate race in Nebraska.[7] Younger sister Laura Ricketts, a lawyer, developed and runs Ecotravel.com and serves on the board of directors of Lambda Legal.[8] Laura, Todd Ricketts, Tom Ricketts and his wife Cecelia and their five children all live in Wilmette, Illinois.
University of Chicago[edit]
In 1984, Ricketts moved from Omaha to Chicago in order to attend the University of Chicago. Just out of high school, he moved in with his younger brother Peter, also a student at the University of Chicago.[9] Ricketts received a bachelor's degree from the university in 1988 and returned to receive his Master of Business Administration in 1993. Ricketts's relationship with the university continued after graduation with reception of the Distinguished Young Alumni award from the university's Graduate School of Business.[10] The award is presented for, among other things, recognition of extraordinary career success, outstanding leadership, and influence in the business community to support the school and current students. In addition, as an alumnus Ricketts has been generous with donations to the university. This has included both volunteering his time and establishing an endowment for the New Year Scholarship Fund. Named after his joy of celebrating the Chinese New Year, the scholarship not only funds promising students but also allows for those students to meet with Ricketts and the other members of the endowment.[11]
Chicago Cubs[edit]

In April 2007, Sam Zell announced his intention to acquire the Chicago-based Tribune Company. After acquiring the Tribune, Zell announced that he would sell the Cubs and related entities including Wrigley Field and a 25% share of SportsNet Chicago.[9][12] Under bankruptcy protection, the sale of the Cubs and the 25% interest in SportsNet Chicago would raise needed funds for the ailing Tribune company. The Ricketts family bid, headed by Thomas S. Ricketts, was selected as the winning bid on January 22, 2009.[3] The family bid included all four siblings (Peter, Tom, Laura, and Todd) and both parents. Forbes estimated that the ownership stake in the Chicago Cubs represents $642 million out of the total $900 million bid made by Ricketts.[12]
Tom Ricketts has said that his love for the Chicago Cubs started during the 1984 season when he was 18 years old and moved to Chicago to attend university. Later, Tom and his brother Pete lived in an apartment over the "Sports Corner" at Addison and Sheffield, across the street from Wrigley Field. He met his wife Cecelia in the Wrigley bleachers and simply states that "my family and I are Cubs fans".[9] The bid was reviewed by Major League Baseball and other stake holders. Although several close friends told the press about Ricketts's deep love for the Cubs, the Ricketts family decided not to court media attention until the bid was accepted by all parties.[9]
On July 6, 2009, the Chicago Tribune reported that Tom Ricketts and family had reached an agreement with the Tribune Company to purchase the Cubs, Wrigley Field, and 25% of Comcast SportsNet Chicago for close to $900 million, as was originally reported. The contract was sent to commissioner Bud Selig for approval.[13] Final approval came by a unanimous vote of the other MLB owners in an October 6, 2009 conference call.[4] On October 27, 2009, the Ricketts family, with Thomas S. Ricketts as board chairman, officially took over 95% ownership of the Chicago Cubs, Wrigley Field, and 25% ownership of Comcast SportsNet Chicago. The Tribune opted to retain a 5% ownership stake in the team.[14]
Business history[edit]




Ricketts in 2011


With his father J. Joseph Ricketts and his brother J. Peter Ricketts, Thomas Ricketts currently serves as a director of TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation. In addition he serves as chairman and CEO of Incapital LLC.[1] Ricketts spent one summer early in life working at TD Ameritrade, giving customers stock quotes over the phone. This was his only work experience with the company before being invited to join as a director later in life.[15]
Mesirow Financial and ABN AMRO[edit]
When Ricketts finished undergraduate studies (1988), he joined the Chicago Board Options Exchange as a market maker. Ricketts held this position until 1994, shortly after finishing his MBA. From 1995 to 1996, he served as vice president with Mesirow Financial until moving to ABN AMRO as vice president in their brokerage division.[1] Ricketts is credited with pioneering the idea of using the Internet and other technologies to help companies sell their investment-grade bonds directly to retail investors, as opposed to limiting sales only to institutions.[15][16] He helped launch the first successful version of this system while at ABN AMRO. In 1999 he left ABN AMRO to found Incapital.[1]
Incapital LLC[edit]
Thomas Ricketts co-founded Chicago-based Incapital LLC in 1999.[1] The securities and investment banking firm has since expanded with two additional offices in Boca Raton, Florida and London, England.[17] Currently, Ricketts serves as Incapital chairman and chief executive officer. Forbes describes the company as a "technologically-oriented investment bank focused exclusively on the underwriting and distribution of fixed income products to individual investors. Incapital underwrites for several major U.S. corporations through its InterNotesSM product platform".[1]

He met his wife Cecelia in the Wrigley bleachers and simply states that "my family and I are Cubs fans".[9] The bid was reviewed by Major League Baseball and other stake holders. Although several close friends told the press about Ricketts's deep love for the Cubs, the Ricketts family decided not to court media attention until the bid was accepted by all parties.[9]
On July 6, 2009, the Chicago Tribune reported that Tom Ricketts and family had reached an agreement with the Tribune Company to purchase the Cubs, Wrigley Field, and 25% of Comcast SportsNet Chicago for close to $900 million, as was originally reported. The contract was sent to commissioner Bud Selig for approval.[13] Final approval came by a unanimous vote of the other MLB owners in an October 6, 2009 conference call.[4] On October 27, 2009, the Ricketts family, with Thomas S. Ricketts as board chairman, officially took over 95% ownership of the Chicago Cubs, Wrigley Field, and 25% ownership of Comcast SportsNet Chicago. The Tribune opted to retain a 5% ownership stake in the team.[14]
Business history[edit]




Ricketts in 2011


With his father J. Joseph Ricketts and his brother J. Peter Ricketts, Thomas Ricketts currently serves as a director of TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation. In addition he serves as chairman and CEO of Incapital LLC.[1] Ricketts spent one summer early in life working at TD Ameritrade, giving customers stock quotes over the phone. This was his only work experience with the company before being invited to join as a director later in life.[15]
Mesirow Financial and ABN AMRO[edit]
When Ricketts finished undergraduate studies (1988), he joined the Chicago Board Options Exchange as a market maker. Ricketts held this position until 1994, shortly after finishing his MBA. From 1995 to 1996, he served as vice president with Mesirow Financial until moving to ABN AMRO as vice president in their brokerage division.[1] Ricketts is credited with pioneering the idea of using the Internet and other technologies to help companies sell their investment-grade bonds directly to retail investors, as opposed to limiting sales only to institutions.[15][16] He helped launch the first successful version of this system while at ABN AMRO. In 1999 he left ABN AMRO to found Incapital.[1]
Incapital LLC[edit]
Thomas Ricketts co-founded Chicago-based Incapital LLC in 1999.[1] The securities and investment banking firm has since expanded with two additional offices in Boca Raton, Florida and London, England.[17] Currently, Ricketts serves as Incapital chairman and chief executive officer. Forbes describes the company as a "technologically-oriented investment bank focused exclusively on the underwriting and distribution of fixed income products to individual investors. Incapital underwrites for several major U.S. corporations through its InterNotesSM product platform".[1]

Early life and education[edit]
Todd Ricketts is the son of Marlene Margaret (née Volkmer) and Ameritrade founder and billionaire Joe Ricketts.[4] Forbes' estimate of the Ricketts' family wealth ($1 billion), consolidated under J. Joseph Ricketts name, placed them at No. 371 on the Forbes 400 list.[5] Ricketts is also brother of Pete Ricketts, current Governor of the U.S. state of Nebraska.
Ricketts earned a bachelor of arts in economics at Loyola University Chicago in 1994 and later attended the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business. Ricketts left Booth before finishing his MBA requirements to work as a trader at a New York-based startup, Knight Securities.[6]
Career[edit]
Ricketts worked for securities and investment banking firm Incapital and for the financial services firm Knight Securities. He also worked for Ameritrade in business development,[7] and he is on the board of directors of TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation (NASDAQ: AMTD).[1]
Ricketts is also on the board of directors of the Chicago Cubs.[8] In April 2007, Sam Zell announced his intention to acquire the Chicago-based Tribune Company. After acquiring the Tribune, Zell announced that he would sell the Cubs and related entities including Wrigley Field and a 25% share of SportsNet Chicago.[9] The Ricketts family bid was selected as the winning bid on January 22, 2009.[10] The family bid included all four siblings (Peter, Tom, Laura, and Todd) and both parents. Forbes estimated that the ownership stake in the Chicago Cubs represents $642 million out of the total $900 million bid.[9]
Ricketts is an owner of Napolita Pizzeria in Wilmette, Illinois and Higher Gear Bike Shops in Wilmette, Illinois and Highland Park, Illinois and a member of the board of directors of World Bicycle Relief.[11][12]
Since 2013, Ricketts has been a member of the board of directors and CEO of a non-profit small government advocacy group called Ending Spending Inc.[13][14] Ending Spending was founded by Joe Ricketts in 2010 to advocate against congressional earmarks.[15]
Political activity[edit]
Ricketts was an influential fundraiser and donor during the 2016 US presidential election, supporting Wisconsin governor Scott Walker during the Republican Party primaries.[16] He was named co-chair of Walker's fundraising drive in May 2015.[17]
Ricketts manages the conservative political operations for the Republican wing of the Ricketts family.[7] After Walker bowed out of the race in September 2015,[18] the Ricketts family donated $5.5 million to Our Principles PAC, a super PAC opposing the candidacy of Donald Trump.[19][20] Once Trump became the presumptive nominee of the Republican Party, Ricketts reversed his stance, throwing his support to Trump.[19] In May 2016, Ricketts was chosen as an at-large member of the Illinois delegation to the Republican National Convention.[21] During the tail end of the general election, Ricketts participated in fundraisers in Chicago for Trump's candidacy and helped to raise money for the pro-Trump super PACs 45 Committee and Future 45, raising over $66 million.[22][16]
Nomination as Deputy Secretary of Commerce[edit]
On November 24, 2016, reports surfaced that President-elect Donald Trump would appoint Ricketts as Deputy Secretary of Commerce.[23] On November 30, 2016, Trump officially announced the nomination of Ricketts as Deputy Secretary of Commerce.[2]
On April 19, 2017, Ricketts withdrew his nomination from consideration citing the inability to untangle his financial holdings to the satisfaction of the Office of Government Ethics.[24]
Philanthropy[edit]
Ricketts is vice chairman of The National WWII Museum in New Orleans, and is on the board of Opportunity Education Foundation. He is a Regent at Loyola University Chicago. He is also active with The Churchill Centre.[25]
Undercover Boss[edit]
On November 7, 2010, Ricketts appeared on the reality television series Undercover Boss, going incognito as an entry-level employee at Wrigley Field. His brother Tom was also considered for the part, but the Cubs chose Todd as Tom was considered too recognizable.[26] Ricketts grew out his beard and wore fake glasses, assuming his alias — unemployed roofer "Mark Dawson".[27] From August 30 to September 8, during a nine-game Cubs' homestand, Ricketts worked a number of jobs at the ballpark, selling hot dogs, operating the scoreboard, picking up trash, and cleaning toilets. He was fired from his maintenance job during the episode.[26]
Personal life[edit]
Ricketts is married to French-Canadian Sylvie Légère.[8][28] His siblings are Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts, Lambda Legal board member Laura Ricketts, and Incapital CEO Thomas S. Ricketts.[29]
Awards and honors[edit]

Early life and education[edit]
Todd Ricketts is the son of Marlene Margaret (née Volkmer) and Ameritrade founder and billionaire Joe Ricketts.[4] Forbes' estimate of the Ricketts' family wealth ($1 billion), consolidated under J. Joseph Ricketts name, placed them at No. 371 on the Forbes 400 list.[5] Ricketts is also brother of Pete Ricketts, current Governor of the U.S. state of Nebraska.
Ricketts earned a bachelor of arts in economics at Loyola University Chicago in 1994 and later attended the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business. Ricketts left Booth before finishing his MBA requirements to work as a trader at a New York-based startup, Knight Securities.[6]
Career[edit]
Ricketts worked for securities and investment banking firm Incapital and for the financial services firm Knight Securities. He also worked for Ameritrade in business development,[7] and he is on the board of directors of TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation (NASDAQ: AMTD).[1]
Ricketts is also on the board of directors of the Chicago Cubs.[8] In April 2007, Sam Zell announced his intention to acquire the Chicago-based Tribune Company. After acquiring the Tribune, Zell announced that he would sell the Cubs and related entities including Wrigley Field and a 25% share of SportsNet Chicago.[9] The Ricketts family bid was selected as the winning bid on January 22, 2009.[10] The family bid included all four siblings (Peter, Tom, Laura, and Todd) and both parents. Forbes estimated that the ownership stake in the Chicago Cubs represents $642 million out of the total $900 million bid.[9]
Ricketts is an owner of Napolita Pizzeria in Wilmette, Illinois and Higher Gear Bike Shops in Wilmette, Illinois and Highland Park, Illinois and a member of the board of directors of World Bicycle Relief.[11][12]
Since 2013, Ricketts has been a member of the board of directors and CEO of a non-profit small government advocacy group called Ending Spending Inc.[13][14] Ending Spending was founded by Joe Ricketts in 2010 to advocate against congressional earmarks.[15]
Political activity[edit]
Ricketts was an influential fundraiser and donor during the 2016 US presidential election, supporting Wisconsin governor Scott Walker during the Republican Party primaries.[16] He was named co-chair of Walker's fundraising drive in May 2015.[17]
Ricketts manages the conservative political operations for the Republican wing of the Ricketts family.[7] After Walker bowed out of the race in September 2015,[18] the Ricketts family donated $5.5 million to Our Principles PAC, a super PAC opposing the candidacy of Donald Trump.[19][20] Once Trump became the presumptive nominee of the Republican Party, Ricketts reversed his stance, throwing his support to Trump.[19] In May 2016, Ricketts was chosen as an at-large member of the Illinois delegation to the Republican National Convention.[21] During the tail end of the general election, Ricketts participated in fundraisers in Chicago for Trump's candidacy and helped to raise money for the pro-Trump super PACs 45 Committee and Future 45, raising over $66 million.[22][16]
Nomination as Deputy Secretary of Commerce[edit]
On November 24, 2016, reports surfaced that President-elect Donald Trump would appoint Ricketts as Deputy Secretary of Commerce.[23] On November 30, 2016, Trump officially announced the nomination of Ricketts as Deputy Secretary of Commerce.[2]
On April 19, 2017, Ricketts withdrew his nomination from consideration citing the inability to untangle his financial holdings to the satisfaction of the Office of Government Ethics.[24]
Philanthropy[edit]
Ricketts is vice chairman of The National WWII Museum in New Orleans, and is on the board of Opportunity Education Foundation. He is a Regent at Loyola University Chicago. He is also active with The Churchill Centre.[25]
Undercover Boss[edit]
On November 7, 2010, Ricketts appeared on the reality television series Undercover Boss, going incognito as an entry-level employee at Wrigley Field. His brother Tom was also considered for the part, but the Cubs chose Todd as Tom was considered too recognizable.[26] Ricketts grew out his beard and wore fake glasses, assuming his alias — unemployed roofer "Mark Dawson".[27] From August 30 to September 8, during a nine-game Cubs' homestand, Ricketts worked a number of jobs at the ballpark, selling hot dogs, operating the scoreboard, picking up trash, and cleaning toilets. He was fired from his maintenance job during the episode.[26]
Personal life[edit]
Ricketts is married to French-Canadian Sylvie Légère.[8][28] His siblings are Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts, Lambda Legal board member Laura Ricketts, and Incapital CEO Thomas S. Ricketts.[29]
Awards and honors[edit]

2016 World Series Champion (as a member of the Cubs' Board of Directors).

Early life and education[edit]
Todd Ricketts is the son of Marlene Margaret (née Volkmer) and Ameritrade founder and billionaire Joe Ricketts.[4] Forbes' estimate of the Ricketts' family wealth ($1 billion), consolidated under J. Joseph Ricketts name, placed them at No. 371 on the Forbes 400 list.[5] Ricketts is also brother of Pete Ricketts, current Governor of the U.S. state of Nebraska.
Ricketts earned a bachelor of arts in economics at Loyola University Chicago in 1994 and later attended the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business. Ricketts left Booth before finishing his MBA requirements to work as a trader at a New York-based startup, Knight Securities.[6]
Career[edit]
Ricketts worked for securities and investment banking firm Incapital and for the financial services firm Knight Securities. He also worked for Ameritrade in business development,[7] and he is on the board of directors of TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation (NASDAQ: AMTD).[1]
Ricketts is also on the board of directors of the Chicago Cubs.[8] In April 2007, Sam Zell announced his intention to acquire the Chicago-based Tribune Company. After acquiring the Tribune, Zell announced that he would sell the Cubs and related entities including Wrigley Field and a 25% share of SportsNet Chicago.[9] The Ricketts family bid was selected as the winning bid on January 22, 2009.[10] The family bid included all four siblings (Peter, Tom, Laura, and Todd) and both parents. Forbes estimated that the ownership stake in the Chicago Cubs represents $642 million out of the total $900 million bid.[9]
Ricketts is an owner of Napolita Pizzeria in Wilmette, Illinois and Higher Gear Bike Shops in Wilmette, Illinois and Highland Park, Illinois and a member of the board of directors of World Bicycle Relief.[11][12]
Since 2013, Ricketts has been a member of the board of directors and CEO of a non-profit small government advocacy group called Ending Spending Inc.[13][14] Ending Spending was founded by Joe Ricketts in 2010 to advocate against congressional earmarks.[15]
Political activity[edit]
Ricketts was an influential fundraiser and donor during the 2016 US presidential election, supporting Wisconsin governor Scott Walker during the Republican Party primaries.[16] He was named co-chair of Walker's fundraising drive in May 2015.[17]
Ricketts manages the conservative political operations for the Republican wing of the Ricketts family.[7] After Walker bowed out of the race in September 2015,[18] the Ricketts family donated $5.5 million to Our Principles PAC, a super PAC opposing the candidacy of Donald Trump.[19][20] Once Trump became the presumptive nominee of the Republican Party, Ricketts reversed his stance, throwing his support to Trump.[19] In May 2016, Ricketts was chosen as an at-large member of the Illinois delegation to the Republican National Convention.[21] During the tail end of the general election, Ricketts participated in fundraisers in Chicago for Trump's candidacy and helped to raise money for the pro-Trump super PACs 45 Committee and Future 45, raising over $66 million.[22][16]
Nomination as Deputy Secretary of Commerce[edit]
On November 24, 2016, reports surfaced that President-elect Donald Trump would appoint Ricketts as Deputy Secretary of Commerce.[23] On November 30, 2016, Trump officially announced the nomination of Ricketts as Deputy Secretary of Commerce.[2]
On April 19, 2017, Ricketts withdrew his nomination from consideration citing the inability to untangle his financial holdings to the satisfaction of the Office of Government Ethics.[24]
Philanthropy[edit]
Ricketts is vice chairman of The National WWII Museum in New Orleans, and is on the board of Opportunity Education Foundation. He is a Regent at Loyola University Chicago. He is also active with The Churchill Centre.[25]
Undercover Boss[edit]
On November 7, 2010, Ricketts appeared on the reality television series Undercover Boss, going incognito as an entry-level employee at Wrigley Field. His brother Tom was also considered for the part, but the Cubs chose Todd as Tom was considered too recognizable.[26] Ricketts grew out his beard and wore fake glasses, assuming his alias — unemployed roofer "Mark Dawson".[27] From August 30 to September 8, during a nine-game Cubs' homestand, Ricketts worked a number of jobs at the ballpark, selling hot dogs, operating the scoreboard, picking up trash, and cleaning toilets. He was fired from his maintenance job during the episode.[26]
Personal life[edit]
Ricketts is married to French-Canadian Sylvie Légère.[8][28] His siblings are Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts, Lambda Legal board member Laura Ricketts, and Incapital CEO Thomas S. Ricketts.[29]
Awards and honors[edit]

2016 World Series Champion (as a member of the Cubs' Board of Directors).

After acquiring the Tribune, Zell announced that he would sell the Cubs and related entities including Wrigley Field and a 25% share of SportsNet Chicago.[9] The Ricketts family bid was selected as the winning bid on January 22, 2009.[10] The family bid included all four siblings (Peter, Tom, Laura, and Todd) and both parents. Forbes estimated that the ownership stake in the Chicago Cubs represents $642 million out of the total $900 million bid.[9]
Ricketts is an owner of Napolita Pizzeria in Wilmette, Illinois and Higher Gear Bike Shops in Wilmette, Illinois and Highland Park, Illinois and a member of the board of directors of World Bicycle Relief.[11][12]
Since 2013, Ricketts has been a member of the board of directors and CEO of a non-profit small government advocacy group called Ending Spending Inc.[13][14] Ending Spending was founded by Joe Ricketts in 2010 to advocate against congressional earmarks.[15]
Political activity[edit]
Ricketts was an influential fundraiser and donor during the 2016 US presidential election, supporting Wisconsin governor Scott Walker during the Republican Party primaries.[16] He was named co-chair of Walker's fundraising drive in May 2015.[17]
Ricketts manages the conservative political operations for the Republican wing of the Ricketts family.[7] After Walker bowed out of the race in September 2015,[18] the Ricketts family donated $5.5 million to Our Principles PAC, a super PAC opposing the candidacy of Donald Trump.[19][20] Once Trump became the presumptive nominee of the Republican Party, Ricketts reversed his stance, throwing his support to Trump.[19] In May 2016, Ricketts was chosen as an at-large member of the Illinois delegation to the Republican National Convention.[21] During the tail end of the general election, Ricketts participated in fundraisers in Chicago for Trump's candidacy and helped to raise money for the pro-Trump super PACs 45 Committee and Future 45, raising over $66 million.[22][16]
Nomination as Deputy Secretary of Commerce[edit]
On November 24, 2016, reports surfaced that President-elect Donald Trump would appoint Ricketts as Deputy Secretary of Commerce.[23] On November 30, 2016, Trump officially announced the nomination of Ricketts as Deputy Secretary of Commerce.[2]
On April 19, 2017, Ricketts withdrew his nomination from consideration citing the inability to untangle his financial holdings to the satisfaction of the Office of Government Ethics.[24]
Philanthropy[edit]
Ricketts is vice chairman of The National WWII Museum in New Orleans, and is on the board of Opportunity Education Foundation. He is a Regent at Loyola University Chicago. He is also active with The Churchill Centre.[25]
Undercover Boss[edit]
On November 7, 2010, Ricketts appeared on the reality television series Undercover Boss, going incognito as an entry-level employee at Wrigley Field. His brother Tom was also considered for the part, but the Cubs chose Todd as Tom was considered too recognizable.[26] Ricketts grew out his beard and wore fake glasses, assuming his alias — unemployed roofer "Mark Dawson".[27] From August 30 to September 8, during a nine-game Cubs' homestand, Ricketts worked a number of jobs at the ballpark, selling hot dogs, operating the scoreboard, picking up trash, and cleaning toilets. He was fired from his maintenance job during the episode.[26]
Personal life[edit]
Ricketts is married to French-Canadian Sylvie Légère.[8][28] His siblings are Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts, Lambda Legal board member Laura Ricketts, and Incapital CEO Thomas S. Ricketts.[29]

Early life and education[edit]
Todd Ricketts is the son of Marlene Margaret (née Volkmer) and Ameritrade founder and billionaire Joe Ricketts.[4] Forbes' estimate of the Ricketts' family wealth ($1 billion), consolidated under J. Joseph Ricketts name, placed them at No. 371 on the Forbes 400 list.[5] Ricketts is also brother of Pete Ricketts, current Governor of the U.S. state of Nebraska.
Ricketts earned a bachelor of arts in economics at Loyola University Chicago in 1994 and later attended the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business. Ricketts left Booth before finishing his MBA requirements to work as a trader at a New York-based startup, Knight Securities.[6]
Career[edit]
Ricketts worked for securities and investment banking firm Incapital and for the financial services firm Knight Securities. He also worked for Ameritrade in business development,[7] and he is on the board of directors of TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation (NASDAQ: AMTD).[1]
Ricketts is also on the board of directors of the Chicago Cubs.[8] In April 2007, Sam Zell announced his intention to acquire the Chicago-based Tribune Company. After acquiring the Tribune, Zell announced that he would sell the Cubs and related entities including Wrigley Field and a 25% share of SportsNet Chicago.[9] The Ricketts family bid was selected as the winning bid on January 22, 2009.[10] The family bid included all four siblings (Peter, Tom, Laura, and Todd) and both parents. Forbes estimated that the ownership stake in the Chicago Cubs represents $642 million out of the total $900 million bid.[9]
Ricketts is an owner of Napolita Pizzeria in Wilmette, Illinois and Higher Gear Bike Shops in Wilmette, Illinois and Highland Park, Illinois and a member of the board of directors of World Bicycle Relief.[11][12]
Since 2013, Ricketts has been a member of the board of directors and CEO of a non-profit small government advocacy group called Ending Spending Inc.[13][14] Ending Spending was founded by Joe Ricketts in 2010 to advocate against congressional earmarks.[15]
Political activity[edit]
Ricketts was an influential fundraiser and donor during the 2016 US presidential election, supporting Wisconsin governor Scott Walker during the Republican Party primaries.[16] He was named co-chair of Walker's fundraising drive in May 2015.[17]
Ricketts manages the conservative political operations for the Republican wing of the Ricketts family.[7] After Walker bowed out of the race in September 2015,[18] the Ricketts family donated $5.5 million to Our Principles PAC, a super PAC opposing the candidacy of Donald Trump.[19][20] Once Trump became the presumptive nominee of the Republican Party, Ricketts reversed his stance, throwing his support to Trump.[19] In May 2016, Ricketts was chosen as an at-large member of the Illinois delegation to the Republican National Convention.[21] During the tail end of the general election, Ricketts participated in fundraisers in Chicago for Trump's candidacy and helped to raise money for the pro-Trump super PACs 45 Committee and Future 45, raising over $66 million.[22][16]
Nomination as Deputy Secretary of Commerce[edit]
On November 24, 2016, reports surfaced that President-elect Donald Trump would appoint Ricketts as Deputy Secretary of Commerce.[23] On November 30, 2016, Trump officially announced the nomination of Ricketts as Deputy Secretary of Commerce.[2]

Philanthropy[edit]

Undercover Boss[edit]
On November 7, 2010, Ricketts appeared on the reality television series Undercover Boss, going incognito as an entry-level employee at Wrigley Field. His brother Tom was also considered for the part, but the Cubs chose Todd as Tom was considered too recognizable.[26] Ricketts grew out his beard and wore fake glasses, assuming his alias — unemployed roofer "Mark Dawson".[27] From August 30 to September 8, during a nine-game Cubs' homestand, Ricketts worked a number of jobs at the ballpark, selling hot dogs, operating the scoreboard, picking up trash, and cleaning toilets. He was fired from his maintenance job during the episode.[26]
Personal life[edit]
Ricketts is married to French-Canadian Sylvie Légère.[8][28] His siblings are Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts, Lambda Legal board member Laura Ricketts, and Incapital CEO Thomas S. Ricketts.[29]

Early life and education[edit]
Todd Ricketts is the son of Marlene Margaret (née Volkmer) and Ameritrade founder and billionaire Joe Ricketts.[4] Forbes' estimate of the Ricketts' family wealth ($1 billion), consolidated under J. Joseph Ricketts name, placed them at No. 371 on the Forbes 400 list.[5] Ricketts is also brother of Pete Ricketts, current Governor of the U.S. state of Nebraska.
Ricketts earned a bachelor of arts in economics at Loyola University Chicago in 1994 and later attended the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business. Ricketts left Booth before finishing his MBA requirements to work as a trader at a New York-based startup, Knight Securities.[6]
Career[edit]
Ricketts worked for securities and investment banking firm Incapital and for the financial services firm Knight Securities. He also worked for Ameritrade in business development,[7] and he is on the board of directors of TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation (NASDAQ: AMTD).[1]
Ricketts is also on the board of directors of the Chicago Cubs.[8] In April 2007, Sam Zell announced his intention to acquire the Chicago-based Tribune Company. After acquiring the Tribune, Zell announced that he would sell the Cubs and related entities including Wrigley Field and a 25% share of SportsNet Chicago.[9] The Ricketts family bid was selected as the winning bid on January 22, 2009.[10] The family bid included all four siblings (Peter, Tom, Laura, and Todd) and both parents. Forbes estimated that the ownership stake in the Chicago Cubs represents $642 million out of the total $900 million bid.[9]
Ricketts is an owner of Napolita Pizzeria in Wilmette, Illinois and Higher Gear Bike Shops in Wilmette, Illinois and Highland Park, Illinois and a member of the board of directors of World Bicycle Relief.[11][12]
Since 2013, Ricketts has been a member of the board of directors and CEO of a non-profit small government advocacy group called Ending Spending Inc.[13][14] Ending Spending was founded by Joe Ricketts in 2010 to advocate against congressional earmarks.[15]
Political activity[edit]
Ricketts was an influential fundraiser and donor during the 2016 US presidential election, supporting Wisconsin governor Scott Walker during the Republican Party primaries.[16] He was named co-chair of Walker's fundraising drive in May 2015.[17]
Ricketts manages the conservative political operations for the Republican wing of the Ricketts family.[7] After Walker bowed out of the race in September 2015,[18] the Ricketts family donated $5.5 million to Our Principles PAC, a super PAC opposing the candidacy of Donald Trump.[19][20] Once Trump became the presumptive nominee of the Republican Party, Ricketts reversed his stance, throwing his support to Trump.[19] In May 2016, Ricketts was chosen as an at-large member of the Illinois delegation to the Republican National Convention.[21] During the tail end of the general election, Ricketts participated in fundraisers in Chicago for Trump's candidacy and helped to raise money for the pro-Trump super PACs 45 Committee and Future 45, raising over $66 million.[22][16]
Nomination as Deputy Secretary of Commerce[edit]
On November 24, 2016, reports surfaced that President-elect Donald Trump would appoint Ricketts as Deputy Secretary of Commerce.[23] On November 30, 2016, Trump officially announced the nomination of Ricketts as Deputy Secretary of Commerce.[2]
On April 19, 2017, Ricketts withdrew his nomination from consideration citing the inability to untangle his financial holdings to the satisfaction of the Office of Government Ethics.[24]
Philanthropy[edit]
Ricketts is vice chairman of The National WWII Museum in New Orleans, and is on the board of Opportunity Education Foundation. He is a Regent at Loyola University Chicago. He is also active with The Churchill Centre.[25]
Undercover Boss[edit]
On November 7, 2010, Ricketts appeared on the reality television series Undercover Boss, going incognito as an entry-level employee at Wrigley Field. His brother Tom was also considered for the part, but the Cubs chose Todd as Tom was considered too recognizable.[26] Ricketts grew out his beard and wore fake glasses, assuming his alias — unemployed roofer "Mark Dawson".[27] From August 30 to September 8, during a nine-game Cubs' homestand, Ricketts worked a number of jobs at the ballpark, selling hot dogs, operating the scoreboard, picking up trash, and cleaning toilets. He was fired from his maintenance job during the episode.[26]
Personal life[edit]
Ricketts is married to French-Canadian Sylvie Légère.[8][28] His siblings are Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts, Lambda Legal board member Laura Ricketts, and Incapital CEO Thomas S. Ricketts.[29]
Awards and honors[edit]

2016 World Series Champion (as a member of the Cubs' Board of Directors).
