1. The performance reflects the asset charges for Series I shares from inception to January 27, 2002, and the asset charges for Series II shares for the time periods subsequent to January 27, 2002. The performance for Series II shares will be lower than Series I shares due to the higher Series II 12b-1 fee.


2. During the time period shown in the chart, the Lifestyles, Science & Technology, Blue Chip Growth, Equity-Income, Health Sciences and Small Company Value portfolios expenses were reimbursed. If such expenses had not been reimbursed, returns would be lower. Expense reimbursement for the International Core portfolio was terminated 11/25/02. Expense reimbursement for the Capital Appreciation portfolio was terminated effective 5/15/01.


3. The portfolios in the John Hanocck Variable Insurance Trust described above are not retail mutual funds and are only available under variable annuity contracts, variable life policies, or through participation in tax qualified retirement plans. Although the portfolios' investment adviser or subadvisers may manage retail mutual funds with similar names and investment objectives, no representation is made, and no assurance is given, that any portfolio's investment results will be comparable to the investment results of any other fund, including other funds with the same investment adviser or subadviser. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

John Hancock Establishes New Series of R Share Classes
October 13, 2011 (PLANSPONSOR.com) - John Hancock Funds has established a new series of R share classes for many of its mutual funds. 
By Tara Cantore editors@plansponsor.com | October 13, 2011 Page 1 of 2			View Full Article 






















  














Known as R6 shares, the class is available to all retirement plans and institutional non-retirement accounts (above $1 million). The R6 shares represent John Hancock Funds' lowest-priced share class, according to a press release. Currently the class is available on the Frontier Trust (utilized by Ascensus), Matrix, and Mid-Atlantic Trust Company trading platforms with other platforms coming online in the near future."Demand for share classes with greater transparency and economy in our defined contribution-investment only business has increased significantly," said Keith F. Hartstein, President & CEO, John Hancock Funds, in the announcement. "And so we created the R6 share class in response to Registered Investment Advisers and retirement plan sponsors who desire fund classes without 12b-1 fees or other administrative and service fees on many of our funds."John Hancock Funds now offering R6 shares include: John Hancock Alternative Asset Allocation Fund; John Hancock Disciplined Value and John Hancock Disciplined Value Mid Cap Funds; John Hancock Global Opportunities Fund; John Hancock Lifecycle 2010 - 2045 Portfolios; John Hancock Lifestyle Aggressive, Balanced, Conservative, Growth, and Moderate Portfolios; John Hancock Strategic Income; and John Hancock Strategic Income Opportunities Funds.For one year after the commencement of operations of Class R6 shares of the fund, certain existing investors of Class I shares who own a minimum of $250,000 of Class I shares of the fund, and do not require the fund or its affiliates to make any type of administrative payments, may exchange all of their Class I shares for Class R6 shares of the fund.
