A basic introduction to soldering from TEquipment:


 


Weller is a German company that is well-known in the world of soldering. The company's cyan colored soldering irons and stations can be found in labs, plants, and home workshops around the world. Weller is credited with the development of the first temperature controlled soldering iron in 1960. Since then the company has continued to innovate and improve soldering with instruments like the first analog and digital controlled soldering stations and the first ever intelligent, energy efficient soldering tools that save you money and help save the environment. 

In this category you will find more than just Weller soldering irons and stations. Weller offers products that cover many areas of soldering and help make soldering easier for you and as a result, quicker and more efficient. These include BGA rework stations, desoldering and rework stations, fume extractors, soldering stands, solder dispensers, pre-heaters, and a wide variety of replacement tips and nozzles for irons, pencils, and guns.

 
Types of Weller Soldering Equipment:

BGA Rework Station: BGA rework stations are used for the manual alignment, replacement, or removal of BGA, μBGA, CSP, and other surface mount components with repeatable solder reflow profiles.
Desoldering Equipment/Rework Stations: Desoldering is the process of removing solder. It is done to repair, replace, and salvage electronics in a variety of applications.
Dispensing Equipment: Dispensing equipment is used to dispense solder wire automatically at the tip of your soldering iron so you have less to hold in your hands while soldering. 
Fume Extraction: Fume extraction devices are used to absorb widespread smoke and/or smoke around equipment users given off during soldering. You should always use a a fume extractor or work in an open area because soldering fumes are toxic.
Hot Air Guns: In soldering, hot air guns are used to heat up circuit boards or components prior to soldering to prevent damage. These guns can also be used for stripping paint, heat shrink tubing, curing epoxy, and defrosting frozen plumbing, among others.
Nozzles: Soldering nozzles are used on hot air pencils and with rework stations. They transfer the heat to the connection point.
Pre-Heater: Pre-heaters provide fast, efficient underside heating and reduce the possibility of thermal damage to sensitive components.
Soldering Equipment: Soldering equipment includes soldering stations and soldering guns, irons, and pencils.
Soldering Pots: Soldering pots are portable devices used to melt solder and for dip soldering small items as well as tinning the ends of wire leads.
Soldering Stands: Soldering stands hold many different types of soldering irons. They make soldering and desoldering easier.
Tips: Soldering tips transfer the heat to the connection point. They are essential to the soldering process and come in a variety of sizes and styles to meet a range of needs.

Weller Soldering Equipment
Weller soldering equipment is easily recognizable due to its cyan color. Weller has been manufacturing affordable and capable soldering tools for over 100 years. The company's disticntly German attention to detail and quality sets its soldering equipment apart from any other similar tools on the market today.
 
There are many soldering tools and accessories available from Weller to meet a variety of needs for both hobbyists and professionals. Regardless of your specific need, it is important to remember these two things when purchasing soldering tools:

Temperature range and variable control are key. These features will help improve soldering by giving you added versatility. By adjusting temperature you can safely solder around sensitive components and improve heat-up time. Be sure to consider temperature range and variable control when choosing a Weller soldering station.
Keep extra nozzles and tips on hand. Anyone who has soldered knowns tips/nozzles can be exhausted quickly at times. Luckily, these parts are inexpensive. It is easier and more cost effective to purchase extra in advance rather than place another order and pay for shipping in the future.

Types of Weller Soldering Equipment:

Analog Soldering Stations: Weller analog soldering stations are not as accurate as their digital counterparts, but they are more affordable and feature a digital electronic control system which is able to control  performance. 
Digital Soldering Stations: In addition to the features and applications similar to those offered by analog soldering stations, digital soldering stations provide a digital readout as well as better temperature control. 
Soldering Pencils and Parts: Soldering pencils are ideal for small jobs. Soldering pencils come in a variety of sizes and styles such as screwdriver tips, long conical, and more. Extra parts, such as heating elements, barrel nuts, and spare tips, are available from Weller.
Soldering Guns: Soldering guns come in a variety of sizes and styles. They feature a looped tip and “trigger” switch. Extra parts are available from Weller.
Soldering Irons. Soldering irons come in a variety of sizes and styles. They feature a heated tip and insulated handle. Weller offers irons with built-in LED lights for maximum work area illumination. Applications include installation, repairs, and limited production work.

Desoldering Tweezers: Weller desoldering tweezers are compatible with most Weller rework/desoldering stations including WRS, WSL, EC, WS, and WSD models. They are designed to make desoldering of SMD components fast and efficient. 
Air Blower Tool: An air blower tool completely removes any solder remaining in through-holes. Weller offers handheld air blowers called solder-off bulbs as well as bulbs that attach directly to soldering/desoldering pencils. 

This video gives an overview of one type of desoldering tool, the Weller WHA3000 series of hot air stations.
 


 

Weller Dispensing Equipment      
Weller Dispensing Equipment is used to dispense solder and solder paste. Weller products include syringes, dispensing needles, and dispensing guns. They help users avoid spills and waste as well as free up space in the user's hands. Weller dispensing equipment is available in a variety of sizes and styles for different wire gauges and applications. 
 
Weller Fume Extraction  
Weller Fume Extraction devices are used to absorb widespread smoke and/or smoke around equipment users. They extract the contaminated air directly at the source, improving air quality and increasing user safety. Weller offers bench top smoke absorbers and fume extraction systems.

Weller Fume Extractor Types:
 
Bench Top Smoke Absorbers
 
Weller bench top smoke absorbers are ESD-safe and remove soldering smoke and fumes quickly, safely, and efficiently. This improves the air quality in the work area and increases worker safety. Weller bench top smoke absorbers use easily-replaced activated carbon filters to ensure work area air is clean and safe.

Fume Extraction Systems
 
Weller Fume Extraction Systems are used with soldering stations to extract contaminated air. Some Weller extraction systems feature hoses that connect to the end of your soldering iron to completely capture fumes directly at the source. Other Weller extraction systems use one or more rigid ducts with attached hoods to capture contaminated air from the workplace surrounding the soldering station. The purified air is returned to the work area.
 
This video demostrates how effective the Weller WFE Zero Smog series of fume extractors is in keeping work area air clean.


 

Weller Hot Air Guns      
Weller Hot Air Guns are typically used to heat components and boards prior to soldering to prevent damage to sensitive electronics. These guns are also useful for efficient drying as well as heat-shrinking, thawing frozen pipes, heating liquids, bending materials, and more. They are used in production plants, laboratories and service shops as well as other industries.

Why is temperature control important in Hot Air Guns?

All hot air guns available from Weller have different wattages and therefore different maximum temperatures. That said each Weller hot air gun features a temperature switch which adjusts wattage to change maximum temperature. These guns feature 2 switchable wattages (i.e. high/low). This may not be important for a home or occasional hot air gun application, but industrial uses often have specifications that must be met. With selectable temperatures, you can avoid costly damage to critical components due to overheating and performance issues later due to insufficient heat.
 
Weller Nozzles
Weller Soldering Nozzles are used on hot air pencils and with rework stations. They transfer heat to the connection point. They are essential to the soldering process and come in a variety of sizes and styles to meet a range of needs. It is a good idea to purchase spare nozzles in advance. This will save you time and money in the long run.

Types of Weller Nozzles
 
Nozzles come in a variety styles and sizes to meet a range of needs. The available styles include the following: 

Flat Hot Air Nozzle
4-Sides Heated Nozzle
2-Sides Heated Nozzle
Round Bent Nozzle
Round Hot Gas Nozzle
Round Nozzle
Hot Air Measuring Nozzle

Weller Pre-Heaters for PCBs
Weller Pre-Heaters provide fast, efficient underside heating for circuit boards. They make soldering and desoldering easier by reducing the heat required of the soldering tool. This reduces the risk of thermal damage to sensitive components. Pre-heaters are used in a variety of applications such as circuit board repair and rework of digital cameras, cell phones, and other electronic devices. Weller pre-heaters are available in a variety of sizes and maximum temperatures.

Certain Weller pre-heaters require external power via Weller power units. Others are totally integrated digital units; these Weller pre-heaters allow for accurate temperature control. Weller pre-heaters come equipped with 1-3 IR heating units and are available from 80-1000 Watts. Auto-off and Standby features are standard on most units.

 
Weller Soldering Pots
Weller Soldering Pots are portable devices used to melt solder and for dip soldering small items as well as tinning the ends of wire leads. They are ideal for smaller jobs that require reliable temperature control.
 
Key Features of Weller Soldering Pots:

Usable with lead-free solder
Solder bath is placed in a V2A tray to guard against dripping solder
Variable temperature control from 150-850/150-999 degrees Fahrenheit
Available in 80W/150W
