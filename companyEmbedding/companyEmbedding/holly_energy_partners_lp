Here's What HollyFrontier's Management Wants You to Know About Its Future
Several changes are likely coming for HollyFrontier related to its new lubricant business and its ownership of Holly Energy Partners.











                Tyler Crowe
            

                (TMFDirtyBird)



            
            Jul 12, 2017 at 7:33PM
            
            





These past several months have been a pretty transformative time for oil refiner HollyFrontier (NYSE:HFC) and its subsidiary master limited partnership Holly Energy Partners (NYSE:HEP). HollyFrontier made a big acquisition back in October that has the potential to do great things for the bottom line. To make it happen, though, it had to utilize Holly Energy Partners in a unique way by dropping down some assets that don't typically fit the mold of a pipeline partnership.
With these moves complete, HollyFrontier's management is now positioning itself for the next chapter. Here are several quotes from the most recent conference call that highlight how management plans to tackle the next several months and years.

Outlook improving
The past year and a half has been a tough time for refiners in general, but it has been especially hard on refiners that don't have export capabilities like HollyFrontier. Rising crude prices and high levels of gasoline and diesel inventories led to low margins and, inevitably, almost non-existent bottom line results. It looks like the market is starting to turn, though. According to CEO George Damiris, the outlook for the rest of the year looks much better:

Our refining outlook for 2017 remains cautiously optimistic. We anticipate solid economic growth will continue to support refined product demand and sustained growth in domestic crude oil production will lead to improved crude differentials... With a large portion of our scheduled maintenance behind us, we are poised for strong financial and operational performance for the remainder of the year.

It should be noted that Damiris gave this outlook before oil prices started to decline again in recent weeks. Refiners tend to feast in a declining crude price environment, so don't be surprised if second-quarter results come in better than expected. 
Lubricant business performing well
This past quarter was the first time that HollyFrontier reported results for its recent PetroCanada Lubricants (PLCI) acquisition. Damiris noted that the partial result from the two months was better than expected and that there are several opportunities to get even better. 

The integration of PCLI continues to progress smoothly. We appreciate the warm reception from our new, talented, knowledgeable and dedicated colleagues. We welcome them and the skills and capabilities they bring to HFC.
We remain confident in our $20 million per year synergy target and expect to realize these benefits as we further integrate our 2 lubricants businesses. Combining PCLI with our existing Tulsa specialty lubricants business creates scale, diversity, operational and financial synergies and a solid platform for growth. There is also opportunity to increase Group III base oil production through feedstock optimization, allowing for significant margin uplift potential. 

Group III base oils are a lubricant with higher viscosity ratings, which means they can handle higher pressures and temperatures. Automotive manufacturers are using them more and more because they reduce engine friction -- better gas mileage -- and extend the life of an engine. This gives HollyFtontier an immense opportunity and is probably the best place for HollyFrontier to allocate capital at this time. The average per barrel margin for Group III base oils in the first quarter was $61. Compare that to the $10 per barrel margin for conventional refining, and you can easily see why this is a lucrative business. 





Fixing the blemish
Perhaps the biggest stain on HollyFrontier's operational and financial results in recent quarters has been its Rocky Mountain assets, most notably the Cheyenne refinery. To fix this problem, management has dedicated a lot of human resources to get that facility back to fighting shape. According to Damiris, the team there has made a lot of progress over the past couple months. 

[W]e are very encouraged by what we have seen. I think -- I can't remember the exact number, but from the fourth quarter of last year, we ran roughly in the mid-30s. And as Tom said in his prepared remarks, in March, we ran 48,000 barrels per day. There's a lot of days where we're hitting 50,000 barrels per day. And that's where we need Cheyenne to be in that high 40s to 50,000 barrels per day range. 

Granted, Cheyenne is a much smaller facility than its other refineries, but any company in the refining business needs all its assets in top form in a low margin environment. If the company can boost productivity here, it should almost directly flow to the bottom line. 
A new relationship with Holly Energy Partners?
Even though master limited partnerships have been around for more than 30 years, it seems that management teams are still trying to figure out the most efficient way to structure the relationship between a limited partnership and its general or managing partner. Typically, the general partner will have incentive distribution rights (IDRs), which means the parent is entitled to a set percentage of distributable cash flow that increases as per share distributions increase. This structure gives the managing partner a lot of incentive to grow the partnership's payout. Over time, though, the percentage to which the general partner is entitled negatively impacts a company's cost of capital and constrains growth.  
As a result, we have seen several other MLPs get rid of this corporate structure lately instead of a high ownership of limited partner shares. Of course, analysts asked management if there were any plans to make a similar change related to Holly Energy Partners. Here was Damiris' response: 

Regarding the IDRs, we continue to work it. We've been a little bit preoccupied with our PCLI [PetroCanada Lubricants] acquisition integrating that into HollyFrontier. So a lot of the people and resources we needed to address the IDRs are just not being freed up from the PCLI activities. We'll continue to evaluate it and will probably be in a position to further address in subsequent quarterly calls. We think it makes a lot of sense to look at it. At the end of day, it's going to have to be something that's right for both the GP and the [LP], obviously. But it seems to make a lot of sense, but we have a lot of Is to dot and Ts to cross before we get to a point where we can make a call on this one.

By the sounds of it, we can probably expect something to happen in the coming quarters. One thing that Damiris did note, though, was that management is adamant about maintaining control of the partnership. It will be interesting to see what solution management comes up with to reconcile the discrepancy. 





A pause in growth
In the fourth quarter of 2016, HollyFrontier dropped down some refining units at its Woods Cross facility to Holly Energy Partners. Part of the logic behind the deal was to raise capital for the PetroCanada acquisition. This drop-down was considerably larger than most others Holly EnergyPartnerss has received in the past. As a result, Damiris noted that the company plans to tap the brakes on future sales to the partnership. 

[W]e're not anticipating drop-downs in 2017. Obviously, we did an outsize drop-down with the Woods Cross processing unit last year. We think we probably got a little more runway in the drop-downs of processing units. Obviously, we've done all the traditional logistics in terms of pipes and tanks. But really what we'd like to do, and this gets the IDR discussion is, we'd like to see HEP continue to grow externally, if you will. I think the other major area where we still have opportunities to leverage HFC for HEP's benefit is replacing other third-party service providers with HEP.

HollyFrontier doesn't have any more pipe or terminal assets that would be an ideal fit for Holly Energy Partners. That means the next phase of growth for the partnership will have to come from one of three places: build assets on its own; buy assets from third parties; or, as Damiris, mentioned, take on more refining units. Refining units aren't necessarily the best kind of assets for a business that wants steady cash flow. 
Another reason the company will want to hold off on any more development is that its current debt leverage is higher than its target level. Management says it wants to keep a net debt to EBITDA ratio of less than four times, and the company is currently above that for the time being. Luckily, the EBITDA contribution from Woods Cross should give it enough cash coming in the door for Holly Energy Partners to maintain its streak of 50 consecutive quarters with a distribution raise intact for a few more quarters until management figures out the next step.

Holly Energy Partners, L.P. Reports First Quarter Results


May 03, 2016

Download this Press Release (PDF 35 KB)

DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Holly Energy Partners, L.P. ("HEP" or the "Partnership") (NYSE:HEP)

 today reported financial results for the first quarter of 2016. For the

 quarter, distributable cash flow was $55.4 million, up $9.5 million, or

 21% compared to the first quarter of 2015. HEP announced its 46th consecutive

 distribution increase on April 22, 2016, raising the quarterly

 distribution from $0.565 to $0.575 per unit, which represents an

 increase of 7.0% over the distribution for the first quarter of 2015.

 


 Net income attributable to Holly Energy Partners for the first quarter

 was $42.8 million ($0.52 per basic and diluted limited partner unit)

 compared to $31.6 million ($0.37 per basic and diluted limited partner

 unit) for the first quarter of 2015. The increase in earnings is

 primarily due to increased revenues from our 75% interest in the UNEV

 products pipeline, our share of earnings from our 50% interest in

 Frontier Pipeline Company, and our refinery processing units acquired in

 the fourth quarter of 2015, as well as higher pipeline and terminal

 volumes and annual tariff increases.

 


 Commenting on the first quarter of 2016, Mike Jennings, Chief Executive

 Officer, stated, "We are pleased with our solid financial results for

 the first quarter of 2016, which allowed us to maintain our record of

 quarterly distribution increases, while maintaining a very strong

 distribution coverage ratio. We remain optimistic about our organic

 growth potential, especially on the UNEV products pipeline.

 Additionally, we successfully completed our acquisition of crude oil

 tankage at HollyFrontier Corporation's Tulsa refinery. As we look

 forward, we believe HEP is positioned for continued growth due to the

 quality and geographic location of our assets, our talented employee

 base, and our financially strong and supportive general partner,

 HollyFrontier."

 

First Quarter 2016 Revenue Highlights



 Revenues for the quarter were $102.0 million, an increase of $12.3

 million compared to the first quarter of 2015 due to the effect of

 higher pipeline volumes and annual tariff increases in addition to $4.5

 million increased revenue from the El Dorado operating units. Overall

 pipeline volumes were up 5% compared to the three months ended March 31,

 2015, largely due to increased volumes from pipelines servicing HFC's

 Navajo refinery and the UNEV pipeline.

 



 Revenues from our refined product pipelines were $39.9 million,

 an increase of $3.7 million compared to the first quarter of 2015

 mainly due to increased revenue from the UNEV pipeline of $2.9 million

 in addition to increased volumes and annual tariff increases.

 Shipments averaged 210.8 mbpd compared to 186.9 mbpd for the first

 quarter of 2015 mainly due to increased volumes from pipelines

 servicing HFC's Navajo refinery and the UNEV pipeline.

 


 Revenues from our intermediate pipelines were $7.4 million, an

 increase of $0.6 million, on shipments averaging 137.4 mbpd compared

 to 138.1 mbpd for the first quarter of 2015. Even though volumes

 decreased slightly, revenues increased due to annual tariff increases

 and an increase in deferred revenue realized.

 


 Revenues from our crude pipelines were $17.5 million, an

 increase of $0.5 million, on shipments averaging 287.4 mbpd compared

 to 282.7 mbpd for the first quarter of 2015. Revenues increased mainly

 due to increased volumes and annual tariff increases.

 


 Revenues from terminal, tankage and loading rack fees were

 $32.7 million, an increase of $3.0 million compared to the first

 quarter of 2015. Refined products terminalled in our facilities

 averaged 466.9 mbpd compared to 397.1 mbpd for the first quarter of

 2015. The volume increase is mainly due to inclusion of full quarter

 volumes from our El Dorado crude tanks acquired in the first quarter

 of 2015. Revenues increased due to increased revenue from the El

 Dorado crude tanks as well as increased volumes and annual tariff

 increases.

 



 Revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2016, include the

 recognition of $6.6 million of prior shortfalls billed to shippers in

 2015 as they did not meet their minimum volume commitments within the

 contractual make-up period. As of March 31, 2016, shortfall deferred

 revenue in our consolidated balance sheet was $2.8 million. Such

 deferred revenue will be recognized in earnings either as (a) payment

 for shipments in excess of guaranteed levels, if and to the extent the

 pipeline system has the necessary capacity for shipments in excess of

 guaranteed levels, or (b) when shipping rights expire unused over the

 contractual make-up period.

 

Operating Costs and Expenses Highlights



 Operating costs and expenses were $46.6 million for the three months

 ended March 31, 2016, representing an increase of $0.4 million from the

 three months ended March 31, 2015. This increase is primarily due to

 operating expenses for our El Dorado operating units acquired in the

 fourth quarter of 2015, and higher depreciation expense partially offset

 by lower environmental costs.

 


 Interest expense was $10.5 million for the three months ended March 31,

 2016, representing an increase of $1.8 million over the same period of

 2015. The increase for the three months ended March 31, 2016, is due to

 an increase in borrowings under our credit agreement.

 


 We have scheduled a webcast conference call today at 4:00 PM Eastern

 Time to discuss financial results. This webcast may be accessed at: https://event.webcasts.com/starthere.jsp?ei=1098789.

 


 An audio archive of this webcast will be available using the above noted

 link through May 17, 2016.

 Net income attributable to Holly Energy Partners is allocated

 between limited partners and the general partner interest in

 accordance with the provisions of the partnership agreement. Net

 income allocated to the general partner includes incentive

 distributions declared subsequent to quarter end. General partner

 incentive distributions were $11.5 million and $9.4 million for the

 three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

 Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization

 ("EBITDA") is calculated as net income attributable to Holly Energy

 Partners plus (i) interest expense and loss on early extinguishment

 of debt, net of interest income, (ii) state income tax and (iii)

 depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is not a calculation based

 upon generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). However, the

 amounts included in the EBITDA calculation are derived from amounts

 included in our consolidated financial statements. EBITDA should not

 be considered as an alternative to net income attributable to Holly

 Energy Partners or operating income, as an indication of our

 operating performance or as an alternative to operating cash flow as

 a measure of liquidity. EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to

 similarly titled measures of other companies. EBITDA is presented

 here because it is a widely used financial indicator used by

 investors and analysts to measure performance. EBITDA also is used

 by our management for internal analysis and as a basis for

 compliance with financial covenants.

 








  

 








 Set forth below is our calculation of EBITDA.

 Distributable cash flow is not a calculation based upon GAAP.

 However, the amounts included in the calculation are derived from

 amounts presented in our consolidated financial statements, with the

 general exception of maintenance capital expenditures. Distributable

 cash flow should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative

 to net income attributable to Holly Energy Partners or operating

 income, as an indication of our operating performance, or as an

 alternative to operating cash flow as a measure of liquidity.

 Distributable cash flow is not necessarily comparable to similarly

 titled measures of other companies. Distributable cash flow is

 presented here because it is a widely accepted financial indicator

 used by investors to compare partnership performance. It is also

 used by management for internal analysis and our performance units.

 We believe that this measure provides investors an enhanced

 perspective of the operating performance of our assets and the cash

 our business is generating.

 








  

 








 Set forth below is our calculation of distributable cash flow.

 *Maintenance capital expenditures are capital expenditures made to

 replace partially or fully depreciated assets in order to maintain

 the existing operating capacity of our assets and to extend their

 useful lives. Maintenance capital expenditures include expenditures

 required to maintain equipment reliability, tankage and pipeline

 integrity, and safety and to address environmental regulations.

 As a master limited partnership, we distribute our available cash,

 which historically has exceeded our net income attributable to Holly

 Energy Partners because depreciation and amortization expense

 represents a non-cash charge against income. The result is a decline

 in partners' equity since our regular quarterly distributions have

 exceeded our quarterly net income attributable to Holly Energy

 Partners. Additionally, if the assets contributed and acquired from

 HollyFrontier while we were a consolidated variable interest entity

 of HollyFrontier had been acquired from third parties, our

 acquisition cost in excess of HollyFrontier's basis in the

 transferred assets would have been recorded as increases to our

 properties and equipment and intangible assets at the time of

 acquisition instead of decreases to partners' equity.
