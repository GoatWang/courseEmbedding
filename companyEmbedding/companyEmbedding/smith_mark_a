Mark was brought into the organisation to fix a dysfunctional team which lacked strategic product direction.  He swiftly went about implementing Hypothesis Driven Development methodologies with the team and coached them to:
- identify real user problems, 
- scope potential solutions to address these problems; and
- identify appropriate ways to measure success – so they’d know whether they’d actually solved the identified problem. 

Mark worked extensively with teams to optimise end-to-end client experiences.  One amazing example was the implementation of an automated payment system, Recurly, to manage recurring payments. This resulted in immediate revenue uplifts as revenues were previously lost due to labourous manual processes.  

Mark is one of those rare senior product managers with commercial and technical expertise.  He’s able to create comprehensive strategic collateral, engage stakeholders and provide technical guidance to ensure the team can realise this vision. 

My only hope is we continue having opportunities to work together in the future.

Product Description▼▲
In 1983, twenty-seven-year-old Earl Smith arrived at San Quentin just like everyone thought he would. Labeled as a gang member and criminal from a young age, Smith was expected to do some time, but after a brush with death during a botched drug deal, Smith’s soul was saved and his life path was altered forever.From that moment on, Smith knew God had an unusual mission for him, and he became the minister to the lost souls sitting on death row. For twenty-three years, Smith played chess with Charles Manson, negotiated truces between rival gangs, and bore witness to the final thoughts of many death row inmates. But most importantly, Smith helped the prisoners of San Quentin find redemption, hope, and to understand that it is still possible to find God’s grace and mercy from behind bars.Edgy, insightful, and thought provoking, Death Row Chaplain teaches us God’s grace can reach anyone—even the most desperate and lost—and that it’s never too late to turn our lives around.

Publisher's Description▼▲
From a former criminal and now chaplain for the San Francisco 49ers and the Golden State Warriors, comes a riveting, behind-the-bars look at one of America’s most feared prisons: San Quentin. Reverend Earl Smith shares the most important lessons he’s learned from years of helping inmates discover God’s plan for them.In 1983, twenty-seven-year-old Earl Smith arrived at San Quentin just like everyone thought he would. Labeled as a gang member and criminal from a young age, Smith was expected to do some time, but after a brush with death during a botched drug deal, Smith’s soul was saved and his life path was altered forever.

Author Bio▼▲
Rev. Earl Smith became the youngest chaplain ever hired by the California Department of Corrections when he was asked to become the chaplain at San Quentin in 1983. In 2000, Earl was named National Correctional Chaplain of the Year. He currently serves as chaplain for the San Francisco 49ers and the Golden State Warriors. He has appeared on HBO, CNN, The 700 Club, Trinity Broadcasting and the Discovery Channel, and has been featured in Newsweek and Time. He was born and raised in Stockton, California, where he lives today with his wife, Angel, and their children Ebony, Earl Jr., Tamara, and Franklin.
Mark Schlabach is the coauthor of the New York Times bestselling books, Happy, Happy, Happy, Si-cology 1, and The Duck Commander Family. He is one of the most respected and popular college football columnists in the country. He and his wife live in Madison, Georgia, with their three children.


Editorial Reviews▼▲
"With the eloquence of a gifted sage, Earl A. Smith delivers a kind of visceral imagery that can only be acquired by firsthand knowledge of a life lived on both sides of the bars. He is uniquely qualified to bring the untold tales of faith, endurance, and perseverance from inside one of the world’s most notorious prisons."
“This book shows how one man’s life was changed not by iron bars, but by a leather book. That book allowed him to open his heart towards the love that God had for him, which changed his life, changed his household, and ultimately changed the trajectory of the future generations of his family.”
“A riveting, clear-eyed but supremely compassionate journey, through one of the darkest corners of the American judicial system. Death Row Chaplain compels the reader to a renewed assessment and appreciation of the human potential for constructive, even inspired, change.”
“Chaplain Earl Smith is a man of real integrity and unusually effective in dealing with inmates in prison. He also has enjoyed great ability in communicating as a chaplain for the San Francisco 49ers and the Golden State Warriors. He is highly socially mobile being able to deal with the elite athletes in the world and the most notorious criminals. There are very few ministers that have this range of communication abilities, but Earl certainly does.”
“Earl Smith traces his remarkable journey from a crime-filled youth, including a near-death experience at the wrong end of a gun, to his ministries to the most hardened of criminals at San Quentin. It is a tale of redemption that has lessons for us all, including the emancipating power of forgiveness over the coercive reflex of revenge.”
“The stories of triumph and the stories of adversity are the stories that allow us to evolve. I hope you read this book and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. You will be truly inspired.”
"Rev. Earl Smith's book takes us into San Quentin, an unforgiving and forgotten dark place where the light of God is powerfully at work. The inspirational stories from behind the bars remind us that grace and mercy is for all people—a message for everyone."
"Smith's stories reveal the power of redemption in the lives of those whom society thinks are unsalvageable."

Mark Smith's Analyst Perspectives





















Informatica Goes Heiler for PIM and Product Information Management

Posted by
Mark Smith on Oct 2, 2012 11:03:02 AM
                    
            








Informatica is a Hot vendor when it comes to our Value Index for Data Integration. When it comes to meeting the business need for consistent and high-quality product information, Informatica just raised its prospects with its announced takeover of Heiler Software. Until now, Informatica has lacked a product information management (PIM) offering. Germany-based Heiler Software, whose presence has continued to grow in Europe and North America, was recently ranked as a Hot Vendor in our Value Index for Product Information Management, as you can read in our no-cost executive report. Informatica’s purchase brings complementary products together from one supplier and will help organizations provide a higher quality and volume of product information throughout business processes, and help place business, rather than IT, in the role of creating, using and sharing information.

PIM, as we define it at Ventana Research, is the process, information and technology people use to establish a single reliable view of products, which can be used in an enterprise to provide information about customers, partners and suppliers to promote efficient business processes, which in turn can improve customer service. Unfortunately, some IT analyst firms have tried to coopt the term for what is really master data management, which based on buyers’ purchasing of PIM products for their business agenda has been a false and unfortunate path. Our research found that 48 percent of PIM investments come from the business technology budget, with only 28 percent from the corporate IT budget. Business buys PIM but not MDM. Heiler and other PIM vendors have therefore focused efforts to leverage their software for business to give customers improved efficiencies and profitability while improving customers’ and suppliers’ experiences in accessing consistent product information.
Our recent benchmark research on the trends and maturity of the product information management market (about which an executive report of the findings is available at no cost) shows that managing the disparate product content and data in organizations is a challenge. Today, less than a fifth of organizations are very satisfied with their current PIM efforts due to incompatible tools and the array of existing manual (45%), database-centric (41%), custom code (37%) and spreadsheet (29%) approaches. Key challenges include having consistent product information across channels, complete product attributes to meet buyer expectations, and consistent prices. Getting access to product data from varying ERP, SCM, PLM, marketing, catalog and other stores of images and videos is no easy task, and requires dedicated software. Our research also found that organizations that use PIM and MDM together will find exponential value in their investments, yielding not just efficiency and profitability improvements but also improved customer satisfaction.
When Heiler announced this takeover to its shareholders and customers, it acknowledged the larger opportunity it will have as a part of Informatica. Heiler and its customers recognize the need to provide better access to product information inside the enterprise and out to the broader business network of customers, partners, suppliers and manufacturers. Heiler customers should see increased value in their investment within the first year after the completion of this transaction in the form of a portfolio of tools to help their business and IT efforts. Heiler customers that lack the resources to tackle data issues such as integration and quality along with a strong master data management backbone will like what Informatica can offer.
Competitively, with this acquisition, Informatica steps beyond IBM, Oracle and SAP, who have an IT- and data-centric approach to master data management technology but lack a unified business approach to improving business processes. Top competitor Stibo, which is a Hot vendor in this category, will have a new global competitor to reckon with, as Informatica should bring renewed marketing and sales investment to capitalize on Heiler’s current products. Riversand, Enterworks and Agility will enjoy more market attention. The PIM market is getting interesting, and we expect more growth and even acquisitions.
Informatica, which continues to grow through acquisitions related to any type of data integration, will now be in the PIM market, where it should not re-label or alter Heiler’s position. If it does, it will not be able to maximize the value of the Heiler investment it is planning to make. The purchase of Heiler is a positive step for Informatica, which continues on a path to be a multibillion-dollar provider of software related to data and information for business and IT. Informatica software provides adaptability in its ability to integrate with existing business processes and PIM technology, and our research has found adaptability to be the top vendor and product consideration for PIM purchases. Informatica customers will gain access to a new software offering that will help leverage their current software investments by providing applications and tools for business to help govern and improve product information across business processes. With more than half organizations planning to improve PIM processes in 2013, Informatica will be well poised to take advantage of this opportunity.
Regards,
Mark Smith
CEO & Chief Research Officer
