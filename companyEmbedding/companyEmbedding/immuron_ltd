    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.source> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11x1gf2m6>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Learn more in our FAQ



Immuron is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a proprietary technology platform focused on the development and commercialization of a novel class of immunomodulator polyclonal antibodies that Immuron believes can address significant unmet medical needs. Immunomodulator polyclonol antibodies are blood proteins that are produced by the immune system to attack foreign substances such as bacteria and can be specifically utilized to increase and/or decrease the activity of the immune system.  Immuron's oral polyclonal antibodies offer targeted delivery within the gastrointestinal (GI) track but do not cross into the bloodstream. Immuron believes that its two lead immunomodulator product candidates, IMM-124E and IMM-529, have the potential to transform the existing treatment paradigms for NASH (Non Alcoholic Steatohepatitis) and for Clostridium difficile (C. difficile), respectively. Immuron also markets an OTC product, Travelan, has been designated by the Therapeutic Goods Administration ("TGA") in Australia and Health Canada as being preventative to Traveler's Diarrhea . Travelan is also based on the same technology.

Investing in an IPO is subject to unique risks, tolerance for volatility, and potential loss of principal, that customers should be aware of prior to making an investment decision. 
        Motif cannot guarantee the availability of IPO shares for customers, who submit conditional orders as the number of shares requested for distribution may exceed the supply.
        Important information concerning IPO participation is contained in the Terms and Conditions for IPO Participation.
There are additional risks to consider with Small-Company IPO, secondary offerings, and Regulation A+ offerings including risks of unproven management, companies that may have
        substantial debt, lack of profitable financial performance, dilution of share value to existing shareholders, liquidity of shares in the marketplace, regulatory uncertainty,
        and exchange-listing requirements. As with any investment decision you make at Motif, you are responsible for determining whether an investment in an initial public offering,
        a follow-on offering, small-cap, or Regulation A+ offering is consistent with your investment objectives and risk tolerance.  Read the prospectus carefully before making an
        investment decision.


Investing in securities involves risks, you should be aware of prior to making an investment decision, including the possible loss of principal. An investment in individual stocks, or a collection of stocks
    focused on a particular theme or idea, such as a motif, may be subject to increased risk of price fluctuation over more diversified holdings due to adverse developments which can affect a particular industry or sector.
    Investments in ETFs can include those with a narrow or targeted investment strategy and can be subject to similar sector risks than more broadly diversified investments.
    Motif makes no representation regarding the suitability of a particular investment or investment strategy.  You are responsible for all investment decisions you make including understanding the risks involved with your
    investment strategy.   


System response time and account access times may vary due to a variety of factors, including trading volumes, market conditions, system performance, and other factors.

              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Dollar turns lower for the week following GDP report
              
              The U.S. dollar fell on Friday, erasing its gains for the week after a read on economic growth came in below expectations, though analysts said the beleaguered currency was potentially nearing a bottom.

Dollar rises from 13-month low
              
              The U.S. dollar rises on Thursday, gaining against major rivals in what analysts suggest a mild consolidation following precipitous declines over recent weeks.

Intellectual Property











Technology











 
Immuron has a policy to identify, capture and protect all relevant intellectual property associated within its core business strategies. The company has a long history of decisively managing its intellectual property, using in-house IP specialists and external patent and trademark attorney firms located both globally and within Australia.
Immuron manages seven separate families of patent cases, requiring prosecution in each of the major global jurisdictions. All such cases are in different stages of development and prosecution. The company further maintains a significant register of trademarks, particularly in association with the product Travelan.
Due to the practical nature of the technology used to produce Travelan, the company also retains a significant amount of know-how and other unregistered intellectual property which presents significant hurdles to competitors in producing the same products. In its relationships with Hadasit and the Monash University, the company continues its policy of actively in-licensing and filing upon new technology that relates to all relevant business objectives.
Immuron currently has a suite of over 27 patents either approved or pending that cover the full spectrum of its Technology Platform.
