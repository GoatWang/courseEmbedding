NPC: An Exception to the Rule 
It took NPC to change the way growers sell - and restaurants buy - produce. It took NPC to change the system – to decide there was a better, more enlightened way. More than just a link in the fresh produce supply chain, NPC, LLC serves growers, shippers and restaurant chains through the use of sophisticated technology and old fashioned collaboration.
NPC is a strong supporter of local and organic farming and believes respect and transparency breed knowledge which, in turn, breeds trust. Providing continuous access to timely information like updated freight rates and other planning information ensures the entire supply chain is engaged and informed.
NPC: changing the rules, From Farm to Fork™ and everything in between.
The following is a presentation of National Produce Consultants flowchart for customization of a fresh produce program.
Customized Fresh Produce Program
Presented by Desiree Forsythe.
 
Big Data
is Recalibrating 
the Foodservice 
Industry
 
 
Information is power. It can inspire new ideas, redefine sales strategies, and drive substantial change across an entire industry. With technology pervading every aspect of our culture, perhaps it’s no surprise that the foodservice industry is poised for a rebirth – armed with a wealth of Big Data and learning more about their customers and operations because of it.
Excerpt taken from PMA Fresh Magazine, July Edition, Page 40 - "Big Data is recalibrating the foodservice industry" article.
 
 

 



  
 

  
 

  
 

  
 

  
 

 








NPC is committed to preserving and protecting food safety at all levels. We have developed a proprietary system called PASS (Produce Alert Safety System). The system is designed to ensure appropriate and affected parts of the produce supply chain are immediately informed of any safety issue. Learn more about PASS and our Food Safety Initiatives here.

Today, news and information runs on a 24-hour cycle. NPC keeps partners and clients up-to-date with immediate access to the business and industry news they need to make informed decisions.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
