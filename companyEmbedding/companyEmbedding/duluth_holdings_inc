Near term resistance is between 20.25-20.75 which is within striking distance.  Intermediate resistance is around 23.5 and if breached, would signal much higher prices afterwards.  FUNDAMENTALS:  Store #23 was just opened and the next earnings report will be in about 6 weeks.  Good news here would certainly trigger a rally that should enable DLTH to breach these resistance levels and be positioned to challenge old highs, especially if the earnings provide a positive surprise.MoreReplyReplies (1)10AAvaDLTH has just seen the last of the selling. Looks like a potential push higher is in store.  check out awesome_stocks, its a pretty reliable service. of course you have to do your own due diligence, but they generally point you in the right direction.Reply10eeddypgilAll American retailer that has control over its productReply30eeddypgil$20 then upReply10JJoeDLTH doing a good job trying to fill the gap.  Most likely with back and fills along the way, but near term resistance has been broken and the short term target is now 19.5 to 21.5 which could happen quickly (July/August).  In order to test intermediate resistance around 23.5 or so, we need to get a positive earnings report plus continued bullishness in the general market.  Positive attitudes towards retail due to the Target news will also help with overall sentiment.Reply30eeddypgilClosest to LL Bean as you can get in publicly traded company . People still like to touch fabric before buyingReply10JJoeHere's an interesting thought; and it might be premature.  Since in the last quarter, SG&A were higher than expected due to new store openings and related expenses, "what if" DLTH doesn't open as many new stores in this current quarter?  Top line sales has not disappointed at all; in fact, generally beats consensus on a regular basis.  If they don't open up the forecasted number of new stores this quarter, then the bottom line won't be "adversely affected" as in the last quarter and might surprise nicely on the upside.  Of course, bulls want more stores to open as it is a sign their strategy is working and they are taking advantage of these new market opportunities.  But it has also been a drag on the bottom line.  If they can not find the locations they want in these new markets fast enough, and the build out takes a little longer, it will just mean less expenses, more profits with the continued growth on the top line.  Could be an interesting surprise in the next quarterly report.  Let's watch to see just how many new stores they open this quarter.  I haven't heard of a new opening in quite a while now, which has spawned my thoughts here.MoreReplyReplies (5)00jjim+6%ish today.  Anyone know why?  Just the target news, or something else?ReplyReplies (1)00JJoeDLTH now attempting to "fill the gap" that was created during the earnings miss.  Might take some time to do so successfully, and if accomplished, next area of resistance is 22-23 range.  Might need to wait for next earnings release in September to have reason to rally into this resistance area or breach it with a positive report.  If there is more negative news on retail, this could cause resistance to the recovery.  If another earnings miss occurs, new lows would likely result as well.  Management guidance for the balance of the year was fairly positive and optimistic.  If the earnings meets or exceeds expectations, breaking above resistance is likely.MoreReply21eeddypgilGreat one to buy shares in leading up to winterReply10eeddypgilA great companyReply40MMeG&A expense as a percentage of sales is on an upward slope.  Too bad senior management is allowing the "Great Desparity" of wages.  Management just taking too much compensation.  Our parents had the "Great Depression".  If the 15% quarterly (60% yearly) SG&A increase did not happen, the stock would have gone the other way.ReplyReplies (1)10eeddypgilA gift at this priceReply20bbob25% short this pos. Only way to make money is to ShortShortShort this POS.ReplyReplies (1)02bbobI will wait till this POS goes down to $14 before i even consider. This is the worst stock to buy at this time.ReplyReplies (1)02eeddypgilBad day for retailReply00eeddypgilSurprisingly bad dayReply00NNumberswatcherHmmm, most innovative retailer ever AMZN decides needs bricks and mortar. (Challenge you to name one product sold by AMZN that you cannot shop/buy in bricks and mortar store.) What's DLTH strategy again...oh, yea, they are adding stores to compliment their online store. Strategy seems right; let's hope the product meets broad customer acceptance without cost prohibitive amount of marketing $.ReplyReplies (2)00eeddypgilSuper buyReply30Show MoreTrump’s unwitting legacy could be universal health coverageYahoo FinanceSolar Eclipse 2017: Stay in the Tualatin ValleyThe Tualatin ValleySponsoredSean Hannity responds to claim he ran up a $42,000 tab at Trump's hotel after flying in a 70-year-old lobster from MaineBusiness InsiderYahoo Small BusinessData DisclaimerHelpSuggestionsPrivacyAbout Our AdsTerms (Updated)

Duluth shares drop 17% after earnings miss estimates
Duluth Holdings Inc.  shares are down 17.3% in Wednesday trading after the company reported a first-quarter earnings miss. Net income totaled $0.4 million, or 1 cent per share, down from $3.24 million, or 10 cents per share, for the same period last year. The FactSet consensus was 5 cents. Revenue for the quarter was $83.7 million, up from $68.6 million last year and ahead of the $82.9 million FactSet consensus. The company, which is known for its humorous advertising and items like Buck Naked underwear, opened four retail stores in the quarter in Indiana, Massachusetts, Michigan and Rhode Island, and has plans for 12 retail stores and one outlet store for the year. Duluth expects 2017 EPS in the range of 66 cents to 71 cents and sales in the range of $455.0 million to $465.0 million. The FactSet consensus is for EPS of 70 cents and sales of $463.7 million.

Duluth shares drop 17% after earnings miss estimates
Duluth Holdings Inc.  shares are down 17.3% in Wednesday trading after the company reported a first-quarter earnings miss. Net income totaled $0.4 million, or 1 cent per share, down from $3.24 million, or 10 cents per share, for the same period last year. The FactSet consensus was 5 cents. Revenue for the quarter was $83.7 million, up from $68.6 million last year and ahead of the $82.9 million FactSet consensus. The company, which is known for its humorous advertising and items like Buck Naked underwear, opened four retail stores in the quarter in Indiana, Massachusetts, Michigan and Rhode Island, and has plans for 12 retail stores and one outlet store for the year. Duluth expects 2017 EPS in the range of 66 cents to 71 cents and sales in the range of $455.0 million to $465.0 million. The FactSet consensus is for EPS of 70 cents and sales of $463.7 million. Duluth shares are down 33.1% for the year so far, while the S&P 500 index  is up 8.5% for the period.

We estimate that the net proceeds to us from the sale of our Class B common
stock in this offering will be approximately $72.5 million, or approximately
$83.7 million if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional
shares in full, based on the initial public offering price of $12.00 per share,
and after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and offering expenses.

We intend to make a final distribution to shareholders who were shareholders
immediately prior to this offering, including some of our directors and
officers, relating to the termination of our “S” corporation status in an amount
equal to 100% of our cumulative undistributed taxable income from the date of
our formation through November 25, 2015, which we currently estimate to be
$51.1 million. The final “S” corporation distribution will include an amount of
income based on our expected results of operations for the full 2015 calendar
year, which is our 2015 tax year, prorated from January 1, 2015 through the date
of our conversion to a “C” corporation, unless otherwise required by law. This
prorated amount may be increased based on our actual results of operations for
the 2015 calendar year. We intend to use a portion of the net proceeds from this
offering to repay borrowings under a short-term note in the aggregate principal
amount of $46.3 million which we intend to use to fund part of this final
distribution. The short-term note will bear interest at the one month London
Interbank Offered Rate, plus 1.25% per annum, which was 1.45% of the date of 
this prospectus, and will be due and payable upon the receipt of proceeds from
this offering. We intend to fund the balance of this final distribution with our
cash on hand, our revolving line of credit or the net proceeds from this
offering. We may use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to repay
borrowings under our revolving line of credit used to fund this balance, which
would be $4.8 million based on the total estimated distribution of $51.1 
million. The revolving line of credit bears interest at the same rate as the
short-term note described above and matures in July 2018.

We estimate net proceeds in excess of the final “S” corporation distribution to
be approximately $21.4 million, after deducting the underwriting discount and
estimated offering expenses payable by us. We intend to use such excess proceeds
to fund growth initiatives and other general corporate purposes, including
approximately $15.0 million to $16.5 million to fund new retail store expansion
and approximately $3.5 million to $5.0 million to fund infrastructure
expenditures, including a new order management system, asset management system,
assortment planning system and e-commerce platform and office and distribution
facilities. Our expected uses of net proceeds from this offering are based on
our present plans, objectives and business condition. We have not specifically
determined the timing of these expenditures, and our management will have
discretion over when these proceeds are used. The amounts and timing of our
actual use of net proceeds will vary depending on a number of factors, including
our cash flow from operations, the number of retail stores we open as part of
our planned future retail store expansion, the timing of opening these new
retail stores, the cost and payback period of these new retail stores and the
systems, information technology and operational infrastructure necessary to
support these new retail stores. We expect it will take approximately
$2.0 million to $2.6 million in capital expenditures and starting inventory to
open a new retail store. If we open a large number of stores relatively close in
time, or if new retail stores have a higher opening cost or a longer payback
period than our existing retail stores, our cash flow from operations may not be
sufficient to support these openings and we may need to use the net proceeds
from this offering more quickly to support this growth and the continuing
operations of these new retail stores. Subject to the factors above, we may
determine to use a portion of the net proceeds of this offering to fund
additional systems, information technology, operational infrastructure and
facilities to support our direct business rather than investing in retail store
expansion.


We operate primarily in the apparel, footwear and accessories industry, which is
highly competitive. We compete with a diverse group of direct-to-consumer
companies and retailers, including men’s and women’s specialty apparel chains,
department stores, outdoor specialty stores, apparel catalog businesses and
online apparel businesses. We compete principally on the basis of brand
recognition, innovation, product quality, customer service and price. According
to IRI, our brand compares favorably to our competitors in the following
categories: comfort, useful features, product fit, quality, durability and
materials used. We believe this outperformance is a result of our solution-based
product development and our high level of focus on maintaining the Duluth
Trading brand. To stay ahead of our competition, we continue to develop
innovative solution-based products for which we create unique selling
propositions that incorporate humor and storytelling.


Company Description
Duluth Trading is a rapidly growing lifestyle brand of men’s and women’s casual
wear, workwear and accessories sold exclusively through our own channels. We
offer a comprehensive line of innovative, durable and functional products, such
as our Longtail T® shirts, Buck Naked™ underwear and Fire


 Hose® work pants,
which reflect our position as the Modern, Self-Reliant American Lifestyle brand.
Our brand has a heritage in workwear that transcends tradesmen and appeals to a
broad demographic of men and women for everyday and on-the-job use.
Approximately 88% of our fiscal 2014 net sales consisted of proprietary products
sold under our Duluth Trading brand name. We believe the foundation of our
success is our culture of “poking average in the eye” by seeing things for what
they could be and should be and finding a way to make them exactly that, and we
like to do it all with a big, toothy grin. Our brand is defined by:
solution-based products manufactured with high quality craftsmanship, humorous
and distinctive marketing and an outstanding customer experience.

Our design process reflects a “there’s gotta be a better way” attitude, 
resulting in differentiated products with enhanced features and enduring styles
that go beyond short-lived fashion trends. We strive to make shopping for our
products fun by using attention-grabbing advertisements that serve to reinforce
our brand identity. We also use storytelling to differentiate our products in
the marketplace and create emotional connections with our customers. We provide
our customers with a unique and entertaining experience across all channels
through our content-rich website, catalogs and “store like no other” retail
environment. We treat our customers like next-door neighbors, as exemplified by
our exceptional customer service and unconditional “No Bull Guarantee” on all
purchases. To protect the integrity of the Duluth Trading brand, we offer our
products exclusively through our omnichannel distribution network, consisting of
our website, catalogs and retail stores. This model creates multiple touch
points with our customers and enables us to control both the expression of our
Duluth Trading brand and the pricing of our products. Our distribution strategy
eliminates the need to sell through third-party retailers, allowing us to focus
on our core competencies of product development, storytelling and serving
customers.

Duluth Trading was founded in 1989 when two brothers in the home construction
industry were tired of dragging tools from job to job using discarded
five-gallon drywall compound buckets. The two brothers were never satisfied with
the status quo and believed “there’s gotta be a better way.” So they invented
the Bucket Boss®—a ruggedly durable canvas tool organizer that fits around a
drywall bucket and transformed the way construction workers organized their
tools. Capitalizing on their initial success, these brothers launched a catalog
that later became known as Duluth Trading Company. Under the initial philosophy
of “Job Tough, Job Smart,” this catalog was dedicated to improving and expanding
on existing methods of tool storage, organization and transport. In December
2000, GEMPLER’S Inc., an agricultural and horticultural supply catalog business
founded and owned by Stephen L. Schlecht, acquired Duluth Trading and brought
the two mail order companies together. Both catalogs had customers who worked
outside and embraced the spirit of hands-on, self-reliant Americans. In February
2003, the GEMPLER’S catalog business was sold to W.W. Grainger (NYSE:GWW) and
proceeds from that sale have been used to fund the growth of Duluth Trading.
With that transaction, GEMPLER’S, Inc. changed its corporate name to Duluth
Holdings Inc.

From what began as an idea aimed at those working in the building trades, Duluth
Trading has become a widely recognized brand and proprietary line of innovative
and functional apparel and gear. We have created strong brand awareness, built a
loyal customer base and generated robust net sales momentum. We have done so by
sticking to our roots of “there’s gotta be a better way” and through our
relentless focus on providing our customers with quality, functional products.
