About Us
John W. Peterson Music Company is a copyright management company that administers the timeless copyright catalog of John W. Peterson.


John W. Peterson
John W. Peterson (1921-2006) was born in Lindsborg, Kansas, and began his musical career while he was still in his teens. During World War II, he served as an Army Air Force pilot flying the famed "China Hump."
"It has been a great joy over these many years to be able to take some manuscript paper and turn it into something that glorifies God or presents the gospel to others." - John W. Peterson
Later, he attended Moody Bible Institute and served on the radio staff there for a number of years. In 1953, he graduated from the American Conservatory of Music in Chicago and shortly thereafter settled in Pennsylvania to continue his songwriting career. He then moved to Grand Rapids, Michigan, where for over ten years he was President and Editor-in-Chief of Singspiration, a sacred music publishing company. He also served on the board of Gospel Films, Inc. of Muskegon, Michigan for several years. Later he moved to Scottsdale, Arizona where he continued his writing and co-founded Good Life Productions. A few years later, the John W. Peterson Music Company was established. During this time, he also served on the board of Family Life Radio Network in Tucson, Arizona. He had wide experience as a choral director, and throughout his career was in great demand as a guest conductor of his own works.

His music is loved and sung around the world. Mr. Peterson has composed well over 1000 individual songs, including titles such as: "It Took a Miracle," "Over the Sunset Mountains," "So Send I You," "Springs of Living Water," "Heaven Came Down," "Jesus Is Coming Again" and "Surely Goodness and Mercy." In addition, he has written 35 cantatas and musicals. Among these are "Night of Miracles," "Born a King," "No Greater Love," "Carol of Christmas," "Jesus Is Coming," "King of Kings," "Down from His Glory" and "The Last Week." Approximately 10,000,000 copies of these cantatas and musicals have been published and sold.
In 1967, the National Evangelical Film Foundation presented Mr. Peterson with the Sacred Music Award in recognition of his accomplishments in the field of sacred music. In the same year, he received the honorary degree, Doctor of Sacred Music, from John Brown University. In 1971, he received the honorary degree, Doctor of Divinity, from Western Conservative Baptist Seminary in Portland, Oregon; and in 1979, he received the honorary degree, Doctor of Fine Arts, from Grand Canyon University in Phoenix, Arizona. In 1977, his autobiography, "The Miracle Goes On," was published by Zondervan Publishing House, and a film by the same title was released by Gospel Films. In 1986, Mr. Peterson was inducted into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame, and in 1996 at MusiCalifornia, he received the prestigious Ray DeVries Church Music Award. He's listed in "Who's Who in America" and "Who's Who in the World."

Warning: All pipe plugs must be blocked or anchored adequately against a force equal to the head pressure times the cross-sectional area of the pipe. Debris or protrusions in the pipeline can damage a seal or rupture inflatable plugs. NEVER use an inflatable plug when its failure could cause injury or catastrophic damage or as the only means of protection for personnel working downstream. NEVER use a test pressure greater than the capacity of the weakest pipe or component in the system.  
Note 1: Mechanical and Molded Rubber Plugs are generally used for testing because fabricated Multi-Flex style plugs may allow some seepage unless customized for a positive seal.
Note 2: We are constantly upgrading our products and while we try to keep the websites up to date it is possible more current specifications may be on a quote or confirming order.
