Going Against the Flow: Stephanie Tilenius, CEO of Vida Health






By Charu Sharma






























Stephanie Tilenius is CEO and Co-Founder of Vida Health. Vida is a next generation, mobile, virtual care platform, and health expert marketplace for consumers and businesses. Vida connects you with a health provider 24/7 to help you lose weight, optimize your health and fitness, reduce blood pressure or cholesterol or manage a chronic condition like diabetes, cardiac risk or cancer. Vida is deployed at Fortune 500-1000 companies, Duke, Stanford and MD Anderson among others.  
Before founding Vida, Stephanie held senior leadership positions at PayPal, eBay and Google. Stephanie was VP of Commerce and Payments at Google where she built Google Wallet and Google Shopping Express. Prior to Google, Stephanie was SVP of eBay.com and VP of PayPal Merchant Services. Prior to eBay, Stephanie founded PlanetRx.com, an online pharmacy and healthcare company that went public in 1999. Stephanie sits on two public boards - Coach Inc. and Seagate Technology.

Q: What does entrepreneurship mean to you, and what underlying characteristics do you see in successful entrepreneurs?Stephanie: Entrepreneurship is bringing something to life from a paper napkin. It requires resilience and resourcefulness, and it requires these everyday. You never stop thinking about it. 
Although, you need to create time when you're not thinking about your vision or your product. A certain mental clarity comes to me after a run or playing with my kids, and I'm able to approach opportunities and problems with a fresh perspective.Q: What are you most proud of in your professional career? If you could do something over in your life, what would it be? 
Stephanie: Working with extremely smart and innovative people and teams has been rewarding. I remember telling the PayPal team that PayPal will be bigger than eBay one day, and it is gratifying to see this dream come true. As for regrets, I don't think like that. One makes certain choices and then one moves forward in life. Always learn but always push forward. There is always something new to build.Q: Tell us about an instance where you had to go against the flow to realize your goal.Stephanie: When I first pitched PayPal going off eBay or "PayPal Merchant Services", I received mixed reactions from eBay leadership. The traditional offline payments business is a low margin business in the US, and it took me two years to convince people of the long term return here and that PayPal could be larger than eBay. It took us two years to sign merchants like Dell and Walmart. Similarly, I faced naysaying while pitching Google Shopping Express and Google Wallet but eventually I was able to sell this vision and garner resources.Q: How were your experiences different during your intrapreneurial stints at PayPal/eBay/Google and your entrepreneurial role at Vida Health? 
Stephanie: Firstly, you are insulated in a big company whereas as a startup, you need to always be raising money. Secondly, if you have the right support at a big company, it is easier and faster to iterate there because you have more resources at hand. Of course, if a large corporation is bureaucratic or you don't have the needed support, then things move way faster at a smaller startup. It's all about starting with the right small team to iterate on a product. For example, with Google Wallet, we took engineers out of Google labs and started with 3 engineers and a product person.Thirdly, failure at a startup is an extreme because your survival is at stake. As a bigger company, you can still work on other projects if a project fails. Q: You earned your MBA from Harvard Business School. Would you advice aspiring entrepreneurs in the present day to pursue business school?Stephanie: My HBS experience was enriching because of the people - the students and the professors, and I'd do it again if I were to go back in time. That said, the pace of innovation in Silicon Valley is unprecedented and taking two years off for an academic pursuit is a bigger risk today than it was in 1994. This is more of a statement about the Valley than it is about the MBA education. If you are in a traditional industry, I'd strongly encourage you to apply to HBS.  Q: If you were to give advice to your 22 year old self, what would it be?Stephanie: Have a long-term vision for what you want to be but don't get caught up in the details of a specific plan; leave some room for serendipity. Also, know and manage your weaknesses but focus on your strengths and let these make you stand out. Follow your passions but take calculated risk. Make sure you are making the world a better place. Ask yourself what impact am I having on the people and world around me?Follow Stephanie Tilenius at @stilenius, and check out the other interviews in Going Against the Flow series at http://www.huffingtonpost.com/charu-sharma/.

Exclusive: Google Commerce Exec Tilenius Departs for Kleiner


June 22, 2012 at 9:02 am PT

Stephanie Tilenius, the eBay exec who Google hired away to jumpstart its commerce and mobile payments efforts, is departing the company to become an executive-in-residence at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.
‚ÄúThe pace of innovation is so unprecedented, especially in social and mobile,‚Äù she said in an interview this morning. ‚ÄúI wanted the ability to help scale a few start-ups, instead of building products in a large company.‚Äù
Tilenius has much experience in both arenas, having co-founded and led PlanetRx.com in Web 1.0, as well as working at software start-up Firefly, AOL and Intel before that. She holds a BA and MA from Brandeis University and an MBA from Harvard.
Tilenius joined eBay in 2001 and worked across a wide variety of its businesses, including running the merchant service group of its powerful PayPal payments unit and also on its key Marketplace offering.
Tilenius took an even more prominent operating role when she joined Google and ended up shepherding Google Wallet, one of the search giant‚Äôs most significant efforts in commerce. Tilenius‚Äôs first job at Google was leading its commerce efforts and in product search, but she founded Google Wallet as a kind of skunkworks within the company. 
It is now part of an integrated offering, in which users have a one-payment account to cover purchases across Android Market, YouTube, Google+ Games and other of the company‚Äôs properties.
‚ÄúWe have built one wallet in the cloud,‚Äù she said.
Tilenius was one of the main executives to unveil Google Wallet at an event in New York last year. She also demonstrated the product at our D: All Things Digital conference in 2011.
Tilenius had also been the key player in Google‚Äôs unsuccessful attempt to buy Groupon. After that, Google then launched Google Offers to compete with the daily deals site.
The various payments initiatives by Google also attracted controversy, when PayPal filed suit against Tilenius ‚Äî¬†as well as Osama Bedier, Google‚Äôs VP of payments and former PayPal executive.¬†The payments unit of eBay claimed they and Google misappropriated trade secrets and violated contracts involving recruiting agreements.
In January, Tilenius shifted roles to oversee Google‚Äôs commerce efforts internationally.
Perhaps by coincidence, since the firm has been talking about bringing her in for months, Tilenius is the second major hire of a woman at the well-known Silicon Valley venture capital firm, in the wake of a gender discrimination lawsuit filed by a woman partner, Ellen Pao. A month ago, Kleiner hired former Square product exec Megan Quinn as a partner to focus on consumer Internet investments.
Kleiner recently filed an answer to Pao‚Äôs legal action, maintaining it was her own performance that kept her from advancing at the firm.
Tilenius declined to comment on the case.
At Kleiner, Tilenius will be working closely with a number of partners, although she will be focusing on late-stage companies in its $1 billion Digital Growth Fund. She also might be incubating some ideas of her own, she said.
Kleiner partner Ted Schlein said Tilenius would be a ‚Äútremendous resource‚Äù for the firm. 
‚ÄúWhen talent becomes available to focus on different opportunties in portfolio, we jump at that,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúStephanie has the experience in some of the largest scaling of businesses in the Valley, as well as an entrepreneurial background, so it is ideal for us.‚Äù
Tilenius said the move was ‚Äúless about Google than working on the next generation of companies.‚Äù
She said she had some ideas in mobile commerce, especially given her experience at Google and eBay, as well as in the healthcare area.
‚ÄúI think it is really early days in mobile and retail is going to be transformed,‚Äù said Tilenius. ‚ÄúThere are a lot of players, but it is a marathon.‚Äù
Indeed.
