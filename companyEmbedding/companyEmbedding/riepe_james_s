James S. Riepe Elected Chairman of the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania


Friday, June 18, 1999
PHILADELPHIA --- James S. Riepe, vice chairman of T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc., a Baltimore-based investment management company, will become chairman of the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania, effective June 18, 1999, according to an announcement by P. Roy Vagelos, M.D., retired chairman and CEO of Merck & Co., Inc., who has been chairman of the Penn trustees since 1994 and a trustee since 1988. 
Mr. Riepe (W'65, WG'67) is a graduate of The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. 
"This will be a marvelous transition," Dr. Vagelos said, adding that "in addition to being one of the leading executives in the investment management industry, he has been an exceptional member of our board in a variety of ways for many years." 
Dr. Vagelos said that Mr. Riepe was first elected to a five-year term on the board as an Alumni Trustee on Jan. 1, 1990. He began a second five-year term as a Term Trustee on Jan. 1, 1995. 
"We are enormously grateful to Dr. Vagelos and the Nominating Committee who have ensured in this transition that we will continue to have extraordinary board leadership," said University President Judith Rodin, adding that she and the officers of the University "are very, very much looking forward to working with Jim Riepe in his new role as chairman." 
Mr. Riepe has been a member of the Executive Committee of the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania since 1993. He is the current chairman of the Trustee Standing Committee on Audit and Compliance and of the Investment Board, and he is a member of the committees on Budget and Finance, External Affairs and Student Life. 
Mr. Riepe also is a member of the Undergraduate Financial Aid Committee and the Agenda for Excellence Council. 
He was a member of the Trustee Board of the University of Pennsylvania Health System and its executive committee from 1993 to 1996. 
As vice chairman of T. Rowe Price, Mr. Riepe serves on its management committee that has oversight for one of the nation's leading providers of no-load mutual funds, managing nearly $150 billion for individuals and institutions. 
Mr. Riepe is a member of the board of governors of the National Association of Securities Dealers. He is former chairman of the board of governors and a member of the executive committee of the Investment Company Institute, the national trade association for the $5 trillion mutual fund industry. 
Mr. Riepe also is a director of the Baltimore Equitable Society, past chairman and a trustee of the Baltimore Museum of Art and past president of the board of trustees of Gilman School. 
Mr. Riepe previously served as a member of the General Alumni Society Board at Penn and its executive committee and on the Athletics Advisory Board. He also served as the first chairman of the Alumni Council on Admissions and was a former member of the President's Council. 
The James and Gail Riepe Scholarship Fund was established at Penn in 1989 to assist undergraduate students from the Baltimore area. 
As a student, Mr. Riepe was a member of The Sphinx Society, captain of the varsity football team and a member of Kappa Sigma Fraternity. 
His wife, Gail Petty Riepe, is a 1968 graduate of the College for Women at Penn. His son, James S. Riepe, Jr., is a 1998 graduate of the College of Arts and Sciences.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/21/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.
