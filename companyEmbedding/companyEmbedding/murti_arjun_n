Arjun N. Murti remembers the pain of the oil shocks of the 1970s. But he is bracing for something far worse now: He foresees a “super spike” — a price surge that will soon drive crude oil to $200 a barrel.Mr. Murti, who has a bit of a green streak, is not bothered much by the prospect of even higher oil prices, figuring it might finally prompt America to become more energy efficient.An analyst at Goldman Sachs, Mr. Murti has become the talk of the oil market by issuing one sensational forecast after another. A few years ago, rivals scoffed when he predicted oil would breach $100 a barrel. Few are laughing now. Oil shattered yet another record on Tuesday, touching $129.60 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Gas at $4 a gallon is arriving just in time for those long summer drives.Mr. Murti, 39, argues that the world’s seemingly unquenchable thirst for oil means prices will keep rising from here and stay above $100 into  2011. Others disagree, arguing that prices could abruptly tumble if speculators in the market rush for the exits. But the grim calculus of Mr. Murti’s prediction, issued in March and reconfirmed two weeks ago, is enough to give anyone pause: in an America of $200 oil, gasoline could cost more than $6 a gallon.

That would be fine with Mr. Murti, who owns not one but two hybrid cars. “I’m actually fairly anti-oil,” says Mr. Murti, who grew up in New Jersey. “One of the biggest challenges our country faces is our addiction to oil.” Continue reading the main story

Mr. Murti is hardly alone in predicting higher oil prices. Boone Pickens, the oilman turned corporate raider, said Tuesday that crude would hit $150 this year. But many analysts are no longer so sure where oil is going, at least in the short term. Some say prices will fall as low as $70 a barrel by year-end, according to Thomson Financial.Experts disagree over the supply of oil, the demand for it and whether recent speculation in the commodities markets has artificially raised prices. As an energy analyst at Citigroup, Tim Evans,  reportedly put it, trading commodities these days is like “sticking your hand in a blender.”Whatever the case, oil analysts like Mr. Murti have suddenly taken on the aura that enveloped technology analysts in the 1990s.

“It’s become a very fashionable area to write about,” said Kevin Norrish, a commodity analyst at Barclays Capital, which began predicting high oil prices around the same time as Goldman. “And to try to get attention from people, people are coming out with all sorts of numbers.”This was not always the case. In the 1990s, oil research was a sleepy area at banks. Many  analysts assumed oil prices would hover near $15 to $20 a barrel forever. If prices rose much above those levels, they figured, consumers would start conserving, suppliers would raise production, or both, causing prices to decline.But around the turn of the century, oil company after oil company started missing predicted production. Mr. Murti, who covers oil companies like ConocoPhillips and Valero Energy, decided to study the oil spikes of the 1970s.Since starting his career at Petrie Parkman & Company, a Denver-based investment firm acquired by Merrill Lynch in 2006, he had been conservative in his calls on oil. But by 2004, he concluded the world was headed for a long supply shock that would push prices through the roof. That summer, as oil traded for about $40 a barrel, Mr. Murti coined what has become his signature phrase: super spike.

The following March, he drew attention by predicting prices would soar to $105, sending shock waves through the market. Angry investors questioned whether Goldman’s own oil  traders benefited from the prediction. At Goldman’s annual meeting, Henry M. Paulson Jr., then the bank’s chief executive and now Treasury secretary, found himself defending Mr. Murti.

“Our traders were as surprised as everyone else was,” Mr. Paulson reportedly said. “Our research department is totally independent. Our trading departments have no say about this.”Over time, Mr. Murti was proved right again. Oil crossed $100 in February. Mr. Murti’s forecasts now feed into many of Goldman’s economic and corporate forecasts, affecting research of companies like Ford and Procter & Gamble. His research is distributed widely among investors.“Even if you disagree with their views, the problem is that Goldman does carry so much credibility,” said Nauman Barakat, senior vice president for global energy futures at Macquarie Futures USA. “There are a lot of traders who are going to buy based on their reports.”

His sudden fame unsettles Mr. Murti. He rarely grants interviews, citing concerns about privacy, and he declined to be photographed for this article. He is not the bank’s only gas prognosticator: Jeffrey R. Currie predicts oil prices out of London.Mr. Murti, for his part, discounts  suggestions that his reports affect market prices. “Whenever an analyst upgrades a stock or downgrades a stock, sometimes you get a reaction that day, but beyond a day, fundamentals win out,” he said.Mr. Murti falls into the camp of oil analysts who believe that supply is likely to remain tight because of geopolitical factors. These analysts predict higher prices because production is declining in non-OPEC countries like Britain, Norway and Mexico.The analysts who predict lower prices say there are supplies of oil that the bullish analysts are missing. “This year will be a year in which supply will be put into the market by stealth by OPEC and by countries we call black-hole countries,” said Edward L. Morse, chief energy economist at Lehman Brothers. China is one example, he said.But while oil and gas prices have been rising for a while now, Americans have only just begun to reduce gasoline consumption, so their efforts to conserve have  not dragged down oil prices.

“The fact that the U.S. gasoline demand can be down and that the U.S. gasoline consumer is no longer driving world oil prices is a monumental event,” Mr. Murti says. He spends most of his time talking to money managers and analysts, many of whom keep asking him if oil prices will stay high if speculators abandon the market, and says he applauds investors for driving up oil prices, since that will spur investment in alternative sources of energy.High prices, he says, “send a message to consumers that you should try your best to buy fuel-efficient cars or otherwise conserve on energy.” Washington should create tax incentives to encourage people to buy hybrid cars and develop more nuclear energy, he said.Of course, if lawmakers heed his advice, oil analysts like him might one day be a thing of the past. That’s fine with Mr. Murti.“The greatest thing in the world would be if in 15 years we no longer needed oil analysts,” he says.

  ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) today announced that Mr. John Faraci, former chairman and chief executive officer of International Paper Company, and Mr. Arjun Murti, former partner at Goldman Sachs, have been elected to its board of directors.   Mr. John Faraci (Photo: Business Wire)   "We are pleased to add two new directors who bring exceptional experience and expertise to our board," said Ryan Lance, chairman and chief executive officer of ConocoPhillips. "They bring unique backgrounds in leading multinational organizations and understanding energy markets. This will add valuable perspectives to our board and management team as we continue to deliver on our commitments to our shareholders."  Mr. Faraci, 64, held several leadership positions during his tenure with International Paper. Most recently, he served as chairman and chief executive officer from 2003 to 2014. Prior to this role, Mr. Faraci was chief financial officer from 1999 to 2003, and served in various other financial, planning and management positions at the company between 1974 and 1999.  Mr. Faraci has served as a non-executive director of PPG Industries since 2012 and United Technologies since 2005. Additionally, he sits on the board of the Moscow School of Management and is a trustee of the American Enterprise Institute, Denison University and the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation. Mr. Faraci holds a bachelor's degree in history and economics from Denison University, and an MBA from the University of Michigan.  Mr. Murti, 45, served as a partner at Goldman Sachs from 2006 until his retirement in 2014. Prior to becoming partner, he served as managing director from 2003 to 2006, and vice president from 1999 to 2003. During his time at Goldman Sachs, Mr. Murti worked as a sell-side equity research analyst covering the energy sector. He was also co-director of research for America's equity research from 2011 to 2014.

Details








	Dear Vitacost.com Customer:
We regret to inform you that Burt’s Bees, which is owned by parent company Clorox, has decided to stop selling their products through Vitacost.com. Neither Clorox nor Burt’s Bees offered an explanation for this change, other than saying that selling through our website is not “consistent” with their current strategy.
	We find it unfortunate that you will no longer be able to benefit from the convenience of online delivery of this product, as well as Vitacost.com’s competitive pricing.

New Chapter Combines Nature’s Wisdom & Science for Supplements You Can Trust

If you’re familiar with New Chapter, the Vermont-based vitamin and supplement company that was founded in 1982, you probably know their remarkable dedication to sourcing the best ingredients for health in environmentally responsible ways.
New Chapter believes the best way to deliver the healing wisdom of nature is through effective, high-quality products that acknowledge not only the latest science, but are also inspired by time-tested herbal tradition. New Chapter has vowed to only introduce products that will make meaningful contributions-products that are new chapters for holistic health.
Inspired by nature, validated by science
New Chapter’s uncompromising dedication to quality and Mother Earth goes all the way back to their roots. New Chapter® was founded in 1982 by Paul and Barbi Schulick out of a desire to bring the remarkable value of nature’s botanicals into people’s lives. From the beginning, Paul and Barbi made a firm commitment to utilizing each whole plant in its pure, unadulterated form.
Nature, in its wholeness, offers a profound opportunity for supporting well-being!
What sets New Chapter apart
Sourcing the ideal ingredients is key in the production of New Chapter supplements. The company travels the globe for herbs, vegetables, mushrooms and fruits that meet strict standards for purity, potency and especially sustainable sourcing. And these ingredients are bursting with nourishment-organic turmeric from India in Turmeric Force™, wild-caught salmon from Alaska’s clean waters in Wholemega™, 10 potent herbs in clinically studied Zyflamend™ Whole Body and sustainably harvested plant calcium from Iceland in Bone Strength Take Care™. 
New Chapter is also a fermentation pioneer. In 1986 they began creating fermented multivitamins that are easily digestible and gentle on the stomach. Their proven, two-step fermentation method uses the power of clinically studied probiotics to bring vitality to each nutrient and unlock its health benefits. Fermentation creates a nutritious fermentate and unleashes Nature’s immune-boosters called beta glucans. Today, New Chapter makes holistic multivitamins for every stage of life, including prenatal and postnatal support.
 Plus New Chapter became a Certified B Corporation in 2014. B Corps are a vibrant new kind of business that define success not just in terms of profit, but in terms of people and planet.
Discover the New Chapter difference
Just as you might check foods for organic and non-GMO labeling, you can confirm the credentials of New Chapter vitamins and supplements the same way. New Chapter multivitamins are made with third-party certified organic vegetables and herbs, and they’re verified by the Non-GMO Project. You can find the Non-GMO Project Verified seal on Zyflamend™ Whole Body, on all New Chapter herbals and herbal blends, on LifeShield™ mushrooms and on their plant calcium, too.
Paul and Barbi’s mission today remains still the same: to deliver the wisdom of nature to all those seeking natural wellness. Check out New Chapter’s whole family of products and experience your own new chapter in holistic health!
