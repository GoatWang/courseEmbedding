			Fred Banks, Jr. has been a partner in the General Litigation Group in the Jackson, Mississippi office of the law firm of Phelps Dunbar LLP since 2001. Since 2008, he has been a non-equity senior partner with that firm. From 1991 to 2001, he was a Justice of the Mississippi Supreme Court, and at the time of his retirement from the court in 2001, he was serving as Presiding Justice. Before serving on the Mississippi Supreme Court, Mr. Banks served as a Circuit Court Judge in Hinds and Yazoo Counties, Mississippi for six years. From 1976 until 1985, he served in the Mississippi House of Representatives. The Board believes Mr. Banks should serve as a director because of extensive experience in law, both in the areas of business transactions and litigation, and because of his perspective on the legal landscape in Mississippi. Mr. Banks' knowledge of Mississippi's corporate law under which the company is organized eminently qualifies him to serve as chair of the Board's Nominating and Governance committee. Mr. Banks has extensive contacts in Mississippi's legal and business communities, and is a visionary leader in numerous civic and philanthropic organizations.

Comfort Level - Are you comfortable telling the lawyer personal
information? Does the lawyer seem interested in solving your problem?

the lawyer worked on other cases similar to yours? 
Cost - How are the lawyer's fees structured - hourly or flat
fee? Can the lawyer estimate the cost of your case? 
City - Is the lawyer's office conveniently located?
Not sure what questions to ask a lawyer?Here are a few to get you started:

How long have you been in practice?
How many cases like mine have you handled?
How often do you settle cases out of court?
What are your fees and costs?
What are the next steps?

Supreme Court Justice Fred L. Banks Jr. announces he is stepping down


Supreme Court Justice Fred L. Banks Jr. announces he is stepping down
September 28, 2001
	Supreme Court Justice Fred L. Banks Jr. announced Friday that he is stepping down to
return to private law practice.
	Banks, who has served on the Supreme Court for 11 years, will join the Jackson office of
the law firm of Phelps Dunbar LLP. Banks said he expects his retirement to be effective Oct. 31. 
	Banks, 59, a former legislator and trial judge, said Friday, "I'm certainly grateful to the
people who elected me and supported me for public office, which I have held for the last 26
years. I'm grateful for the opportunity to serve the people of the state of Mississippi. It's just
come  to a point in my life where I  think change would be beneficial to me. I've  decided to
retire and return to private practice with the Phelps Dunbar law firm."
	Supreme Court Chief Justice Edwin L. Pittman said, "It's been a pleasure to serve with
him. I've served with him his entire tenure on the court. He is an extremely hard worker. He
is extremely knowledgeable about the law and he is a diligent researcher.  I've often said about
him that he is a purist. 
	"He has chaired the Rules Committee and still does. He was in line to be the next chief
justice," Pittman said. "It's going to be a real loss for the Supreme Court." 
	Banks and Pittman's  terms expire at the end of December 2004. Pittman has said he does
not plan to seek another term. 
	The justice with the longest service on the court is chief justice. The chief justice is the
head of the court and handles administrative duties of the court in addition to hearing cases.
	Banks said, "It would have been a great honor to serve the state as chief justice, but it is
not really an honor that I looked forward to. I don't  relish the ceremonial and administrative
aspects of that job.  I prefer to spend my time dealing with the legal issues. The prospect of being
chief justice did not play a significant role in my decision." 
Banks acknowledged that part of his decision to leave the court was based on economic
considerations. "There  are opportunities out there that are attractive to people with judicial
experience."
Banks said he has received other inquiries and offers to return to private law practice for
the past three years.
"It was a difficult decision because I enjoy what I'm doing," Banks said. "I left the
Legislature with mixed emotions. I was really enjoying my service in the Legislature when the
vacancy occurred on the Circuit bench. It was very much with mixed emotions that I left the
Legislature and private practice to become a Circuit Judge almost 17 years ago. It was with
mixed emotions that I left the trial bench. The same is true with this court.
"I do enjoy what I'm doing,  but I don't want to be here five or six years from now saying
'I wish I'd  tried something else,' " Banks said.
In 1975, Banks  was elected to the Mississippi House of Representatives from Hinds
County. He was twice re-elected.  During his tenure, he served as Chairman of the House Ethics
Committee, Chairman of the House Judiciary B Committee and Chairman of the Legislative
Black Caucus.
 In February 1985, he was appointed Circuit Judge for the 7th Circuit  District, which at
that time included Hinds and Yazoo counties. He was twice unopposed for re-election. In
January 1991, Governor Ray Mabus appointed Banks to fill an unexpired term on the Mississippi
Supreme Court.  Banks was elected to serve the remainder of that term in November 1991 and
re-elected to serve a full term in November 1996. 	
Banks has twice followed his former law partner, Reuben Anderson, into judicial
positions. Banks took the Circuit judgeship vacated by Anderson when Anderson was appointed
to the Supreme Court. When Justice Anderson returned to private practice, Banks was appointed
to the position that Anderson had held on the Supreme Court. 
Banks will rejoin Anderson, who is a partner in the Phelps Dunbar firm.
"We were law partners from 1968 to 1977 and we will be law partners again," Banks
said. "Reuben and I have been lifelong friends. We have been friends since the fifth grade,"
Banks said. "The prospect of joining him once again is a pleasant prospect."
Banks said he will not participate in any matters before the court involving the Phelps
Dunbar law firm. He withdrew from participation in any matter involving the Phelps Dunbar
firm two weeks ago.
"That's when I agreed that I would accept an offer if one was made," Banks said.
Banks grew up in Jackson. After graduating from Lanier High School in 1960, he
attended Howard University in Washington, D.C. He  received his undergraduate degree in
Business Administration and graduated cum laude from law school, second in his class, in 1968.
After admission to the Mississippi Bar, he began  private practice in Jackson, initially 
serving with other lawyers in his office as local counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense and 
Education Fund. That office evolved into the firm of Anderson, Banks, Nichols and Leventhal.
	Banks  participated in school desegregation, housing and employment discrimination,
voting rights and other civil rights cases as well as general law practice.  He was town attorney
for the Town of Fayette from 1970-75, consulting attorney to the Mississippi Association of
Educators and general counsel to the Mississippi State Conference of NAACP Branches.
Banks  was president of the Jackson Branch of the NAACP from1971 through 1982 and
presently serves as a member of the National Board of Directors of the NAACP. He chairs the
legal committee and sits on the executive committee.
He serves on the Board of Visitors at Mississippi College School of Law, where he is an
adjunct professor of law, and on the board of directors of the Greater Jackson Community
Foundation. He served as a member of the Mississippi Board of Bar Admissions. He is a Fellow
in the Mississippi Bar Foundation.  He is a member of the American Law Institute, a member
and former president of American Inns of Court, Charles Clark Inn, and of the Mississippi, Hinds
County, Magnolia, National, American, and District of Columbia bar associations.
Banks was co-director of the Mississippi Carter-Mondale presidential campaign in 1976.
He was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1976 and 1980. He was appointed
by President Jimmy Carter to serve on  the National Advisory Committee for the Education of
Disadvantaged Children as well as the Democratic National Committee Commission on
Presidential Elections.  He has served on numerous state and local commissions and task forces
including the State Advisory Committee to the Commission on Civil Rights, the State Advisory
Commission on Substance Abuse, the Governor's Task Force on Drunk Driving, and the
Governor's Constitutional Reform Commission.

				1. Please see your applicable Wells Fargo account agreement and card terms and conditions for information on liability for unauthorized transactions. 2. 10 or more purchases/payments with your Wells Fargo Debit Card each fee period required to avoid the $10 Everyday Checking account monthly service fee. - Included: Debit card purchases include PIN, signature, online and phone purchases that post during the fee period. Debit card payments include one-time and recurring payments of bills made with your debit card that post during the fee period. - Not Included: Any transaction at an ATM (Wells Fargo or non-Wells Fargo) and ACH (Automated Clearing House) transactions. Debit card purchases and debit card payments must post during the fee period to be counted toward the total of 10 or more. The dates of your fee period are located in the “Monthly service fee summary” section of your statement. Transactions received after the applicable cut-off time or on a non-business day (Saturday, Sunday and federal holidays) are posted on the next business day. 3. A qualifying direct deposit is a direct deposit of your salary, pension, Social Security, or other regular monthly income electronically deposited to this checking account by your employer or an outside agency. Transfers from one account to another, or deposits made at a banking location or ATM, do not qualify as a direct deposit. 4. If the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program is terminated, the bonus interest rate on all eligible savings accounts, and discounts or fee waivers on other products and services will discontinue and revert to the Bank's then- current applicable rate or fee.  For bonus interest rates on time accounts, this change will occur upon renewal. If the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program is terminated, the remaining unlinked Wells Fargo Portfolio Checking or Wells Fargo Prime Checking account will be converted to another checking product or closed. 5.  Subject to credit qualification. To qualify for a customer relationship discount, you may be required to maintain a qualifying Wells Fargo consumer checking account and make automatic payments from a Wells Fargo deposit account—if automatic payments are required but not selected, or are canceled for any reason at any time after account opening, the interest rate and the corresponding monthly payment may increase. To learn which accounts qualify for the discount, please consult a Wells Fargo banker. 6. The Portfolio by Wells Fargo program has a $30 monthly service fee, which can be avoided when you have one of the following Portfolio by Wells Fargo qualifying balances: $25,000 or more in qualifying linked bank deposits (checking, savings, time accounts (CDs), FDIC insured IRAs), OR $50,000 or more in qualifying linked bank, brokerage (available through our brokerage affiliate Wells Fargo Advisors®) and credit balances (including 10% of mortgage balances, certain mortgages not eligible). 7. Subject to applicable transfer or advance fees. 8. Benefits apply only to the primary Wells Fargo Portfolio Checking account within the Portfolio by Wells Fargo. 9. Surcharge fees imposed by non-Wells Fargo ATM owners or operators may apply. For the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program, Wells Fargo will waive its own ATM access fee (U.S. and international) when you withdraw cash from a non-Wells Fargo ATM from your primary checking account within the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program. Where Portfolio by Wells Fargo qualifying balances are $250,000 or more, you will be reimbursed for all surcharge fees on non-Wells Fargo ATM withdrawals located in the U.S., and receive reimbursement for up to 5 surcharge fees imposed by non-Wells Fargo ATM owners or operators per monthly fee period if you use a non-Wells Fargo ATM to make a cash withdrawal at an ATM located outside of the U.S. 10. No fee for Wells Fargo personal checks — except desk checks or home office style (3-on-a-page). Check discounts apply only to the primary Wells Fargo Portfolio Checking account.
