Trevena Inc is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company, headquartered in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, USA, and is involved in the discovery and development of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) biased ligands. Trevena was founded in 2007 with technology licensed from Duke University, which originated in the labs of company founders Robert Lefkowitz winner of the 2012 Nobel Prize in Chemistry [1] and Howard Rockman. Trevena's approach to drug discovery is based on utilizing ligand bias, or functional selectivity, at GPCR targets to produce drugs with improved efficacy and reduced side effect profiles.[2] Trevena was named one of the top 15 US startups of 2008 by Business Week.[3]
Trevena’s expertise lies in engineering "biased ligands" that activate only the beneficial signaling pathways downstream of a GPCR to unlock new biology and avoid drug adverse effects.[4] Trevena’s pipeline currently includes a clinical stage mu-opioid biased ligand for post-operative pain, and discovery-stage programs for chronic pain, migraine, and Parkinson’s disease.[5]

History[edit]
In 2008, the company raised $25 Million in a Series A[clarification needed] financing round led by Alta Partners, Polaris Ventures, New Enterprise Associates, Healthcare Ventures, and Yasuda Economic Development Corporation.[6]
In early 2009, Trevena entered into a collaborative agreement with Ligand Pharmaceuticals to identify biased ligands at numerous GPCRs from a large, diverse chemical library.[7] Later that year, Trevena received a competitively awarded American Recovery and Reinvestment Act Grand Opportunities Grant, spanning two years and funding $7.65 million USD of research.[8] The company has disclosed specific interests in the mu Opioid receptor and kappa Opioid receptor.[9] The company raised an additional $35 million USD in a B round of venture financing in the summer of 2010.[10] In 2011, Treveva received another NIH grant as part of the NIH Blueprint Neurotherapeutics Network, potentially worth up to $10M USD, to support preclinical development of a delta opioid receptor biased ligand for major depressive disorder.[11] Trevena has received funding from the Michael J. Fox Foundation to explore the potential for delta opioid receptor biased ligands to treat Parkinson's disease.[12]
Trevana's initial public offering was on January 30, 2014.[13]
Pipeline[edit]
Oliceridine[edit]
Trevena's leading drug candidate is Oliceridine (TRV130), a G protein-biased ligand binding to the mu opioid receptor[14] for the intravenous treatment of acute moderate-to-severe post-operative pain. Phase I and II clinical trials of TRV130 for postoperative pain are complete. Phase II trials showed effectiveness is analgesia and a wider therapeutic window than morphine.[15] In February 2016, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy status to olicerdine.[16] In January 2017, Trevana announced that enrollment for its phase III trials, APOLLO-1 and APOLLO-2 are complete.
TRV027[edit]
Trevena's developed TRV027 for acute heart failure, targets the angiotensin receptor utilizing beta-arrestin bias, an approach that has shown numerous beneficial cardiovascular and renal actions in preclinical species.[17][18] Trevena completed Phase I clinical trials in 2010.[19] Phase 2 clinical trials on TRV027 began in the spring of 2011.[20] In May 2016, Trevana announced that the TRV027 phase II trial failed to meet its primary endpoints and they were no longer developing the drug.[21]
TRV250[edit]
TRV250 is a pre-clinical drug candidate for migraine binding to the delta opioid receptor. This avoids the addiction potential of drugs that activate the mu opioid receptor. Other delta opioid-targeting drugs are known to cause seizures,[22] but Trevaga hopes to avoid this with TRV250 by bypassing the β-arrestin pathway.[23]
TRV734[edit]
TRV734 is an oral follow-up to the injected TRV130 mu-opioid biased ligand program. While it binds to the same receptors as opioid analgesics, TRV734 has very weak β-arrestin recruitment, unlike other available opioids, and produced fewer off-target effects.[24] Phase I clinical trials were completed in 2014.[25]

   OLINVO Discovery


How OLINVO™ (oliceridine injection) Works
OLINVO™ (oliceridine injection) was designed to have an improved analgesic profile by optimizing opioid receptor pharmacology, and has been granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA. OLINVO is the first μ-receptor G protein pathway selective modulator (μGPS), a biased ligand targeting the μ-opioid receptor. In preclinical studies, OLINVO activated the μ-opioid G protein receptor pathway in a manner similar to strong opioids such as morphine and fentanyl, and, like these drugs, OLINVO was a powerful analgesic. Unlike those drugs, in cell-based studies OLINVO did not engage the β-arrestin pathway, which was shown in other preclinical studies to inhibit morphine analgesia and promote morphine-induced constipation, respiratory depression, and analgesic tolerance.(1,2). 
OLINVO mechanism hypothesis

	In preclinical studies, OLINVO was more potent than morphine, and it reached peak analgesia faster. OLINVO caused less gastrointestinal dysfunction than morphine at equivalent analgesic doses. OLINVO also showed an improved relationship between analgesia and respiratory depression risk compared to morphine(3,4).

 Our pipeline consists of innovative product candidates focused in areas of acute care where current options leave significant unmet medical need:
OLINVO™ (oliceridine injection), our lead product candidate, is a next-generation IV analgesic in development for the management of moderate-to-severe acute pain. OLINVO has been designated a Breakthrough Therapy by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration.  
In February 2017, we announced top-line results from two Phase 3 pivotal efficacy studies testing multiple OLINVO dosing regimens. In both studies, all dose regimens achieved their primary endpoint of statistically greater analgesic efficacy than placebo, as required for FDA approval. In addition, compared to a commonly used IV morphine regimen, patients given one of the tested OLINVO regimens experienced comparable pain relief with numerically less frequent adverse events including vomiting and multiple indicators of respiratory safety â both key unmet needs in acute pain management. 
OLINVO was specifically designed to improve on conventional IV opioid pharmacology by binding to the same endorphin receptor as conventional opioids and selectively activating the pathway leading to pain relief, while avoiding a pathway associated with opioid-related adverse effects. Clinical trial results have consistently suggested that OLINVO may provide rapid and effective pain relief while potentially setting a new standard for opioid safety and tolerability.
Our pipeline also includes several product candidates we have identified as potential best-in-class or first-in-class therapies to address a variety of serious unmet medical needs. TRV734 has completed Phase 1 studies for the oral treatment of acute and chronic pain; TRV250 is in Phase 1 development for the treatment of migraines; and TRV027 recently was evaluated in a Phase 2b study for the treatment of acute heart failure.

Trevena Inc is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company, headquartered in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, USA, and is involved in the discovery and development of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) biased ligands. Trevena was founded in 2007 with technology licensed from Duke University, which originated in the labs of company founders Robert Lefkowitz winner of the 2012 Nobel Prize in Chemistry [1] and Howard Rockman. Trevena's approach to drug discovery is based on utilizing ligand bias, or functional selectivity, at GPCR targets to produce drugs with improved efficacy and reduced side effect profiles.[2] Trevena was named one of the top 15 US startups of 2008 by Business Week.[3]
Trevena’s expertise lies in engineering "biased ligands" that activate only the beneficial signaling pathways downstream of a GPCR to unlock new biology and avoid drug adverse effects.[4] Trevena’s pipeline currently includes a clinical stage mu-opioid biased ligand for post-operative pain, and discovery-stage programs for chronic pain, migraine, and Parkinson’s disease.[5]

History[edit]
In 2008, the company raised $25 Million in a Series A[clarification needed] financing round led by Alta Partners, Polaris Ventures, New Enterprise Associates, Healthcare Ventures, and Yasuda Economic Development Corporation.[6]
In early 2009, Trevena entered into a collaborative agreement with Ligand Pharmaceuticals to identify biased ligands at numerous GPCRs from a large, diverse chemical library.[7] Later that year, Trevena received a competitively awarded American Recovery and Reinvestment Act Grand Opportunities Grant, spanning two years and funding $7.65 million USD of research.[8] The company has disclosed specific interests in the mu Opioid receptor and kappa Opioid receptor.[9] The company raised an additional $35 million USD in a B round of venture financing in the summer of 2010.[10] In 2011, Treveva received another NIH grant as part of the NIH Blueprint Neurotherapeutics Network, potentially worth up to $10M USD, to support preclinical development of a delta opioid receptor biased ligand for major depressive disorder.[11] Trevena has received funding from the Michael J. Fox Foundation to explore the potential for delta opioid receptor biased ligands to treat Parkinson's disease.[12]
Trevana's initial public offering was on January 30, 2014.[13]
Pipeline[edit]
Oliceridine[edit]
Trevena's leading drug candidate is Oliceridine (TRV130), a G protein-biased ligand binding to the mu opioid receptor[14] for the intravenous treatment of acute moderate-to-severe post-operative pain. Phase I and II clinical trials of TRV130 for postoperative pain are complete. Phase II trials showed effectiveness is analgesia and a wider therapeutic window than morphine.[15] In February 2016, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy status to olicerdine.[16] In January 2017, Trevana announced that enrollment for its phase III trials, APOLLO-1 and APOLLO-2 are complete.
TRV027[edit]
Trevena's developed TRV027 for acute heart failure, targets the angiotensin receptor utilizing beta-arrestin bias, an approach that has shown numerous beneficial cardiovascular and renal actions in preclinical species.[17][18] Trevena completed Phase I clinical trials in 2010.[19] Phase 2 clinical trials on TRV027 began in the spring of 2011.[20] In May 2016, Trevana announced that the TRV027 phase II trial failed to meet its primary endpoints and they were no longer developing the drug.[21]
TRV250[edit]
TRV250 is a pre-clinical drug candidate for migraine binding to the delta opioid receptor. This avoids the addiction potential of drugs that activate the mu opioid receptor. Other delta opioid-targeting drugs are known to cause seizures,[22] but Trevaga hopes to avoid this with TRV250 by bypassing the β-arrestin pathway.[23]
TRV734[edit]
TRV734 is an oral follow-up to the injected TRV130 mu-opioid biased ligand program. While it binds to the same receptors as opioid analgesics, TRV734 has very weak β-arrestin recruitment, unlike other available opioids, and produced fewer off-target effects.[24] Phase I clinical trials were completed in 2014.[25]

Migraine is a common and sometimes debilitating brain disorder that remains poorly treated for many patients. 
	610 million headaches are treated annually in the United States, including the acute treatment of episodic migraine headaches 
	(440 million in 2014) as well as chronic migraine headaches (170 million in 2014)(1).  
	We estimate that approximately 20% to 30% of these patients either do not 
	respond to or cannot tolerate the market-leading triptan drug class, and an additional 25% would benefit from improved efficacy compared to these drugs.
Activation of the delta receptor has recently emerged as a potentially valuable new mechanism of action for treating migraine(2).  
	In addition, delta opioid receptor agonists also have shown therapeutic potential in preclinical models for additional indications including Parkinson's 
	disease(3) and neuropathic pain(4,5). These discoveries have attracted substantial research interest, in part because the delta receptor  
	is not associated with the addiction liability of mu opioid drugs like morphine or oxycodone(6). However, delta receptor activation has caused
	seizures in preclinical studies, limiting the utility of many known delta receptor agonists(7). Several approaches to separating these delta 
	receptor effects have been attempted, but none has yet achieved human proof of concept, and no selective delta receptor agonists have been approved for human use.
	
Mechanism hypothesis for TRV250
Trevena scientists discovered that delta receptor-mediated seizures are reduced in Î˛-arrestin2 knockout mice, while effects linked to therapeutic benefit are preserved. 
	This suggests that a G protein-biased ligand may be able to avoid delta receptor-mediated seizures while preserving the proposed CNS benefits of previous delta receptor agonists. 
	Other preclinical work has showed that delta receptor biased ligands may offer improved efficacy over unbiased ligands in mood disorders(8).
Trevena scientists leveraged these discoveries and Trevenaâs ABLE™ platform to design TRV250, a small molecule G protein biased ligand targeting the delta-receptor. 
	Based on the initial profile of TRV250, we anticipate focusing our initial development efforts on the acute treatment of episodic and chronic migraine headaches, 
	with a goal of providing a new option to migraine patients who are not adequately treated by currently approved medications.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Trevena Inc is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company, headquartered in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, USA, and is involved in the discovery and development of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) biased ligands. Trevena was founded in 2007 with technology licensed from Duke University, which originated in the labs of company founders Robert Lefkowitz winner of the 2012 Nobel Prize in Chemistry [1] and Howard Rockman. Trevena's approach to drug discovery is based on utilizing ligand bias, or functional selectivity, at GPCR targets to produce drugs with improved efficacy and reduced side effect profiles.[2] Trevena was named one of the top 15 US startups of 2008 by Business Week.[3]
Trevena’s expertise lies in engineering "biased ligands" that activate only the beneficial signaling pathways downstream of a GPCR to unlock new biology and avoid drug adverse effects.[4] Trevena’s pipeline currently includes a clinical stage mu-opioid biased ligand for post-operative pain, and discovery-stage programs for chronic pain, migraine, and Parkinson’s disease.[5]

History[edit]
In 2008, the company raised $25 Million in a Series A[clarification needed] financing round led by Alta Partners, Polaris Ventures, New Enterprise Associates, Healthcare Ventures, and Yasuda Economic Development Corporation.[6]
In early 2009, Trevena entered into a collaborative agreement with Ligand Pharmaceuticals to identify biased ligands at numerous GPCRs from a large, diverse chemical library.[7] Later that year, Trevena received a competitively awarded American Recovery and Reinvestment Act Grand Opportunities Grant, spanning two years and funding $7.65 million USD of research.[8] The company has disclosed specific interests in the mu Opioid receptor and kappa Opioid receptor.[9] The company raised an additional $35 million USD in a B round of venture financing in the summer of 2010.[10] In 2011, Treveva received another NIH grant as part of the NIH Blueprint Neurotherapeutics Network, potentially worth up to $10M USD, to support preclinical development of a delta opioid receptor biased ligand for major depressive disorder.[11] Trevena has received funding from the Michael J. Fox Foundation to explore the potential for delta opioid receptor biased ligands to treat Parkinson's disease.[12]
Trevana's initial public offering was on January 30, 2014.[13]
Pipeline[edit]
Oliceridine[edit]
Trevena's leading drug candidate is Oliceridine (TRV130), a G protein-biased ligand binding to the mu opioid receptor[14] for the intravenous treatment of acute moderate-to-severe post-operative pain. Phase I and II clinical trials of TRV130 for postoperative pain are complete. Phase II trials showed effectiveness is analgesia and a wider therapeutic window than morphine.[15] In February 2016, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy status to olicerdine.[16] In January 2017, Trevana announced that enrollment for its phase III trials, APOLLO-1 and APOLLO-2 are complete.
TRV027[edit]
Trevena's developed TRV027 for acute heart failure, targets the angiotensin receptor utilizing beta-arrestin bias, an approach that has shown numerous beneficial cardiovascular and renal actions in preclinical species.[17][18] Trevena completed Phase I clinical trials in 2010.[19] Phase 2 clinical trials on TRV027 began in the spring of 2011.[20] In May 2016, Trevana announced that the TRV027 phase II trial failed to meet its primary endpoints and they were no longer developing the drug.[21]
TRV250[edit]
TRV250 is a pre-clinical drug candidate for migraine binding to the delta opioid receptor. This avoids the addiction potential of drugs that activate the mu opioid receptor. Other delta opioid-targeting drugs are known to cause seizures,[22] but Trevaga hopes to avoid this with TRV250 by bypassing the β-arrestin pathway.[23]
TRV734[edit]
TRV734 is an oral follow-up to the injected TRV130 mu-opioid biased ligand program. While it binds to the same receptors as opioid analgesics, TRV734 has very weak β-arrestin recruitment, unlike other available opioids, and produced fewer off-target effects.[24] Phase I clinical trials were completed in 2014.[25]

Trevena's leading drug candidate is Oliceridine (TRV130), a G protein-biased ligand binding to the mu opioid receptor[14] for the intravenous treatment of acute moderate-to-severe post-operative pain. Phase I and II clinical trials of TRV130 for postoperative pain are complete. Phase II trials showed effectiveness is analgesia and a wider therapeutic window than morphine.[15] In February 2016, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy status to olicerdine.[16] In January 2017, Trevana announced that enrollment for its phase III trials, APOLLO-1 and APOLLO-2 are complete.
TRV027[edit]
Trevena's developed TRV027 for acute heart failure, targets the angiotensin receptor utilizing beta-arrestin bias, an approach that has shown numerous beneficial cardiovascular and renal actions in preclinical species.[17][18] Trevena completed Phase I clinical trials in 2010.[19] Phase 2 clinical trials on TRV027 began in the spring of 2011.[20] In May 2016, Trevana announced that the TRV027 phase II trial failed to meet its primary endpoints and they were no longer developing the drug.[21]
TRV250[edit]
TRV250 is a pre-clinical drug candidate for migraine binding to the delta opioid receptor. This avoids the addiction potential of drugs that activate the mu opioid receptor. Other delta opioid-targeting drugs are known to cause seizures,[22] but Trevaga hopes to avoid this with TRV250 by bypassing the β-arrestin pathway.[23]
TRV734[edit]
TRV734 is an oral follow-up to the injected TRV130 mu-opioid biased ligand program. While it binds to the same receptors as opioid analgesics, TRV734 has very weak β-arrestin recruitment, unlike other available opioids, and produced fewer off-target effects.[24] Phase I clinical trials were completed in 2014.[25]

Trevena Inc is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company, headquartered in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, USA, and is involved in the discovery and development of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) biased ligands. Trevena was founded in 2007 with technology licensed from Duke University, which originated in the labs of company founders Robert Lefkowitz winner of the 2012 Nobel Prize in Chemistry [1] and Howard Rockman. Trevena's approach to drug discovery is based on utilizing ligand bias, or functional selectivity, at GPCR targets to produce drugs with improved efficacy and reduced side effect profiles.[2] Trevena was named one of the top 15 US startups of 2008 by Business Week.[3]
Trevena’s expertise lies in engineering "biased ligands" that activate only the beneficial signaling pathways downstream of a GPCR to unlock new biology and avoid drug adverse effects.[4] Trevena’s pipeline currently includes a clinical stage mu-opioid biased ligand for post-operative pain, and discovery-stage programs for chronic pain, migraine, and Parkinson’s disease.[5]

History[edit]
In 2008, the company raised $25 Million in a Series A[clarification needed] financing round led by Alta Partners, Polaris Ventures, New Enterprise Associates, Healthcare Ventures, and Yasuda Economic Development Corporation.[6]
In early 2009, Trevena entered into a collaborative agreement with Ligand Pharmaceuticals to identify biased ligands at numerous GPCRs from a large, diverse chemical library.[7] Later that year, Trevena received a competitively awarded American Recovery and Reinvestment Act Grand Opportunities Grant, spanning two years and funding $7.65 million USD of research.[8] The company has disclosed specific interests in the mu Opioid receptor and kappa Opioid receptor.[9] The company raised an additional $35 million USD in a B round of venture financing in the summer of 2010.[10] In 2011, Treveva received another NIH grant as part of the NIH Blueprint Neurotherapeutics Network, potentially worth up to $10M USD, to support preclinical development of a delta opioid receptor biased ligand for major depressive disorder.[11] Trevena has received funding from the Michael J. Fox Foundation to explore the potential for delta opioid receptor biased ligands to treat Parkinson's disease.[12]
Trevana's initial public offering was on January 30, 2014.[13]
Pipeline[edit]
Oliceridine[edit]
Trevena's leading drug candidate is Oliceridine (TRV130), a G protein-biased ligand binding to the mu opioid receptor[14] for the intravenous treatment of acute moderate-to-severe post-operative pain. Phase I and II clinical trials of TRV130 for postoperative pain are complete. Phase II trials showed effectiveness is analgesia and a wider therapeutic window than morphine.[15] In February 2016, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy status to olicerdine.[16] In January 2017, Trevana announced that enrollment for its phase III trials, APOLLO-1 and APOLLO-2 are complete.

What is a Biased Ligand?
Trevena's ABLE Platform
History of Biased Ligands

  

History of GPCR Biased Ligands
The capacity of a receptor to signal through both G proteins and β-arrestins was discovered in the late 1990s and early 2000s(1)
	in the laboratory of Robert Lefkowitz M.D. at Duke University, using the angiotensin II receptor as a model. We now know that β-arrestins can activate a broad set of 
	intracellular signaling molecules for numerous GPCRs(2). Later work demonstrated that G protein and 
	β-arrestin pathways are distinct and can be pharmacologically modulated independently with 
	"biased ligands"(3). In the mid 2000s, a handful of biased ligands were discovered that specifically 
	targeted G protein or β-arrestin signaling, and the idea of biased GPCR signaling emerged as a new 
	theme in receptor biology(4,5). With a new appreciation of the diversity of signals that can be elicited 
	by GPCR ligands, Dr. Lefkowitz and his colleague Howard Rockman M.D., also at Duke University, began to consider 
	the possibility that biased ligands had the potential to uniquely modify GPCR-mediated pharmacology 
	to deliver new and differentiated medicines. Dr. Lefkowitz was awarded the 2012 Nobel Prize for Chemistry for his studies of 
	GPCRs. His Nobel Lecture, including discussion of biased ligands, can be viewed on the Nobel Prize Website.
Trevena was founded to harness the promise of biased ligands, with Drs. Lefkowitz and Rockman as academic co-founders.
	The company has successfully demonstrated that biased ligands can 
	be discovered and optimized for a number of distinct GPCRs. Furthermore,
	these biased ligands exhibit a unique spectrum of pharmacological responses.(6,7) This approach has the potential to deliver the next generation of GPCR-targeted 
	therapeutics to meet significant unmet patient needs.  Trevena has discovered 
	multiple biased ligands now in development as potential first-in-class and 
	best-in-class medicines to treat serious unmet medical needs.
