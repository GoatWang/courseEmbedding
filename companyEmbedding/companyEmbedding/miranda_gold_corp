TSX.V:MADDeutsch








Welcome to Miranda Gold Corp.
Miranda Gold Corp. (TSX-V: MAD) is a gold exploration company concentrating its generative efforts in Colombia. Our focus is exploration - the stage that offers the strongest rewards and growth potential for shareholders. The risk of exploration is mitigated through our joint venture business model and with strategic alliances. This business model allows us to conserve our treasury by having partners "earn in" to our projects by funding the early exploration on our projects.  Miranda Gold Corp. is committed to the exploration and discovery of world-class deposits in one of the most endowed and yet under-explored mineral jurisdictions in the world, Colombia. 

Miranda is also striving to separate itself from the typical "prospect generator" by becoming cash flow positive. Our Willow Creek project in Alaska is a high-grade underground past-producing gold mine with a NR43-101 compliant resource. Miranda has partnered with Gold Torrent Inc. in a "development joint venture" focused on placing Willow Creek back into production. Gold Torrent is tasked with placing the property into production and funding the majority of the capital that will be required.

Joint Venture

Properties Seeking JV







JV Partners

Miranda Gold Corp. has established a reputation as a high-quality project generator attracting a number of mining companies to help advance the exploration on our properties. By successfully leveraging our technical expertise into joint venture partnerships we lower the risk of early stage exploration and preserve shareholder value. 

Joint venture partners are responsible for funding all exploration on those projects under agreement in exchange for the opportunity to earn a majority interest in the property. 

Below is a list of our current partners:


IAMGOLD Corporation
www.iamgold.comIAMGOLD is a mid-tier mining company with four operating gold mines on three continents.  The company trades on the TSX under the symbol IMG and on the NYSE under the symbol IAG.  Production in 2017 is projected to be between 780,000 to 810,000 ounces of gold.  IAMGOLD has a solid base of strategic assets in North and South America and West Africa is complemented by development and exploration projects, and continued assessment of accretive acquisition opportunities.

On March 15, 2017 Miranda and IAMGOLD announced the signing of an option agreement that allows IAMGOLD Corporation to earn an interest in Miranda's Antares Project in Colombia by conducting exploration on a scheduled earn-in basis.  IAMGOLD is required to incur US$100,000 in expenditures during 2017 to maintain the right to enter into the option which begins on the later of January 1, 2018 or the date on which mineral title to one or more of the exploration applications making up the Antares Project has been granted by the Colombian government.  At such time, should IAMGOLD elect to enter into the option, it will be obligated to incur US$750,000 in expenditures during the subsequent 12 months.

Should IAMGOLD exercise the option they will have the right to acquire an initial undivided 51% interest in the mineral rights of Antares by funding a total of US$5,000,000 in expenditures, including a commitment to drill at least 3,000 meters over four years.  IAMGOLD also has a second option to acquire a further undivided 14% interest in the mineral rights, for an aggregate 65% interest by making additional exploration expenditures of US$7,000,000, including a commitment to drill at least 12,000 meters within a subsequent term of four years from the exercise of the first option.  IAMGOLD can attain a further 10% interest, for an aggregate 75% in the mineral rights of Antares, by providing Miranda, at its election, financing for mine construction.

IAMGOLD's Colombian exploration team will operate the project with input from Miranda.


Gold Torrent Inc.
www.goldtorrentinc.comGold Torrent Inc.  ("Gold Torrent") is a US listed company with a highly experienced management and technical team. Led by Daniel Kunz, Chairman and CEO, the company was formed to seek out and acquire high-grade mineral projects that could be fast-tracked into production. Dan has over 35 years of experience in engineering, mine operations, management, accounting, and finance including 17 years with Morrison Knudsen Mining as well as having served as the COO of Ivanhoe Mines Ltd. Gold Torrent and Miranda have entered into a partnership agreement in November, 2014, whereby Gold Torrent can earn a 70% interest in the Willow Creek project by funding the initial US$10 million in capital. Funding is staged with the total due by May 2018. Upon Gold Torrent earning a 70% interest, Miranda has the option to fund 30% of any additional Capex spending or dilute.

Corporate Profile

Miranda Gold Corp. is in the business of creating shareholder wealth through the discovery of new gold deposits. Our focus is Colombia - an under-explored country that was at one time the largest gold producer in South America. It is an exciting time to be exploring in Colombia with some 100 million ounces of gold discovered in the last ten years. Miranda is certainly one of the most active junior explorers in the country and the most active "prospect generator" since our initial involvement in 2009.

In addition to our projects in Colombia, the company has acquired the high-grade underground Willow Creek vein deposit in Alaska that has a recorded historical production of 667,000 ounces of gold at an average grade of 1.2 ounces per ton. We acquired a district scale property through an 80 year lease. The property came with approximately $10M of drill data that Miranda was able to use to form the basis of an independently prepared estimate of a measured and indicated resource of 62,100 ounces of gold contained in 78,700 tonnes at an average grade of 24.6 g Au/t using a cut off of 7.0 Au/t. Currently the project is being advanced through a "production" joint venture with Gold Torrent, a company with an experience underground mine development team.

Since 2003, Miranda Gold has established itself as one of the best exploration companies to employ the "project generator" business model. Over the years we have partnered with Newmont, Placer Dome, Barrick, Newcrest, Agnico Eagle and a dozen or so junior companies. The company is led by a strong management team who have been involved in 10 previous gold discoveries. Over the last 6 years Miranda's technical team has established an expertise in Colombian geology and exploration and has advanced several projects to the drill ready stage. Over the last 12 years the company has been successful in financing and attracting significant shareholders including Sprott Global, Rick Rule, Paul Stephens, the Orphan Fund, Adrian Day Asset Management, TriMark Capital, Paul van Eeden, Raymond James, Haywood Securities and the Taylor Fund. 

As an emerging mineral exploration company, known for our expertise as a project generator, investors have the opportunity to participate in a diverse number of projects and in turn numerous possibilities to take part in a major gold discovery. With a large property portfolio and solid partnerships with several mining companies, our goal is to mitigate the risk of exploration through Joint Ventures while increasing opportunities for discovery and preserving the treasury.
Highlights:

Strong management team with decades of worldwide exploration and mining expertise and experience in financing and public company management.
Focused in Colombia with emphasis on discovering multi-million ounce gold deposits. 
A portfolio of Colombia projects that include outcropping mineralized systems that are "drill ready".
 An active joint venture in Alaska at Willow Creek where our partner will fund the first US$10M of mine development  and where we could see production and cash flow as soon as 2018 which would allow Miranda to become a Self-Funded Prospect Generator, something unique in the industry.
Through an installment purchase option agreement, Miranda holds a 3.3% Net Smelter Royalty at Willow Creek that could be monetized or held for future cash flow.
Share project risk by joint venturing properties thus providing shareholders exposure to numerous gold exploration projects while at the same time preserving capital.
Active Exploration and Joint Venture Agreements with IAMGold Corporation and Gold Torrent, Inc.

					Full Description



Miranda Gold Corp. (Miranda), incorporated on May 4, 1993, is engaged in the acquisition, exploration and the development of mineral properties. The Company’s primary focus is on gold exploration. Miranda’s business model is to identify and secure mineral resource properties for which it seeks suitable joint venture partners. The Company operates in the mineral exploration sector within two geographic segments: Nevada and Alaska projects in the United States and Colombian projects in Colombia.Nevada and Alaska projectsThe Nevada projects include the Redlich and Kibby Flats projects located in Esmeralda County; the Big Blue project located in Lander County; Red Canyon and Red Hill projects located in Eureka County; the Iron Point project located in Humboldt County; the Mustang project located in Nye County, and the East Spruce project located in Elko County. The Red Canyon sediment-hosted gold project is made up of 254 lode claims (8.2 square miles / 21.2 square kilometers) along the Battle Mountain-Eureka Gold Trend in Eureka County, Nevada. The project covers a 3 square miles (7.8 square kilometers) alteration cell developed in carbonate rocks that are age-equivalent to gold-bearing host rocks at the Cortez Hills, Pipeline and Gold Bar deposits. Red Hill is located in the northern Simpson Park Mountains approximately 80 road miles (128 kilometers) southwest of Elko, Nevada. The property is along the Cortez Gold Trend, a west-northwest alignment of bulk-mineable, sediment-hosted gold deposits including Pipeline, Cortez Hills, Gold Acres, Cortez and Horse Canyon. Red Hill is 15 miles (24 kilometers) southeast of the Cortez Hills gold deposit, a 12 million ounce sediment-hosted gold deposit owned by Barrick. The Iron Point project is made up of 80 lode claims covering 2.6 square miles (6.7 square kilometers) along the Battle Mountain - Eureka Gold Trend in Humboldt County, Nevada. The project is located at the intersection of the Battle Mountain-Eureka and Getchell gold trends. Kibby Flat is a high-sulfidation gold system project in the Monte Cristo Range in western Esmeralda County, Nevada, and about 37 miles (60 kilometers) west-northwest of Tonopah. The Mustang epithermal gold-silver target consists of 69 lode claims covering 2.2 square miles (5.7 square kilometers) 15 miles (24 kilometers) southeast of Gabbs, in Nye County, Nevada.Willow Creek project is located approximately 75 miles (121 kilometers) north of Anchorage, Alaska, in the Willow Creek mining district. This contiguous project claim block includes 76 patented and 62 State of Alaska lode mining claims covering an area of approximately 8,700 acres (3,520 hectares).Colombian projectsThe Company’s Colombian projects include the Pavo Real, Oribella and Cerro Oro exploration projects. The Company’s activity of gold mineralization is operated at Pavo Real, Colombia. The Pavo Real project comprises a Triassic-Jurassic sedimentary sequence overlain by a volcanic sequence. The sedimentary and volcanic sequences are intruded by various bodies of diorite, granite and rhyodacite porphyry, and cut by hydrothermal breccias and a number of quartz veins and quartz stockwork, all related to sericitic alteration. The Project is situated within the Department of Tolima, 20 kilometers south of the city of Ibague and 45 kilometers south-east of AngloGold Ashanti's La Colosa project.The Company also owns the Oribella project in the Antioquia Department of Colombia, which lies about 40 kilometers southwest of Medellin. The Oribella project comprises approximately 10,700 hectares, including one exploration license and one application on which the government technical study has been completed and the canon fees have been paid. Cerro Oro covers approximately 1,100 hectares and lies within the Middle Cauca Belt in the Caldas department approximately 120 kilometers south of Medellin. Cerro Oro appears to be one of a cluster of large northeast-trending epithermal gold systems that includes Marmato which lies 14 kilometers to the northeast.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.
