A Word From the Courts ...

 "The Court was a little tentative about doing online mediation but the whole team from Court innovations has been fantastic and very good at addressing our concerns and explaining the process - We would highly recommend the Matterhorn Online Mediation application."Michelle Marcero 
1st District Court Administrator
"Court Innovations has been a wonderful addition to our customer service efforts.  Unlike other vendors, the team responds immediately to answer our questions.  They not only are open to our ideas for new services but present options to us as well.  We couldn't be happier with their product and I can't say enough about how great the staff is."Shirley Beeman 
74th District Court Administrator
"My feelings are --if people are going out of their way to contact us, then they do really want to resolve the issue and by and large, for the most part, we will probably reschedule the hearing ."
Tanya Todd 
61st District Court Clerk
"It seems to be a win-win-win for all the participants. Processes that used to take whole days now take only minutes."Robert Ciolek 
Court Administrator, Michigan 14A District Court
"...A lot of people who work or go to school or never had issues with the law can go online and resolve their case without ever having to come into court, including paying for it online."Hon. Dawn A. Klida 
Michigan 74th District Court
"...The way budgets are these days, the police do not have to show up, which means they can do it from their office if they have to do anything. It eliminates the court time which means we don’t have to put that on our docket. And it also frees up time for the magistrate, of course."Hon. Thomas Truesdell 
Michigan 14A District Court
"Currently those with civil infractions are getting an initial court date on average of 21 days; with Matterhorn, from date of ticket issuance through to closing of the ticket is averaging 6.1 days."
 Hon. Brigette Officer-Hill 
Michigan 30th District Court
"Matterhorn not only improves the process of resolving a warrant, it alleviates the fears that people might have about coming to court to do so, and getting arrested."Hon. Dawn A. Klida 
Michigan 74th District Court
"Matterhorn’s online platform has improved what was an inefficient process that was leading to a backlog of cases in the courtroom and a general sense of dissatisfaction with the courts in the community."Hon. Dawn A. Klida 
Michigan 74th District Court
"Online ticket review helps to make the justice system more accessible and convenient for the public. The system also saves time for judges, prosecutors, and law enforcement, making our justice system more efficient."Hon. Robert P. Young 
Chief Justice, Michigan Supreme Court
"Going to court is stressful enough, let alone having to miss work. Online ticket review takes the stress out and helps to resolve the case more quickly and efficiently. That’s good news for both the public and the courts."Hon. Bridget McCormick 
Supreme Court Justice

About Matterhorn
Based in Ann Arbor, Mich., Court Innovations is a spin out from the University of Michigan Law School. Matterhorn allows courts to handle many high-volume infractions completely online, saving citizens and courts time and money. Rather than limiting judicial or law enforcement discretion, Matterhorn enables decision-makers to resolve cases more efficiently and equitably. Its 24/7 access and education component empowers defendants to work with the court to resolve minor violations informally, and at a convenient time.

 What are the benefits of online negotiation? Its free to search and see if you are eligible and you can do it at your convenience from home, work, school, using your phone, tablet or computer.  Traffic Ticket? You could get your charge changed to one with no or fewer driver's license points. And you can do it online rather than going to court.   Warrant? Resolve a fail-to-pay warrant without getting arrested or coming to court to see the judge. If you have a fail-to-appear warrant you can pay your bond online and receive a new court date.  How is it different online than in court? It's not. Your case is reviewed, and a final decision is made by the judge. Why does the court allow online case negotiation? We all make mistakes, and the court is there to listen to you and help you resolve your case. For Traffic cases, If you have a good driving record, the judge and police officer may be willing to give you a lesser charge that does not add points to your license.  For Warrant cases, the court has created this site to provide you clear instructions on how to take care of your obligations. 





Online Negotiation

Search for your case.
Submit your request.
The court will get back to you!



About 30th District Court
The State of Michigans 30th District Court is pleased to offer online case negotiation as part of our initiative to expand access to justice and to strive for efficiency and fairness.  Read more

Franklin County Small Claims Resolution with Matterhorn featured in Norwegian Judicial Magazine
Post Date: June 28, 2017 Author: Dunrie Greiling




The magazine of the Norwegian Judiciary, Rett på Sak, wrote about Matterhorn’s successful small claims resolution in Franklin County, Ohio. Franklin County includes Ohio’s state capital Columbus and its surrounding area.
Benefits of Small Claims Resolution
According to Alex Sanchez, manager of the small claims and dispute resolution department at Franklin County Municipal Court,
“The direct results of the platform are more cases resolved prior to [main hearing]….
The biggest benefit to the parties is that they can resolve their case without setting aside time to come to court….
By providing one more avenue for case resolution, courts can dedicate time and resources to other projects and cases.”
How has Matterhorn been received? Alex Sanchez says,
“We received compliments from parties on the very first day the platform launched….Our court users have found our ODR negotiation platform easy to use and are appreciative of the time it saves.”

The article’s authors, Colleen Anderson and Travis Peterson, are students in a joint program at the University of Toledo, Ohio, and the Folkeuniversitet i Trondheim (University of Trondheim).
The full issue of Rett på Sak can be found online on the Norges Domstoler (Judiciary of Norway) website. The magazine is available as a PDF and the article about us (in English!) is on pages 26-27.
We are thrilled by the continuing international and national interest in Matterhorn (including the recent presentation at the International ODR conference in Paris). We are particularly pleased that the users of the system find it valuable.
