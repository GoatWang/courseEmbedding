Title: President
               Company: Jackson & Blanc Inc
Job Details
               Jackson & Blanc has been serving the heating and air conditioning needs of San Diego since 1931. The company has grown from a small shop serving primarily local residences to an operation that serves large commercial establishments throughout Southern California. Partners Milt Jackson and Rene Blanc started Jackson & Blanc on July 1, 1931. At the time, The Great Depression still had a strong-hold on the US, and the firm got most of its business from residential customers, designing and installing furnaces for their homes. In 1939, as the economy continued to bounce back from the Depression and the air conditioning industry began to flourish, Jackson & Blanc expanded its service to commercial establishments. In the 1940s, the material demands of World War II drove much of the US economy. Jackson & Blanc served as the only Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning (HVAC) business in San Diego County to operate continuously throughout the war and performed much of its work for the Navy. The Company provided air conditioning for pilot training simulators and also installed systems at Camp Callan and Camp Matthews - both waypoints for American soldiers headed to fight in the war.

If the company isn't reporting the account correctly, you can submit a dispute to the credit bureaus asking them to correct it.

If you were a grad victim you don't need to fill out a fraud package. Google it. And send it to the credit bureaus.

I live on a fixed income. Its very difficult. My father and I are fairly comfortable, but due to the 40+ derogatory items on my credit report, which are all medically related. Lexington law, if you can afford their services, have done soo much for me. In only two months time, they removed 25+ items off my report. Unfortunately I'm unable to continue working with them, due to the roughly $100/mo fee, which is a bit too high for me.… read more

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.

Are there really companies you can pay that guarantee to raise your credit score in 2 months or less or they'll double your money back?
