Opkix Closes $675,000 100% Subscribed Seed Round | Business Wire
























































Opkix Closes $675,000 100% Subscribed Seed Round






December 20, 2016 08:00 AM Eastern Standard Time



COSTA MESA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Opkix (a DBA of Native Optiks, Inc.), a global lifestyle brand creating 
      consumer camera products in the wearable, lighting, optics, accessories, 
      and mobile camera space, today announced the closing of its fully 
      subscribed $675,000.00 Seed round with several private high net worth 
      and angel investors.
    


      Proceeds are dedicated to accelerating commencement of the company’s 
      production-ready prototype named Opkix 1, formalizing its brand and 
      marketing strategy and completing the MVP of its mobile camera app 
      platform. “This initial Seed round was smaller than most, by design. We 
      accepted only what we needed to reach our near-term goals as outlined in 
      our financial model and because we’re well down the path with several 
      current investors on our Series A round closing in 2017,” stated Shahin 
      Amirpour, Co-Founder of Optiks.
    

      Co-Founder and Chief Design Officer, Ryan M. Fuller, said, “Personally, 
      I’m passionate about photography and videography. It’s the centerpiece 
      of most of my work, so building Opkix is the realization of a long-held 
      dream. We’ve created an initial product, and a suite of new products and 
      accessories, that address current consumer demand while also challenging 
      the status quo in ways no one has ever seen. This is going to be fun!”
    

      Co-Founder and CEO, C. Lawrence Greaves, stated, “Opkix is 
      revolutionizing the personal camera to seamlessly integrate into the 
      lives of users. Providing an integrated ‘capture and share’ user 
      experience is what Opkix is all about. Whether flying down a mountain on 
      a snowboard, creating one of your favorite dog videos, or pushing your 
      baby on a swing in the park, Opkix wants to be there – you’re #1. 
      Consumer’s needs are moving quickly past existing mobile camera 
      offerings. We believe Opkix 1, as well as our suite of new products, 
      provide a strong competitive advantage over current offerings and 
      position us well for the future by presenting a super high-quality 
      product at a value that’s unmatched in the industry.”

You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.
