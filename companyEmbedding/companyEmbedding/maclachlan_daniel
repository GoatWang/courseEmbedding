Chair of Ophthalmology, Otology & Paedolothy 1889-1895






DANIEL A. MacLACHLAN was born at Aylmer, Ontario, November 10, 1852, son of Archibald and Mary (Robertson) MacLachlan. His father's parents came from Argyleshire, Scotland, and settled in Caledonia, New York. His maternal ancestry is Scotch-Irish. He received his early education in the public schools and under private tutors. After teaching school for two years he entered upon the study of medicine, and in 1875 passed the preliminary examinations before the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario. In the following year he entered the Homeopathic Medical College of the University of Michigan and was graduated Doctor of Medicine in 1879.  After passing the examination of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario, he began the practice of his profession at Pontiac, Michigan, and later removed to Holly.  In 1885 he was appointed to the chair of the Theory and Practice of Medicine in the Homeopathic Medical College of the University and held this position till he was transferred in 1889 to the chair of Ophthalmology, Otology, and Paedolothy.  He resigned this position in 1895 and removed to Detroit. In 1889 he studied abroad in London, Vienna, Heidelberg, an Paris; and again in 1892 in London and Edinburgh.  In this year he received the diploma of the Royal London Ophthalmic Hospital.  He was a member of the Michigan State Board of Health from 1899 to 1905. He was First Vice-President of the American Institute of Homeopathy, 1895-1896, and President of the Michigan State Homeopathic Medical Society, 1895-1897. He is a member of the New York State Homeopathic Medical Society, and a member and one of the founders of the American Ophthalmological, Otological, and Laryngological Society. He is also a member of the Detroit Practitioners' Society and of the Grace Hospital Medical Board, and has served as Ophthalmic and Aural Surgeon to the latter institution since 1895. In 1899 he was made Dean of the Detroit Homeopathic College and Professor of Ophthalmology, Otology, and Laryngology in that institution, which positions he still holds. From 1886 to 1895 he was editor of "The Medical Counselor," then published in Ann Arbor; since its removal to Detroit he has served as associate editor. He has made numerous contributions to the professional journals. In 1882 he was married to Bertha M. Hadley, Holly, Michigan, and they have two children: Mary Winifred and Ruth.

Clan History

We include here  the pamphlet "Who are the MacLachlans" by Tom McLachlan.


Who are the MacLachlans?
Origins in Scotland.  
 The MacLachlans originate in Scotland from Cowal of Argyllshire
which comprises the parishes of Strathlachlan, wherein lies Castle
Lachlan home of the Chief, Strachur, Kilfinan, Kilmodan, Inverchaolin,
Dunoon and Kilmun. The area is bounded on the east by Loch Long and the
Firth of Clyde, on the south by the Kyles of Bute and to the west by
Loch Fyne. In fact MacLachlans lived on both sides of Loch Fyne
including the parishes of Kilmichael-Glassary, the Knapdales and
Kilmartin, all at the mainland end of the of Kintyre. The men of Argyll
were always, by necessity, seamen and the waters between the peninsulas
and islands were less barriers to social and commercial intercourse
than were the hills. A look at a map of Scotland shows the high
proportion of coastline to land mass in Argyll.
MacLachlans were to be found two hundred years ago in other parts
of Scotland. Migration eastward had settled MacLachlans across into
Perthshire where the spelling is MacLauchlan (pronunciation the same).
Many of the families in Stirlingshire were probably associated with the
MacLachlans of Auchintroig in the parish of Drymen at the border of
Stirlingshire with Dumbartonshire.
 Many dwelt on Mull , in Morvern and along the shores of Loch
Linnhe. Merchants and sailors settled early in the Clyde towns of
Glasgow and Greenock. In the middle of the last century many Irish
immigrants settled on Clydeside and in southwest Scotland and many
district registrars spelt surnames the Scottish way and so some
McLaughlans became McLachlan or McLauchlan and were never altered back
again. There was always a two-way movement between south-west Scotland
and northeast Ireland and it would be very difficult to be certain
whether or not the forebears of some immigrants from Ireland had gone
in the reverse direction a century or so before.

Spelling. 
  Spellings of the name
are significant to only a limited extent. Mac and Mc were used
indiscriminately until the commencement of compulsory registration in
1855 when most Argyll registrars used "Mac" while the Clydeside and
inland parishes used "Mc". Those families higher up the social scale
frequently insisted on being recorded as MacLachlans. The inclusion of
the "u" indicates an east coast family or a possible Irish descent and
spelt with a "g" the name almost certainly is from Ireland. Of course
many McLaughlans are more Scottish than most by series of marriages
with old Scots families.

Clan System.   
 Highland chiefs, lairds and tacksmen were wealthy only in terms of
their social conditions relative to those of ordinary Highlanders. The
feudal clan system broke up when the commerce and methods of government
of the rest of the United Kingdom penetrated effectively the more
remote parts of Scotland. Retributive measures by the government after
1745 hastened this process. The property of the chief's family was
confiscated for their part in the Rebellion in which Lachlan 17th chief
of MacLachlan was killed at Culloden. The lands were later restored to
his son.
Up to that time a territorial chief sub-let land through tacksmen
who were "platoon" and "company" commanders in the chief's "battalion"
in times of strife. The holders of tacks were members of the Highland
middle class and all the while their children were brought up with the
children of their neighbours there were no class barriers. The power of
the chiefs and tacksmen was in the allegiance of the families living on
their land. 
With the decline in the clan system the tacksmen, who leased but
owned little or no land, were among the first to leave Scotland. Many
went to North America where most settled and to the West Indies where
many died or made a fortune and came home or to London. Alexander and
Dougald, sons of Lachlan MacLachlan of Fassafern in Lochaber, went to
Jamaica in the middle of the 18th century and retired to live in the
south of England later in the century. Their wills show that they had
owned plantations in the West Indies and mention, in one case, a son by
a freed slave for whom provision was made.

Families after the End  of the  Clan System.  
The sons of these families entered the army or became lawyers or
merchants in English or Scottish cities and other parts of the world.
Some, less venturesome and less astute, tried to eke out a gentlemanly
existence without money in the area in which they were born. Examples
were Colin and Ewan sons of Ewan MacLachlan of Laudale in Morvern
parish who succeeded to the property. In her memoirs a neighbour wrote
of them, "In an evil moment they went security for some relative, with
the result that their property had to be sold to meet the demand, and
little indeed was left for them to live upon. They used to arrive as if
to make a call, but it was well understood that a visit of a week or
two was intended". They never married and spent their later life as
house servants near Oban.
When Colin MacLachlan of Craiginterve died in 1804 his
long-established landed family was declining socially and economically.
They had been hereditary leeches to the Earls and Dukes of Argyll for
several generations, and had intermarried with families of Campbells.
Colin's heir was his daughter, Lucy, wife of Archibald Bell, a writer
in Inverary, then the administrative centre of the county of Argyll.
Archibald and his two sons changed their surname to MacLachlan to
preserve the "title". His grandson. William Campbell Bell MacLachlan,
was a plumber in Helensburgh before succeeding to Craiginterve. The
property finally passed out of the family's hands during the lifetime
of his son John Bell Maclachlan who owned 2,900 acres in Argyllshire in
1872 when he was 14 years old but when he died at Eastbourne in the
south of England in 1949 his effects were worth only 737 pounds
sterling.
Within a few miles of Craiginterve is Killinochanach, the Moaning
Woods, once home of another MacLachlan family. Neil the son of Donald
and grandson of Kenneth MacLachlan of Killinochanach was born around
1767 living a long and respectable life to die in Lochgilphead, a
new-grown town, in 1862. He was a captain in the Argyll Militia and a
Justice of Peace, but none of his family left male heirs in Scotland.
His eldest son, Lachlan, earned renown as "Bendigo Mac"after being
appointed a magistrate in the Australian gold fields.
Another neighbouring family were the MacLachlans of Dunadd,
hereditary seneschals of the Chief on that side of the Loch, only a
mile from Killinochanach and five from Craiginterve. Robert was a
captain in the Argyll Fencibles, a forerunner to the Militia, and was
the son of Kenneth, grandson of Duncan and grandnephew of Dougald, all
of Dunadd. Early in the last century the family had to sell up at
Dunadd and moved to the far north of the county to the parish of
Morvern. Here he held the tack of the farm of Rahoy. His
granddaughter's journal says that, of a family of thirteen only one,
her mother, had children. One son died as a soldier in India and
another, a doctor died in nearby Tobermoray in 1873 about 110 years
after his father's birth. Doctor John MacLachlan is still remembered as
a famous singer of Gaelic songs.
Besides having the effect of dispossessing most of the tacksmen and
many of the minor lairds, the social change had another effect on the
ordinary people. The greater ease of communication allowed individuals
to change their abodes and expanding commerce allowed men, who would
have died as shepherds or cottars at home, to achieve reputation and
substance elsewhere. Charles MacLachlan was born in Greenock in 1794
the son of Duncan, a sailor, and Margaret Turner both of whom had come
across the Firth of Clyde from Kilmun near Holy Loch. He went out to
the West Indies as a clerk with a Scottish trading company, later
transferring to Hobart in Tasmania then known as Van Diemen's Land.
Later he became a director of the island's bank and a member of the
legislative council with property in New South Wales and a stylish
house in London's Belgravia.
Thomas MacLachlan was enrolled as a private soldier in the 44th
regiment of Foot in 1780, serving at Quebec in 1783 being discharged
ten years later. He re-enlisted as an ensign (2nd lieutenant) in the
3rd West Indian Regiment in 1795 and reached the rank of captain. His
son became a doctor of medicine and a Justice of the Peace in Rothesay;
his grandsons included two doctors, a minister of the church and
major-general.
Another Thomas (1829-1900) was a pioneer of the Transvaal and
Swaziland and one of South Africa's successful gold prospectors. He was
described as a tall and lanky Scotsman and was born in the Perthshire
parish of Caputh into the family of Robert, a successful farmer, and
his wife Janet McNaughton. 
Two brothers James and Donald MacLachlan, the sons of an army
captain, were merchants and served as consuls or consular agents to
Queen Victoria in the Dutch East Indies. Both married Dutch women.
James died at Cheltenham, England in 1903 worth a quarter million
pounds.
After fighting the British government forces in the 1745 Rebellion,
many former rebel highlanders and their sons joined British Highland
regiments. Their fighting tradition, their ability to live in rugged
surroundings on short rations and their family pride made them
excellent soldiers.  
 A commission in the British Army at that time was obtained either
by purchase, by quota of men or by nomination by a senior officer who
had rendered a distinguished service. Lachlan MacLachlan was appointed
an ensign in the 48th Foot regiment in 1796 at the behest of his
mother's brother General James Campbell. The unusual feature of this
appointment was that Lachlan was only six years old at the time. He
never actually saw service and remained on half pay for most life, but
his four brothers James, Archibald, Alexander and Robert served to
become a colonel, major-general, Lt. general and captain respectively.
The last died in Spain in the Peninsular wars of Napoleon and
Wellington. They were the nephews of Lachlan, the Jacobite Chief who
died at Culloden in 1746 at the hands of their predecessors in the
British Army. 
Although six years was too tender an age to actually serve in the
army of the time, ten or twelve years was not. James Augustus
McLauchlan went to Canada in 1811 to join his father, a Royal Engineer
captain. On arrival in New Brunswick he found that the captain had been
previously ordered to the West Indies. The 104th Regiment adopted him
in the rank of ensign. He remained in New Brunswick and married and his
descendants are still in Maritime Canada with a tradition of military
service. 
Born in Glasgow's Gorbals in 1807, the son of a shoemaker, Daniel
McLachlan attended Glasgow Grammar School and qualified as a doctor of
medicine at Edinburgh in 1827. He entered the army as a hospital
assistant and then served as a regimental surgeon. His last 23 years of
military service were as principal medical officer at the Royal
Hospital, the home of the Chelsea Pensioners. His two surviving sons
were army officers, one dying in the Crimea.
The migration of Scotsmen of the time are illustrated by nine
master mariners and mates named McLachlan born in Scotland in the first
half of the last century. Although all did not end their days on dry
land, five had their homes in Liverpool at the time of their deaths,
one in London and three in Scotland. Of thirteen MacLachlan army
officers of the last century born in Scotland who died outside active
service only three ended their days there and one of those had probably
never been out of the country. Of the remainder one died in Ireland,
one in New Zealand and another in Australia and the rest in England. 
MacLachlan doctors of medicine were more inclined to stay at home.
Of thirty three born in Scotland, sixteen died there. The remainder
died in England (12), India (2) and one each in Australia, South
America and South Africa.

Clan Records.    
Like other bearers of Scots Highland surnames, we MacLachlans are
to be excused our pride in our forebears past and the wish to know more
about them is understandable. One of the finest attributes in the
Highlandman was his respect for his kin and his overwhelming desire to
earn and retain their respect for him. Most families in any area of the
Highlands were related in one way or another and every member knew his
relationship with everyone else and would stand by his father's second
cousin or his mother's aunt if the need arose. 
People like the late Hugh McLachlin of Burlington, Ontario have
created extensive records of their co-descendants. His ancestor, Hugh,
with his wife, Janet McLean, left Kilmallie parish on Scotland's west
coast, early in the last century and settled first in western Quebec
before moving into Ontario. Hugh traced the many hundreds of
descendants of that couple which included Daniel, the famous lumber
boss of Renfrew County.
  Much of this work can be done now while there are people
alive who remember family stories of past migrations. When these Clan
"elders" are gone no amount of research among records will adduce the
information they could have given. As it is, countless generations to
come will never know the name of thei last ancestor to come out of
Scotland. Whether that ancestor was a near impecunious tacksman or a
totally impecunious crofter is not of importance. The act of emigration
and the challenge of survival in pioneer conditions usually required a
person of sterling character and their name and origin are worthy of
preservation by their family, present and future.
There is so much to be recorded in this history of the MacLachlans
and so little on record. Not only are the events prior to 1745, when
most of our ancestors lived in the Highlands, of considerable interest,
but many occurrences since make good reading. If you are not one of the
families that made the long journey across the Atlantic or to the
Southern Hemisphere under sail, you have cousins whose families did.
 Ours is not among the larger clans but is one of the oldest
and most respected and we are represented at the clan gatherings all
over the world. Ninety per cent of our membership is now outside
Scotland and there are now strong Branches of the Society in Australia,
Canada , New Zealand and the United States exchanging information and
finding long-lost cousins.
Prompted by the late Madam Marjorie Maclachlan , the 24th chief , a
small group met in Glasgow on 24th March 1979 and resolved to form the
Clan MacLachlan Society to fulfil the functions suggested in the
foregoing paragraph. The major medium of communication is a journal
"Clan Lachlan" published twice a year. 
 Every family that has migrated has a story to tell and
although one may be excused for not holding all one's relations in
universal esteem, it is a good experience to read of, hear from, or to
meet someone who shares forebears. Individual members throughout the
world now communicate more and more through E mail.  
The Story of individual Families are now
recorded for all time in the "Clan Lachlan" CD which is updated every
year and is stored in the National Library of Scotland. Add the story
of your Family to our Clan records.
 See Order Form .  
The name is the same whether it starts Mac, Mc, or M', and
continues Lachlaine, Lachlan or Lauchlin or Claflin or a sept such as
Gilcrist. We have all known our name to be subject to considerable
abuse as to spelling, but it would be a bold man who claimed his to be
the only correct way. The founder members agreed to use the version
similar to that of the Chiefs family when referring to the Clan
generally, but every effort is made to use the spelling preferred by an
individual or a family when referring to them.
Euan Maclachlan of Maclachlan, the 25th Chief succeeded his mother
on her death in October 1996 and lives at Castle Lachlan in the parish
of Strathlachlan, Strachur, Argyll on the shores of Loch Fyne, a few
hundred yards from the ancient castle damaged 
by a disabling action by General Campbell's soldiers departing after
their occupation in the year that his great great great great
grandfather was struck down at Culloden.
