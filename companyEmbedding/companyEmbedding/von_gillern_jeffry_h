	Explanation of Responses:










	(1) 





	Restricted stock units convert into common stock on a one-for-one basis at the time of vesting.









	(2) 





	A grant of restricted stock units was awarded to the Reporting Person on February 20, 2014, and was reported on a Form 4 filed on February 24, 2014. The number of restricted stock units originally awarded was subject to adjustment based on certain fiscal 2014 corporate performance measures. On January 23, 2015, the adjusted, final number of units subject to the award was reported. Due to a calculation error, the number of shares in that form was incorrect. This form is being filed to report the correct number of shares. The number of restricted stock units in column 5 is the number of units by which the original award was increased. The number of units in column 9 is the total final award amount.









	(3) 





	The restricted stock units vest in four equal annual installments beginning on the date listed in the Date Exercisable column of Box 6.
