Combat / Carry Adjustable Rear SightUniquely configured for combat / carry applications, the MMC Combat Adjustable Sight meets the need for an extremely durable and snag free adjustable gun sight. More 


MMC Rotary Power Checkering ToolThe tool is used to complete the repetitious bulk of the checkered panels. Hand tool use is not eliminated, however, the time required to finish the job is dramatically reduced.More

Firearm Safety and Proper Gun HandlingSafe gun handling helps us minimize, or hopefully eliminate personal injury and demonstrate to those around us, the deadly serious nature of the tool we use. More 








Combat / Carry Adjustable Rear Sight
When considering an adjustable sight for a handgun, the question should be – How will it be used? If the application is exclusively to punch holes in paper, perhaps target sights are in order. However, if the gun is to be used for carry or combination carry / target, then a lower, snag free design would be a better choice. Unfortunately, current adjustable offerings are largely unsuitable for combat use. In addition to the low, snag free profile, a combat sight should be very durable and quick to acquire. It is this segment of the market we wish to address.

FAQ






















































Sight MachinePowering Digital ManufacturingFAQHome / Resources / FAQHow Sight Machine Works:
Frequently Asked Questions
Does Sight Machine support multiple data sources?
Sight Machine is an open and agnostic data platform. It can support multiple data sources from across your infrastructure, including: PLC endpoints; inspection systems and quality equipment; Excel spreadsheets; data historian output; RDBMS, MES and ERP adapters, and MTConnect agents. The platform’s plugin architecture enables us to develop custom adapters to fit additional data sources/formats to ensure that all necessary information can be seamlessly collected.
How is data collected and consolidated into the Sight Machine platform?
Sight Machine’s data collection process includes three steps:

Data acquisition from multiple sources across the factory floor.
Data transformation into the API formats required.
Data upload to our management layer in an on-floor cluster or the cloud.

How is the data collection process managed – and will Sight Machine need to install any physical hardware on premise?
There are multiple data configuration options:

Data is collected and pushed to the cloud. This option is recommended when there are limited needs for real-time data access.
A central plant cluster communicates directly with machines, offering modest real-time data accessibility.
A data collection node is installed next to the edge devices for collection and pre-processing, offering a real-time look into the performance operations of facility machines.

What happens to data collection, processing, and access when Internet service is latent, faulty, or down?
When Internet service to a plant is interrupted, Sight Machine continues to collect and spool data. Once the connection is restored, the dashboards are updated. Any closed-loop or on-premise functionality will continue to function, even without cloud connectivity.
How quickly can data be collected and consolidated into digestible information for facility managers to review?
Sight Machine is configured to handle data as fast as you need it. The platform was developed to provide real-time feedback, so operations managers can identify and resolve any inefficiencies across the floor as soon as they occur. With add-on functionality processed at the edge with sub-second response times and KPIs aggregated in micro-batches of 30 seconds, information can be consolidated and ready for analysis quickly.
Does Sight Machine deliver supply-chain-wide visibility?
Yes. Because Sight Machine supports multiple, geographically dispersed data sources from across your infrastructure, you’re not limited to single-plant views and can uncover and deliver insights from across the entire supply chain.
Can we manage all of our data locally, or do we need to use the cloud?
We understand that securing private information is a priority for most facilities. Sight Machine offers customers the option to configure their platform to run in a private cloud. Additionally, Sight Machine offers and maintains a provisioned virtual private cloud in order to provide added security.
Can we export data from Sight Machine back into another format or system?
Sight Machine doesn’t just collect data from a variety of data sources, the platform can also push back high-level data into a variety of standard formats and systems, including SQL databases, data lakes, CSV files, and MES/ERP.
What types of KPIs do you support?
Sight Machine offers a variety of KPIs, including uptime, OEE, performance, quality, top defect types, top downtime reasons, average cycle time, etc.
What insight does Sight Machine provide that I don’t already have access to today?
By sorting through and making sense of previously unviewed data, Sight Machine helps you gain a faster, more accurate view of root cause analysis, statistical process control, anomaly detection, and other resource- and time-related issues.
Does Sight Machine provide alerts when specific criteria are met?
Yes. Sight Machine’s alert utility provides configuration tolerances for part measurements and machine data.
How does Sight Machine keep my data secure?
Sight Machine understands that security is a priority and data security is top of mind for us. We’ve taken many steps to ensure that all plant floor data collected remains private, including:

All endpoints are on a secure VPN
All changes inside the Web interface are logged to create an audit trail
Password and authentication management can be made to comply with your IT policies to ensure consistency and avoid added work for your IT teams

What preparation is required before implementing Sight Machine?
Getting started with Sight Machine is straightforward and does not require a vast amount of time or human resources. We begin by working with you to:

Identify a potential list of specific projects
Gain an understanding of the data sources we’ll be working with – including machines, databases, and systems
Confirm the goals and specific information that stakeholders – executives, operations managers, and QA professionals – require

Who owns the data that is collected into the Sight Machine systems?
You own all the data. If, for any reason, you discontinue working with Sight Machine, you can export all of your data and Sight Machine will no longer have access to any of your company’s information.
Do we need to write custom software in order to work with Sight Machine?
No. Sight Machine requires no additional software development for a fully functioning solution. Unlike other IoT platforms, Sight Machine is an end-to-end solution that runs off of your existing systems and software.
What is the average project timeline, from start to finish?
Our goal is to get Sight Machine up and running so you can gain access to your plant floor as soon as possible. While project complexity can vary, our target for initial deployment is typically 60 days.
Does Sight Machine require factory downtime for setup?
No. Because Sight Machine lives downstream from control systems and MES platforms, integrations can typically be done without interruption to plant operations.
What resources are required to manage a project?
Client resources usually include a manufacturing point of contact and and IT point of contact. Their responsibilities are primarily during setup and would only be to facilitate troubleshooting. Sight Machine provides you with a relationship manager and an application engineer. While other Sight Machine resources may be used during deployment, once the system is up and running, these are your primary contact points for business and technical matters.
What is IT’s role in supporting Sight Machine after it’s deployed?
Sight Machine has a very low IT burden and post-deployment support is limited to maintaining network connectivity to the Scout and Sentinel appliances, and giving access to any new data sources that need integration.

Sight Machine is in the sweet spot, with a very robust solution to the central problem that manufacturers are experiencing today: how to make sense of all their data.




The Sight Machine platform is being used in a variety of industries to take data about manufacturing processes, machines and parts, and model entire operations as digital twins.




For one client deploying a new robotic manufacturing line, Sight Machine was able to reduce downtime by 50% and increase performance by 25% within one month...




The ability to draw correlations between the process and a
				machine's health starts giving us insights we never had before.




The problem is not so much generating data, but integrating and making sense of it in a way that’s useful to manufacturers.
