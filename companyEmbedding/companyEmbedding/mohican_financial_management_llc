The management team, dedicated to convertible securities portfolios, began with three experienced individuals, now comprises five professionals, and has had no attrition.

The fund is 100% dedicated to convertible arbitrage with a portfolio management team that combines thirty-five years of experience in trading US convertible securities. We employ a versatile strategy that includes in-the-money/synthetic put trades, at/near-the-money trades, and cash-flow-oriented mandatory trades. We focus on the small and mid cap space of the convertibles market. We emphasize convertible coupon bonds (always more than 50% of the portfolio, usually more than 80%) to maintain positive carry and yield. We continually assess portfolio mix to optimise risk/reward, and use options-based models to invest in under-priced securities. Profits are generated from identifying undervalued securities, positive carry, credit improvement, delta/volatility trading and relative premium expansion.







 
Eric Hage 

						Portfolio Manager, Principal 



Eric was Director of Convertible Arbitrage Accounts at Salomon Smith Barney, where from 1999 to 2002 he was responsible for major client accounts. From 1994 to 1999 as Institutional Trader, Convertible Securities, he made markets in all types of US convertible securities (coupon, zeros, preferreds, mandatories). As first Managing Director and then Co-Head of Sales, Convertible Securities at Bear Stearns from 1991 to 1994, he managed large institutional investor accounts and collaborated with the Equity Syndicate Department in pricing new convertible issues. At Smith Barney from 1989 to 1991 he was Assistant Trader, Convertible Securities engaged in market making and convertible arbitrage with institutional traders, after completing the Institutional Sales and Trading Training Program covering all fixed income and equity products. From 1986 to 1988 as a Trader at Continental Grain, he bought and sold cash grain commodities in Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana and hedged positions with grain futures. 

Education 
 Mr. Hage was awarded an MBA in Finance & International Economics in 1989 by Columbia Business School and a BS in Agricultural Economics in 1986 by Cornell University, where he was President of Phi Delta Theta.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60)

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.

Highlights
 
Unlock productivity and accelerate onboarding
 
Focused on a business user’s needs, the award-winning SAP Fiori 2.0 extends the personalized paradigm of the SAP Fiori user experience, enabling easier onboarding and greater productivity. The SAP Fiori launchpad is evolving into a “viewport,” a personalized landing page with ready access to individual notifications and profile information. 
 
From a single point of entry, each user can see his or her task list, key performance indicators, and access apps through tiles, links, or search. The SAP S/4HANA 1610 release has a single visual design across all applications making it easier for your workforce to transition between daily activities.   
 
Accelerate digital transformation
 
The SAP S/4HANA 1610 release includes new functional, usability, and integration enhancements which expand on existing innovations and allow customers to accelerate their digital transformation journeys with IT landscapes that are more simple and flexible.
 
Supply chains can perform better with increased agility—resulting in lower lead times, better customer service and higher profitability. Key innovations include SAP Extended Warehouse Management (EWM) and Production Planning and Detailed Schedule (PPDS) in the core, eliminating potentially complex integrations.
 
The 1610 release also includes the full scope of SAP S/4HANA Finance. Companies can now take complete advantage of new capabilities such as transfer pricing, parallel valuation, soft close, and prediction.
 
Additional innovations across lines of business include Integrated Quality Management, Embedded Software in Product Development, and Optimized Portfolio and Project Management among many others.
 
Leverage key industry functionality in the core
 
The new SAP S/4HANA 1610 release allows organizations to meet specific industry needs in the digital economy. For example, not only has Retail Merchandise Management been completely re-architected to take advantage of SAP HANA, it is now also available for customers in other industries who have retail operations.
 
Oil and Gas customers can take advantage of upstream and downstream functions that have been optimized for the SAP HANA platform as well as a real-time insight and the flexibility to better meet customer needs.
