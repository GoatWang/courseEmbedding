Our offering is being made on a self-underwritten and “best-efforts” basis: no
minimum number of shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed. The
offering price per share is $0.03. The following table sets forth the uses of
proceeds assuming the sale of 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%, respectively, of the
securities offered for sale by the Company. There is no assurance that we will
raise the full $90,000 as anticipated.

Unpredictable expenses       $         $   1,000 $   1,000 $   1,000

The above figures represent only estimated costs.  If necessary, Andriy
Berezhnyy, our president and director, has verbally agreed to loan the Company
funds to complete the registration process. Also, these loans would be necessary
if the proceeds from this offering will not be sufficient to implement our
business plan and maintain reporting status and quotation on the OTC Electronic
Bulletin Board when and if our common stocks become eligible for trading on the
Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. However, Mr. Berezhnyy has no obligation to
loan such funds to us and that there is no guarantee that he will loan such
funds to us. Mr. Berezhnyy will not be paid any compensation or anything from
the proceeds of this offering. There is no due date for the repayment of the
funds advanced by Mr. Berezhnyy. Mr. Berezhnyy will be repaid from revenues of
operations if and when we generate revenues to pay the obligation.


The level of competition in the horse breeding business is extremely high. We
need proceeds from this offering to enter this business. We also need knowledge,
riding and competition experience and broad connections to enter into the horse
breeding business. We will be in a market where we compete with many domestic
and international companies offering similar services. We will be in direct
competition with them. Many of these companies may have a greater, more
established customer base than us. We will likely lose business to such
companies. Also, many of these companies will be able to afford to offer young
horses with better characteristics than us which may also cause us to lose
business. We foresee to continue to face challenges from new market entrants. We
may be unable to continue to compete effectively with these existing or new
competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition and results of operations.

Albero, Corp. has not yet entered the market and has no market penetration to
date. Once we have entered the market, we will be one of many participants in
the horse breeding business. Many established, yet well financed entities are
currently active in the horse industry. Nearly all Albero, Corp.'s competitors
have significantly greater financial resources, technical expertise, and
managerial capabilities than Albero, Corp. We are, consequently, at a
competitive disadvantage in being able to provide such services and become a
successful company in the equine industry. Therefore, Albero, Corp. may not be
able to establish itself within the industry at all.


Company Description
We plan to commence operations in the horse breeding business. We are planning
to purchase brood mares that demonstrated good results at show jumping
competitions or triathlons, whose jumps on racecourses were no less than 1.2-1.3
meters. We will purchase brood mares with good breeding record that


 includes
famous world producers whose offspring already demonstrates good results in
large-scale competitions. The price for high category young brood mares starts
from $12,000 and can be much higher depending on their characteristics. We do
not intend to buy such high category young horses. We need funds from this
offering to buy our mares. If we have available funds, we plan to purchase up to
16 houses. We plan also to buy old mares, 20 years old and older. The price for
such horses starts from $2,500. As of today we have purchased one old mare for
$3,750. Its breeding record is seven foals for the last seven years. Its breed
is Irish Sport Horse and its age is 20 year old. As of today we have also leased
a pasture consisting of approximately 5 acres located at 20 Ballylummin Rd.,
Ahoghill  Ballymena,  Co. Antrim  BT42 2PH Northern Ireland.

For mating, we will use the world best studhorses that competed and compete in
large-scale world competitions and that already have offspring that already
competes and takes high places in international competitions. Further, the
company will handle stockbreeding – raising elite offspring for sport purposes.
We will purchase a semen and inoculate it into our brood mares.  For mating, we
will take our horses to breeding farms. We plan to lease grazing land where our
horses will live. We will keep foals until they are 6-7 months old and then sell
them by auction. The foals are sold for, at least, $5,000 or higher depending on
their breeding record, exterior data as well as their movement. The price can
reach 100 thousands and higher. The amount of time that we expect to elapse
between identification and purchase of a brood mare and sale of a viable foal is
1.5-2 years.

Mr. Berezhnyy is undertaking the day to day care of the company’s horse. The
horse grazes every day on the leased filed and doesn’t need special care. The
natural diet of the horse is grass. In addition to the grass, Mr. Berezhnyy
provides horse feeds. One bag of horse feed costs about $8. From December to
March, our horse needs haylage. During this period, Mr. Berezhnyy, give one big
bale of haylage every three weeks. Big bale of haylage costs approximately $30.
Also, Mr. Berezhnyy gives necessary medicine to the horse every three months
which costs approximately $12. In addition, he cleans the hoofs every three
months. There is no any arrangements have been made to care for the animal when
Mr. Berezhnyy is absent. Veterinarian services is needed in the case of illness
only. The costs of veterinarian services is highly unpredictable. We believe it
will cost no more than $50 per horse per year, however, no assurance can be
given that our horses will not get severe illness or will be seriously injured
which require considerable veterinarian services.

Bitspark CEO, George Harrap, said:
I think this signals the start of a working relationship that we can build on over time for new products and markets to meet the needs of our customers with our industry leading services in the financial space.
A Key Money Transfer Market
Malaysia is an integral market for money transfers, often involving high volumes of shipments to neighboring Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, and other nations throughout the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The ASEAN market represents more than $2 billion USD and is growing 6 percent annually.
Malaysia in 2015 was the first ASEAN country to issue a regulatory framework for equity crowdfunding, followed by marketplace lending, and Indonesia is issuing new credit bureau licenses to improve centralized credit data collection and availability, according to Techcrunch.
Malaysia is also a destination for Indonesian migrants, CCN reported. It is also home to some bitcoin mining datacenters.
Vitaxel: A Direct Sales Company
Ryan Leong, CEO of Vitaxel, said his direct sales company has grown to serve close to 5,000 distributors in 16 Asian nations in less than a year and a half.
He said:
Our customers and members of the public will very soon enjoy faster money transfer with greater cost savings. We are committed to provide the most effective technology to deliver the best value to our current and future customers.
Bitspark launched from the Hong Kong Cyberport organization to pioneer a cash-in-cash-out blockchain remittance platform for money transfer operators.

Bitspark Fostered By Cyberport
Cyberport is an organization that supports innovative companies and is backed by the Hong Kong government. An alumnus of the Accenture fintech accelerator program, Cyberport works with small and large multi-national organizations in developing blockchain-based solutions for financial and other applications.
Vitaxel Group Limited is quoted on the OTCQB, USA as “VXEL” and has two subsidiaries, Vitaxel SDN BHD (Vitaxel) and Vitaxel Online Mall SDN BHD (Vionmall).
Vitaxel is mainly engaged in the direct selling industry utilizing a multi-level marketing model with an emphasis on entertainment, travel and lifestyle products and services. Vionmall develops and operates online shopping platforms for distributors, the public, and third-party product and service providers. It has approximately nearly 5,000 dealers in 16 Asian nations.
