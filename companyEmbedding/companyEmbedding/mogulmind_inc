You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.

The Ultimate Game of Success. Click on each square for more information.


















Let’s Talk Strategy 
Are ready to quit your day job and would like to take your idea to the next level? 

Remember that you are the master of your own universe. 
With that statement, becoming a Mogul Minded Inc. 
member might be just the right path for you.
 





    
    Entrepreneurs have several things they need to be successful. A brilliant business idea. Money or investors. A solid marketing plan. A smart team to help you start up. But there's at least one thing that a true entrepreneur needs above all others: confidence.
 
It takes someone who is courageous and determined to be able to bring a new product or service to market, especially one that people haven't seen before. A person needs to be bold and ballsy to lead a team, communicate a vision and grow a company.
 
While no one is immune to bouts of insecurity, entrepreneurs who want to be successful need to be confident in who they are and what they're doing -- and be able to instill that same spirit in the people who will help them achieve that success.
 
Assess yourself. Realize what you're awesome at and what you're not. Be confident about the skills and capabilities you possess and focus on those. Hire people to handle the rest.




    

Entrepreneurs are a curious bunch. They come in all shapes, sizes, genders and backgrounds. They get up at dawn. They're the first ones to the office and the last ones to leave. They use productivity apps, network their tooshes off and leave no stone unturned when it comes to pretty much everything.

 At best, they make the rest of us humans wonder if it's worth getting up in the morning. At worst, well, ditto. As superwoman/entrepreneur Ingrid Vanderveldt (Dell's entrepreneur-in-residence, media personality and investor) puts it: "Entrepreneurs are barrier breakers whose optimistic view of the world combined with their creative thinking has the ability to address even the toughest of challenges, including the government's approach to innovation." 

Sound crazy? Well, that's the point. Beyond what entrepreneurs actually do, exists a mindset that has them believing even something as morose and archaic as the government is redeemable vis-à-vis entrepreneurship.
