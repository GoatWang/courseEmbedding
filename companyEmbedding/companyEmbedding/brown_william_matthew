Top record matches for William Matthew Brown






Surname meaning for "Brown"
English, Scottish, and Irish: generally a nickname referring to the
color of the hair or complexion, Middle English br(o)un, from
Old English brun or Old French brun. This word is
occasionally found in Old English and Old Norse as a personal name or
byname. Brun- was also a Germanic name-forming element. Some
instances of Old English Brun as a personal name may
therefore be short forms of compound names such as Brungar,
Brunwine, etc. As a Scottish and Irish name, it sometimes
represents a translation of Gaelic Donn. As an American family
name, it has absorbed numerous surnames from other languages with the
same meaning.

Surname meaning for "Brown"
English, Scottish, and Irish: generally a nickname referring to the
color of the hair or complexion, Middle English br(o)un, from
Old English brun or Old French brun. This word is
occasionally found in Old English and Old Norse as a personal name or
byname. Brun- was also a Germanic name-forming element. Some
instances of Old English Brun as a personal name may
therefore be short forms of compound names such as Brungar,
Brunwine, etc. As a Scottish and Irish name, it sometimes
represents a translation of Gaelic Donn. As an American family
name, it has absorbed numerous surnames from other languages with the
same meaning.

Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in California:













Does Brown William carry a valid contracting license?



In California, any remodeling or construction project that exceeds $500 (labor and materials), requires a contractor to have an active license with the California Contractor State License Board (CSLB).
Brown William currently holds license 789975, 310206 (Electrical, General Building Contractor, Plumbing), which was Active when we last checked.











How important is contractor licensing in California?



The CSLB is one of the highest rated licensing boards in the US. Applicants are required to pass a written board exam and prove at least four years of prior, relevant work experience. In addition, the CSLB requires all license holders to maintain at least $2,500 in operating capital and provides you with a range of other consumer protections.











Your liability risk when hiring Brown William



Contractors in California are required to carry workers' compensation insurance if they have employees and proof of liability insurance with the cumulative limit of $1 million for licensees with five or fewer persons, and an additional 100,000 for each additional member over five, not to exceed $5 million total.











Financial recourse when hiring Brown William



All licensed contractors in California are required to maintain a bond, which provides you with financial recourse in case they perform defective work or violate license regulations. If you feel as though you have been taken advantage of, you should leave feedback on the contractor's BuildZoom profile and file a complaint with the CSLB.
Brown William has a $12,500 bond with Wesco Insurance Company. 











What else should I know before hiring Brown William



California contractors are required to submit their fingerprints to the board, which are then checked against criminal records held by the California Department of Justice (DOJ) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) prior to obtaining a valid contracting license.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The California State License Board recommends getting at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
