About Platinum Golf Membership
Platinum Golf Membership is a golf rewards program managed by East Coast Golf Management (ECGM).

The mission with the Platinum Golf Membership is to  put fun and affordability into everyday golf, while giving participating golfers the opportunity to enjoy golf club membership benefits at multiple courses.
Platinum News and Alerts
Platinum members receive a regular Newsletter and Daily Alerts about Pro Platinum (Pro-Am) tournaments, scrambles, and other member opportunities at participating golf courses and restaurants. Beginning in Myrtle Beach, SC, ECGM and the Platinum Golf membership have now expanded to Wilmington, NC and Fayetteville, NC with new courses coming online annually. A growing base of participating courses increases play flexibility and member benefits. This membership rivals all competitors in variety and affordability and is getting better with each passing month.
Local Residency in North or South Carolina Not Required
Unlike other membership programs, The Platinum Golf Membership is available to everyone. Members do not have to be residents of North or South Carolina to qualify. Because of the program’s unique pricing and offsetting benefits, traveling golfers can justify owning a Platinum Golf Membership. Participating courses and restaurants can be found here.

Platinum Golf Membership extends from January through December each year. Member benefits may change from year to year but normally include deeply discounted rounds at a growing number of courses, free rounds with frequent play, and gift cards*.

Member Courses
The group of participating courses in the Platinum Golf Membership program has grown each year and now includes courses in North and South Carolina with plans for further expansion on the horizon.
