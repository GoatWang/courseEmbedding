Human Capital Management	









 New Information – 8.9 Product Upgrade 


 On September 26, 2006 the Lucas County Board of Commissioners awarded CherryRoad Technologies the contract to upgrade the County’s HR Enterprise System (PeopleSoft) from version 8.3 SP1 to 8.9 MP1. The current modules that were upgraded include Human Resources, Benefits Administration, Payroll, and Time and Labor. The upgrade commenced on October 23, 2006 and went live on April 22, 2007. The project was completed on time and under budget. The identified goals that were established at the beginning of the upgrade project were also achieved. Special thanks go out to all of the upgrade team members from Lucas County and CherryRoad Technologies for a job well done! 

            The County is currently in the process of implementing PeopleSoft Financials version 8.9. As of June of 2007, the County went live with the GL interface module. As of August of 2007, the County started the implementation of Accounts Payable and Purchasing.





 History - Lucas County ERP 


 The planning for the implementation of an ERP system and the Change Management initiative started in the fall of 2001. The PeopleSoft HRMS implementation started in May of 2002 and was successfully completed in April 2003. The successful go-live was attributed to all of the hard work and dedication of countless Lucas County employees. The County spent the next four years fine-tuning and refining business processes, leave plans, and time administration processes.

            Lucas County is located in Northwest Ohio with a population of approximately 450,000 with the city of Toledo as the County seat. Lucas County government is comprised of 47 separate agencies with 29 bargaining units and employs approximately 4,400 employees.

            Additional documentation regarding the HRMS implementation from 2002 and 2003 has been provided below. The information includes general project facts, specific findings, recommendations, and plans used for the implementation of the PeopleSoft HRMS.
