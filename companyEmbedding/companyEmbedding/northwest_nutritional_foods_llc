We all have a pretty good idea of what wouldn’t qualify as the most nutritious foods in the world—for many of us, they’re our favorite things to eat: burgers, spaghetti, tacos, chocolate, potato chips. However, eating these foods every day could leave you overweight and low on energy.
A balanced diet with a wide variety of foods from every food group is always recommended. But these foods have the potential to be the best types of foods in the world when it comes to nutrition, and some of the results may surprise you…
1. Kale
By this point in time, it’s probably no surprise that kale is one of the world’s healthiest foods. That’s because it’s been the focus of health experts for a few years now, with those same experts recommending that we eat as much kale as possible. But why is that so important? Well, aside from being low on calories and free on fat, kale is loaded with vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and natural fiber. 
Put simply, kale keeps you going and helps you feel better than many other foods. If you’re worried about the taste of kale, which can be slightly bitter, try adding it to stews and sauces. Chances are you’ll never notice it’s there, even as it goes about having a significant impact on how you feel.

You can’t help but notice the biting, shooting pain that comes with sciatica. This condition affects the sciatic nerve that runs across the buttock and down the back of the legs (the entire length of the hamstrings to the toes).
When sciatic nerve pain acts up, the nerve itself becomes inflamed due to an injury—for instance, a slipped disc, pinched nerve, pressure due to pregnancy, or poor posture. Sciatica can be very debilitating, however, there are a few tricks that can help soothe sciatic nerve pain and decrease inflammation.
Here are ten tips for relieving sciatica…
1. Massage
Massaging the muscles of the buttocks and backs of the legs (where the sciatic nerve runs) can loosen muscle tension and decrease painful nerve inflammation. How? Massage promotes blood circulation which will ease sciatic nerve tenderness and built up tension.

We’re all forgetful at times, regardless of our age and mental health. However, as we age, our risk of dementia increases, and by the age of 85 almost 35-percent of those in your age group with be afflicted with this degenerative disorder that causes gradually and worsening memory loss and mental skills.
If a loved shows the following ten early warning signs of dementia, book an appointment to see a doctor immediately…
1. Memory Loss
Mild cognitive impairment (or as doctors refer to it, MCI) explains memory loss that is more pronounced than typical age-related forgetfulness.  MCI will cause an inability to recall short term memory (or recent events) such as what you did yesterday or last week. However, suddenly a strong ability to remember specific from the past will occur.
A study from Rutgers University, estimates that roughly 4-percent of Americans between the ages of 65 and 74-years old have Alzheimer’s Disease, with the percentage raising steady as we grow. The same research estimates that roughly 50-percent of all Americans over 85-years of age suffer with Alzheimer’s Disease and that more than half of all dementia cases are misdiagnosed and actually Alzheimer’s Disease.

Gallbladder attacks are downright scary! Often mistaken for a heart attack, when the gallbladder is unhealthy, this small digestive organ is unable to properly aid the digestive process (by storing liver bile and excreting it into the small intestine to for food digestion). As a result, gallstones can form and block bile ducts, bile can back up in the gallbladder and cause painful inflammation, or the gallbladder can become infected with a condition known as Cholecystitis.
A gallbladder attack can come on suddenly and last anywhere between a few minutes to a few hours, requiring hospitalization. That’s why staying calm and recognizing the signs can be important to your health and ability to sustain an attack.
1. Belly Pain
The gallbladder is a little sac, or storage compartment, for bile, which is produced by the liver. The gallbladder emits bile into the small intestines via a duct referred to as the cystic duct. The entire process is meant to break down foods (namely fatty foods). You wouldn’t normally pay too much attention to your gallbladder, unless bile flow slows or becomes blocked, which can be very painful.
One of the most common and evident symptoms of gallstones is pain that begins in the upper right portion of the stomach, under the ribs. This belly pain will radiate outwards, moving gradually to the center of the belly or upper back. Gallstone attacks accompanied by pain of this nature usually last 15 minutes, but many patients report continuing or lingering pain can go on for hours and even rouse you from sleep.
