LITTLE red flags jut out from the shelves at a CVS drugstore in suburban Boston, alerting shoppers to shortages of nearly a dozen Johnson & Johnson products. Among them are Motrin, Rolaids, children’s Tylenol liquid and adult Tylenol, Mylanta, Pepcid AC and even some Neutrogena skin care products.“Looking for Tylenol pain relief products?” asks one of the signs. The notices at CVS serve as a stark reproof to Johnson & Johnson, whose brands have for more than a century been synonymous with quality. Some of its products are in short supply at drugstores and supermarkets because the McNeil Consumer Healthcare unit of J.& J. last year recalled about 288 million items, including about 136 million bottles of liquid Tylenol, Motrin, Zyrtec and Benadryl for infants and children.Johnson & Johnson has had to recall such a variety of products because of quality-control problems across product lines, in multiple factories and in several units last year. Some of its consumer products, for instance, may have contained bits of metal. Others came in bottles with a moldy smell. And some products have gone missing from stores with hardly an explanation. All of this has put the company and its manufacturing under the intense scrutiny of lawmakers and officials at the Food and Drug Administration.“It looks like a plane spinning out of control,” says David Vinjamuri, a former J.& J. marketing employee who now trains brand managers at his company, ThirdWay Brand Trainers.

While the drugstore signs that helpfully suggest “Try CVS/pharmacy brand” are intended to assist frustrated shoppers in identifying alternatives to missing brand-name products, they also serve as constant reminders of another of J.& J.’s continuing problems: It must persuade millions of disappointed customers to once again pay a premium for products that may no longer seem to be of any higher quality than the less expensive store brand.

“I don’t even consider buying them any more,” says Thien-Kim Lam, a mother of two and a blogger in Silver Spring, Md. In a post last spring titled “Makers of Tylenol, I’m Disappointed in You” on the blog DC Metro Moms, Ms. Lam wrote about the huge recall of J.& J. infants’ and children’s medicines.Now, she says, the frequent recalls have prompted her to switch to generic cold and cough medicines for her children. “It’s like a breakup,” she says. “I’m done. I’ve moved on.”Bonnie Jacobs, a McNeil spokeswoman, says the company is committed to restoring McNeil’s reputation as a world-class manufacturer of over-the-counter medicines. “We will invest the necessary resources and make whatever changes are needed to do so, and we will take the time to do it right,” she wrote in an e-mail last Thursday.If Queen Elizabeth II had been the chief executive of Johnson & Johnson, she might have called 2010 an “annus horribilis.”J.& J.’s troubles with some of its consumer products began in earnest last January, when McNeil recalled millions of pill bottles after some consumers complained that they smelled like mold. By December, when it recalled 13 million packages of Rolaids soft chews that may have been contaminated with metal or wood particles, the company had closed one plant in Fort Washington, Pa., for an overhaul and had yet to solve the quality problems at another, in Puerto Rico.The response of J.& J.’s chief executive, William C. Weldon, has been to allocate more than $100 million to upgrade McNeil’s plants and equipment, appoint new manufacturing executives, hire a third-party consulting firm to improve procedures and systems at McNeil and shore up quality control companywide. In Congressional testimony last fall, he promised that when the Pennsylvania plant reopened, it would “represent the state of the art in medicine production.” And he has repeatedly tried to reassure consumers, as he did when he promised that J.& J. had “no higher concern than providing parents with the highest-quality products for their children.”Those reassurances, however, have been followed by yet more recalls. What is most perplexing is the seeming inability of executives to solve — and satisfactorily explain — the manufacturing issues that dog the company. Federal regulators have continued to fault the McNeil unit for failing to identify and address systemic problems at its plants, and consumers remain mystified about why simple products like O.B. tampons can disappear from drugstore shelves.

In July, McNeil submitted a plan to the F.D.A. detailing how it intends to overhaul its operations. To comply with regulatory standards, McNeil is undertaking thorough manufacturing and quality-control reviews for all its products, Ms. Jacobs says.That means the recalls may continue. Last Thursday, Ms. Jacobs said the company would “take whatever steps are needed to ensure our products meet quality standards, including further recalls if warranted.”Only a day later, McNeil recalled 47 million units of Sudafed, Sinutab, Benadryl and other drugs from wholesalers because of issues like inadequate equipment cleaning practices. The company said that the recalls were not a result of health problems and that consumers could continue to use the products.JOHNSON & JOHNSON, with about $62 billion in sales in 2009, makes thousands of different kinds of products, including Band-Aids, baby shampoo, cardiac stents and advanced drug treatments for rheumatoid arthritis. It solidified a reputation for product quality with a company credo, dating from 1943, saying that the company owed its first responsibility to the mothers and fathers, doctors, nurses and patients who use its products.With such a diversity of products and operating companies, Johnson & Johnson’s overall business has not suffered significantly. But the string of recent recalls at McNeil threatens to weaken the kind of trust that made many people willing to pay more for J.& J. brands.“Nothing is more valuable to Johnson & Johnson than the brand bond of trust with consumers,” says Erik Gordon, a professor at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan. “But this is almost like, ‘If it’s an even-numbered day, it’s time for another quality problem at Johnson & Johnson.’ ”And, as the signs in CVS indicate, competitors — whether drugstore brands or other household names like Advil from Pfizer or Triaminic from Novartis — have muscled into the shelf space vacated while J.& J. puts its plants in order. In the year ended on Dec. 26, for example, sales of children’s liquid Tylenol and Motrin decreased 60 percent or more while drugstore brands have gained 93 percent, according to the SymphonyIRI Group, a market research firm that tracks mass-market sales excluding those at Wal-Mart.

Mark Mandel, a father in Chicago, says his family previously bought infants’ Tylenol and Motrin drops on the assumption that the branded products were of better quality than generics. But to regain his business now, Mr. Mandel says, J.& J. would have to demonstrate that it had better manufacturing standards.

“There were reasons we weren’t buying generics before,” says Mr. Mandel, a microbiologist at the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern. “But they are lower than the concerns we have about Johnson & Johnson right now.”YouGov BrandIndex, a market research firm that tracks consumer attitudes, says it has noticed a steady, albeit not steep, erosion over the last 18 months in how consumers perceive not just drug brands like Tylenol but also J.& J. While many consumers are still loyal, says Ted Marzilli, a senior executive at the firm, the company needs to avoid death by a thousand cuts.“They’ve really got to stop the bleeding,” Mr. Marzilli says. “What the company really needs to do is not have any more recalls for six months, nine months, 12 months.”Ms. Jacobs says the company intends to “build back our brands by producing the reliable, high-quality products that consumers expect of us and we expect of ourselves.”Consumers have typically been willing to forgive a brand for one incident or product problem, industry analysts say, if a company acts swiftly to rectify the situation and to issue an apology — as J.& J. did in 1982 when seven people died in the Chicago area after a tampering incident in which Tylenol was laced with cyanide.The most recent recalls of Tylenol and other products have been more of an inconvenience to consumers than a serious health risk. Federal officials have said there was no evidence that deficiencies in the recalled products caused severe illness or death.But the number and variety of problems have stirred concern among government officials and consumers that the McNeil unit has suffered from a systemic breakdown of its manufacturing procedures. Last May, the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform opened an investigation into the recalls.Questions are still swirling around another event, described by some House committee members as a “phantom recall,” in 2009 — in which McNeil hired outside contractors to quietly buy back certain defective Motrin products from store shelves. The products did not dissolve properly, a problem that could cause the pills to work less effectively.

Last week, the state of Oregon filed a lawsuit accusing Johnson & Johnson and McNeil of misrepresenting the quality and efficacy of those products.“They did not want the negative publicity that would come with admitting they had a defective product, the negative publicity that comes with any recall,” John Kroger, Oregon’s attorney general, said.Ms. Jacobs of McNeil said the unit’s actions “were consistent with applicable law, and there was no health or safety risk to consumers associated with this limited recall.”

The company disputed the allegations, she said, and would seek to have the lawsuit dismissed.But Mr. Weldon, while saying that he believed McNeil had acted with good intentions, has emphasized that in retrospect, the company should have handled things differently.“This episode was not a model for how I would like to see Johnson & Johnson companies approach problems with defective products when they arise,” he said during Congressional testimony last September.NOTHING better illustrates Johnson & Johnson’s difficulties in remedying McNeil’s woes — and the longstanding frustration of federal regulators — than the events at the company’s plant in Las Piedras, Puerto Rico. Consumers started complaining as early as April 2008 about moldy-smelling Tylenol arthritis caplets that they said nauseated them or gave them stomach problems.McNeil did not alert the F.D.A. until September 2009 and then didn’t start a substantial recall until December 2009 — during an F.D.A. inspection of the plant, according to F.D.A. documents.In January 2010, the agency sent a warning letter to Peter Luther, the president of McNeil, complaining that the company’s initial investigation “was unjustifiably delayed and terminated prematurely.” It said that even though consumers had also complained about a moldy smell in Rolaids and Extra-Strength Tylenol, the company had not widened its investigation to include those products.Only after the F.D.A. inspection did McNeil executives recall millions of bottles of Tylenol, Motrin, Benadryl and other pills. The company identified an unusual source for the moldy odor: chemical contamination from a byproduct of a pesticide used to treat wooden pallets. It has since stopped using the pallets.

The F.D.A. says the company should have acted faster. “When something smells bad literally or figuratively, companies must aggressively investigate and take all necessary actions to solve the problem,” said Deborah M. Autor, director of the office of compliance at the F.D.A. Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, during a press conference last year.But Johnson & Johnson executives say that identifying the root cause of the problem was a difficult and lengthy process. Indeed, F.D.A. documents indicated that the consumer complaints subsided for a time in 2008 — leading the company to conclude the issue had gone away — only to resume months later.

In a letter to the agency last February, Mr. Luther, the McNeil president, explained that the odor issue was an extremely unusual problem. The investigation, he wrote, had been challenging because there were very few research labs able to test for the chemical later identified as the cause of the smell. McNeil, he assured the F.D.A., was making changes in the ways that it handled consumer complaints, conducted investigations and notified the agency.Last October, McNeil recalled yet another lot of Tylenol because consumers again complained of an odor, and the next month in an inspection report, the F.D.A. cited additional lapses at the Puerto Rico plant.McNeil says that it has been working diligently to ensure that its manufacturing operations meet F.D.A. standards and that it plans to address the agency’s most recent concerns.J.& J.’s troubles have not been limited to its over-the-counter products, which could suggest that the company may suffer from even broader problems. Last year, its DePuy medical device unit recalled two kinds of hip implants, affecting tens of thousands of patients worldwide. Its vision care unit recalled millions of soft contact lenses sold abroad.A shareholder lawsuit filed last month against Johnson & Johnson’s directors, meanwhile, catalogs a long list of “federal and state regulatory investigations, subpoenas and requests for documents, F.D.A. warning letters, news articles and the recall of products accounting for hundreds of millions of dollars of corporate losses.”Ms. Jacobs says the company intends to defend itself in court.THE manufacturing problems over the last year have clearly cost J.& J. In the third quarter, overall consumer sales in the United States fell 25 percent, to $1.3 billion from $1.7 billion for the same period in 2009, but sales of over-the-counter medicines and nutritional products declined about 40 percent, to $438 million, the company said. The company plans to report fourth-quarter results later this month.

While the company is estimating that the total hit to sales in 2010 from problems at the Pennsylvania plant is likely to be around $600 million, it has begun reintroducing only a few of the products that were once available. Executives say they hope to get more of the missing medicines back on the shelves by the middle of this year and to reopen the plant by year-end.Although some in the industry are optimistic that the company can quickly regain its perch, some Wall Street analysts are not convinced. This month, Goldman Sachs lowered its 2011 earnings estimates for the company, partly because of the time it might require to bring the closed plant up to the F.D.A.’s standards.“We believe recovery could be slower than expected,” Jami Rubin, a Goldman analyst, warned investors, noting that generic alternatives may now be entrenched with consumers.Nor has the company improved its communication with the public. Last year, drugstores across the country started running out of O.B. tampons, a product made by McNeil-P.P.C., another company unit.The product shortage — and limited information provided by the company about the reasons behind the supply problem — caused even louder howls of frustration among some women than the children’s medicine recall.“It was like a brick wall,” says Susan Pickin, a mother of a 5-year-old daughter in Manhattan, describing her phone conversation with a McNeil customer service representative. The conversation, Ms. Pickin says, left her wondering whether the company had permanently retired the tampons because of a safety issue or whether the items might soon reappear in stores.Ms. Jacobs, the McNeil spokeswoman, says the company discontinued the most absorbent of the products, called “Ultra,” last year, but that there had been no unusual reports of health problems. The company has begun shipping other O.B. products, now available in some stores.Ms. Jacobs declined to explain the nature of the supply disruptions that caused the shortage.THE variety, magnitude and duration of the manufacturing and quality problems perplex some industry watchers.

“This is really unusual to have this gross systemic failure,” says Donald Riker, the editor of OTC Product News, an industry newsletter on over-the-counter drugs.The reasons for McNeil’s woes remain unclear. Some critics, including former employees, say Johnson & Johnson has lost sight of its credo, while others suggest that the company decentralized its oversight of manufacturing and quality control in error.Others say it was simply a matter of cost-cutting. The December lawsuit, for example, cited two unnamed former employees who contended that the company failed to address the manufacturing problems at McNeil because it was trying to save money.Other former employees who are not involved in the lawsuit say that J.& J. seemed to hesitate in recent years to invest in new manufacturing equipment.“It takes a lot of money to buy equipment and maintain quality,” says Patrick Bols, who left Johnson & Johnson’s pharmaceutical division in the late 1990s and owns stock in the company.McNeil declined to comment on what specifically led to its manufacturing troubles. But Ms. Jacobs said the company was taking steps to address all the factors that could have contributed. Since last summer, the company has met the monthly goals it set in its overhaul plan submitted to the F.D.A. And Johnson & Johnson has since revamped and centralized its quality-control operations, naming a longtime executive to oversee a new system of quality control across the corporation and to report directly to Mr. Weldon.Even some critics say Johnson & Johnson seems to be taking steps to remedy its problems. “It takes a while,” Mr. Bols says, “to get it right again.”

June 05, 2014
 JAN SINGER NAMED CEO OF SPANX
Atlanta, GA—June 5, 2014 – Spanx, Inc. today announced that Jan Singer has been named Chief Executive Officer of the company. Singer will report to Sara Blakely, the founder and owner of the company. Gregg Ribatt, the Interim CEO, will assist Singer through a transition, and then continue to serve on the company’s Board of Advisors. Singer is expected to join the company officially in early July.
Singer is a highly regarded and well-respected leader in the apparel and footwear industry. She joins Spanx from Nike, where she held various senior leadership roles including Corporate Vice President of Global Apparel and Corporate Vice President of Global Footwear. Prior to that, Singer served as the Vice President and General Manager of Reebok’s women’s business and played key marketing and global communications roles for Chanel, Calvin Klein, and Prada. Singer also previously served as the Beauty and Fitness editor for YM Magazine.
“Spanx is first and foremost an innovator and leader,” said Sara Blakely. “Jan’s role in helping to lead and innovate at premium, global brands across the apparel, footwear and beauty industries, combined with her deep understanding of the consumer, make her the perfect fit for Spanx. I’m confident that she will transition from the locker room to the fitting room seamlessly. I am grateful to Gregg Ribatt for his role in leading the company through this transition and setting us up for the next phase of growth.”
“Spanx is an incredible brand with unique and powerful consumer connections, and I’m excited to join such a dynamic company,” said Singer. “My background and experience position me to build on the great foundation created by Sara and her team, and I look forward to leading the organization on its continued path of success.”
ABOUT SPANX
Spanx founder Sara Blakely was getting ready for a party when she realized she didn't have the right undergarment to provide a blemish-free look under white pants. Armed with scissors and sheer genius, she cut the feet off her control top pantyhose and the Spanx revolution began! In addition to the first footless pantyhose, Spanx is responsible for countless other industry-changing inventions including the first-ever shaper short with no leg band, the revolutionary shaping camisole, control-top fishnet pantyhose and the first back-smoothing bra, the Bra-llelujah!
The Spanx brand now houses more than 200 products ranging from slimming apparel and swimsuits, to bras, activewear and men's undershirts. To help women everywhere experience the power of shapewear, Spanx launched ASSETS®, a focused range of body-shapers and ASSETS® Red Hot Label™ by SPANX®, a luxe extension of ASSETS that offers a wider assortment of slimmers, bras and panties. With an array of problem-solving products for every body type and budget, Spanx has secured its place in women’s hearts and in pop-culture with daily mentions everywhere from CNN to SNL.
In March of 2012, Sara was named the world’s youngest, self-made female billionaire by Forbes Magazine and one of TIME’s 100 Most Influential People. Headquartered in Atlanta, GA and opening retail shops across the United States, Spanx can now be found worldwide in more than 50 countries. In addition to keeping butts covered from Savannah to Singapore, SPANX also shapes the world by focusing on their mission: To make the world a better place…one butt at a time!

Product Unbundling in the Travel Industry: The Economics of Airline Bag Fees


								Journal of Economics & Management Strategy, Vol. 24, Issue 3, pp. 457-484, 2015
							

Number of pages: 28
Posted: 29 Jul 2015









Date Written: September 24, 2013

Abstract
This paper provides theory and evidence on airline bag fees, offering insights into a real-world case of product unbundling. The theory predicts that an airline’s fares should fall when it introduces a bag fee, but that the full trip price (the bag fee plus the new fare) could either rise or fall. The empirical evidence presented in the paper provides strong confirmation of this prediction. The data also suggest that the average fare falls by less than the bag fee itself, so that the full price of a trip rises for passengers who choose to check bags. 



Keywords: unbundling, airlines, bag fees

                Spanx CEO Jan Singer has left the company, according to a report in Women's Wear Daily.            

                Spanx            








 



The CEO of Atlanta-based Spanx has left the shapewear company after less than two years.
According to a report in Women’s Wear Daily, Spanx CEO Jan Singer has exited her role and Spanx founder Sara Blakely is returning to helm the company.

                            Spanx CEO Jan Singer has left the company, according to a report in Women's Wear Daily.                        
Spanx










 


Singer was a big-time Nike executive before coming to Spanx in summer 2014. She had replaced former CEO Laurie Ann Goldman, who stepped down in early 2014.
Singer held various senior leadership roles at Nike including corporate vice president of global apparel and corporate vice president of global footwear.





When Singer was hired, Blakely said in a statement: "Jan’s role in helping to lead and innovate at premium, global brands across the apparel, footwear and beauty industries, combined with her deep understanding of the consumer, make her the perfect fit for Spanx. I’m confident that she will transition from the locker room to the fitting room seamlessly."
When Singer came to Spanx, she focused broadening the appeal of the company beyond just shapewear, featuring other garments such as jeans and swimsuits. According to a 2015 report, she also reorganized 80 percent of top management with a series of hires.
Spanx did not immediately respond to an interview request about Singer's departure.

Amy Wenk covers hospitality, retail and restaurants.

Endless/Continuous Embroidery Hoop


Create endless borders and edgings! With a field size of 6.75” x 4”, you can add the perfect accent to dresses, tablecloths, quilts and more! Simply place the fabric and stabilizer on the Endless Embroidery Hoop and with one click you have hooped your fabric. When the hoop is filled with embroidery, one click releases the fabric and stabilizer. A jump stitch marks the matching point for perfect placement of the next embroidery. Slide the fabric and stabilizer forward, take one stitch for perfect placement, click the hoop in place and embroider.


Knee Lifter


The knee lifter allows for hands-free raising and lowering of the presser foot and is vital when appliquéing and embroidering.

HyperFont™ converts all TrueType fonts on your PC into embroidery. Advanced Editing allows you to edit existing embroidery designs

Four Design Transmission Methods


The design can be sent one color block at a time, the whole design can be sent at one time, the design can be sent in one color or the color sequence can be chosen during data transmission.


Trace Design


Trace the outline of the design in the hoop for accurate design positioning.

Move forward or backwards through a design

Sewing Features

 

Long Arm Design


Plenty of room for your biggest projects with 8.25 inches from the needle to the tower


Electronic Auto Pilot


Unplug the foot control, press the Start button and the machine sews. You are still in complete control over the speed - just slide the Speed Control Lever to the desired maximum speed.


6 StayBright™ LED Lights


With lights on each side of the needle area as well as one light over the large surface to the right of the needle, it is easier to see your work.


215 Built-in Sewing Stitches


10 Basic, 6 Stretch 192 Decorative and 7 Buttonholes. A large variety of stitches for fashion, home décor, quilting and heirloom sewing always ensures the perfect stitch for every project.


6 Fully Automatic 1-Step Buttonholes Plus 1 Endless Buttonhole


Buttonhole sewing is a one-step simple process, providing reliable results every time. One additional endless buttonhole lets you have complete customization. There are no size limitations—ideal when sewing nontraditional sized buttonholes.


Exclusive Buttonhole Underplate


Sandwiches fabric between a lower plate and the foot to ensure perfect buttonholes on multiple layers of fabric. Effectively, this is like a mini-embroidery hoop in which the machine feeds the attachment, rather than the fabric. It makes creating buttonholes possible in places that conventional buttonhole devices cannot easily reach.


Programmable Needle Up/Down


The needle can be programmed to stop in the highest up position when your foot is lifted from the controller, making it easier to remove fabric from the machine. The needle can also be programmed to stop in the down position which is ideal for pivoting, appliquéing and quilting.


Drop Feed


Perfect for free-motion embroidery, machine embroidery, monograms and attaching buttons without the need to attach a darning plate.


Extra-High Presser Foot Lifter


There are two heights to the presser foot lifter. The second height offers a 1/4” more clearance, which is needed when placing multiple layers or bulky fabrics under the presser foot.


Heavy Duty Metal Frame


This rigid support holds all the mechanisms in perfect alignment for skip-free sewing and overall durability.


Optimum Power Control


Provides precise power when sewing multiple layers or dense fabric


Automatic Tension


Stable stitch quality no matter the type of fabric used


Dual Accessory Tray


More room in the removable extension table for storing accessories.


LED Indicator Light


Green light indicates the machine is ready to start. Red light indicates the machine is operating. Flashing red light indicates a problem or error.


Speed Control Lever


Slide the lever on the front of the machine to set the sewing speed from slow to fast. When the foot pedal is used the lever functions as a top speed limiter.


13 Needle Positions


Needle position can be changed for individual projects, such as inserting zippers, cords and topstitching.


Included Standard Accessories


All-Purpose Foot, Zipper Foot, Satin Stitch Foot, Button Sewing Foot, Blind Hem Foot, Buttonhole Foot with Underplate, Embroidery Presser Foot, Needles, Bobbins (Class 15J), Auxiliary Spool Pin, Spool Pin Felt, Spool Pin Caps, Seam Ripper / Lint Brush, Screwdrivers, Thread Spool Nets, Vinyl Accessory Bag, Scissors, Embroidery Software CD with AutoPunch™, HyperFont™ and Advanced Editing, Embroidery Hoops, USB Cable

The Best Embroidery Machine EVER
Kathryn Barnhill | June 09, 2016

Pros:
Good Value, Great Features, Easy To Use, High Quality



I already had three embroidery machines- a Futura 150 and a Bernina 430 for my home. I had a Futura 250 for our vacation house. Our vacation house was broken into and the Futura 250 was stolen. I had already decided I like the Futura features better than the Bernina and was drooling over the Quintet but it was unlikely the spose would agree to a 4th Embroidery machine. The break in gave me the excuse I needed so I bought a Quintet. I am absolutely thrilled with the whole machine not just the embroidery: the features are fantastic the auto thread cutter, the endless hoop and on and on. It could have been a steep learning curve but all embroidery machines are. I could not be more thrilled. Thank you robbers!

Quintet

Pros:
When Operating Correctly It Works Well


Cons: 
Too Much Time Is Taken To Setup To Get It To Work Correctly



I received my Futura Quintet as a gift. I am not a new to embroidery machines.  My husband purchased it based on a friends recommendations and the demonstration saw on HSN.  As it was a gift when I had trouble with the first one I returned it and requested a replacement.  Although it works well, it is way more difficult to set up and embroider that my past brand.  I find it to be extremely noisy. the tangles under the throat plate continue to plague me even with the replacement (proper bobbins, needles, thread do not make a difference ).  If I had purchased it myself I would get rid of it and go back to my old brand, just a newer model.  Love my husband so am very pleased that he attempted the purchase without me.

Not for a Beginner

Pros:
Good Value


Cons: 
Poor Quality, Complicated



I got my machine on line for an amazing deal and am new to embroidery. When it does work it is amazing but there is a STEEP learning curve. I have had many problems with it including tension and sensor readings for the hoop. I have had to take it to the shop to get fixed three times in the first month and now waiting for a part on back order. Great price but too many problems.

Pros:
Great Features



I love this machine some days--and other days I am so frustrated. Sometimes it embroideries beautiful and some days it  messes up. If  I  don't run it on low speed it jams up, and breaks needles like you won't believe. It gets birds nest  no-matter what you do. I have ruined six different projects I was doing for Christmas gifts this year. Now I'm out quite a few dollars I  needed . Sometimes I am almost afraid to try  another project. I f  I could afford I t   I'd look into another machine. And yet it has a lot  of good features I like.  And for some reason the thread  keeps getting caught between the top and the needle which puts stress on the needle and it breaks. Three more needles again today. Which is getting expensive. But when it is working good it does a subperb job.

Pros:
Good Value, Great Features


Cons: 
Poor Quality, Complicated



I've picked this one up via hsn.com during a Today's Special & thought it would be easy to work with.   Well..it's not easy nor is it fun either.  Someone else mentioned the bird's nest under the work and THAT'S what this thing does.  I became so frustrated with this newer model that I went-out & purchased Singer's older XL6000 model (which embroiders like butter)...the only downside with this model is it's so old...the software conversion is even outdated and no longer supported.   I'm very tempted in selling this Quintet as it's way too late for me to return to hsn.com.  Maybe I'll use it as another back-up sewing machine without the embroidery component.

I do a lot of household sewing.  Altering clothes, making curtains, tablecloths.  Love the self threader!  Stitches faster than my previous machine which is great when making table cloths.

Great Machine
Sandra VanWiggeren | March 08, 2016


Overall Rating



Pros:
Good Value, High Quality



I just recently purchased this machine and absolutely could not be more pleased.  It is easy to use, strong, and its stitches beautifully.  Even though it is heavier, I think this machine will be the new featherweight as far as quilters are concerned.

Needle threader doesnt work
Nancy wertz | February 08, 2016


Overall Rating




I am very happy overall with the machine and the buttonholer is wonderful.  However the self threader quit working after one week.  I have tried to adjust the tiny wire and failed.  This is the only option to correct the issue according to cutomer support.  I have had two other very inexpensive machines with a threading devices that never failed over years of use.

View a full list of this machine's features to get started quickly






ONE TOUCH™ Stitch Selection with 24 Built-In Stitches


Easy to Select, Easy to Personalize. This direct stitch selection sets optimal stitch size for better results. Includes most popular stitch patterns: 6 Basic, 4 Stretch, 12 Decorative and 2 Buttonhole.


2 Fully Automatic 1-Step Buttonholes


Buttonhole sewing is a one-step simple process, providing reliable results every time. Each side of the buttonhole is sewn in the same direction creating beautifully balanced buttonholes.


SWIFTSMART™ Threading System with Automatic Needle Threader


Sewers guide the thread directly from the spool to the needle area through a single groove and thread the needle by simply pressing the lever for true, simple one-touch threading!


QuickView Stitch Setting & Simple Stitch Adjustment


Optimal stitch setting shown as stitch is selected. When either the length or width of a stitch is changed, the LED light turns yellow to notify the sewer of the change.


DROP & SEW™ Bobbin System


With this special top drop-on bobbin, there’s no longer any need to raise the bobbin thread before sewing. Just drop and sew!


Presser Foot Sensor


Ensures the presser foot is in position for an easy start. The machine will not start but rather alerts you with a “beep” sound if presser foot is not in the down position.


3 STAYBRIGHT™ LED Lights


Not just one but three lamps illuminate the sewing surface for optimal viewing. The long-lasting bulbs (100,000 hours) stay cool regardless of how long the machine is being operated.


Feed Dog Control 


A conveniently located lever, easily and effortlessly moved, will lower the feed dogs for free-motion embroidery, monograms and for sewing buttons.


Extra-Large Sewing Space (374 mm/14.7”)


Provides a more spacious working area, an essential for quilting, home décor sewing or when working with other larger projects.


Vintage Inspired Design & Graphics


Nostalgic filigree and signature machine curves pay tribute to our classic historic machine designs.


Extra High Presser Foot Lift


Offers more clearance, which is needed when placing multiple layers of bulky fabric under the presser foot.


Heavy-Duty Metal Frame


The internal rigid support holds all the mechanisms in perfect alignment for skip-free sewing and overall durability.


Sewing Speed


Projects can be sewn quickly with a maximum speed of 750 stitches-per-minute.


Automatic Reverse


Push the conveniently located automatic reverse button to sew in reverse and reinforce the stitch.


Free Arm


Provides easy access to cuffs, collars, pant hems and other difficult to reach areas.


Included Accessories


All-Purpose Foot, Blind Hem Foot, Satin Stitch Foot, One-step Buttonhole Foot, Zipper Foot, Needles, Bobbins, Spool Pin Felt, Auxiliary Spool Pin, Thread Spool Caps, Needle Plate Screwdriver, Lint Brush/ Seam Ripper and Soft-Sided Cover.

Pros:
Good Value, Great Features, High Quality


Cons: 
A Little Larger Than Expected.



Like the Anniversary edition.  The looks are amazing. Stunning black and gold scrolls.   Was not that easy to use at first..... have learned to work with it better.  Have made many items with it now  that I have become accustomed to it.  Got it on promotion so that did make me happy.

Too many little problems

Pros:
Great Features, Easy To Use


Cons: 
Too Many Miscellaneous Problems



I have had problems with my Singer 1 One since I received it as a gift at Christmas 2014.  I managed to make it through the small problems until now.  Those problems included error messages for errors that didn't exist, thread bundling up at the bobbin case, fabric not being pulled through evenly (straight), needles breaking by striking the pins in the fabric or breaking the pins, or tension messing up.  Now the feed dogs are stuck in the down position.  I didn't lower them; found out when fabric was not feeding at all.  I cleaned and oiled the machine, which didn't help, but then the bobbin thread began to catch and wind itself all over.  I think I have that problem corrected, but am at a loss for the feed dogs. My 1978 Kenmore is still less a problem and more reliable than this new one.

Poor Quality



I still have my mother's Slant O Matic and it sews great, this machine sewed great for about 3 weeks, the needle started to hit the stitch plate, had it fixed, now it won't hold the upper tension.  I should have left it in the store  on the shelf.

Mostly Happy

Pros:
Easy To Use


Cons: 
Power Foot Sticks.



Purchased mainly for quilting and so far it works well.  Two problems I've found are 1) the power foot (the one you put your foot on to make it go) seems to stick so that when I release pressure completely, the machine keeps sewing.  I have to tap repeatedly to "unstick" it.  Bummer.  2) Machine seems to be very picky about the thread I use.  I have to use thread that is labeled "for quilting" as thinner, more silky options just don't seem to want to work in this machine at all and I get repeated errors indicating the thread has broke (when it hasn't).  I'll try to replace the power foot and I don't really use it for anything other than quilting cotton so that's not a big deal to me, but I'm guessing it would be if you are using it for sewing clothing.

I love my Singer One

Pros:
Good Value, Great Features



I needed a larger sewing base and chose this machine for this reason and it was affordable for me. I have started quilting and find this great for piecing. I have my quilts finished professionally as my skill level isn't quite there yet. I'm sure there are many features I'm not using. My only desire would be for an class at my local JoAnn Fabrics on the many ways to use this machine. It seems that unless there is a Singer representative 'in store' this is not available.  I have had to learn by trial and error.
