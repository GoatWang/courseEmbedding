PART
I

 

Item 1.
Business

 

The
Company was incorporated under the laws of the state of Utah on
October 25, 1972, under the name of Electronic Agricultural
Machinery Development Corporation.  In 1974, the Company
changed its name to Zenith Development Corporation.  In 1980,
the Company changed its name to Alternative Energy Resources, Inc.
 In 2004, the Company changed its name to Trafalgar Resources,
Inc.

 

Initially,
the Company sought to develop and market inventions, including an
asparagus harvester, a hot water saving device and a gas alert
signal.  Ultimately, none of the inventions were successful
and they were abandoned. The Company ceased to conduct any business
and has not conducted any business during the last three
years.

 

Currently,
the Company is in the process of investigating potential business
ventures which, in the opinion of management, will provide a source
of eventual profit to the Company.  Such involvement may take
many forms, including the acquisition of an existing business or
the acquisition of assets to establish subsidiary businesses.
 All risks inherent in new and inexperienced enterprises are
inherent in the Company’s business.

 

The
Company is not currently conducting any business, nor has it
conducted any business for several years. Therefore, it does not
possess products or services, distribution methods, competitive
business positions, or major customers.  The Company does not
possess any unexpired patents or trademarks and any and all of its
licensing and royalty agreements from the inventions it sought to
market in the past have since expired, and are not currently valid.
The Company does not employ any employees.
    

 

The
selection of a business opportunity in which to participate is
complex and risky. Additionally, as the Company has only limited
resources, it may be difficult to find good opportunities.
 There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to
identify and acquire any business opportunity which will ultimately
prove to be beneficial to the Company and its stockholders. The
Company will select any potential business opportunity based on
management's business judgment.

 

The
activities of the Company are subject to several significant risks
which arise primarily as a result of the fact that the Company has
no specific business and may acquire or participate in a business
opportunity based on the decision of management which potentially
could act without the consent, vote, or approval of the Company's
stockholders.  The risks faced by the Company are further
increased as a result of its lack of resources and its inability to
provide a prospective business opportunity with significant
capital.

 

Item 2.
Property

 

The
Company owns no properties and utilizes space on a rent-free basis
in the office of its principal stockholder, Anthony Brandon
Escobar.  This arrangement is expected to continue until such
time as the Company becomes involved in a business venture which
necessitates its relocation, as to which no assurances can be
given.  The Company has no agreements with respect to the
maintenance or future acquisition of the office facilities,
however, if a successful merger/acquisition is negotiated, it is
anticipated that the office of the Company will be moved to that of
the acquired company.  

 

The
Company is not actively engaged in conducting any business.
 Rather, the Company is in the process of investigating
potential business ventures which, in the opinion of management,
will provide a source of eventual profit to the Company.
 Therefore, the Company does not presently intend to invest in
real estate or real estate securities, nor has it formulated any
investment policies regarding investments in real estate, real
estate mortgages, or securities of or interests in persons engaged
in real estate activities.

Item 7.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations.

 

Special
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

 

This
annual report contains certain forward-looking statements within
the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995
with respect to the Plan of Operations provided below, including
information regarding the Company’s financial condition,
results of operations, business strategies, operating efficiencies
or synergies, competitive positions, growth opportunities, plans
and objectives of management. The statements made as part of the
Plan of Operations that are not historical facts are hereby
identified as “forward-looking statements.”

 

PLAN OF
OPERATION.

 

The
Company is in the process of investigating potential business
ventures which, in the opinion of management, will provide a source
of eventual profit to the Company.  Such involvement may take
many forms, including the acquisition of an existing business or
the acquisition of assets to establish subsidiary businesses.
 The Company’s management does not expect to remain
involved as management of any acquired business.

 

As the
Company possesses limited funds, the Company will be extremely
limited in its attempts to locate potential




-5-

 

  

business
situations for investigation.  The Company intends to
commence, on a limited basis, the process of investigating possible
merger and acquisition candidates, and believes that the
Company’s status as a publicly-held corporation will enhance
its ability to locate such potential business ventures.  No
assurance can be given as to when the Company may locate suitable
business opportunities and such opportunities may be difficult to
locate; however, the Company intends to actively search for
potential business ventures for the foreseeable future.
 

 

Management
anticipates that due to its lack of funds, and the limited amount
of its resources, the Company may be restricted to participation in
only one potential business venture.  This lack of
diversification should be considered a substantial risk because it
will not permit the Company to offset potential losses from one
venture against gains from another.

 

Business
opportunities, if any arise, are expected to become available to
the Company principally from the personal contacts of its officers
and directors.  While it is not expected that the Company will
engage professional firms specializing in business acquisitions or
reorganizations, such firms may be retained if funds become
available in the future, and if deemed advisable.
 Opportunities may thus become available from professional
advisors, securities broker-dealers, venture capitalists, members
of the financial community, and other sources of unsolicited
proposals. In certain circumstances, the Company may agree to pay a
finder’s fee or other form of compensation, including perhaps
one-time cash payments, payments based upon a percentage of
revenues or sales volume, and/or payments involving the issuance of
securities, for services provided by persons who submit a business
opportunity in which the Company shall decide to participate,
although no contracts or arrangements of this nature presently
exist.  The Company is unable to predict at this time the cost
of locating a suitable business opportunity.

 

The
analysis of business opportunities will be undertaken by or under
the supervision of the Company’s management, none of whom is
a professional analyst and none of whom have significant general
business experience.  Among the factors which management will
consider in analyzing potential business opportunities are the
available technical, financial and managerial resources; working
capital and financial requirements; the history of operation, if
any; future prospects; the nature of present and anticipated
competition; potential for further research, developments or
exploration; growth and expansion potential; the perceived public
recognition or acceptance of products or services; name
identification, and other relevant factors.  

 

It is not
possible at present to predict the exact manner in which the
Company may participate in a business opportunity.  Specific
business opportunities will be reviewed and, based upon such
review, the appropriate legal structure or method of participation
will be decided upon by management.  Such structures and
methods may include, without limitation, leases, purchase and sale
agreements, licenses, joint ventures; and may involve merger,
consolidation or reorganization.  The Company may act directly
or indirectly through an interest in a partnership, corporation or
reorganization.  However, it is most likely that any
acquisition of a business venture the Company would make would be
by conducting a reorganization involving the issuance of the
Company’s restricted securities. Such a reorganization may
involve a merger (or combination pursuant to state corporate
statutes, where one of the entities dissolves or is absorbed by the
other), or it may occur as a consolidation, where a new entity is
formed and the Company and such other entity combine assets in the
new entity.  A reorganization may also occur, directly or
indirectly, through subsidiaries, and there is no assurance that
the Company would be the surviving entity.  Any such
reorganization could result in loss of control of a majority of the
shares.  The Company’s present directors may be required
to resign in connection with a reorganization.  

 

The
Company may choose to enter into a venture involving the
acquisition of or merger with a company which does not need
substantial additional capital but desires to establish a public
trading market of its securities.  Such a company may desire
to consolidate its operations with the Company through a merger,
reorganization, asset acquisition, or other combination, in order
to avoid possible adverse consequences of undertaking its own
public offering.  (Such consequences might include expense,
time delays or loss of voting control.)  In the event of such
a merger, the Company may be required to issue significant
additional shares, and it may be anticipated that control over the
Company’s affairs may be transferred to others.

 

As part
of their investigation of acquisition possibilities, the
Company’s management may meet with executive officers of the
business and its personnel; inspect its facilities; obtain
independent analysis or verification of the

information
provided, and conduct other reasonable measures, to the extent
permitted by the Company’s limited resources and
management’s limited expertise.  Generally, the Company
intends to analyze and make a determination based upon all
available information without reliance upon any single factor as
controlling.  

 

In all
likelihood, the Company’s management will be inexperienced in
the areas in which potential businesses will be investigated and in
which the Company may make an acquisition or investment.
 Thus, it may become necessary for the Company to retain
consultants or outside professional firms to assist management in
evaluating potential investments.  The Company can give no
assurance that it will be able to find suitable consultants or
managers.  The Company has no policy regarding the use of
consultants, however, if management, in its discretion, determines
that it is in the best interests of the Company, management may
seek consultants to review potential merger or acquisitions
candidates.  There are currently no contracts or agreements
between any consultant and any companies that are searching for
“shell” companies with which to merge.

 

It may be
anticipated that the investigation of specific business
opportunities and the negotiation, drafting and execution of
relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments
will require substantial management time and attention, and
substantial costs for accountants, attorneys and others.
 Should a decision thereafter be made not to participate in a
specific business opportunity, it is likely that costs already
expended would not be recoverable.  It is likely, in the event
a transaction should eventually fail to be consummated, for any
reason, that the costs incurred by the Company would not be
recoverable.  The Company’s officers and directors are
entitled to reimbursement for all expenses incurred in their
investigation of possible business ventures on behalf of the
Company, and no assurance can be given that if the Company has
available funds they will not be depleted in such expenses.
 

 

Based on
current economic and regulatory conditions, management believes
that it is possible, if not probable, for a company like the
Company, without assets or many liabilities, to negotiate a merger
or acquisition with a viable private company.  The opportunity
arises principally because of the high legal and accounting fees
and the length of time associated with the registration process of
“going public.”  However, should any of these
conditions change, it is very possible that there would be little
or no economic value for anyone taking over control of the
Company.

 

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

 

As of
September 30, 2010, the Company had $4,466 in cash and liabilities
of $54,478.  As of September 30, 2010, the Company had a
negative working capital of $20,012. The Company had a negative
working capital of $37 as of September 30, 2009.  The Company
has only incidental ongoing expenses primarily associated with
maintaining its corporate status and maintaining the
Company’s reporting obligations to the Securities and
Exchange Commission. Current management has indicated a willingness
to help support the Company’s ongoing expenses through the
purchase of securities of the Company.

 

For the
twelve months ended September 30, 2010, the Company had $16,545 in
expenses related to maintaining its corporate status, paying
accounting and legal fees.  Expenses were slightly lower than
in previous years as the Company had only limited operations
related to completed audits and accounting work and filed documents
with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Management
anticipates only nominal continuing expenses related to
investigating business opportunities and legal and accounting cost.
For the year ended September 30, 2010, the Company had a net loss
of $19,975 compared to a loss of $13,832 for the year ended
September 30, 2009.

 

Since
inception the Company has not generated significant revenue, and it
is unlikely that any revenue will be generated until the Company
locates a business opportunity with which to acquire or merge.
 Management of the Company will be investigating various
business opportunities.  These efforts may cost the Company
not only out of pocket expenses for its management but also
expenses associated with legal and accounting costs.  There
can be no guarantee that the Company will receive any benefits from
the efforts of management to locate business
opportunities.

 

Management
does not anticipate employing any employees in the future until a
merger or acquisition can be accomplished.  Management will
continue to rely on outside consultants to assist in its corporate
filing requirements.

Item
9A(T). Controls and Procedures

 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

 

Our
management, which consists of one person and with the assistance of
an outside CPA firm, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this
report. Based on that evaluation, our President and CFO concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the
period covered by this report were effective such that the
information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under
the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules
and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our
management, including our President and CFO, as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. A controls system
cannot provide absolute assurance, however, that the objectives of
the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can
provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of
fraud, if any, within a company have been detected.  However,
management believes the controls and procedures provide a
reasonable basis for the conclusions.  This evaluation was
made in light of the fact the Company has no operations or revenue
and limited cash on hand.

 

 

Management’s
Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial
Reporting

 

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States.

 

 

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even
those systems determined to be effective can provide only
reasonable assurance of achieving their control
objectives.

 

 

Our
management evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting as of September 30, 2010. In making this
assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(“COSO”) in Internal Control - Integrated
Framework.   Further, our management considered the lack
of operations and revenue, the limited cash on hand and the limited
transactions which occur on a monthly basis.  Based on this
evaluation, our management concluded that, as of September 30,
2010, our internal control over financial reporting was effective.
 However, management recognized the weaknesses of
inadequate


-8-

 

  

segregation
of duties consistent with control objectives due to our small size
and limited resources but believes our controls are reasonably
effective.

 

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of the
Company’s registered public accounting firm regarding
internal control over financial reporting.  Management’s
report was not subject to attestation by the Company’s
registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Security
and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only
management’s report in this annual report.

in internal control over financial reporting

 

There have
been no changes in internal control over financial
reporting.
