T&T Clark 1895–2010






















Tweet











Overview

The International Critical Commentary, published by T&T Clark International, has long held a special place among works on the Bible. It brings together all the relevant aids to exegesis: linguistic and textual, archaeological, historical, literary, and theological, with a comprehensiveness and quality of scholarship unmatched by any other series.
The ICC series has also been rather difficult to purchase in its entirety, due in part to the cost of the print volumes, numerous revisions of various volumes, and the fact that most retailers do not offer the entire set as one purchase. The Logos edition contains the most recent edition of each title and provides an easy way to own every volume of this often-cited commentary set. If you were to purchase all 59 volumes in print at suggested retail price, the cost would be over $2,800.00. The Logos edition provides a substantial discount and presents the content in a more flexible medium than print! This series is under the editorship of Professor J. A. Emerton of Cambridge, Professor C. E. B. Cranfield of Durham and Professor G. N. Stanton of Cambridge.
With Logos Bible Software, you can reap the maximum benefit from the 59-volume ICC by getting easier access to the contents of this series—helping you to use these volumes more efficiently for research and sermon preparation. Every word from every book has been indexed and catalogued to help you search the entire series for a particular verse or topic, giving you instant access to cross-references. Along with this, your titles will automatically integrate into custom search reports, passage guides, exegetical guides, and the other advanced features of Logos Bible Software.
What’s more, with Logos, every word is essentially a link. Scripture references are linked directly to Greek and Hebrew texts, along with the English Bible translations of your choice. That gives you access to technical linguistic data, along with the tools for accurate exegesis and interpretation.


Note: Many of the titles in this series have gone through a number of revisions. See the bibliography for a list of editions included in the Logos ICC product.

Genesis

Author: John Skinner
Publisher: T&T Clark
Publication Date: 1910
Pages: 552

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




John Skinner’s 1910 Commentary on Genesis was for many years the standard English-language text. Incorporating Hebrew text throughout and packed with references, his commentary, like his lectures, is clear, illuminating, and impressive.


John Skinner studied in Scotland and Germany at the end of the nineteenth century. He held pulpits in the Free Church of Scotland from 1880 until 1890, when he was elected to the faculty of what is now Westminster College, Cambridge. There he became one of the earliest English-language scholars to incorporate the documentary hypothesis in his teaching and writing. Skinner was elected principal in 1908, and given principal emeritus status in 1922. He died in 1925 while revising Genesis.







Numbers

Author: G. Buchanan Gray
Publisher: T&T Clark
Publication Date: 1903
Pages: 489

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




G. Buchanan Gray wrote this commentary on Numbers to enable readers to study and interpret the book in light of new discoveries.


Most Bible readers have the impression that Numbers is a dull book only relieved by the brilliancy of the Balaam chapters and some snatches of old Hebrew songs, but, as Professor Gray shows with admirable skill and insight, its historical and religious value is not that which lies on the surface. Professor Gray’s commentary is distinguished by fine scholarship and sanity of judgment; it is impossible to commend it too warmly.
—Saturday Review


George Buchanan Gray (1865–1922) was a congregational clergyman and biblical scholar. He was professor of Hebrew and Old Testament exegesis in Mansfield College, Oxford.

Edited by Alfred Plummer, Charles Augustus Briggs, and S. R. Driver, this commentary on Deuteronomy provides a fantastic backdrop to the study of Deuteronomy. An indespensible resource for the serious Bible scholar, student, or pastor.


It is a pleasure to see at last a really critical Old Testament commentary in English upon a portion of the Pentateuch, and especially one of such merit. This I find superior to any other commentary in any language upon Deuteronomy.
—E. L. Curtis, professor, Yale University

Judges

Author: G. F. Moore
Publisher: T&T Clark
Publication Date: 1910
Pages: 476

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




G. F. Moore’s work was of importance in four fields—the shaping of US scholarship, the reshaping of US concepts of religion, the study of the Hebrew Bible, and the study of Tannaitic Judaism. Of his many articles in the Andover Review and Cheyne’s Encyclopaedia Biblica, his commentary on Judges remains most valuable.


Professor Moore has more than sustained his scholarly reputation in this work, which gives us for the first time in English a commentary on Judges not excelled, if indeed equalled, in any language of the world.
—L. W. Batten, P. E. Divinity School, Philadelphia
Although a critical commentary, this work has its practical uses, and by its divisions, headlines, etc., it is admirably adapted to the wants of all thoughtful students of the Scriptures. Indeed, with the other books of the series, it is sure to find its way into the hands of pastors and scholarly laymen.
—Portland Zion’s Herald
Like its predecessors, this volume will be warmly welcomed—whilst to those whose means of securing up-to-date information on the subject of which it treats are limited, it is simply invaluable.
—Edinburgh Scotsman

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




For over 100 years, the International Critical Commentary series has held a special place among works on the Bible. It has sought to bring together all the relevant aids to exegesis—linguistic and textual no less than archaeological, historical, literary and theological—with a level of comprehension and quality of scholarship unmatched by any other series.


Professor Smith’s commentary will for some time be the standard work on Samuel, and we heartily congratulate him on scholarly work so faithfully accomplished.
—The Athenaum
The literary quality of the book deserves mention. We do not usually go to commentaries for models of English style. But this book has a distinct, though unobtrusive, literary flavor. It is delightful reading. The translation is always felicitous, and often renders further comment needless.
—The Evangelist
The author exhibits precisely that scholarly attitude which will commend his work to the widest audience.
—The Churchman


Henry Preserved Smith (1847–1926) was an American biblical scholar. Educated both at Amherst College and Lane Theological Seminary, he eventually became an instructor therewith.

Smith retired from the denomination, and in 1893, upon becoming a professor at Andover Theological Seminary, entered the ministry of the Congregational Church. From 1897 to 4099 he was a professor in Amherst College, and in 1907 became a professor in the Meadville Theological School (now affiliated with the University of Chicago).

Through his distinguished academic career, Montgomery made a name for himself in the fields of Semitics and Oriental studies. He authored a number of books on the Orient and the Middle-East, and his works were considered by scholars in the field to be the most complete and well-researched publications on that subject.

This account of I and II Chronicles provides a comprehensive, thought-provoking exegesis of two Old Testament books.


To those whose work calls for a strictly critical commentary on the text and the sources this commentary is commended.

For this purpose there is no other one book in English of equal value with this work of Professor Curtis.

Christian scholarship seems here to have reached the highest level yet attained in study of the book which in religious importance stands next to the Gospels. His work upon it is not likely to be excelled in learning, both massive and minute, by any volume of the International Series, to which it belongs.
—The Outlook
We have in this work what we should expect, extreme thoroughness, scholarly precision, and depth of insight.
—The Churchman
It is scarcely too much to say that we have here in compact form the best available commentary upon the first book of the psalter. It is not simply grammatical and lexical, but it embodies the best results of the author’s study of biblical theology. These serve to bring out doubly the significance and import of these hymns of worship of ancient Israel.

In 1869, the trustees of Southern Seminary invited Toy back, this time to become professor of Old Testament interpretation and Oriental languages. His resignation came after 10 years with the seminary due to a theological controversy. From 1880, until his retirement in 1909, Toy was Hancock Professor of Hebrew and Other Oriental Languages at Harvard, and from 1880–1903 was Dexter Lecturer on Biblical Literature.

Hugh Williamson’s Isaiah 1–5 is the first of three volumes in a important new commentary on Isaiah 1–27.

The new commentaries continue this tradition. All new evidence now available is incorporated and new methods of study are applied. The authors are of the highest international standing. No attempt has been made to secure a uniform theological or critical approach to the biblical text: contributors have been invited for their scholarly distinction, not for their adherence to any one school of thought.

Pages: 424

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




Isaiah 40–55 is unusually challenging on both the macro and micro levels. To combine literary sensibilities with traditional textual and historical methods is challenging as well. These informative, careful, and copiously researched volumes respectably fill a long-felt gap and will surely be sought as important reference works in the study of Isaiah for decades to come.
—Interpretation
One of the latest additions to the eminent International Critical Commentary series is this joint production of J. Goldingay and D. Payne. In the preface, the authors lay out briefly the long history of the ICC’s delay in publishing a complete commentary on the book of Isaiah, and describe the process with which they worked: Payne is primarily responsible for the textual and philological notes, while Goldingay produced the bulk of the explicitly exegetical work and the lengthy introduction . . . The two authors have succeeded, independently in their respective tasks and jointly through their interaction, in producing a detailed and ultimately quite judicious commentary on the 16 chapters of the book of Isaiah normally taken to be a literary unit within this corpus . . . In form and content these two volumes are a fitting addition to the ICC, and . . . are sure to provide a solid foundation for planned volumes on the remaining chapters.

—Dianne Bergant, distinguished professor of Old Testament studies, Catholic Theological Union
The commentary constitutes a detailed exegetical discussion, including interaction with ancient and medieval Jewish and Christian sources as well as modern commentators.

This fine, learned and patient commentary will be a great resource for those who wish to engage in a detailed study of Hosea . . . Macintosh is tireless in his attempts to elucidate Hosea’s language, ranging widely over scholarship of many centuries, but always building his comments into a lucid and coherent synthesis. . . . This is a distinguished, ‘advanced’ commentary that blends conservatism and innovation, and a worthy addition to the ICC.

I shall have pleasure in recommending it to all students in our seminary. This book fills, in the most favorable manner, a long-felt want for a good critical commentary on two of the most interesting books in the Old Testament.
—Lewis B. Paton, professor of Hebrew, Hartford Theological Seminary
Nothing at all worthy of consideration has been passed by. The consequence is that when one carefully studies what has been brought together in this volume, either upon some passage of the two prophets treated, or upon some question of critical or antiquarian importance in the introductory portion of the volume, one feels that he has obtained an adequately exhaustive view of the subject.
—The Interior

Publication Date: 1922
Pages: 317

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




 E. P. Gould’s powerful treatise on the Gospel of Mark is heavily influenced by linguistic studies and historical context, and provides a stellar example of New Testament biblical scholarship. This volume is an essential part of the library of any pastor, teacher, or professor of the Bible.


The whole make-up is that of a thoroughly helpful, instructive critical study of the Word, surpassing anything of the kind ever attempted in the English language, and to students and clergymen knowing the proper use of a commentary it will prove an invaluable aid.
—The Lutheran Quarterly
Dr. Gould’s commentary on Mark is a large success . . . and a credit to American scholarship. . . . He has undoubtedly given us a commentary on Mark which surpasses all others, a thing we have reason to expect will be true in the case of every volume of the series to which it belongs.

St. Luke

Author: A. A. Plummer
Publisher: T&T Clark
Publication Date: 1896
Pages: 592

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




A. A. Plummer’s commentary on the Gospel of Luke sets itself apart from other commentaries of its time because of the illustrations it takes from Jewish writings, the abundance of references to the Septuagint and other books of the New Testament, and the use of frequent use of quotations from the Latin versions.


It is distinguished throughout by learning, sobriety of judgment, and sound exegesis. It is a weighty contribution to the interpretation of the third Gospel, and will take an honorable place in the series of which it forms a part.
—D. D. Salmond, Critical Review
We are pleased with the thoroughness and scientific accuracy of the interpretations. . . . It seems to us that the prevailing characteristic of the book is common sense, fortified by learning and piety.
—The Herald and Presbyter
It is a valuable and welcome addition to our somewhat scanty stock of first-class commentaries on the third Gospel. By its scholarly thoroughness it well sustains the reputation which the International Series has already won.
—J. H. Thayer, professor of sacred literature, Andover Theological Seminary

John 1–4

Author: John McHugh
Series: International Critical Commentary
Publisher: T&T Clark
Publication Date: 2009
Pages: 368

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




For over 100 years the International Critical Commentary has had a special place amongst works on the Bible. This new volume on John brings together all the relevant aids to exegesis—linguistic, textual, archaeological, historical, literary and theological—to enable the scholar to have a complete knowledge and understanding of this New Testament book. John McHugh incorporates new evidence available in the field and applies new methods of studies. No uniform theological or critical approach to the text is taken.


McHugh is very attentive to grammatical issues, as to be expected of the ICC. His discussion of text-critical matters is also impressive. In terms of the history of interpretation, he surveys broadly on any interpretive crux, and includes precritical perspectives. Perhaps most impressive is his theological engagement with the text, no doubt influenced by the ministerial work he undertook in his retirement . . . will serve as a handy resource for research on John’s Gospel.
—Theological Book Review


John McHugh was dean of the theology faculty at the University of Durham, UK from 1980 to 1982, and in 1984 was appointed to the Pontifical Biblical Commission.

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




Acts is one of the most theologically-rich New Testament books. Charting Paul’s missionary journeys, as well as the beginnings of the early church, C. K. Barrett’s commentary provides solid biblical truth for today.


The commentary proper, which is on the Greek text, engages with a wide range of scholarship; readers will find much to argue with and—hesitantly—dissent from, but they will certainly find themselves indebted to its richness and clarity. This is essentially a work for the scholar’s library, and institutions serious about New Testament study will ensure that they have it on their shelves.
—Peter Doble, Theological Book Review
The discussion of textual variants is careful and detailed. Again and again, Barrett provides valuable insights on the grammar and syntax of Luke’s Greek, and students who read Acts in intermediate or advanced Greek classes will have frequent occasion to bless the author for his help.

A number of commentaries on the Acts of the Apostles have recently been published, especially in the US; this one ranks among the best given the wealth of information it provides.
—Nouvelle Revue Theologique
With this second volume, eminent British biblical scholar C. K. Barrett completes his contribution to the prestigious ICC series. As with the first volume published in 1994, Barrett’s commentary on the Greek texts of Acts is thorough and lucid, addressing the literary, historical and theological dimensions of the text. This two-volume work will remain a classic source on Acts for serious students of the New Testament.

Romans

Authors: A. C. Headlam, W. W. Sanday
Publisher: T&T Clark
Publication Date: 1901
Pages: 450





Two well-respected theologians, A. C. Headlam and W. W. Sanday, bring lucid commentary on Romans to the International Critical Commentary series. This focused commentary brought forth by collaborative effort, gives a remarkable guidebook to the tenets found within Paul’s letter to the Romans.


We do not hesitate to commend this as the best commentary on Romans yet written in English. It will do much to popularize this admirable and much needed series, by showing that it is possible to be critical and scholarly and at the same time devout and spiritual, and intelligible to plain Bible readers.
—The Church Standard
A commentary with a very distinct character and purpose of its own, which brings to students and ministers an aid which they cannot obtain elsewhere. . . . There is probably no other commentary in which criticism has been employed so successfully and impartially to bring out the author’s thought.
—NY Independent
We have nothing but heartiest praise for the weightier matters of the commentary. It is not only critical, but exegetical, expository, doctrinal, practical, and eminently spiritual. The positive conclusions of the books are very numerous and are stoutly, gloriously evangelical. . . . The commentary does not fail to speak with the utmost reverence of the whole word of God.
—The Congregationalist

Author: Margaret E. Thrall
Publisher: T&T Clark
Publication Date: 1994
Pages: 978

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




Margaret E. Thrall provides an exegetical verse-by-verse exposition and addresses all historical, linguistic, and theological issues. The two volumes of this commentary now form the most comprehensive and up-to-date work available on 2 Corinthians.


It is difficult to praise Margaret E. Thrall’s commentary on 2 Corinthians too highly. In my notice of the first volume I called attention to Dr. Thrall’s immense scholarship, clarity of mind, and lucid writing. These qualities continue through Volume II . . . Here is everything that could be wished for in a commentary . . . Throughout, the text is carefully analyzed, the views of a wide range of scholars are set out and judicious decisions between them made—all with a beautiful clarity. Even when the reader disagrees with Dr. Thrall’s conclusions, he or she will have had their understanding enlarged and be given a deeper insight into the epistle. Reading this commentary one wonders why anyone should be satisfied with anything less elegant.
—The Bulletin for the Institute for Reformed Theology
The high standard of meticulously detailed exegesis displayed in the first volume of Dr. Thrall’s magisterial commentary is continued in its sequel . . . In all respects, this volume and its predecessor surely deserve to be regarded as one of the most impressive contributions to this fine series . . . Historians and theologians alike will find this commentary an indispensable resource for the interpretation both of key passages and of others that might at first sight look innocent of historical or doctrinal significance.
—Journal of Theological Studies
Students and scholars with good Greek skills who are working on 2 Corinthians must engage with this commentary.
—Foundations
Margaret Thrall . . . is the perfect guide to assist the reader through this difficult text. . . . After a lifetime of work on Paul, she commands an awesome familiarity with every aspect of II Corinthians and the forest of literature upon it. The ICC commentaries are renowned for their thoroughness in exegetical detail, and Thrall provides translation, textual notes, linguistic analysis and historical discussion in full . . . Thus this is an ideal commentary for those engaged in serious, detailed engagement with the (Greek) text.
—Anvil
She has completed the first of two volumes of what will become a standard work of detailed exegesis on the Greek text of 2 Corinthians and a model of thorough interaction with current scholarship.
—Scottish Journal of Theology
Few of the canonical books makes such exacting demands on the commentator as 2 Corinthians. Anyone attempting to reconstruct from oblique and allusive references what had actually happened in Corinth faces unusually baffling problems, for the most part excluding all solutions save those with their degree of probability carefully quantified (as is conscientiously done by Thrall). The same is true of the cruces which stud almost every chapter. No wonder that the vast literature on this epistle is particularly taxing to interact with. All the more credit, then, to Thrall for her achievement in giving us so much, in the space available, about a document which has recently been attracting even more attention that before. Dr. Thrall manages to combine remarkable conciseness with almost unfailing clarity.
—C. J. A. Hickling, Journal of Theological Studies
A fine accomplishment and an important addition to the commentaries on 2 Corinthians.
—E. Earle Ellis, Southwestern Journal of Theology
This is a magnificently substantial volume, the rich fruit of a super-abounding labour. This large and generous and patient work does not belong on a large shelf, but on the large desk of any who is willing to engage, no holds barred, with the mind and/or imagination of the apostle. Everyone awaits with eager expectation the next enthralling installment.
—Douglas A. Templeton, Epworth Review


Margaret E. Thrall was reader in biblical studies at the University of Wales, Bangor, where she had a long and distinguished career, from 1962 to 1996.

Galatians

Author: E. de Witt Burton
Publisher: T&T Clark
Publication Date: 1920
Pages: 539

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




When in 1896 I began work upon the epistle to the Galatians with definite reference to the preparation of this commentary, it was with a clear conviction that if I was to make any appreciable contribution to the understanding of the epistle, it would be by confining myself to a few of the several lines of study which an interpreter might properly and profitably undertake. I decided not to attempt an exhaustive study of the history of the interpretation of the epistle, or of the rabbinic writings and method of exegesis. Convinced that, despite all that had been done in the study of the vocabulary of the New Testament, much remained still to be done, and strongly inclined to expect that such study would aid materially in the recovery of the primary elements of the thought of the apostle Paul, persuaded also that such lexicographical work would prepare the way for a clearer perception of the course of thought of the epistle, I determined, while not wholly neglecting other lines of study, to give my chief attention, first, to a fresh historical study of the vocabulary of the letter, and then to an endeavour to trace its course of thought with exactness and to state it with clearness.
—From the Preface


Ernest De Witt Burton graduated from Denison University in 1876, then from Rochester Theological Seminary in 1882. His studies also carried him to Germany at Leipzig and Berlin. Burton taught at the seminaries in Rochester and Newton (1882–1892), before becoming head of the department of New Testament literature and interpretation at the University of Chicago—where he was president from 1923–1925.

This volume prides itself in its linguistic precision, exegetical breadth, and penetrating theological observation on the epistle of Ephesians.


If you are looking for a thorough commentary on the Greek text of Ephesians, then this will not let you down.
—Doug Chaplin, Reviews in the Religion and Theology
Let us say it at once: this is now the premier English commentary on Ephesians in print.
—Edgar Krentz, Currents in Theology and Mission
Professor Best’s commentary with its wealth of detailed exegetical discussion is one of the most useful for those concerned with serious study of Ephesians and all who wish to discuss the value of Ephesians’ contribution to thinking about the nature and role of the church.
—Andrew T. Lincoln, Journal of Theological Studies
No one working on any aspect of Ephesians will be able to ignore this magisterial commentary by Best. It is a worthy and welcome contribution to biblical scholarship and one that will easily pass the test of time.
—Eugene Hensell, The Catholic Biblical Quarterly
While the commentary is very much a tool for scholars, it is accessible to preachers [who] will find that there are few problems raised by the text which have not been perceived by Best and on which he offers helpful comment.
—I. Howard Marshall, Epworth Review
The breadth and depth of the discussion make it required reading for those who want critically to engage with the text and thought world of Ephesians.

Author: T. K. Abbott
Publisher: T&T Clark
Publication Date: 1909

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




T. K. Abbott devoted his life to the study of biblical Greek and Hebrew, and this background prepared him for the task of writing the International Critical Commentary on Ephesians and Colossians—a trove of theological wisdom.


The exegesis based so solidly on the rock foundation of philology is argumentatively and convincingly strong. A spiritual and evangelical tenor pervades the interpretation from first to last. . . . These elements, together with the author’s full-orbed vision of the truth, with his discriminative judgment and his felicity of expression, make this the peer of any commentary on these important letters.
—The Standard
An exceedingly careful and painstaking piece of work. The introductory discussions of questions bearing on the authenticity and integrity (of the epistles) are clear and candid, and the exposition of the text displays a fine scholarship and insight.
—Northwestern Christian Advocate


Thomas Kingsmill Abbott (1929–1913) was a graduate of Trinity College, Dublin, where he would later teach for 30 years. There, he was both senior fellow and professor of biblical Greek and Hebrew. Abbott wrote many books on religious and scientific matters.

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




This volume takes its place as a worthy replacement in the venerable International Critical Commentary series. Here is critical but reverent scholarship at its best, distilling many years of research and reflection. In a day when the length of critical commentaries is expanding exponentially, Wilson serves up a concise, erudite treatment, a model of lucid scholarship. For pastors who can work with their Greek New Testament and for teachers in colleges, universities and seminaries, this commentary will prove to be a goldmine of information. The proofreading for this highly technical volume is first rate.
—Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society
A technical but readable analysis of Colossians and Philemon with due attention given to the text, background, and arguments of these letters. The author gives good overviews of scholarship and excavates the text with learned precision. Wilson is well-qualified to write a commentary on Colossians given his 40 years of expertise . . . in sum a technical but eminently readable commentary.
—Michael F. Bird, lecturer in theology, Ridley College, Melbourne, Australia
To his great credit, Wilson keeps this aim in sight throughout his careful and detailed study. As a result, the commentary proves a valuable source-book of data on a variety of topics: lexical, conceptual, social, theological, and occasionally pastoral . . . It is rich in word studies based on the text and other New Testament sources . . . In all, this is a valuable contribution to the library of scholarly works on the two letters. Building on the work of Lightfoot, Lohse, and Dunn, it takes its place as a welcome addition to the ICC revision.
—Ralph P. Martin, emeritus distinguished scholar in residence, Fuller Theological Seminary
Breaks fresh ground . . . Wilson has written a commentary that provides a sober analysis of the text and the critical issues that surround it.
—Expository Times


Robert McL. Wilson was emeritus professor of biblical studies at the University of St. Andrews, United Kingdom.

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




Although two of the New Testament’s shortest books, Philippians and Philemon are packed full of theologically important information. This powerful commentary by Marvin R. Vincent contains critical exegesis and fresh insight that is essential for today’s biblical scholar.


Of the merits of the work it is enough to say that it is worthy of its place in the noble undertaking to which it belongs. It is full of just such information as the Bible student, lay or clerical, needs; and while giving an abundance of the truths of erudition to aid the critical student of the text, it abounds also in that more popular information which enables the attentive reader almost to put himself in St. Paul’s place, to see with the eyes and feel with the heart of the apostle to the gentiles.
—Boston Advertiser
Throughout the work scholarly research is evident. It commends itself by its clear elucidation, its keen exegesis which marks the word study on every page, its compactness of statement and its simplicity of arrangement.
—Lutheran World


Marvin R. Vincent was Baldwin Professor of Sacred Literature at Union Theological Seminary in New York. One of his most notable works is his Word Studies in the New Testament, which has been treasured by generations of pastors and laypeople.

I have tried to present the message of the letters as they are ostensibly meant to be understood, as letters from Paul to Timothy and Titus, but I am well aware that right from the beginning of their ‘canonical’ history the letters were intended to be read for their relevance to the church and its leaders, and it is therefore also on that level that they are interpreted. I am conscious that only to a very limited extent has the commentary attempted to ask questions about the history of exposition or about the significance of the letters for the modern reader, but I hope that the exegesis has been done in such a way that expositors will find it a helpful basis for application. A recent commentator on another epistle has stated that ‘commentaries should be a resource for worship rather than a self-indulgent exploration of the biblical text.’ Like him I write from a self-consciously Christian set of presuppositions, and it is my hope that this commentary will help readers to appropriate the message of this particular part of Holy Scripture.
—From the Preface

Publisher: T&T Clark
Publication Date: 1924
Pages: 264





In this volume, professor James J. Moffatt delivers striking and provocative commentary on the New Testament book of Hebrews—a book that has at times been an enigma to the Church. Moffatt’s elucidation of this biblical text is an important addition to the International Critical Commentary series.


James J. Moffatt (1870–1944), was a graduate of Glasgow University. He first ministered before becoming professor of Greek and New Testament exegesis at Mansfield College, Oxford in 1911. He returned to Glasgow in 1915 as professor of church history at the United Free Church College. From 1927–1939 he was Washburn Professor of Church History at Union Theological Seminary in New York.

1 & 2 Peter, Jude

Author: C. C. Bigg
Publisher: T&T Clark
Publication Date: 1901
Pages: 353

Sample Pages: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7




Full of historical integrity and original language studies, this volume by C. C. Bigg is essential to the study of 1 & 2 Peter and Jude.


His commentary is very satisfactory indeed. His notes are particularly valuable. We know of no work on these epistles which is so full and satisfactory
—The Living Church
Canon Bigg’s work is preeminently characterized by judicial open-mindedness and sympathetic insight into historical conditions. His realistic interpretation of the relations of the apostles and the circumstances of the early church renders the volume invaluable to students of these themes. The exegetical work in the volume rests on the broad basis of careful linguistic study, acquaintance with apocalyptic literature and the writings of the Fathers, a sane judgment, and good sense.
—American Journal of Theology


Charles C. Bigg (1840–1908) was a schoolmaster and ecclesiastical historian.
