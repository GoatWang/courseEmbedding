Ingredient Glossary
 
We are proud of the ingredients in our products and list them on every label, as well as share additional information below. Our products are specifically formulated to be safe for use in and around the home with family, children and pets. We work hard to ensure our products have the very best combination of ingredients—combinations that not only work hard on your daily dirt and grime, but that fill your home with garden-inspired scents.
We make intelligent, responsible raw material choices, and whenever possible, obtain materials from renewable plant resources such as coconut, corn, soy or olive. At times we choose not to use a plant-derived material for reasons of efficacy, consistency and safety.
Our products do not contain ammonia, chlorine, glycol solvents, parabens, phthalates, formaldehyde, artificial colorants, phosphates or petroleum distillates.
We do not test our products on animals, nor are our products made with animal-derived ingredients.
Our packaging is recyclable and we use at least 25% post-consumer plastic in our bottles.
We manufacture according to exacting personal care standards in a cosmetic-grade cGMP facility. cGMP is an abbreviation for the term "current Good Manufacturing Practice", which refers to FDA regulations regarding the manufacturing, testing, and quality control of pharmaceutical and food products.
All suppliers of Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day ingredients derived from Palm Oil are members of RSPO (Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil). Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day supports sustainable practices of eco-sensitive areas throughout Asia, Africa and South America like the Brazilian rain forests.

Leaping Bunny Program




Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day is a member of the Leaping Bunny Program, an internationally recognized campaign in North America and the European Union to eliminate cosmetics, personal care and household product testing on animals. The Coalition for Consumer Information in Cosmetics' (CICC) and the Leaping Bunny Program administers a cruelty-free standard that provides the best assurance that no animal testing is used in any phase of product development by the company, its laboratories, or suppliers through clear product labeling. The Leaping Bunny logo serves as a symbol of the approval of participating animal protection groups around the world.  Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day is a certified cruelty-free company for our no animal testing policy. We do not test our products or ingredients on animals, nor are our products made with animal-derived ingredients. We make intelligent, responsible raw material choices, and whenever possible, obtain materials from renewable plant resources such as coconut, palm, corn, soy or olive. At times we choose not to use a plant-derived material for reasons of efficacy, consistency and safety. Examples of these choices are primarily around our preservative system and ingredients in some of our fragrance compositions. Safety is always the first consideration when evaluating all raw materials. For more information, contact Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day.   
Our Take On Non-Toxic & Product Testing:
In order to include a claim on our product that it is "non-toxic"—a term that must be approved by regulatory agencies before it can be used on packaging—animal testing is required. Because we do not test on animals, we cannot claim that our product is "non-toxic". A toxicologist reviews all of our formulations against a mathematical model for safety assessment. When used as directed, our products are safe for use around children and pets.

Hi, I'm Gina Meyers. A creative ​content creator.

A Little About​Myself.
I'm Gina and although I’m Flemish, I do speak two other languages fluently, i.e. English and French because I grew up abroad (Haïti, Tanzania, Senegal...). I got a Master degree from the PXL Hasselt, with distinction, in Visual Arts with a speciality in Graphic Design. After my Master I got my Teachers degree as well, as I am passionate about my specialties and love to learn others to find their way in creativity. "Ambitious, driven, passion, design."I've had the chance to work for big brands, small brands, and unique customers. I had the opportunity to guide a few complete campaigns, big projects and small projects.In high school, I had already started with studies in Product Design. In my free time I do illustrative work, stay up to date about all new trends and technology in design, and keep on evolving by taking online courses for example on UX & webdesign, and others. I keep challenging myself on all fronts as it is important to keep on growing.I fell in love with the art of strategical branding, developing brands to their finest form. Visual communication and design are my passion. I find myself creative as well as venturous and perfectionistic.

Ingredient Glossary
 
We are proud of the ingredients in our products and list them on every label, as well as share additional information below. Our products are specifically formulated to be safe for use in and around the home with family, children and pets. We work hard to ensure our products have the very best combination of ingredients—combinations that not only work hard on your daily dirt and grime, but that fill your home with garden-inspired scents.
We make intelligent, responsible raw material choices, and whenever possible, obtain materials from renewable plant resources such as coconut, corn, soy or olive. At times we choose not to use a plant-derived material for reasons of efficacy, consistency and safety.
Our products do not contain ammonia, chlorine, glycol solvents, parabens, phthalates, formaldehyde, artificial colorants, phosphates or petroleum distillates.
We do not test our products on animals, nor are our products made with animal-derived ingredients.
Our packaging is recyclable and we use at least 25% post-consumer plastic in our bottles.
We manufacture according to exacting personal care standards in a cosmetic-grade cGMP facility. cGMP is an abbreviation for the term "current Good Manufacturing Practice", which refers to FDA regulations regarding the manufacturing, testing, and quality control of pharmaceutical and food products.
All suppliers of Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day ingredients derived from Palm Oil are members of RSPO (Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil). Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day supports sustainable practices of eco-sensitive areas throughout Asia, Africa and South America like the Brazilian rain forests.

Leaping Bunny Program




Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day is a member of the Leaping Bunny Program, an internationally recognized campaign in North America and the European Union to eliminate cosmetics, personal care and household product testing on animals. The Coalition for Consumer Information in Cosmetics' (CICC) and the Leaping Bunny Program administers a cruelty-free standard that provides the best assurance that no animal testing is used in any phase of product development by the company, its laboratories, or suppliers through clear product labeling. The Leaping Bunny logo serves as a symbol of the approval of participating animal protection groups around the world.  Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day is a certified cruelty-free company for our no animal testing policy. We do not test our products or ingredients on animals, nor are our products made with animal-derived ingredients. We make intelligent, responsible raw material choices, and whenever possible, obtain materials from renewable plant resources such as coconut, palm, corn, soy or olive. At times we choose not to use a plant-derived material for reasons of efficacy, consistency and safety. Examples of these choices are primarily around our preservative system and ingredients in some of our fragrance compositions. Safety is always the first consideration when evaluating all raw materials. For more information, contact Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day.   
Our Take On Non-Toxic & Product Testing:
In order to include a claim on our product that it is "non-toxic"—a term that must be approved by regulatory agencies before it can be used on packaging—animal testing is required. Because we do not test on animals, we cannot claim that our product is "non-toxic". A toxicologist reviews all of our formulations against a mathematical model for safety assessment. When used as directed, our products are safe for use around children and pets.
