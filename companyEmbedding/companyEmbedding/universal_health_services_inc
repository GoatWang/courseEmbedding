Alan B. Miller, who currently serves as the company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, founded Universal Health Services, Inc. in 1979 after he engineered a financial turnaround of American Medicorp, only to lose the control of the company in a hostile takeover by Humana.

Controversies[edit]
Hospital licenses[edit]
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) threatened the Rancho Springs Medical Center (Murrieta) and Inland Valley Regional Medical Center (Wildomar) in California with decertification in June 2010 while the State of California warned of a possible hospital license revocation.[37] Universal Health Services implemented a program to address all concerns and in November 2011, the two hospitals passed a CMS Certification Survey.[38] As a result, CMS rescinded its termination notice and the California Department of Public Health withdrew its license revocation notice.
Allegations of noncompliance with same-sex visitation law[edit]
According to a petition started on change.org[39] by Terri-Ann Simonelli of Henderson, Nevada, Spring Valley Hospital (owned and operated by UHS) claimed that their policy required power of attorney for a same-sex partner to make medical decisions on behalf of their partner. If true, this would seemingly violate new Department of Health and Human Services rules enabling same-sex partners to make said decisions, with or without power of attorney.
Fraudulent Medicaid claims[edit]
In September 2012, UHS and its subsidiaries, Keystone Education and Youth Services LLC and Keystone Marion LLC d/b/a Keystone Marion Youth Center agreed to pay over $6.9 million to resolve allegations that they submitted false and fraudulent claims to Medicaid. Between October 2004 and March 2010, the entities allegedly provided substandard psychiatric counseling and treatment to adolescents in violation of the Medicaid requirements. The United States alleged that UHS falsely represented Keystone Marion Youth Center as a residential treatment facility providing inpatient psychiatric services to Medicaid enrolled children, when in fact it was a juvenile detention facility. The United States further alleged that neither a medical director nor licensed psychiatrist provided the required direction for psychiatric services or for the development of initial or continuing treatment plans. The settlement further resolved allegations that the entities filed false records or statements to Medicaid when they filed treatment plans that falsely represented the level of services that would be provided to the patients.[40]
Buzzfeed investigation[edit]
On December 7, 2016, Buzzfeed published a report detailing questionable practices within UHS psychiatric facilities.[41] The report includes allegations of holding nonthreatening patients against their will, manipulative misinterpretation of patient testimonies to fit guidelines to involuntary confinement, aggressive staff layoffs and understaffing in hospitals, needless patient deaths due to understaffing and misprescription of medication, "violating a patient’s right to be discharged or holding a patient without the proper documentation", and unnecessary extension of stay times to the maximum Medicare payout. UHS denied the conclusions of the report;[42] its stock fell approximately 12% after publication.

Alan B. Miller, who currently serves as the company’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, founded Universal Health Services, Inc. in 1979 after he engineered a financial turnaround of American Medicorp, only to lose the control of the company in a hostile takeover by Humana. The next day, Miller founded UHS with $3.2 million from venture capitalists and $750,000 put up by himself and several former American Medicorp employees who decided to follow Miller into his new venture.

Controversies[edit]
Hospital licenses[edit]
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) threatened the Rancho Springs Medical Center (Murrieta) and Inland Valley Regional Medical Center (Wildomar) in California with decertification in June 2010 while the State of California warned of a possible hospital license revocation.[37] Universal Health Services implemented a program to address all concerns and in November 2011, the two hospitals passed a CMS Certification Survey.[38] As a result, CMS rescinded its termination notice and the California Department of Public Health withdrew its license revocation notice.
Allegations of noncompliance with same-sex visitation law[edit]
According to a petition started on change.org[39] by Terri-Ann Simonelli of Henderson, Nevada, Spring Valley Hospital (owned and operated by UHS) claimed that their policy required power of attorney for a same-sex partner to make medical decisions on behalf of their partner. If true, this would seemingly violate new Department of Health and Human Services rules enabling same-sex partners to make said decisions, with or without power of attorney.
Fraudulent Medicaid claims[edit]
In September 2012, UHS and its subsidiaries, Keystone Education and Youth Services LLC and Keystone Marion LLC d/b/a Keystone Marion Youth Center agreed to pay over $6.9 million to resolve allegations that they submitted false and fraudulent claims to Medicaid. Between October 2004 and March 2010, the entities allegedly provided substandard psychiatric counseling and treatment to adolescents in violation of the Medicaid requirements. The United States alleged that UHS falsely represented Keystone Marion Youth Center as a residential treatment facility providing inpatient psychiatric services to Medicaid enrolled children, when in fact it was a juvenile detention facility. The United States further alleged that neither a medical director nor licensed psychiatrist provided the required direction for psychiatric services or for the development of initial or continuing treatment plans. The settlement further resolved allegations that the entities filed false records or statements to Medicaid when they filed treatment plans that falsely represented the level of services that would be provided to the patients.[40]
Buzzfeed investigation[edit]
On December 7, 2016, Buzzfeed published a report detailing questionable practices within UHS psychiatric facilities.[41] The report includes allegations of holding nonthreatening patients against their will, manipulative misinterpretation of patient testimonies to fit guidelines to involuntary confinement, aggressive staff layoffs and understaffing in hospitals, needless patient deaths due to understaffing and misprescription of medication, "violating a patient’s right to be discharged or holding a patient without the proper documentation", and unnecessary extension of stay times to the maximum Medicare payout. UHS denied the conclusions of the report;[42] its stock fell approximately 12% after publication.

Controversies[edit]
Hospital licenses[edit]
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) threatened the Rancho Springs Medical Center (Murrieta) and Inland Valley Regional Medical Center (Wildomar) in California with decertification in June 2010 while the State of California warned of a possible hospital license revocation.[37] Universal Health Services implemented a program to address all concerns and in November 2011, the two hospitals passed a CMS Certification Survey.[38] As a result, CMS rescinded its termination notice and the California Department of Public Health withdrew its license revocation notice.
Allegations of noncompliance with same-sex visitation law[edit]
According to a petition started on change.org[39] by Terri-Ann Simonelli of Henderson, Nevada, Spring Valley Hospital (owned and operated by UHS) claimed that their policy required power of attorney for a same-sex partner to make medical decisions on behalf of their partner. If true, this would seemingly violate new Department of Health and Human Services rules enabling same-sex partners to make said decisions, with or without power of attorney.
Fraudulent Medicaid claims[edit]
In September 2012, UHS and its subsidiaries, Keystone Education and Youth Services LLC and Keystone Marion LLC d/b/a Keystone Marion Youth Center agreed to pay over $6.9 million to resolve allegations that they submitted false and fraudulent claims to Medicaid. Between October 2004 and March 2010, the entities allegedly provided substandard psychiatric counseling and treatment to adolescents in violation of the Medicaid requirements. The United States alleged that UHS falsely represented Keystone Marion Youth Center as a residential treatment facility providing inpatient psychiatric services to Medicaid enrolled children, when in fact it was a juvenile detention facility. The United States further alleged that neither a medical director nor licensed psychiatrist provided the required direction for psychiatric services or for the development of initial or continuing treatment plans. The settlement further resolved allegations that the entities filed false records or statements to Medicaid when they filed treatment plans that falsely represented the level of services that would be provided to the patients.[40]
Buzzfeed investigation[edit]
On December 7, 2016, Buzzfeed published a report detailing questionable practices within UHS psychiatric facilities.[41] The report includes allegations of holding nonthreatening patients against their will, manipulative misinterpretation of patient testimonies to fit guidelines to involuntary confinement, aggressive staff layoffs and understaffing in hospitals, needless patient deaths due to understaffing and misprescription of medication, "violating a patient’s right to be discharged or holding a patient without the proper documentation", and unnecessary extension of stay times to the maximum Medicare payout. UHS denied the conclusions of the report;[42] its stock fell approximately 12% after publication.

Controversies[edit]
Hospital licenses[edit]
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) threatened the Rancho Springs Medical Center (Murrieta) and Inland Valley Regional Medical Center (Wildomar) in California with decertification in June 2010 while the State of California warned of a possible hospital license revocation.[37] Universal Health Services implemented a program to address all concerns and in November 2011, the two hospitals passed a CMS Certification Survey.[38] As a result, CMS rescinded its termination notice and the California Department of Public Health withdrew its license revocation notice.
Allegations of noncompliance with same-sex visitation law[edit]
According to a petition started on change.org[39] by Terri-Ann Simonelli of Henderson, Nevada, Spring Valley Hospital (owned and operated by UHS) claimed that their policy required power of attorney for a same-sex partner to make medical decisions on behalf of their partner. If true, this would seemingly violate new Department of Health and Human Services rules enabling same-sex partners to make said decisions, with or without power of attorney.
Fraudulent Medicaid claims[edit]
In September 2012, UHS and its subsidiaries, Keystone Education and Youth Services LLC and Keystone Marion LLC d/b/a Keystone Marion Youth Center agreed to pay over $6.9 million to resolve allegations that they submitted false and fraudulent claims to Medicaid. Between October 2004 and March 2010, the entities allegedly provided substandard psychiatric counseling and treatment to adolescents in violation of the Medicaid requirements. The United States alleged that UHS falsely represented Keystone Marion Youth Center as a residential treatment facility providing inpatient psychiatric services to Medicaid enrolled children, when in fact it was a juvenile detention facility. The United States further alleged that neither a medical director nor licensed psychiatrist provided the required direction for psychiatric services or for the development of initial or continuing treatment plans. The settlement further resolved allegations that the entities filed false records or statements to Medicaid when they filed treatment plans that falsely represented the level of services that would be provided to the patients.[40]
Buzzfeed investigation[edit]
On December 7, 2016, Buzzfeed published a report detailing questionable practices within UHS psychiatric facilities.[41] The report includes allegations of holding nonthreatening patients against their will, manipulative misinterpretation of patient testimonies to fit guidelines to involuntary confinement, aggressive staff layoffs and understaffing in hospitals, needless patient deaths due to understaffing and misprescription of medication, "violating a patient’s right to be discharged or holding a patient without the proper documentation", and unnecessary extension of stay times to the maximum Medicare payout. UHS denied the conclusions of the report;[42] its stock fell approximately 12% after publication.

Careers at UHS


Notification of recruiting scam using the UHS name:
It has been brought to our attention that a handful of cases have occurred around the country where scammers using the UHS name have attempted to lure unsuspecting job seekers into an arrangement whereby they would be asked to send money in exchange for a job with the company. This is a scam targeting job seekers and the individuals involved are not representatives of UHS.
If you are the victim of such a scam, we ask that you:

Notify the UHS Compliance Department at 1-800-852-3449
Notify local law enforcement authorities, the recruiting website and Google, being certain to include the email address of those who you were corresponding with
If you receive any checks DO NOT cash them. Instead, contact the Bank and inform them that you believe that you have received a fraudulent check and want to report it

Universal Health Services, Inc. Announces Date For Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Release And Conference Call


Jul 10, 2017 8:00 AM EDT









Universal Health Services Becomes #194 Most Shorted S&P 500 Component, Replacing LyondellBasell Industries
The most recent short interest data has been released for the 06/15/2017 settlement date, and we here at Dividend Channel like to sift through this fresh data and order the underlying components of the S&P 500 by "days to cover." There are a number of ways to look at short data, for example the total number of shares short; but one metric that we find particularly useful is the "days to cover" metric because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares typically traded. The number of shares short is then compared to the average daily volume, in order to calculate the total number of trading days it would take to close out all of the open short positions if every share traded represented a short position being closed.
