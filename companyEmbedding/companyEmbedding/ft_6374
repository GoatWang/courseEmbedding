Product Overview





			            Great basements start with a great foundation. DRIcore Subfloor R+ is the perfect solution to create a warm and dry living space without any compromise. DRIcore Subfloor R+ combines high density Oriented Strand Board (OSB) and Extruded Polystyrene (XPS). With an R-Value of 3, DRIcore raises the temperature of finished flooring by up to 5.6 degree C/10.6 degree F. Enjoy a warm, comfortable basement for years to come. XPS' closed-cell structure resists moisture and maintains R-value. Creating a Warm and Dry Basement has Never Been this Easy. DRIcore panels keep your basement comfortable and cozy throughout the entire year. The air gap encourages constant air flow and evaporation/re-absorption of surface moisture emitted from your basement concrete floor.
			        

Panels provide an easy, ready-to-use wood subfloor to add your favorite finished floor
Raises finished floor temperatures by 5.6 degree C/10.6 degree F (R=3)
DRIcore Subfloor R+ panels create a soft comfortable foundation for your finished flooring
Panels improve sound absorption

            Any plans to sell it in stores?
        


Asked by: Eugene

            Not sure who answered this question, but I saw these DriCore panels in my local Home Depot just this past weekend (Maryland). I even took a photo of it so that I could remember what it was.. still have it on my phone - so SOME HD's likely carry it.

Went in very easy, and instantly made the the basement more comfortable. If your basement has a sump pump pit, I would recommend doubling up on the quantity of shims they recommend or you will find yourself making more trips to get more.

I have used this in 3 rooms that have concrete slabs for the floor. It is perfect to use as a subfloor beneath radiant heating pads and a floating, click-style floor above. The Dricore Aspen Panels transform the rooms from cold-floored, echo-y rooms into warm, cozy living spaces in a day's time. They go down very easily and nest together into a unified subfloor with no problems. I plan to keep using it until I have transformed my whole slab-on-grade house into comfortable rooms with warm floors.
