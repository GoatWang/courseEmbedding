Why This Gold Miner's Shares Rose 16% in June While Gold Prices Were Falling
NovaGold Resources reported good news that allowed it to buck the broader precious metals downtrend.











                Reuben Gregg Brewer
            

                (TMFReubenGBrewer)



            
            Jul 7, 2017 at 10:18AM
            
            





What happened
Gold miner NovaGold Resources Inc. (NYSEMKT:NG) saw its shares advance 16% in June -- which could be viewed as somewhat odd, since most precious metals miners ended the month in negative territory. For example, industry giant Newmont Mining (NYSE: NEM) was down about 5%, roughly tracking the downtick in the price of gold. But NovaGold's stock gains largely came after June 22, when it made a joint announcement with Barrick Gold (NYSE:ABX).
The big news was that Barrick and NovaGold's 50/50 Donlin Gold joint venture was making good progress in developing what has the potential to be one of the world's largest pure-play gold mines. There are a number of things to like about this project, which NovaGold CEO Greg Lang explained in the release: "Donlin Gold's size, grade, production profile, exploration potential, mine life, community support and jurisdictional safety render it a unique asset in the gold industry."

So what
For the roughly $18 billion market cap Barrick, this is a nice project, to be sure. (Barrick's shares were down around 4% in June.) Joint ventures like this are a way for the giant to expand without taking on all the risks of developing new projects. But for $1.4 billion market cap NovaGold, it's a huge deal. NovaGold's primary assets are its 50% stake in Donlin Gold and a 50% stake in the Galore Creek project, which is expected to produce gold, silver, and copper. In other words, this miner isn't currently bringing any gold (or other metals) out of the ground. It needs these two projects to work if it hopes to shift from burning cash to generating it.  
So the stock price advance after the release was all about investors reacting positively to the news that one of NovaGold's two key projects looks like it's getting closer to actually producing gold.





Now what
There's no question that NovaGold shareholders got some very good news in June. That said, NovaGold really remains most appropriate for aggressive gold investors since it's currently burning through cash as it works to complete the two joint venture mining projects mentioned above. Although the Donlin project appears to be making good progress, until gold starts coming out of the ground, there's always a risk that something could go wrong. If you are willing to make a wager that everything will work out well, however, NovaGold is worth a deep dive.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the NOVAGOLD Second Quarter 2017 Conference Call and Webcast. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conversation is being recorded.
I would now like to introduce your host for today’s conference call Miss Melanie Hennessey. Vice President, Corporate Communication. Ma'am.
Melanie Hennessey
Thank you, Vince. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased that you are with us today for NOVAGOLD's second quarter financial results and also to hear an update on the permitting and drill program at Donlin Gold as well as latest activities at Galore Creek. On today’s call, we have Greg Lang, NOVAGOLD's President and CEO; and David Ottewell, NOVAGOLD's Vice President and CFO.
At the end of the formal part of the presentation, we will take questions both by phone and by e-mail. Before we get started, I would like to remind our listeners that our materials do contain forward-looking information and projections that may differ from our actual results. Please refer to the risks and uncertainties disclosed in our annual report filed on Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2016 and also other NOVAGOLD reports and documents filed on SEDAR and EDGAR.
With that, I have the pleasure of introducing Greg Lang, NOVOGOLD's President and CEO. Greg?
Greg Lang
Thank you, Melanie. Good morning, everyone. Today, we will be reviewing our second quarter results and providing an update on our two projects. Our 50% owned flagship asset, Donlin Gold continues to progress through permitting and is poised to become one of the largest producers in the gold industry. Galore Creek, a 50% partnership with Teck, is one of the largest undeveloped copper deposits in Canada.
During the second quarter, Donlin Gold continued to work with the Army Corps of Engineers and other cooperating agencies to ensure that all the required information for the final EIS was delivered in a timely and complete fashion. The Corps has scheduled to issue the final EIS in early 2018. Donlin Gold also advanced other major state and federal permit applications and approvals. The Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety Administration published a public notice initiating that comment period on the request for a permit to construct the natural gas pipeline. This comment period closed in June with no substantive comments received.
The Alaska Department of Environmental Quality concluded the comment period for the air quality permit in May and again no substantive comments were received. Several other major state permit applications were also filed in the second quarter such as the integrated waste management permit and the water discharge permit. It's very encouraging to see that these permitting activities remain very much on track.
We're thrilled to be advancing the optimization efforts with our partner as shown on Slide 6. The recently announced drill program will capitalize on the flexibility found in Donlin Gold's unique characteristics of large size, superior grade and strong exploration potential. On the basis of what we know now about the structural controls and the evaluations done to date, plus what we know from the original feasibility study, grade is clearly on our side.
As part of the ongoing optimization work, more selective mining methods, has been identified as an opportunity for improvement. Additional structural data collection will enhance our understanding of the targeted mineralized zones. This opportunity is sufficiently encouraging that the partners have increased the Donlin Gold budget this year by 40% and have resumed drilling after seven years to collect additional data that will validate the structural interpretations and support other ongoing optimization work.

As noted in the quotes on Slide 7, our joint effort is to build the best-in-class, not to mention, largest pure gold mine in the world. But also to do extensively in terms of economics and closely related to that timing, so that when Donlin will be built only when it will benefit our and Barrick shareholders and all other stakeholders. Patience had supported us to potentially have it all. The optimization studies are looking good enough for us to spend some additional money. We clearly have a large and remarkable ore body with grades already more than two times the industry average, that’s a tremendous advantage when one is laying out the optimal development for a big mine.
Yet both NOVAGOLD and Barrick are striving to do better and optimize its developments that it can be among the largest producers, but with lower upfront capital. Many of the inputs into the feasibility study were at peak prices, but there are opportunities beyond that for reduction in capital cost through third-party participation in our infrastructure and the leasing of mining equipment. With reduced upfront capital cost and exceptional exploration upside, our aim is sustaining our production profile as one of the largest gold producers in the world for decades to come. This is a remarkable objective, but that’s where we're heading with this work. We view Donlin Gold as an ore body that will keep on giving, and the alignment between the two companies, has simply never been better.
Moving to Slide 8, we've have long believed that in order to maintain a social license to operate, a company must have a thorough understanding and respect for the language, values and culture of the people in the region where our projects are located. Our work in the region, over the last twenty years, has been critical in building a foundation of broad community support. In the second quarter, Donlin Gold continued village meetings across the Y-K region. Donlin was also returning as a principal sponsor and volunteer at the 45th Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.
I would like to congratulate all the mushers who participated in this year's race with special recognition to Pete Kaiser, who is from the region near the Donlin Gold project and finished in the top ten. Donlin also supported Aniak's 4th Annual Academic Decathlon and Career Fair as well as other activities in the region. At Galore Creek, we continue to support various local Tahltan community initiatives.
I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, David Ottewell. Dave?
David Ottewell
Thank you, Greg. Turning to Slide 9, our share of Donlin Gold and Galore Creek funding totaled 3. (sic) [3.1] million for the second quarter as expected. For the full year, we expect to spend approximately 14 million to fund Donlin Gold and 2 million to fund Galore Creek. Our forecasted spending for the full year at Donlin Gold has increased by 4 million as a result of the recently announced drill program.
Slide 10 highlights our second quarter operating performance. For the quarter, we reported a 7.6 million operating loss and an 8.5 million net loss as expected and similar to the prior year quarter. The operating loss and net loss for the first six months were also consistent with the prior year, as our activities continue to focus on Donlin Gold permitting.
NOVAGOLD's cash flow highlights are outlined on Slide 11. During the second quarter of 2017, we spent 4.7 million of which 3.1 million was used to fund our share of the Donlin Gold and Galore Creek project, and 1.5 million was used for administrative costs net of working capital and interest. We ended the quarter with cash and term deposits of 93.5 million.
Finally on Slide 12, we've increased our 2017 budget from 23 million to 27 million including our 4 million share of the drill program at Donlin Gold. We expect to end the year with approximately 78 million in cash and term deposits.

Greg, back to you.
Greg Lang
Thank you, Dave. I'll quickly recap the attributes that make the Donlin project unique and why we have focused this company solely on Donlin. In terms of size, Donlin is an immense endowment. Its size and production profile clearly distinguish it from its peers.
On Slide 14 the grade, Donlin is a high-grade open pit mine. Many new mines have been built on grades of about a 1 gram. Donlin is better than twice those grades and it's the grade where the industry was 10 years ago. Donlin will be a large scale producer. As envisioned in the feasibility study, we'll produce 1.5 million ounces in its first five years followed by decades of an average of 1 million ounces a year. This is substantially bigger than any of the other emerging producers.
On Slide 16, the reserve pit as shown in the white border on the left hand side of the diagram contains the currently defined 39 million ounces of measured and indicated resources at Donlin Gold. When the time is right, we will tap into Donlin's Gold potential along strike and at depth, and test other targets as shown on the diagram at Dome, Quartz and Snow.
Donlin has positive returns in the current price environment as highlighted on Slide 17. These returns become robust as the bull market in gold resumes. One of the unique attributes that Donlin has is that it's on private land owned by two Alaska-native corporations. They've been vocal advocates for the project through our permitting. They're supporting our plans and encouraging us to go forward with the project. We're nearing the completion of permitting. Permitting in the United States is a rigorous disciplined project. In the last few years, we've spent advancing through permitting is nothing in the context of a mine whose life is measured in decades.
Our Galore project on its own is a substantial endowment of copper gold and silver and it is among the highest grade undeveloped copper deposits in the world, and when the time is right, we'll sell it to further strengthen our balance sheet to advance Donlin. As evidenced by our top shareholders, we're in institutional quality investment in the gold developers. Many of our top shareholders have been with the Company for years and we're appreciative of their continued support.
To wrap it up, for the last few years, we've been focusing our resources on one unwavering strategy to advance and de-risk Donlin Gold in order to provide the most attractive ways for our shareholders to profit, from the next phase of the long-term bull market in gold. I'm proud to report that year-after-year, we've been successful in executing on our stated objectives without interruption. We believe that this is the most important gold development project in the world and we're making material and indeed exciting progress on all fronts.
Operator, we can now open the line for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from John Bridges of JP Morgan. Your line is open.
John Bridges
I just wanted to -- good to hear that you're drilling up presumably the higher grade targets for this optimization study. Just wondering if you can give us a bit more detail on what you're trying to do with that and what sort of shape of projects you might come up with?
Greg Lang
John, first off I love drilling, it's one of the most exciting activities that the Company can undertake and it's great to be doing it after a long break. We've been working with Barrick in-depth on this project. It's really almost from the ground up understanding the geology, the mineralization controls and looking at various opportunities. Large scale mining operation inherently has higher dilution; with smaller mining equipment you can take advantage of the tighter structural controls. So, we've got some pretty exciting theories in that regard and the best way to test the theory is to get out and drill, and we're really sufficiently excited by the opportunity that in these rather capital challenged times we're willing to invest additional money, and we'll -- as the results come in, we'll certainly update everybody on what they mean to the project.

John Bridges
So is geotechnical drilling to figure out, if you can be more selective with the mining or more geology to find out where the high grades portions of the ore body exists?
Greg Lang
Yes, the program has multiple objectives, John. We'll be collecting additional geotechnical work, see if there's opportunities, for example, steeper pit walls. We will be testing some of the structures and even collecting additional hydrologic data. So, it's a pretty broad program just targeted on enhancing our understanding in the ore body and flushing out some of the opportunities that may lead to enhanced grade.
John Bridges
And it's good to hear that the permitting is advancing and according to plan with no objections, so that's great, and congratulations. And look forward to hearing Q3 and maybe some drill results? Can you give us some information along the way or are you going to keep it all close to your chest?
Greg Lang
Well, we'll work with our partner on the timing of releasing the data John, but we're certainly glad to be drilling.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from David Luchenski [ph] an investor. Your line is open, sir.
Unidentified Analyst
Greg, just a few questions. It's hard for me to understand how NOVAGOLD's market cap is 1.4 billion, and yet you own an asset that's worth 20 billion, and how the market doesn't recognize that. It means you're undervalued by a factor of 15, 18 times, how do you feel about that?
Greg Lang
Well, I would be very pleased if you were - if that was indeed the case. I think gold developers are valued I think based on the assets of their gold in the ground and the quality of their deposits. When I look at our peer groups, I think we're appropriately valued now. But I think certainly as we continue to advance the project and further de-risk it through permitting and ultimately take the project forward, I think you're correct, the value of our shares will multiply as we become -- get through permitting and into development. And certainly as a producer with endowment of over 20 million assets, I think there's certainly a room to run for the shares.
Unidentified Analyst
Yes, to me you're $25 stock all day long. The permit, when do you expect -- I think on one of the previous conference calls you said the first quarter of 2018, is that your target?
Greg Lang
Yes, the Army Corps of Engineers, who is the lead federal agency, involved with the permitting, keeps an up-to-date website. You can look -- find the Donlin Gold EIS, and they have stated that they will publish the final EIS in March of next year and issue a record of decision, approximately three to four months later. So, we're -- give or take a year away from finishing up the federal permitting process. And while we're working our way through that is noted on the call, we're pursuing the other various state and federal permits that are necessary for the operation. But clearly the environmental impact study is the largest and most time consuming part of this process.
Unidentified Analyst
And another question, would you ever consider paying dividends in bullion instead of -- and that could be done through the intermediaries by having wholesale coin dealers, ship bullion to stockholders. Would you ever consider something like that?
Greg Lang
David, that's certainly an interesting idea and we're quite a ways from it, but…
Unidentified Analyst
I know I just invite you to think about it, that's all.
Greg Lang
When the time is right, we'd love to be a dividend paying company.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay, –here is the last question I have. Your legal department, I'm sure you've quite a few law firms involved. What is your opinion of the naked short, so they're down on the COMEX? In the past weeks, you've had -- you've had 4 billion of naked shorts dumped at market, not limit orders, market orders, and then you had within the last five days another 2 billion of naked shorts through the banks. Do you -- does that smell bad to you? It smells bad to me. I mean do you -- it seems like it's totally manipulated the price of gold. And with the prejudice to you and Barrick and everybody else, what is your opinion of that?

Greg Lang
Well, I -- over the last couple of months, we were part of the GDXJ and when they announced the rebalancing of the index, we certainly saw a lot of downward pressure on our stock and higher than normal volumes. I think with this GDXJ rebalancing behind us, just in the last week we're seeing shares trade in the pattern that we're used to seeing them trade, which is largely in concert with gold price and on news as the Company progresses through its projects.
Unidentified Analyst
But who [adopts] [ph] 6 billion at market, I mean most investors would have limit orders. I mean, it just -- what hedge fund or it just -- do you have any -- I guess here is my question, do you have any suspicion that the gold price is being artificially slammed because quite frankly, it's the only thermostat for foul play in the financial arena?
Greg Lang
David, we appreciate your thought-provoking questions, but as a matter of practice, we don't really comment on trading in our shares. And I do note, we're a fairly liquid stock and I think that invites high frequency trading. But I don't see anything sinister in any of it. It all looks, given our circumstances, pretty normal.
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] I see no other questions in queue. I'd like to turn it back to Mr. Lang for closing remarks.
Greg Lang
All right, well, everyone, thank you for joining our call this morning, and we look forward to keeping you update as we progress with our drilling and permitting activities. Have a good day.
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

                NOVAGOLD is a well-financed precious metals company engaged in the exploration and development of mineral properties in North America. The company is focused on permitting and developing its 50%-owned flagship property, Donlin Gold, one of the world's largest known undeveloped gold deposits.    The Donlin Gold project commenced permitting in 2012, a clearly defined process expected to take approximately five years. NOVAGOLD is also committed to maximizing value of its non-core assets and is currently exploring opportunities to sell its interest in the Galore Creek copper-gold-silver project in British Columbia, Canada.

		"A few months ago I put out a brief report out on our blog and initiated a buy recommendation on NOVAGOLD Resources Inc. at $4.05 US. . .the share price is up about 23% since then($5.20 now) but I believe the upside on this stock is enormous. . .this is a stock that you can comfortably own IN SIZE because of its mature stage of development, liquidity, and pedigree; i'll go out on a limb here.....NG will hit $50 per share within 5 years. . .you heard it here first!. . .NG joins MUX as one of my top 3 holdings with market values over $1 billion."
		
		












  
      Raj Ray, National Bank Financial
  

(1/25/17)

		
		"We view NOVAGOLD as a long-dated option on the gold price that offers investors long-term exposure to a large-scale open-pit deposit in a stable jurisdiction which could assume significance if our forecast for industry-wide production decline play out over the next few years. . .we expect gold developers to remain in focus as investors look for a solution for looming production declines in the gold space. . .we contend that a favorable construction decision on the Donlin project will depend on the project among other things on a sustained period of strong gold price. . .as a result we continue to maintain Sector Perform rating."

The  Gold Report Interview with Doug Groh 

(10/18/16)

		
		"NOVAGOLD is in a unique position in that it has a 50% interest in a huge gold deposit in the Donlin Gold project, located in Alaska, that offers investors not just a sizable resource but a favorable jurisdiction where a mining company can operate. Alaska is resource-development friendly. NOVAGOLD's management has been very pragmatic and studious in their development of Donlin. I think it's going to offer investors a very good return over the long term. We're very much on board with its plans and activities as it goes through the process of permitting and developing Donlin. NOVAGOLD is going through the permitting process for the Donlin Gold project in a very methodical way, while also making sure the community is informed and involved in the project. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is overseeing the process for the Environmental Impact Statement and is now reviewing the comments from the public comment period. Various permits are also being advanced with state and federal agencies�such as water discharge, wetlands, air quality, water use and fish habitat permits and other approvals that will give them right-of-way access. Meanwhile, NOVAGOLD has been very engaged in community outreach among local stakeholders. The work and benefit from that effort cannot be underestimated. NOVAGOLD has made it a priority, and rightly so, to involve the local community from early on in the project. That's a good thing for investors waiting to realize the tremendous value that resides in the Donlin Gold resource with its 39 million ounces. And while most of management's effort to realize value is focused on the Donlin Gold project, it appears to us that investors have totally discounted NOVAGOLD�S 50% interest in Galore Creek, which could someday be one of Canada's largest and lowest-cost copper mines."

      Raj Ray, National Bank Financial
  

(10/4/16)

		
		"Permitting for NovaGold Resources Inc.'s Donlin Gold continues as EIS advances; NG announced its fiscal Q3/16 (quarter-ended Aug. 31st) results. Permitting activities for its Donlin Gold project (50% NG, 50% Barrick) in Alaska continue to move forward with the completion of the comment period on the draft environmental impact statement at the end of August 2016. . .NG continues to maintain a strong financial position with cash and term deposits of ~US$108.5M at the end of fiscal Q3/16 (US$112M in Q2/166."
		
		









  Jonathan Ratner, Financial Post
(9/27/16)

		
		"NovaGold Resources Inc. was upgraded to overweight from neutral at J.P. Morgan in anticipation of the Vancouver-based miner receiving permits for its 50 per cent-owned Donlin Gold project next year; analyst John Bridges told clients that with project partner Barrick Gold Corp.'s production trending downward, it will be motivated to push ahead. . .'This should position NovaGold as the 50 per cent owner of one of the few large gold projects,' Bridges said in a research note."
		
		












  
      Raj Ray, National Bank Financial
  

(6/28/16)

		
		"Permitting activities for NOVAGOLD's Donlin Gold project in Alaska continue to move forward. . .the company continues to maintain a strong financial position with cash and term deposits of ~US$112M at the end of fiscal Q2/16, expected to be more than sufficient to complete permitting of Donlin Gold. The strong cash balance also provides optionality protection over the next few years. . .We are maintaining a Sector Perform rating and target price of Cdn$8.00."
		
		









  Jefferson Research 

(4/1/16)

		
		"NOVAGOLD is showing strong earnings quality, operating efficiency and balance sheet quality, and valuation suggests a lower amount of price risk. . .the company's stock deserves a Buy rating. . .the primary reason the overall rating improved during the last quarter was an improvement in the balance sheet rating due to strengthening receivable and inventory positions. Another factor in the upgraded overall rating was an improved operating efficiency rating."
		
		









  
      John Bridges, J.P. Morgan 
  

(2/28/16)

		
		"Investors in NOVAGOLD should be well positioned to derive a lot of value from the successful and timely development of Donlin Gold."
		
		












  
      John Hathaway, Tocqueville Asset Management L.P.
  

(2/28/16)

		
		"An important aspect about NOVAGOLD that I am quite bullish about: the environment in which Donlin gold would be nearing production; what I mean is the current atmosphere of low gold discovery rates, particularly in safe jurisdictions. Shrinking mine lives of existing operations and the ever-increasing complexities of putting new mines into production could be hugely beneficial to NOVAGOLD as it gets closer to bringing its new long-life, low-cost gold mine into production."
		
		









  Jefferson Research 

(2/26/16)

		
		"The earnings quality for NG remains strongest. . .the company's quality of net income earnings is extremely high. . .the operating efficiency rating for NOVAGOLD improved from strong to strongest."
		
		












The Gold Report Interview with Bob Moriarty 

(2/18/16)

		
		"NOVAGOLD went from $0.09/share in 2001 to $1/share six months later when nobody wanted to own resource stocks. It went up 1,000%, and then it went on to go up 20 times higher again. It went up 20,000%. The person running NOVAGOLD, the chairman of the board, is Thomas Kaplan from New York. He's one of the brightest guys in the industry. . .you're buying really excellent management."

      Marc Davis, BNW News
  

(2/15/16)

		
		"[That company] isn't the only instance of top-tier gold mining developers that have rich assets, proven management and healthy treasuries. NOVAGOLD Resources has two company-maker deposits in Alaska with combined resources of over 31 Moz gold." 
		
		









  Jefferson Research 

(2/5/16)

		
		"NOVAGOLD is showing strong earnings quality, operating efficiency and balance sheet quality, and valuation suggests a lower amount of price risk. . .the company's stock deserves a Buy rating. The primary reason the overall rating improved during the last quarter was an improvement in the balance sheet rating due to strengthening receivable and inventory positions. Another factor in the upgraded overall rating was an improved operating efficiency rating."
		
		












The  Gold Report Interview with Bob Moriarty 

(11/30/15)

		
		"One company that Bob Moriarty thinks gets the 'buy low, sell high' idea is NOVAGOLD. 'This was a $0.09 stock in the summer of 2001. The company did a joint venture deal in Alaska with Placer Dome that required it to spend $6M in eight years. NOVAGOLD did all the work in 18 months and ended with a $20 stock. That's exactly the kind of aggressive company you want to look for right now,' Moriarty says."

The Gold Report Interview with John Hathaway 

(10/26/15)

		
		"NOVAGOLD: Permitting is taking place. It's definitely a sign of progress. It is not a market-moving kind of event, but it's necessary. I look at NOVAGOLD as an option on the gold price. We know it has the ability to produce half a million ounces a year. That's enormous. If you went to UBS or Morgan Stanley and tried to get a 10-year call on gold prices, first of all, they'd laugh at you, but if they did actually give you a quote, it would be very expensive. If you compare that to what you get with NOVAGOLD, it's a perpetual call on the gold price with what could be one of the world-class gold mining assets, but it won't get built until the gold price is right.

  Jefferson Research 

(10/16/15)

		
		"NOVAGOLD is showing strong earnings quality and operating efficiency, and valuation suggests a lower amount of price risk. . .with an adjusted net income of �$5.0M in the last quarter that was greater than the reported number, the company's quality of net income earnings is extremely high. . .the rating for NOVAGOLD is already a Strongest, the best possible rating. . .the operating efficiency rating for NOVAGOLD remains Strong. . .the stock's valuation rating remains a Least Risk."
		
		









  
      Stephen Walker, RBC Capital Markets
  

(10/6/15)

		
		"NovaGold still expects to file the Donlin draft environmental impact statement (EIS) around year-end 2015, which will trigger a five-month period for public comment before the final EIS is submitted. . .we forecast sufficient financial capacity for the company to fund the Donlin gold project through receipt of the final EIS permit in 2017."
		
		









  Jefferson Research 

(8/21/15)

		
		"NOVAGOLD is showing strong earnings quality, operating efficiency and balance sheet quality, and valuation suggests a lower amount of price risk. . .when combined, the company deserves a Buy rating." 
		
		









  
      Stephen Walker, RBC Capital Markets
  

(7/29/15)

		
		"We have updated our estimates and valuation ahead of the expected filing of the draft environmental impact statement for Donlin Gold at year-end 2015. We maintain our view that NOVAGOLD offers investors an attractive long-term option on gold for its world-class Donlin gold project in Alaska and we have increased our price target to $5/share from $4.30/share." 
		
		









  Jefferson Research 

(7/24/15)

		
		"NOVAGOLD is showing strong earnings quality, operating efficiency and balance sheet quality, and valuation suggests a lower amount of price risk, but cash flow quality is weak. When combined, the company deserves a Buy rating. The cash flow quality rating declined the most during the recent quarter. Though this dimension and all of the others were either down or unchanged at best, it was not sufficient to lower the overall rating."

Buy/Sell Signals for ClubCorp Holdings, Inc. (MYCC) and NovaGold Resources Inc. (NG)

By Luis Castro -   July 18, 2017 



 








Share on Facebook
Tweet on Twitter










Shares of ClubCorp Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:MYCC) are making a strong comeback as they have jumped 57.87% since bottoming out at $10.8 on Nov. 04, 2016. Meanwhile, due to an ongoing pressure which caused a decline of almost 0% in the past five days, the stock price is now up 18.82% so far on the year — still in strong territory. In this case, shares are down -3.13% from $17.6 , the 52-week high touched on Feb. 22, 2017, and are keeping their losses at 17.02% for the past 12 months.
MYCC Target Price Reaches $19.13
 Brokerage houses, on average, are recommending investors to buy ClubCorp Holdings, Inc. (MYCC)’s shares projecting a $19.13 target price. Analysts‟ target price forecasts are a prediction of a stock‟s future price, generally over the 12 months following the release date (Asquith et al., 2005). This forecast is a point estimate that provides investors with a benchmark against which to directly compare stock price in the short run.Target prices made by analysts employed by large brokers, who have access to a greater resource pool, are more likely to be met over the 12-month forecast period.
 How Quickly ClubCorp Holdings, Inc. (MYCC)’s Sales Grew?
 MYCC’s revenue has grown at an average annualized rate of about 8.6% during the past five years. However, the company’s most recent quarter increase of 3% looks unattractive. The sales growth rate for a stock is a measure of how the stock’s sales per share (SPS) has grown over a specific period of time. It tells an investor how quickly a company is increasing its revenues. The sales growth rate helps investors determine how strong the overall growth-orientation is for a stock or portfolio.
NovaGold Resources Inc. Achieves Below-Average Profit Margin 





  The best measure of a company is its profitability, for without it, it cannot grow, and if it doesn’t grow, then its stock will trend downward. Increasing profits are the best indication that a company can pay dividends and that the share price will trend upward. Creditors will loan money at a cheaper rate to a profitable company than to an unprofitable one; consequently, profitable companies can use leverage to increase stockholders’ equity even more. Profitability ratios compare different accounts to see how efficiently a business is generating profits. These ratios show how well income is generated through operations, and are important to both creditors and investors. They help determine the company’s ability to continue operating. Currently, ClubCorp Holdings, Inc. net profit margin for the 12 months is at 0.44%. Comparatively, the peers have a net margin 12.3%, and the sector’s average is 11.83%. In that light, it seems in weak position compared to its peers and sector. The profit margin measures the amount of net income earned with each dollar’s worth of revenue. It shows the percentage of sales that remain after all of the company’s expenses have been paid. The higher the ratio, the better.
 NovaGold Resources Inc. (NYSE:NG) is another stock that is grabbing investors attention these days. Its shares have trimmed -37.83% since hitting a peak level of $7.27 on Aug. 02, 2016. Thanks to an increase of almost 11.33% in the past one month, the stock price is now with underperforming -0.88% so far on the year — still in weak zone. In this case, shares are 19.58% higher from $3.78, the worst price in 52 weeks suffered on May. 31, 2017, but are collecting gains at -11.37% for the past six months.
Analysts See NovaGold Resources Inc. 3.48% Above Current Levels 
 The good news is there’s still room for NovaGold Resources Inc. (NG) to grow. At recent closing price of $4.52, NG has a chance to add $3.48 or 76.99% in 52 weeks, based on mean target price ($8) placed by analysts.The analyst consensus opinion of 2 looks like a hold. It has a 36-month beta of 0.37 , so you might not be in for a bumpy ride.
 Are NovaGold Resources Inc. (NYSE:NG) Earnings Growing Rapidly?
 For the past 5 years, NovaGold Resources Inc.’s EPS growth has been nearly -18.1%. Sure, the percentage is discouraging but more headwinds are coming as looking out over a next 5-year period, analysts expect the company to see its earnings go down by 0%, annually.
Is NG Turning Profits into Returns?
 NovaGold Resources Inc. (NG)’s ROE is -11.02%, while industry’s is 0.46%. The average ROE for the sector stands at 14.54%. The return on equity (ROE), also known as return on investment (ROI), is the best measure of the return, since it is the product of the operating performance, asset turnover, and debt-equity management of the firm. If a firm can borrow money and use it to achieve a higher return than the cost of the debt, then the leveraging creates additional revenue that accrues to stockholders as increased equity.
 NovaGold Resources Inc.’s ROA is -8.14%, while industry’s average is 0.15%. As with any return, the higher this number the better. However, it, too, needs to be taken into the context of a company’s peer group as well as its sector. The average return on assets for companies in the same sector is 8.93. The return on assets (ROA) (aka return on total assets, return on average assets), is one of the most widely used profitability ratios because it is related to both profit margin and asset turnover, and shows the rate of return for both creditors and investors of the company. ROA shows how well a company controls its costs and utilizes its resources.

Donlin Gold[edit]
The Company's flagship asset is Donlin Gold Project in Alaska. NOVAGOLD and Barrick Gold each own 50% of the project. Project permitting began in 2012. Permitting is a clearly defined process which, if successful, can take 3-4 years or more. Donlin Gold is a substantial resource. In terms of size, grade, exploration potential, production profile and jurisdictional safety, it is regarded as one of the most significant undeveloped gold projects in the world. As per the Feasibility Study, Donlin Gold has the potential to produce more than 1M ounces of gold annually over a 27-year mine life. In July 2012, joint venture partner Barrick Gold announced that the Donlin project "no long meets its investment criteria." The substantial costs of bringing power to the remote site, and other development expenses, gave Barrick reason to rethink its investment in the project. The share price of NOVAGOLD dropped 23% on the news.[1][2]
Galore Creek[edit]
NOVAGOLD and Teck Resources each own 50% of the Galore Creek copper-gold-silver project located in northern British Columbia. According to the pre-feasibility study, Galore Creek mine has the potential to be the largest copper mine in Canada and in the top 5% of known gold deposits. Construction began on the project in 2007, but was halted in November of that year when a $3 billion cost overrun forced the partners to put the project on "care and maintenance". The increase more than doubled the estimated development cost of the project. The new estimate was attributed to cost increases for the tailings dam and water diversion structures.[3] NOVAGOLD indicated in 2010 that it was evaluating opportunities to sell all or a portion of its interest in Galore Creek and apply the proceeds toward the development of Donlin Gold. However, after the 2012 announcement concerning Donlin, NOVAGOLD has reevaluated its decision to sell Galore Creek.
Environmental responsibility and community relations[edit]
The company has stated that it is "Committed to responsible development and operating to the highest environmental standards...[and] acts with a long-term view, creating mutually beneficial relationships with our communities, employees, investors, partners and other people critical to our success and the economic development of Alaska."

Donlin Gold[edit]
The Company's flagship asset is Donlin Gold Project in Alaska. NOVAGOLD and Barrick Gold each own 50% of the project. Project permitting began in 2012. Permitting is a clearly defined process which, if successful, can take 3-4 years or more. Donlin Gold is a substantial resource. In terms of size, grade, exploration potential, production profile and jurisdictional safety, it is regarded as one of the most significant undeveloped gold projects in the world. As per the Feasibility Study, Donlin Gold has the potential to produce more than 1M ounces of gold annually over a 27-year mine life. In July 2012, joint venture partner Barrick Gold announced that the Donlin project "no long meets its investment criteria." The substantial costs of bringing power to the remote site, and other development expenses, gave Barrick reason to rethink its investment in the project. The share price of NOVAGOLD dropped 23% on the news.[1][2]
Galore Creek[edit]
NOVAGOLD and Teck Resources each own 50% of the Galore Creek copper-gold-silver project located in northern British Columbia. According to the pre-feasibility study, Galore Creek mine has the potential to be the largest copper mine in Canada and in the top 5% of known gold deposits. Construction began on the project in 2007, but was halted in November of that year when a $3 billion cost overrun forced the partners to put the project on "care and maintenance". The increase more than doubled the estimated development cost of the project. The new estimate was attributed to cost increases for the tailings dam and water diversion structures.[3] NOVAGOLD indicated in 2010 that it was evaluating opportunities to sell all or a portion of its interest in Galore Creek and apply the proceeds toward the development of Donlin Gold. However, after the 2012 announcement concerning Donlin, NOVAGOLD has reevaluated its decision to sell Galore Creek.
Environmental responsibility and community relations[edit]
The company has stated that it is "Committed to responsible development and operating to the highest environmental standards...[and] acts with a long-term view, creating mutually beneficial relationships with our communities, employees, investors, partners and other people critical to our success and the economic development of Alaska."

Donlin Gold[edit]
The Company's flagship asset is Donlin Gold Project in Alaska. NOVAGOLD and Barrick Gold each own 50% of the project. Project permitting began in 2012. Permitting is a clearly defined process which, if successful, can take 3-4 years or more. Donlin Gold is a substantial resource. In terms of size, grade, exploration potential, production profile and jurisdictional safety, it is regarded as one of the most significant undeveloped gold projects in the world. As per the Feasibility Study, Donlin Gold has the potential to produce more than 1M ounces of gold annually over a 27-year mine life. In July 2012, joint venture partner Barrick Gold announced that the Donlin project "no long meets its investment criteria." The substantial costs of bringing power to the remote site, and other development expenses, gave Barrick reason to rethink its investment in the project. The share price of NOVAGOLD dropped 23% on the news.[1][2]
Galore Creek[edit]
NOVAGOLD and Teck Resources each own 50% of the Galore Creek copper-gold-silver project located in northern British Columbia. According to the pre-feasibility study, Galore Creek mine has the potential to be the largest copper mine in Canada and in the top 5% of known gold deposits. Construction began on the project in 2007, but was halted in November of that year when a $3 billion cost overrun forced the partners to put the project on "care and maintenance". The increase more than doubled the estimated development cost of the project. The new estimate was attributed to cost increases for the tailings dam and water diversion structures.[3] NOVAGOLD indicated in 2010 that it was evaluating opportunities to sell all or a portion of its interest in Galore Creek and apply the proceeds toward the development of Donlin Gold. However, after the 2012 announcement concerning Donlin, NOVAGOLD has reevaluated its decision to sell Galore Creek.
Environmental responsibility and community relations[edit]
The company has stated that it is "Committed to responsible development and operating to the highest environmental standards...[and] acts with a long-term view, creating mutually beneficial relationships with our communities, employees, investors, partners and other people critical to our success and the economic development of Alaska."
