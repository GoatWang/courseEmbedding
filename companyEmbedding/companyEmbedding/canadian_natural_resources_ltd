Should You Buy Canadian Natural Resources Limited or Suncor Energy Inc. Today?

Joey Frenette | July 20, 2017 | More on:  CNQ SU CNQ SU








 




It’s tough to be a contrarian investor when it comes to Canada’ oil patch these days. Short-term losses can be expected, and there’s no real timeline as to when your shares may start appreciating. Canada’s energy sector is clouded by uncertainty, and many investors have simply scratched energy stocks off their radars.

Nobody likes uncertainty, and one could argue that the pessimism surrounding the oil sands is near an all-time high. The oil sands are a tough place to be right now, but the possibility of border taxes, carbon taxes, cleanup costs, and a prolonged weak oil price environment make…

It’s tough to be a contrarian investor when it comes to Canada’ oil patch these days. Short-term losses can be expected, and there’s no real timeline as to when your shares may start appreciating. Canada’s energy sector is clouded by uncertainty, and many investors have simply scratched energy stocks off their radars.
Nobody likes uncertainty, and one could argue that the pessimism surrounding the oil sands is near an all-time high. The oil sands are a tough place to be right now, but the possibility of border taxes, carbon taxes, cleanup costs, and a prolonged weak oil price environment make investing in Alberta’s oil patch seem like a dangerously risky feat.
You’re probably well aware of all the fear following Canada’s energy sector right now, but as Warren Buffett once said, “… be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” Fear is ridiculously high right now, but should you really follow the Oracle’s words of wisdom in the case of the Canadian energy sector? A lot of large-cap companies have lost well over half their value in a short span, and it only looks like the negative momentum is picking up.
Although oil prices have stabilized at the US$45-50 levels, the stocks of many oil companies are worse off than they were in the early part of last year, when oil prices were at lower levels. Is it really time to buy Canadian oil stocks? Or should you throw in the towel, like so many foreign investors have?
A safer way to invest in Canadian oil sands
If you want to bet on the oil sands without risking too much of your capital over the short to medium term, then it would be a wise choice to opt for two of Canada’s premier oil plays: Canadian Natural Resources Limited (TSX:CNQ)(NYSE:CNQ) and Suncor Energy Inc. (TSX:SU)(NYSE:SU).
Unlike most Canadian oil stocks that have lost over half their value over the course of a year, shares of Canadian Natural Resources and Suncor are only down around 18% and 15%, respectively, from their 52-week highs. Both companies have solid balance sheets when compared to peers and have the ability to pay a sustainable dividend. Suncor currently yields 3.4%, while Canadian Natural Resources yields 2.9% — both of which are unlikely to be cut, even if the lower oil price environment is here to stay.
Many other Canadian oil companies have slashed their dividends many times already. Some have cut their dividends entirely, but Suncor and Canadian Natural Resources are not on this path because both firms are operating in a more efficient manner than their peers.
Both companies made deals to beef up their oil sands assets with the hopes of “buying low,” but, remarkably, neither company is overwhelmed with debt since both are aware that oil prices may stay depressed for longer than originally expected.
Bottom line
There are many reasons to be bearish on the Canadian energy sector as a whole, especially since renewable sources of energy are the future. Renewables are coming, but it’s going to be a slow transition, so don’t rule out oil yet — even dirtier forms of oil like the oil sands.
If you’re a contrarian investor who’s intrigued by the oil sands, then you may want to ask yourself if you’re in it for the long term or if you just want a lottery ticket that may pay off in the short term in the form of a turnaround. Because if you’re not in it for the long run, you’re probably setting yourself up for disappointment.
If you’re a patient investor, then pick up shares of one or both companies and collect the bountiful dividend yields while you wait for the turnaround to happen.
Stay smart. Stay hungry. Stay Foolish.

Breakthrough IPO Receives Rare Endorsement

 




Why are over 15,130 well-positioned and in-the-know Canadian investors all counting down to two very specific days this month at 4 p.m.?

It has to do with an amazingly telling profit signal we’ve come to call a “Ground Floor Event” (even though it’s completely unrelated to an IPO)…
And one that’s made a few lucky investors who’ve paid close attention to under-the-radar events like these gains of 832%... 5,480%... and even 7,902% over the past 5 to 10 years. 
You can join the roughly 0.03% of Canadians who’ve already positioned themselves to capitalize on this next “Ground Floor Event” – but you must act soon…

Statoil ASASTO along with partners Eni SpA E and Petoro has discovered a small gas deposit in the Blamann well.
 The discovery, estimated to hold recoverable volumes of 1.5-3 billion standard cubic meters (BCM) which is about 10-20 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), lies between the Snøhvit and Goliat fields in the Barents Sea.
 Drilled in license PL 849, the well received Norway's Awards in Predefined Areas (APA) licensing round in 2016. Gas was found in a 23-meter column in the Stø formation, while no oil volumes were encountered.
 Located in the Hammerfest basin, the discovery lies about 21 kilometers southeast of the Snøhvit field.
 This represents the second discovery in Statoil's 2017 Barents Sea exploration campaign, subsequent to the Kayak oil discovery announced on Jul 3.
 Drilled by the "Songa Enabler" semisubmersible drilling rig, the well will be transferred to the Hoop area to drill the Gemini North prospect in license PL855, located northeast of the Wisting discovery.
 Being the operator of Blåmann license, the company holds 50%. Other partners include Eni and Petoro holding 30% and 20%, respectively.
 Statoil is also the operator of Gemini North (PL855) with an interest of 55%. Other partners include OMV and Petoro holding 25% and 20%, respectively.
 Shares of the company have gained 4.9% in the last three months compared with the Zacks categorized Oil & Gas - International Integrated industry's growth of 0.5%.
 Statoil is a Norway-based major international integrated oil and gas company. In recent times, the company has delivered strong exploration results, adding significantly to its resource base by making several high impact discoveries. The latest finds give Statoil access to new regions of Norway, Russia, Azerbaijan, Tanzania and Australia, which will ensure long-term growth.
 Statoil currently has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). Some better-ranked stocks in the same space are Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP BWP and Canadian Natural Resources Limited Ltd. CNQ . Both these stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here .

  For Immediate Release  Chicago, IL - July 17, 2017 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include Canadian Natural Resources Ltd.  (NYSE:  CNQ - Free Report   ), Suncor Energy Inc.  (NYSE:  SU - Free Report   ), Baker Hughes, a GE Company  (NYSE:  BHGE - Free Report   ), Petrobras  (NYSE:  PBR - Free Report   ) and Repsol S.A.  (OTCMKTS:  REPYY - Free Report   ). Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free .   Here are highlights from Friday's Analyst Blog:    Canadian Natural & 4 Other Great Large-Cap Energy     Stocks   Oil prices have gained almost 10% since falling to a ten-month low in late June. Plunging to $42 per barrel on June 21 and officially entering a bear market, the commodity was pushed down by the ongoing rebound in U.S. shale production, OPEC's slow progress toward rebalancing the market and restored output from exempted African producers Libya and Nigeria. Some feared more pessimism ahead with the notoriously-volatile crude's return to the sub-$30 prices of early last year. But West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures seems to have come back from the brink and rallied to climb above $45 a barrel.  Crude Spurred by Decline in Oil & Product   Stockpiles  Oil's recent rebound has been fueled by multiple weeks of strong inventory draws in the U.S. crude and gasoline stockpiles. The nation's oil stockpiles have shrunk in 12 of the last fourteen weeks and the latest decline - of 7.56 million barrels for the week ending July 7 - was its biggest in 10 months. Over the last two weeks, inventories have slumped by 13.9 million barrels, narrowing the five-year average storage surplus down to 103.05 million barrels. Importantly, stocks at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma - the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange - is currently at 57.56 million barrels, the lowest since November 2015. Gasoline stocks have also been going down. As per EIA's latest inventory release, supplies of gasoline were down for the fourth successive week as demand strengthened and imports declined. The 1.65 million barrels draw took gasoline stockpiles down to 235.66 million barrels. As a result of recent decreases, the existing stock of the most widely used petroleum product has now fallen 1.8% below the year-earlier level. Moreover, implied demand rose 81,000 barrels per day and has averaged 9.711 million barrels per day the last four weeks - above the five-year average for the same period. It's this comprehensive decline in oil and product inventories the energy traders have been waiting to see all this while.  But Plenty of Risks Remain  Despite the recent uptick in prices, the sustainability of these gains is highly uncertain as the oil market is still in a lot of trouble. Arguably, the biggest headwind is the steady climb in U.S. shale production. Last week it rose to 9.40 million barrels per day, the most since July 2015. The biggest development in global oil markets over the last few years, the relentless increase in North American shale output has repeatedly undermined efforts by OPEC and other major producers' efforts to 'rebalance' the market and prop up prices. Now at a financial equilibrium, the shale firms are putting more rigs and employees back to work. Throughout the downturn, producers worked tirelessly to cut costs down to a bare minimum and look for innovative ways to churn out more oil from rock. And they managed to do just that by improving drilling techniques. With these efforts, many upstream companies have repositioned themselves to adapt to the new $45 oil reality and even thrive at those prices. Another concern is that despite the Saudi-led OPEC cartel's best efforts in draining the oil glut through production cuts, the group's exports are still at fairly high levels that is minimizing the impact of their own curbs.  What Does the Future Hold?  The uncertainty of  oil prices  means that the future direction of the commodity's movement is anybody's guess. While we cheer strong inventory draws in the U.S., there are still a host of bearish factors that might induce oil's fall into the mid-$30s and spell doom for investors. On the contrary though, the commodity's recovery to $45, predictably, has had a positive effect on stocks in the sector. In particular, savvy investors might view the price bump as the impetus the stocks need after freefalling for three years. Undoubtedly still a long way to go, but improving crude prices may have already primed certain oil producers and linked entities for upward momentum.  Play It Smart  But it's important to keep in mind that even in these tumultuous times, there are some stocks that stands out. Amid the uncertainty, it is necessary that investors adopt a cautious approach. It is prudent to opt for large cap stocks. These have a market capitalization of over $10 billion, and also have further room for upside. These companies enjoy leading market positions, have a global footprint, strong cash positions and are large enough to stay strong even in the face of unfavorable events. To guide investors to the right picks, we highlight 5 stocks that carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank   (Strong Buy) stocks here   . The Zacks Rank is a reliable tool that helps you to trade with confidence regardless of your trading style and risk tolerance. To learn more about how you can use this proven system for market-beating gains, visit  Zacks Rank Education   .  Our Choices  The first such stock is Calgary, Alberta-based Canadian Natural Resources Ltd.  (NYSE:  CNQ - Free Report   ). The company is engaged in the acquisition, development and exploitation of crude oil and natural gas properties. Canadian Natural Resources' core operations are focused in western Canada, the United Kingdom sector of the North Sea and offshore West Africa. Zacks Rank #1 Market Capitalization: $33 billion The second pick, Suncor Energy Inc.  (NYSE:  SU - Free Report   ), Canada's premier integrated energy company. Suncor's operations include oil sands development and upgrading, conventional and offshore crude oil and gas production, petroleum refining, and product marketing under the Petro-Canada brand. Zacks Rank #2 Market Capitalization: $49 billion Houston and London-based Baker Hughes, a GE Company  (NYSE:  BHGE - Free Report   ) is also on our radar. It is one of the largest providers of oilfield services in the world, offering a variety of equipment, maintenance, and engineering and construction services to the global oil and gas industry. Zacks Rank #2 Market Capitalization: $16 billion We advise investors to add Petrobras  (NYSE:  PBR - Free Report   ) - the largest integrated energy firm in Brazil and one of the largest in Latin America. The company's activities include: exploration, exploitation and production of oil from reservoir wells, shale and other rocks, as well as refining, processing, trading and transportation of oil and oil products, natural gas and other fluid hydrocarbons, in addition to other energy-related activities. Zacks Rank #2 Market Capitalization: $55 billion Finally, we have Repsol S.A.  (OTCMKTS:  REPYY - Free Report   ). Repsol is Spain's largest energy company, which is engaged in oil and gas exploration and production, refining and marketing of petroleum products, and other energy-related businesses. Zacks Rank #2 Market Capitalization: $23 billion  Bottom Line  While there are ample reasons to be cautious, there is still enough room to make money in energy stocks, if one focuses on the right companies. In particular, large-cap stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank prove to be attractive options for investment.  More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!

Moving ahead with its divestment goals, Brazil's state-run energy giant Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. or Petrobras PBR recently announced plans to offload assets in Paraguay and Maromba field in the Campos basin. The company, grappling with huge debt, intends to reinstate its financial health through deleveraging efforts and divestment goals.
In Paraguay, Petrobras is set to divest its entire stake in three subsidiaries namely – Petrobras Paraguay Distribución Limited, Petrobras Paraguay Operaciones y Logística SRL and Petrobras Paraguay Gas SRL. These subsidiaries are involved in the distribution and sale of fuel, liquefied petroleum gas and lubricants. Currently, Petrobras being the largest fuel distributor in Paraguay operates 197 service stations and 113 convenience stores in the region. The company also operates Paraguay's three airports.
Along with divestment of assets in Paraguay, Petrobras will also unload its stake in the Maromba oil field in the Campos Basin, offshore Brazil. Maromba is a heavy oil field located in shallow waters close to the fields of Peregrino and Papa-Terra. The company, which had earlier planned to develop the field through the use of floating production system, now considers Maromba as one of its non-core assets. Petrobras owns a 70% interest in the field while the rest 30% is held by U.S. energy giant Chevron Corporation CVX.
Petrobras which aims to revive its financial health through the divestment program of 2015–2018, has already sold assets over $13.6 billion since Jan 2015. The company intends to raise another $21 billion over the next two years to garner $35 billion from asset sales. Last month, Petrobras announced plans to divest around 30 assets by the end of this year. These divestment plans are in sync with the company's strategy to reinstate investor's faith in the stock.
Zacks Rank & Key Picks
Petrobras is an integrated company that is involved in exploration, production, refining, retailing and transportation of petroleum and its byproducts, both domestically and internationally. The Brazilian multinational corporation is headquartered in Rio de Janeiro.
Year to date, shares of Petrobras have lost 24%, underperforming the Zacks categorized Oil & Gas Emerging Markets integrated industry's 9% decline.

However, the company delivered average positive earnings surprise of 18.51% in the last four quarters.
The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
Some better-ranked players in the broader energy space include Delek US Holdings, Inc. DK and Canadian Natural Resources Limited CNQ. Both stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.
Delek US Holdings delivered a positive average earnings surprise of 60.68% in the trailing four quarters.
Canadian Natural Resources is expected to report year-over-year earnings grwoth of 724.76% in earnings in 2017.
Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?
 Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.
 With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.
 It's not the one you think.

Will The Bank Of Canada Pull The Trigger?



Risk Considerations For A Commodity Trade


















Is Canadian Natural Resources A Good Investment? - Canadian Natural Resources, Ltd. (NYSE:CNQ) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Is Canadian Natural Resources A Good Investment?Jun.26.17 | About: Canadian Natural (CNQ) Orthodox Investor Long/short equity, Deep Value, value, GrowthSummaryCredit profile remains strong despite the addition of debt.Additional cash flows from Athabasca oil sands project will enhance the fundamentals.North Sea and African assets bring geographic diversification and expose the company to international oil prices.Canadian Natural Resources (NYSE:CNQ) is one of the better placed companies to take advantage of the expected recovery in oil prices. It is an excellent long-term investment as the company has a strong balance sheet, efficient cost structure, attractive and diversified asset base and healthy fundamentals. The acquisition of Athabasca oil sands project, while financed mainly with debt, will not negatively affect the credit profile of the company. In fact, this acquisition will further enhance the fundamentals and increase cash flows. Volatile market conditions have taken a toll on the margins in the last two years. However, Canadian Natural is not alone here as the weak commodity prices have resulted in poor margins for almost all the players in the industry. The image below shows the trend in margins and some key credit metrics in the last three years. All the figures are in Canadian dollars. 

 Source: SEC filings and Morningstar Comparing the last three years, we can see clearly how the margins were affected as the slump started in 2014. Base year (2014) margins and leverage ratios look extremely strong. These credit metrics warrant an investment grade credit rating. However, the picture changes completely in the following two years. Operating margin becomes negative (down from around 25%) while EBITDA is also halved. Deterioration in EBITDA will have a direct impact on credit metrics as we see that the leverage ratio has more than doubled to 2.9x in 2015, from 1.25x in 2014. Leverage ratio of 3.55x for 2016 is quite high for a company like Canadian Natural. The quality of assets and operational efficiency of Canadian Natural deserves a better leverage ratio.
 This is going to change in 2017 and onwards. One of the key accomplishments for the company has been the cost controls. In most of its production areas, Canadian Natural has been able to reduce operating costs by more than 40%. The management is still not done with the cost control measures and we will likely see more cost reductions in the next few quarters. Rising oil prices in the next few months along with a decline in operating costs will result in cash savings. 

 Source:10-Q The company made some debt payments which brought its long-term debt to $13.175 billion by the end of the first quarter. However, this is again going to go up substantially as the Athabasca oil sands acquisition will be mainly financed by debt. Around $9 billion will be raised through different bond issues and term loan facilities. The company has already priced three long-term and three medium-term bonds. An advantage for Canadian Natural is that its credit rating is still strong. At the start of the last year, Moody’s downgraded its rating to Baa3. It is lower medium grade but still above the non-investment grade ratings. Since then, the company has maintained its credit rating and the outlook was later upgraded to stable. As a result of this credit rating, the company was able to issue debt at reasonably lower cost than some of the weaker peers in the industry. Although Moody’s has termed the oil sands acquisition as credit negative due to the increased leverage, it has also highlighted the increased cash flows from the production gains. Canadian Natural has some debt maturities coming up in the next 12 months. Two bonds worth $1 billion will mature by April 2018 along with a fully drawn non-revolving credit facility of $1.5 billion. The company will have to make these payments. Increased cash flows from the Athabasca acquisition and Horizon expansion will allow the company to meet these cash needs. More than 230,000 bbl/d will be added to the production from these two projects.
 Canadian Natural Resources’ target of a post-acquisition leverage of 2.4x in 2017 is achievable. First-quarter EBITDA was over $1.7 billion. if the increased production and expected rise in oil prices is accounted for, then the full year EBITDA will be $8-10 billion. EBITDA figure of $8 billion will give us a leverage ratio of 2.6x. Keep in mind that these are my rough estimates and I believe at the lower end of EBITDA estimates, Canadian Natural will be close to achieving its target of 2.4x leverage. Athabasca oil sands acquisition gives some diversity to cash flows. Canadian Natural has some geographic diversity as well through its North Sea and African off-shore assets. African off-shore assets are some of the most profitable operations for the company and as the North Sea oil finds its way into Asia, these operations will also yield more. Due to a tax change from UK, drilling at North Sea has become even more attractive. Canadian Natural has planned 3 new wells for North Sea in 2017. Oil prices have been under pressure in the last few months, but the OPEC members are looking to prop up prices. I am expecting oil prices to recover in the next few months. Increased production along with rising oil prices will bring in healthy cash for the company. Canadian Natural also intends to buy more than 27.9 million shares in the market over the next 12 months. Another sign that the management is confident about the cash flows and wants to return cash to shareholders. All these factors make Canadian Natural Resources an excellent long-term pick.

For investors, it makes evident which corporations are treating climate change as a material financial risk and which are not.”Utility companies included in the database are: American Electric Power, CLP Holdings, Dominion Resources, DTE Energy, Edison International, Enel, Entergy, Eversource, Exelon, FirstEnergy, Fortis, Iberdrola, NextEra Energy, PG&E, Power Assets Holdings, PPL, Public Service Enterprise Group, Southern Company, SSE, and Xcel.Oil and gas companies included in the database are: Anadarko, Apache, BP, Canadian Natural Resources, Chevron, Concho Resources, ConocoPhillips, Devon Energy, Eni, EOG Resources, Exxon Mobil, Marathon, Occidental, Phillips 66, Pioneer Natural Resources, Royal Dutch Shell, Suncor Energy, Total, Valero, and Woodside Petroleum.Users can select several companies and compare their disclosures, side-by-side, such as the example provided in this news release with data from BP, Chevron, Exxon-Mobile and Shell. And with a single click, users can jump to the specific location of disclosures in a corporation’s financial filings, where the information can be read in context.Envonet displays climate-related disclosures in the areas of governance, strategy, risk management and performance measurement, found in mainstream financial filings (e.g., Form 10-Ks filed with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission).

Investor Information

Canadian Natural has a history of delivering profitable growth. We measure our reserves, production, finding costs, cash flow and earnings growth on a "per share" basis.
We benchmark our performance against our North American independent exploration and production peer group, and rank as a top tier performer in all respects.
Our balanced asset base includes numerous defined opportunities for continued growth in each of our core areas and product offerings.
This, combined with our strong free-cash flow generation ability enables us to invest increasingly larger amounts in significant long-term developments such as offshore projects and the Horizon Oil Sands.

World Class Assets

Canadian Natural’s strong, low-risk asset base is developed via prudent capital allocation to maximize returns. This is key to Canadian Natural’s successful and proven strategy. Other elements of the strategy include effective execution of our defined growth plan, growth through the drill bit along with growth through opportunistic acquisitions, maintaining balance in all parts of the business, striving to be the most effective and efficient producer in every basin in which we operate, and finally, owning and operating infrastructure in core areas where Canadian Natural maintains a large, balanced portfolio of assets with production and development of both natural gas and crude oil. North America operations serve as our foundation with international exposure provided through operations in the UK portion of the North Sea and Offshore Africa.








 Select an area on the map to learn more about specific assets.


North America
Canadian Natural has the largest undeveloped land base in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) with a large infrastructure position. North America assets consist of conventional and unconventional natural gas, along with projects in crude oil, including primary, secondary and tertiary light, medium and heavy production, in situ oil sands and oil sands mining.
Natural Gas
Canadian Natural is the largest  producer of natural gas in Western Canada. Our natural gas assets are strong, leveraged by a vast land base, well developed infrastructure and a deep, diversified inventory of drilling prospects. Conventional and unconventional natural gas production is concentrated in five North American core regions: Northwest Alberta, Northeast British Columbia, the Foothills, the Northern Plains and the Southern Plains.
Canadian Natural continues to access and develop new natural gas opportunities, focusing on growing an already strong location inventory and optimizing existing production.

Q1/17
Natural Gas Activity







Crude Oil and NGLs
Canadian Natural is a significant producer of heavy crude oil in Canada with a competitive advantage through its vast land base. We balance heavy production with light crude oil, bitumen, SCO, Pelican Lake medium crude oil and production of natural gas liquids. Production is balanced as are project time horizons with near, mid and long term projects focusing on long-term value creation through a defined plan for profitable growth.

Canadian Natural’s heavy crude oil production is focused on the Alberta-Saskatchewan border. We benefit from an extensive and dominant land position which allows for large scale drilling and development programs while minimizing capital cost requirements. Costs are further managed through owning and operating centralized treating and sand handling facilities, maximizing their utilization and achieving economies of scale. Primary production of heavy crude oil typically recovers between 5%-15% of oil originally in place, leaving a vast unrecovered resource that will ultimately be exploited through improved recovery techniques.

Canadian Natural produces light crude oil and NGLs in all of the western Canadian core regions. The majority of the light pools are mature but as in heavy oil production, recovery factors are modest with recovery rates improving as new technology and EOR techniques are implemented.
The Pelican Lake field is a premium asset within Canadian Natural’s crude oil portfolio, having had great success first with waterfloods followed by polymer floods. Pelican Lake is a large, shallow medium crude oil pool initially developed for primary production. Parts of the field were converted to waterflood, resulting in a significant production increase. Building on that success, polymer flood was tested and subsequently introduced, again resulting in significant increases in production. The application of the higher viscosity polymer flood increases oil recovery due to reduced fingering or breakthrough, which can happen when waterflooding.

Canadian Natural believes we hold some of the best oil sands assets in North America, particularly thermal in situ properties. These assets will provide tremendous value and growth potential. Located in two of the major oil sands deposits in Western Canada – the Athabasca and Cold Lake – the thermal in situ properties are developed using both cyclic steam stimulation (CSS) and steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) techniques. Our thermal operations are an integral part of our defined plan.

Q1/17
Crude Oil & NGLs Activity







Horizon Oil Sands
Another development in Canadian Natural’s world class oil sands assets is the Horizon Oil Sands Mine. Rather than in situ production, Horizon includes a surface oil sands mining and bitumen extraction plant, complimented by on-site bitumen upgrading with associated infrastructure, ultimately producing high quality synthetic crude oil. Canadian Natural holds extensive leases with a massive resources base, with the mine and plant facilities expected to produce for decades to come without the production declines normally associated with conventional crude oil production. The Horizon Oil Sands are located just north of Fort McMurray, Alberta in the Athabasca region.

Q1/17
Horizon Oil Sands Mining and Upgrading Activity







International
Canadian Natural’s International operations provide a committed source of light crude oil production. The Company leverages their experience in mature, low-risk, exploitation basins (similar to those found in our core area, the WCSB in North America,) to those found offshore. International efforts are concentrated in two core areas – the UK portion of the North Sea, and in Offshore Africa, specifically Offshore Cote d’Ivoire and Offshore Gabon. In all International properties, the focus is on generating free cash flow while setting up for future expansion.
North Sea
In the North Sea, attention is focused on managing existing infrastructure in a mature basin leading to field life extension, providing additional recovery potential in a low-risk environment, along with generating significant free cash flow. Mature basin exploitation is one of Canadian Natural’s core competencies and this area provides long-term development in a low-risk, high-value area.
Offshore Africa
The Offshore Africa assets again deliver high-value, light crude oil, providing development opportunities with significant exploration upside with some of the highest returning projects in the company. Canadian Natural has capitalized on a unique government relations niche while leveraging technical and operational expertise from the North Sea operations.

In Offshore Cote d’Ivoire, the Espoir development is produced from two reservoirs - East and West Espoir – located roughly 60 kilometers southwest of Abidjan, capital of Cote d’Ivoire. The field is developed through highly deviated wells and the use of water injection and other recovery techniques to achieve superior flow rates. The light crude is then processed, stored and offloaded via a floating production storage and off-take (FPSO) vessel.

Also in Offshore Cote d’Ivoire is the Baobab field. Baobab is located roughly 8 kilometers south of Espoir in deep water. As with Espoir, Baobab uses an FPSO to process, store and export the crude oil. Long term plans for the field include a cost conscious approach towards its development.

In Offshore Gabon, the Olowi field is located approximately 20 kilometers offshore in shallow waters. Canadian Natural is the operator and holds a 90% interest in the asset. Long term plans include sustaining and optimizing production.

Canadian Natural has a 50% interest in Block 11B/12B offshore South Africa, approximately 200 km offshore between Mossel Bay and Port Elizabeth. The block is prospective for coalescing (deep water) basin floor fans, with amalgamated turbidite sand thickness potentially up to 150m based on seismic data, similar to that in the Forties Fan in the North Sea. As this is deep water with challenging sea conditions, Canadian Natural secured a world class partner for the deep water exploration of its Block 11B/12B with a 50% working interest and carry on the first exploratory well up to $150 million gross.

Industry Profile: Canadian Natural Resources Ltd.

September 19, 2016
Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. (NYSE: CNQ; www.cnrl.com) is one of the largest independent crude oil and natural gas producers in the world. They do this by working in many different oil and energy industries. This creates a steady stream of income because even if one product isn’t doing well, the others make up the difference. Canadian Natural is always working to grow its businesses in natural gas, North America crude oil and natural gas liquids, Horizon Oil Sands, and International crude oil. By being a part of all of these industries, Canadian Natural always has a few irons in the fire.
Canadian Natural gets the most out of the different places they work by using a strategy with several parts. First, they know the most important thing is to be efficient in every job they do. This is critical because wasteful business practices won’t be able to make enough money in the long run. They also focus on getting the most out of oil and gas locations they already know instead of using valuable time trying to find the next major pool. Canadian Natural always uses the best new technology along with its own research. This helps them get the most bang for their buck on a low-risk approach. Canadian Natural also believes in owning and running every part of its businesses. By doing so, they can start up or shut down drilling sites on very short notice. Making fast decisions is so useful because lets them work quicker than the competition. Every action is taken based on the feedback of a special committee that meets weekly to decide the best places to spend money and resources.
Canadian Natural’s motto of “balance” goes beyond just keeping footholds in natural gas, heavy crude oil, and light crude oil. It’s also important to keep an equal amount of short-, medium- and long-term projects. These help give a look into how projects can be expected to do in the future. These practices give Canadian Natural some protection against the ups and downs of just one product or service. It also gives them more options with how to put resources into the projects that are doing the best.
Canadian Natural believes in being responsible. This means listening its investors, and working with them in the places where Canadian Natural does business. It also means responsibility to the people that work there. Smart, skilled employees make up the back bone of any company. Canadian Natural safeguards them by having some of the highest safety standards around. Finally, it means being careful with the environment. Canadian Natural uses the newest technology to reduce the amount of waste they create and use less energy every year. Most of all, Canadian Natural is committed to always keep improving in its goal of growing as a world-class company.
Canadian Natural has its headquarters in Calgary and maintains offices throughout Canadian and internationally in Scotland, Gabon and Cote d’Ivoire.

Operations[edit]
With headquarters located in Calgary, Alberta, the company operates field offices in Alberta, British Columbia, Saskatchewan as well as international offices in Gabon, Côte d'Ivoire and Aberdeen, Scotland.
According to the company it has the largest undeveloped base in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin: it is the largest independent producer of natural gas in Western Canada and the largest producer of heavy crude oil in Canada.[5]
Canadian Natural's largest operation is the Horizon Oil Sands project which is located 75 kilometres (47 mi) north of Fort McMurray, Alberta. The Horizon Oil Sands include a surface oil sands mining and bitumen extraction plant, complimented by on-site bitumen upgrading with associated infrastructure. Canadian Natural's sanctioned the Horizon Oil Sands Project in February 2005 and it produced its first barrels of synthetic crude oil in early 2009.[6]
International operations concentrates in the United Kingdom portion of the North Sea and in offshore Africa. In the North Sea, it focuses on managing existing infrastructure. In offshore Africa, the company operates in Côté d'Ivoire and Gabon.[7]
History[edit]
In 1988, Canadian Natural was heavily in debt due to a combination of excessive leverage in late 1970s and early 1980s, and the collapse of oil prices in 1986. It was forced into a restructuring that saw the majority of its geographically scattered assets sold. It employed 9 people, produced about 1,400 barrels (220 m3) of oil equivalent per day and had a market capitalization of about $1 million. Through growth and acquisitions, it has grown to approximately 8000 employees, production of over 817,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and a market capitalization of approximately $45 billion.[8]
Accidents[edit]
In late November 2014, a CNRL pipeline spilled almost 60,000 liters of crude oil into a muskeg region in northern Alberta, located roughly 27 kilometers from Red Earth Creek.[9] 2014 was a poor safety year for CNRL.[10]
Recent news[edit]
In November 2015, the firm announced it would sell most of its royalty assets to PrairieSky Royalty Ltd for around $1.8 billion.[11]
In March, 2017, Canadian Natural Resources announced plans to spend C$12.74 billion in cash and shares in a blockbuster deal to acquire the bulk of Royal Dutch Shell’s oilsands holdings and half of Marathon Oil’s minority stake in the Athabasca Oil Sands Project in Alberta.[12]
Trading[edit]
Canadian Natural's common shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CNQ and under the Toronto Stock Exchange as CNQ and CNQ.U which denotes trading in US funds.
Corporate governance[edit]
Canadian Natural is a limited liability, publicly traded corporation. Current members of the board of directors are: Catherine M. Best, N. Murray Edwards, Honourable Gary A. Filmon, Ambassador Gordon D. Giffin, John G. Langille, Steve W. Laut, Keith A.J. MacPhail, Honourable Frank J. McKenna, James S. Palmer, Eldon R. Smith and David A. Tuer.

By 2011, with a production of 121,000 barrels (19,200 m3), CNRL was Canada's largest oil company and Canada's "single biggest conventional heavy oil producer".[3] By 2009 CNRL ranked number 251 on the Forbes Global 2000 list.[4]
CNRL is one of the largest independent crude oil and natural gas producers in the world, with its head office in Calgary, and operations focused in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin,[notes 1][2] the North Sea and offshore West Africa.

Operations[edit]
With headquarters located in Calgary, Alberta, the company operates field offices in Alberta, British Columbia, Saskatchewan as well as international offices in Gabon, Côte d'Ivoire and Aberdeen, Scotland.
According to the company it has the largest undeveloped base in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin: it is the largest independent producer of natural gas in Western Canada and the largest producer of heavy crude oil in Canada.[5]
Canadian Natural's largest operation is the Horizon Oil Sands project which is located 75 kilometres (47 mi) north of Fort McMurray, Alberta. The Horizon Oil Sands include a surface oil sands mining and bitumen extraction plant, complimented by on-site bitumen upgrading with associated infrastructure. Canadian Natural's sanctioned the Horizon Oil Sands Project in February 2005 and it produced its first barrels of synthetic crude oil in early 2009.[6]
International operations concentrates in the United Kingdom portion of the North Sea and in offshore Africa. In the North Sea, it focuses on managing existing infrastructure. In offshore Africa, the company operates in Côté d'Ivoire and Gabon.[7]
History[edit]
In 1988, Canadian Natural was heavily in debt due to a combination of excessive leverage in late 1970s and early 1980s, and the collapse of oil prices in 1986. It was forced into a restructuring that saw the majority of its geographically scattered assets sold. It employed 9 people, produced about 1,400 barrels (220 m3) of oil equivalent per day and had a market capitalization of about $1 million. Through growth and acquisitions, it has grown to approximately 8000 employees, production of over 817,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and a market capitalization of approximately $45 billion.[8]
Accidents[edit]
In late November 2014, a CNRL pipeline spilled almost 60,000 liters of crude oil into a muskeg region in northern Alberta, located roughly 27 kilometers from Red Earth Creek.[9] 2014 was a poor safety year for CNRL.[10]
Recent news[edit]
In November 2015, the firm announced it would sell most of its royalty assets to PrairieSky Royalty Ltd for around $1.8 billion.[11]
In March, 2017, Canadian Natural Resources announced plans to spend C$12.74 billion in cash and shares in a blockbuster deal to acquire the bulk of Royal Dutch Shell’s oilsands holdings and half of Marathon Oil’s minority stake in the Athabasca Oil Sands Project in Alberta.[12]
Trading[edit]
Canadian Natural's common shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol CNQ and under the Toronto Stock Exchange as CNQ and CNQ.U which denotes trading in US funds.
Corporate governance[edit]
Canadian Natural is a limited liability, publicly traded corporation. Current members of the board of directors are: Catherine M. Best, N. Murray Edwards, Honourable Gary A. Filmon, Ambassador Gordon D. Giffin, John G. Langille, Steve W. Laut, Keith A.J. MacPhail, Honourable Frank J. McKenna, James S. Palmer, Eldon R. Smith and David A. Tuer.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
