					Full Description



Entellus Medical, Inc., incorporated on August 10, 2006, is a medical technology company. The Company is focused on delivering patient and physician experiences through products designed for the minimally invasive treatment of chronic and recurrent sinusitis in both adult and pediatric patients. Its three core product lines, XprESS Multi-Sinus Dilation Systems, MiniFESS Surgical Instruments, and FocESS Imaging & Navigation, are designed to enable ear, nose and throat (ENT), physicians to perform a range of procedures in the ENT physician office and to simplify operating room-based treatment. Its XeroGel Nasal Packing Material is indicated for use in patients undergoing nasal or sinus surgery as a space-occupying packing to separate tissue or structures compromised by surgical trauma, prevent adhesions between mucosal surfaces, help control bleeding following surgery or trauma, and act as an aid in the natural healing process. XeroGel nasal packing material is also indicated for use to treat epistaxis, or nasal bleeding.XprESS Multi-Sinus Dilation Product FamilyThe Company's XprESS Multi-Sinus Dilation family of products consists of its XprESS Pro device, its XprESS LoProfile device and its XprESS Ultra device. The XprESS LoProfile device and the XprESS Ultra device are sold with its light emitting diode (LED) Light Fiber. Its XprESS devices combine the features of balloon sinus dilation, suction, irrigation and light confirmation into a single-use device shaped to feel like a sinus seeker, a tool used regularly by ENT physicians to probe for sinus openings and drainage pathways. Its XprESS devices include an ergonomic handle attached to a hollow metal shaft with a malleable tip that can be shaped with its disposable bending tool and steered into diseased frontal, sphenoid and maxillary sinuses without requiring a guidewire or purchase of another component. The LED Light Fiber is a single-use tool that provides real-time high intensity red trans-illumination of the sinus cavity with its own battery power, eliminating the need for extra light sources, cables and adapters. Its FocESS Sinuscopes provide ENT physicians with a solution for endoscopic visualization during a sinus procedure. Its MiniFESS tools are designed to provide ENT physicians with a way to confirm sinus location and XprESS device placement. Its diagnostic MiniFESS tools consist of its Light Seeker, Maxillary Seeker and Sphenoid Seeker/Freer.MiniFESS Surgical InstrumentsThe Company's MiniFESS family of surgical instruments includes eight devices designed to enable physicians to perform various surgical procedures. These devices include a turbinate forceps, two Blakesley thru-cutters, a 2.5 millimeter Takahashi forceps, a sickle knife and Blakesley forceps in zero-degree, 45-degree and 90-degree orientations, respectively. Each device is designed to be used in specific sinus procedures, which enables them to be utilized easily in the office setting on appropriate patients. In addition, its Turbinate forceps product enables physicians to create space in tight anatomy through the controlled and precise compression of an enlarged middle turbinate. Its MiniFESS family's Shaver System offers a technology in a compact size. Its Cyclone Sinonasal Suction/Irrigation System is designed to provide simultaneous suction and irrigation for saline lavage.Fiagon Image Guidance SystemThe Fiagon Image Guidance System (IGS) consists of a navigation unit, navigation sensor, software instruments and a patient localizer. The system is designed to be integrated into any endoscopy tower. It is a distributor of the Fiagon IGS and related ancillary products to ENT physicians in physician offices, clinics and surgery centers, located in the United States, certain United States territories and Canada. It is also a distributor of Fiagon GuideWires attached to or sold with its balloon products to hospitals in the United States, certain United States territories and Canada.The Company competes with Johnson and Johnson Inc., Medtronic, plc, Smith & Nephew, plc, SinuSys Corporation, Olympus and Stryker Corporation and Intersect ENT, Inc.

Q: What if I am interested in more than one position or have applied in the past?

Precision
The seeker-based design of XprESS delivers the familiar control and tactile feel physicians rely on to access even the most tortuous nasal anatomy.




Consistent
Precision brings success. Studies show physicians achieve a consistent, high technical success rate reaching and dilating targeted sinus ostia when using XprESS.2




Malleable
Reshapeable tip can be adjusted to an infinite number of angles to meet the unique anatomical challenges of each patient.
Supplied bending tool delivers optimal angle ranges to access natural sinus ostia and avoid sensitive anatomy.




Sleek
The slim profile and small ball tip of each XprESS device allows for smooth movement through tight nasal passages and easy endoscopic viewing of treatment.






Single Device
The unique malleable tip of XprESS can be reshaped to treat the frontal, maxillary and sphenoid sinuses, as well as Eustachian tubes as appropriate.




Broadest Indication
XprESS is approved for balloon dilation to treat maxillary sinuses in patients (2+) as well as the frontal and sphenoid sinuses in patients (12+). In addition, ETD patients (18+) can also be treated.




Easy Integration
With our easy-to-use devices, staff training takes minutes, not hours –in the OR and the clinic.






Accredited Technology
Not only is XprESS clinically proven to provide safe, effective and durable outcomes, it is the ONLY balloon dilation technology to receive positive guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Medical Technologies Advisory Committee for the treatment of chronic sinusitis after medical treatment has failed.

Familiar
The seeker-based design of XprESS delivers the familiar control and tactile feel physicians rely on.

Transillumination

 Live Case: Treating Complex Disease in the Office 
 January 24, 2017, 4:00pm 
 Balloon sinus dilation has enabled the transition of sinus surgery to the office, providing physicians more control of their schedule and offering patients a convenient treatment option. With the introduction of additional office friendly technologies, including our Shaver System and FiagonTM Sinus Navigation System, physicians can now pair additional necessary techniques with balloon sinus dilation to extend the benefits of an office-based procedure to more appropriate patients.

Entellus Medical Announces First Quarter 2017 Financial ResultsBack to ENTL News

Share Story4:03PM ET 5/03/2017 Globe NewswirePLYMOUTH, Minn., May  03, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Entellus Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENTL), a medical technology company focused on delivering superior patient and physician experiences through products designed for the minimally invasive treatment of chronic and recurrent sinusitis patients, today reported its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. 
Recent Highlights and Accomplishments 
Revenue of $19.1 million in the first quarter of 2017, an increase of 13% year-over-year
In-office revenue represented 58% of U.S. product revenue in the first quarter
Received 510(k) clearance from the FDA and CE Mark for use of the XprESS ENT Dilation System in patients with persistent Eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD)
Strengthened balance sheet with secondary offering and entered into a new credit facility, expanding borrowing capacity to up to $50.0 million

"Our first quarter performance was again marked by strong sales to physicians' offices and our balloon business performed well.  Overall revenues came in at the low end of our guidance range as sales of certain capital equipment products were lighter than expected," said Robert White, President and Chief Executive Officer of Entellus Medical. "With our broad product offering and execution of key initiatives, I am confident in the business and our ability to accelerate revenue growth throughout the remainder of 2017."
First Quarter 2017 Financial ResultsRevenue for the first quarter increased 13% to $19.1 million from $16.9 million during the same period of the prior year. The growth in revenue was attributable to increased sales of the Company's XprESS family of products and strong sales of new products with the exception of certain capital products due to an unexpected slowdown in purchases at the end of the quarter.  Foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted revenue by approximately $0.1 million for the quarter.
Gross margin for the first quarter of 2017 was 74.4%, compared to 76.3% for the same period in 2016.  Gross margin was impacted by product mix and continued geographic expansion.
Operating expenses for the first quarter of 2017 were $22.0 million, an increase of 14% compared to $19.3 million for the same period of the prior year. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to increased employee-related expenses resulting from the expansion of the Company's sales and corporate staff, including stock-based compensation expense of $1.8 million compared to $1.2 million in the same period of 2016.  The first quarter operating expenses also included the Company's annual global sales training meeting and the launch of new products.
Net loss for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 was $8.3 million, or $0.40 per share, compared with a net loss of $6.9 million, or $0.37 per share, for the same period of the prior year.
In January 2017, the Company completed an underwritten public offering raising net proceeds of over $45 million for the Company.  In March 2017, the Company entered into a new credit facility allowing it to borrow up to a total of $40.0 million in term loans and up to $10.0 million under a revolving line of credit, subject to a borrowing base requirement.
Entellus Medical ended the first quarter of 2017 with $68.2 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments.
2017 Financial Outlook Entellus Medical expects full year 2017 revenue will be in a range of $86.0 million to $89.0 million, representing growth of 14% to 18% over 2016 revenue. This compares to our previous annual revenue expectation for 2017 of $86.0 million to $90.0 million and previous growth expectations of 14% to 20%.  Gross margin is expected to be in a range of 72% to 74% for the full year 2017. Full year 2017 net loss is expected to be in a range of $24.0 million to $32.0 million.
Entellus Medical expects second quarter 2017 revenue will be at the lower end of its projected annual revenue growth range with revenues ranging from $20.7 million to $21.7 million, representing growth of 11% to 16% over the second quarter of 2016. Gross margin is expected to be in a range of 72% to 74% for the second quarter of 2017. Second quarter 2017 net loss is expected to be in a range of $7.0 million to $9.0 million.

Control
Versatility
Confidence
Choice
 


Precision
The seeker-based design of XprESS delivers the familiar control and tactile feel physicians rely on to access even the most tortuous nasal anatomy.




Consistent
Precision brings success. Studies show physicians achieve a consistent, high technical success rate reaching and dilating targeted sinus ostia when using XprESS.2




Malleable
Reshapeable tip can be adjusted to an infinite number of angles to meet the unique anatomical challenges of each patient.
Supplied bending tool delivers optimal angle ranges to access natural sinus ostia and avoid sensitive anatomy.




Sleek
The slim profile and small ball tip of each XprESS device allows for smooth movement through tight nasal passages and easy endoscopic viewing of treatment.






Single Device
The unique malleable tip of XprESS can be reshaped to treat the frontal, maxillary and sphenoid sinuses, as well as Eustachian tubes as appropriate.




Broadest Indication
XprESS is approved for balloon dilation to treat maxillary sinuses in patients (2+) as well as the frontal and sphenoid sinuses in patients (12+). In addition, ETD patients (18+) can also be treated.




Easy Integration
With our easy-to-use devices, staff training takes minutes, not hours –in the OR and the clinic.






Accredited Technology
Not only is XprESS clinically proven to provide safe, effective and durable outcomes, it is the ONLY balloon dilation technology to receive positive guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Medical Technologies Advisory Committee for the treatment of chronic sinusitis after medical treatment has failed.
Click to view press release>>



Familiar
The seeker-based design of XprESS delivers the familiar control and tactile feel physicians rely on.




Confidence
With the XprESS family of devices, physicians can apply a combination of five methods to confidently confirm device placement.
Direct visualization
Tactile feel
1cm and 2cm depth markings
Transillumination
Tip excursion
Watch case video to see how physicians apply confirmation




Simple
One finger advancer gently slides the balloon to device tip for treatment.




Intuitive
Inflation syringe requires only single depression to reliably achieve 12 atm of pressure and connects simply to inflation port on XprESS.
