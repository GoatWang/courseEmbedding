History[edit]
United States Commodity Funds LLC is an issuer of exchange traded commodity products (ETPs). It was founded in 2005 in Alameda, CA. The first fund it launched, in 2006, was United States Oil Fund, LP. USO was the first commodity ETF based on crude oil launched in the United States. USO was the fourth commodity ETP launched in the United States, after the SPDR Gold Shares Trust (ticker: GLD), the iShares COMEX Gold Trust (ticker: IAU), and the Powershares DB Commodity Index Fund (ticker: DBC).[2] USO is the largest and most actively traded oil-based ETP in the United States.[3]
In 2007, USCF launched United States Natural Gas Fund, LP, the first natural gas based ETP. UNG is the largest and most actively traded natural gas commodity ETP in the United States. USCF also launched the first gasoline based commodity ETP, United States Gasoline Fund, LP (ticker:UGA), and the first heating oil based commodity ETP, the United States Heating Oil Fund, LP, both in 2008. In 2010, USCF launched the first commodity ETP in the United States that invested in Brent crude oil (ticker:BNO), although previously a Brent crude oil based commodity ETP had been launched in London.[1]

USCF's commodity exchange traded products are all listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Prior to the merger of the American Stock Exchange with the New York Stock Exchange, all of USCF's products were listed for trading on the American Stock Exchange.[1]
On October 6, 2010, commodity index provider SummerHaven Index Management announced that USCF had licensed two new indexes from SummerHaven.[5]

Fund Details
 The United States Gasoline Fund® LP (UGA) is an exchange-traded security that is designed to track in percentage terms the movements of gasoline prices. UGA issues shares that may be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca. 
 The investment objective of UGA is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares' NAV to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the price of gasoline (also known as reformulated gasoline blendstock for oxygen blending, or "RBOB"), for delivery to the New York harbor, as measured by the daily changes in the price the Benchmark Futures Contract, less UGA's expenses. 
 The Benchmark Futures Contract is the futures contract on gasoline as traded on the NYMEX. If the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration, the Benchmark will be the next month contract to expire. The RBOB contract is for delivery to the New York harbor. 
 UGA invests primarily in listed RBOB futures contracts and other gasoline-related futures contracts, and may invest in forwards and swap contracts. These investments will be collateralized by cash, cash equivalents, and US government obligations with remaining maturities of two years or less. 
UGA's Fund Benefits

UGA offers commodity exposure without using a commodity futures account.
UGA provides "equity-like" features including, intra-day pricing, and market, limit, and stop orders.
UGA provides portfolio holdings, market price, NAV and TNA on its website each day.

The above frequency distribution chart presents information about the difference between the daily market price for shares of the Fund and the Fund's reported net asset value. The amount that the fund's market price is above the reported NAV is called the premium. The amount that the fund's market price is below the reported NAV is called the discount. The market price is determined using the midpoint between the highest bid and the lowest offer on the listing exchange, as of the time that the Fund's NAV is calculated (usually 4:00 pm Eastern time). The horizontal axis of the chart shows the premium or discount expressed in basis points. The vertical axis indicates the number of trading days in the period covered by the chart. Each bar in the chart shows the number of trading days in which the Fund traded within the premium/discount range indicated.
 
* A basis point is equal to 1/100th of 1% and is used to denote the change in a financial instrument.

Fund Details
The United States Natural Gas Fund® LP (UNG) is an exchange-traded security that is designed to track in percentage terms the movements of natural gas prices. UNG issues shares that may be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca.
The investment objective of UNG is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares' net NAV to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the price of natural gas delivered at the Henry Hub, Louisiana, as measured by the daily changes in the Benchmark Futures Contract, less UNG's expenses.
The Benchmark is the futures contract on natural gas as traded on the NYMEX. If the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration, the Benchmark will be the next month contract to expire. The natural gas contract is natural gas delivered at the Henry Hub, Louisiana.
UNG invests primarily in listed natural gas futures contracts and other natural gas related futures contracts, and may invest in forwards and swap contracts. These investments will be collateralized by cash, cash equivalents, and US government obligations with remaining maturities of two years or less.
UNG's Fund Benefits

UNG offers commodity exposure without using a commodity futures account.
UNG provides "equity-like" features including, intra-day pricing, and market, limit, and stop orders.
UNG provides portfolio holdings, market price, NAV and TNA on its website each day.

The above frequency distribution chart presents information about the difference between the daily market price for shares of the Fund and the Fund's reported net asset value. The amount that the fund's market price is above the reported NAV is called the premium. The amount that the fund's market price is below the reported NAV is called the discount. The market price is determined using the midpoint between the highest bid and the lowest offer on the listing exchange, as of the time that the Fund's NAV is calculated (usually 4:00 pm Eastern time). The horizontal axis of the chart shows the premium or discount expressed in basis points. The vertical axis indicates the number of trading days in the period covered by the chart. Each bar in the chart shows the number of trading days in which the Fund traded within the premium/discount range indicated.
 
* A basis point is equal to 1/100th of 1% and is used to denote the change in a financial instrument.

		United States Oil Fund (USO) Is Stretched — Short It!	
A pullback looms for the USO ETF. Here's how to capitalize.

Jul 28, 2017, 12:36 pm EDT  |  By Tyler Craig, Tales of a Technician



 
 

Commodities have rather enjoyed the U.S. dollar’s recent death spiral. Greenback weakness has delivered gains to everyone from gold and silver to crude oil. But the upside in oil may soon slow, and that has me eyeing some contrarian trades in the United States Oil Fund LP (ETF) (NYSEARCA:USO).
With overhead resistance looming close, bearish plays in USO may be worth a shot here.
Interestingly enough, the relationship between oil prices and the dollar wasn’t very consistent during the first half of the year. Sometimes they moved together; sometimes they moved apart. But in the month of July we’ve finally seen the pair revert to their normal relationship, with dollar weakness delivering strength to USO.
As shown below, the 20-day correlation between the U.S. Dollar Index and USO is -0.69 which is quite negative.
Source: OptionsAnalytix

Since bottoming at $8.65 in mid-June, USO has rallied 18% popping above the 50-day and 20-day moving averages in the process. While rising above both smoothing mechanisms would normally count as a victory for the bulls, USO hasn’t really been responding to either average. Its disrespect is likely due to its trendless nature in recent years.
The six-week rally has driven the RSI indicator close to overbought territory. Matter of fact, it’s perched at the same level as where the last six oil rallies finally topped out. Throw it all together, and bearish oil trades are starting to look attractive.

Short USO Calls
In timing the entry, it’s worth waiting for signs that crude is topping. USO has now carved out four up-days in a row, so we’ll want to see a down candle or at least a break of intraday support before pulling the trigger.
USO’s overall neutral nature, not to mention its small price tag, makes it a prime candidate for option selling. Once we start to see weakness creep in, sell the Sep $10.50 calls for around 29 cents.
You can think of it as a wager that USO will sit below $10.50 at September expiration. But you don’t have to ride it till the bitter end. I suggest exiting if you can snatch back the calls near 10 cents anytime over the duration of the trade.
As of this writing, Tyler Craig did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities. Want to learn how to master the art of option selling for high-probability cash flow?

The investment seeks the daily changes in percentage terms of the spot price of gasoline, for delivery to the New York harbor, as measured by the daily changes in the price of a specified short-term futures contract on gasoline called the “Benchmark Futures Contract,” less UGA’s expenses.
 The fund invests in futures contracts for gasoline, other types of gasoline, crude oil, diesel-heating oil, natural gas and other petroleum-based fuels. The Benchmark Futures Contract is the futures contract on gasoline as traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange that is the near month contract to expire, except when the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration.
