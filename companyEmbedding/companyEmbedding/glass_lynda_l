                DESIGN PHILOSOPHYBlending Interior Design with Interior Architecture and the principles of Feng Shui, Lynda creates unique, sustainable, quality environments. With an eye for dramatic simplicity, she sees good design as a creative composition of space that embodies less as more, detail rather than decoration, quality rather than quantity, authenticity rather than imitation, and timelessness rather than trendiness. While being ecologically and environmentally conscious, using natural and sustainable elements, rare finds and often blending indoors with outdoors - the spaces created are harmonious, inviting, and tranquil. Providing a personal and comprehensive service, Lynda finds inspiration in transforming spaces from conception through completion, creating life enhancing spaces and places.  As we shape our environments, our environments shape us.
