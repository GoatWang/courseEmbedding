                         Dear Customers, Suppliers, and Associates,
    
    As you can see, we have finally updated our web site.  For a long time, it has not reflected who we have become.  We have been very busy transforming our company from a small start up, to a hundred million dollar global specialty chemical company.  It's been 14 years since Mark, Kevin, and I, working out of our homes, thought we could help our customers access high quality low priced products from China.
    
    In the meantime, we have added people, factories, and warehouses, and global sales offices to support the efforts.  When discussing the web site, it has always been, "we'll get to it."
    
    Well now we got to it.
    
    People that have known us have stated that "you guys are the best kept secret in the industry."
    
    Well now we finally have the time to sit down and figure out what it is we do and state it.
    
    What we do is use all of our strengths, creativity, and energy to help and support our customers, partners, suppliers, and employees reach their goals and objectives.
    
    We really take this seriously. We know that our continuing success is built on every interaction that we have with our customers, suppliers, partners, and employees. Our reputation grows by doing this diligently and carefully. We listen to all of you and strive to put you in the strongest position so that you can all succeed in a tough environment.
    
    We are small enough so that we can think creatively to solve any problem no matter the size. There is no order, conversation, transaction, which doesn't get the highest attention.
    
    We are now big enough so that we have low cost supply chain, so that we can provide products to our customers which add value to their supply chains and allow us to invest in improving our offerings.
    
    We have continually grown at a 30% annual rate and have done this by retaining 95% of our 300 customers every year. We will continue to grow by adding new products to these existing customers and getting the word out so that we take on new customers, suppliers, and partners.
    
    To those that know us, thank you for your business. For those that don't know us, please give us a chance to help you reach your goals and objectives.
    
    
    Sincerely,
    
    Adam Feldman
    CEO and Chairman
