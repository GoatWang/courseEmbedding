Can OTT video match TV reliability, quality of delivery? Yes it can, though it could take a while to get there. http://ow.ly/lrIn3071Kp3

ABOUT US






 



OUR MISSION
 
To level the playing field for media companies 
in an arena where data determines the winners.
 
To support this mission, we believe in a few key tenants:

Data and insights need to flow freely in an organization for the best decisions to be made. Companies that invest in this effort will improve their chances for success.
There is a distinct competitive advantage to be gained from creating a virtuous cycle of rapid testing and analysis of results from many data sources.
There is huge potential value in aggregating integrated data across customers of Media Insights. Customers can benefit from sophisticated cohort analysis leading to new insights into best practices, vendor performance etc. 

To accelerate the fulfillment of this mission, we have established four key cultural values. Beyond “it’s the right thing to do”, each value has a business imperative or ‘why’.
 
Our values are:

Integrity — Our customers, employees, partners and other stakeholders will receive the respect they are due.
				

Diversity — We survive and thrive on the merits of our ideas. Therefore, we invest in more perspectives, enable a creative friction to produce the best ideas and encourage an environment to question the status quo.
				

Empathy — Knowing your audience is everything when conveying a new idea or motivating them to take action.
				

Curiosity — Innovation is most frequently a product of asking why, how and why not.
				
 
These values are reinforced by specific policies and processes that embed these traits into the organization. This is our ‘how’. This enables our teammates to execute quickly as objectives are pursued and guidance is only required when an initiative or tactic potentially conflicts with a cultural value.

How do you drive your video business when the insights to inform decisions are locked in silos?






 



We believe that effective use of data will be a decisive factor in determining the winners in the future of television. The continued fragmentation of the traditional pay television audience has created new opportunities and challenges for media companies. Consumers are spending more time on social sites, OTT services, and personal devices. While this has made reaching audiences more complex, the bigger issue is that eventually, revenue should align with attention, which will mean a decline in income from traditional pay television; with the potential to replace it with online offerings.
With these dynamics as a backdrop, media companies have had to find new ways to reach their target audience. These efforts have created new silos of critical data that business leaders need to see, compare and synthesize to make informed decisions, and track their results. To compete effectively in this evolving market, media companies will need a new level of sophistication in their business intelligence tools. As alternative platforms continue to grow, this will become increasingly urgent.
As veterans of cloud computing and the online video market, the team behind Wicket Labs is setting out on a new mission to level the playing field for media companies in an arena where data and insights drive winning strategies.
