History[edit]
Security First Corp was founded in 2002[5] by Mark O'Hare, a 26 year Navy veteran[6] who had served as Program Executive Officer of the US Navy Aircraft Carrier Program.[1]
In 2008, information technology company Unisys integrated Security First's Secure Parser technology into its Stealth brand software for Windows servers and desktops.[7]
In June 2009, the company acquired Silicon Valley-based DRC Computer Corporation (DRC), a developer of acceleration coprocessors. Security First was reportedly using DRC's products for an information security appliance, and planned to operate DRC as a wholly owned subsidiary.[8]
In August 2011, IBM announced they were integrating three of Security First's cryptographic technologies into its next generation of chips, to increase their security.[9]
In December 2014, Security First released SPxSHARC for VMware's vCenter Server, running on VMWare's ESXi hypervisor.[10]
In 2015, IBM announced it was using Security First's SPxBitFiler-IPS encryption technology to allow IBM's PureApplication System virtual pattern deployers to encrypt on-disk data. The technology is also licensed by IBM for its Cloud Data Encryption Service (ICDES).[3][11]
Products[edit]
Security First's core product is Secure Parser Extended (SPx) technology, which encrypts data, scrambles it randomly and disperses it to different locations.[12] The technology combines AES-256 certified encryption, multi-factor secret sharing with keyed information dispersal, and cryptographic random bit-splitting. The solution is compliant with common government and industry data protection standards and security requirements.[6]
The company offers SPx SHARC, a security suite designed for multi-site data protection, SPx Gateway, a data protection solution designed to protect data stored across multiple cloud computing service providers, a process the company calls "Cloud Spanning",[13] and ParsedCloud, a file transfer application that encrypts, splits and transfers data between multiple sites, available in free and fee-based versions.[1]
Media coverage[edit]
In December 2014, former Apple CEO John Sculley was interviewed on Fox News and called Security First's bitsplitting technology a "gamechanger".[4]
Funding[edit]
In a December 2014 SEC filing, the company announced it had raised $29 Million from sales of debt and equity, from undisclosed investors.[14] In an April 2016 SEC filing, the company announced it had raised an additional $36 Million from sales of debt and equity, also from undisclosed investors.[15]
Subsidiaries[edit]
The company operates DRC Computer corporation as a wholly owned subsidiary.[8]

The company offers SPx SHARC, a security suite designed for multi-site data protection, SPx Gateway, a data protection solution designed to protect data stored across multiple cloud computing service providers, a process the company calls "Cloud Spanning",[13] and ParsedCloud, a file transfer application that encrypts, splits and transfers data between multiple sites, available in free and fee-based versions.[1]
Media coverage[edit]
In December 2014, former Apple CEO John Sculley was interviewed on Fox News and called Security First's bitsplitting technology a "gamechanger".[4]
Funding[edit]
In a December 2014 SEC filing, the company announced it had raised $29 Million from sales of debt and equity, from undisclosed investors.[14] In an April 2016 SEC filing, the company announced it had raised an additional $36 Million from sales of debt and equity, also from undisclosed investors.[15]

History[edit]
Security First Corp was founded in 2002[5] by Mark O'Hare, a 26 year Navy veteran[6] who had served as Program Executive Officer of the US Navy Aircraft Carrier Program.[1]
In 2008, information technology company Unisys integrated Security First's Secure Parser technology into its Stealth brand software for Windows servers and desktops.[7]
In June 2009, the company acquired Silicon Valley-based DRC Computer Corporation (DRC), a developer of acceleration coprocessors. Security First was reportedly using DRC's products for an information security appliance, and planned to operate DRC as a wholly owned subsidiary.[8]
In August 2011, IBM announced they were integrating three of Security First's cryptographic technologies into its next generation of chips, to increase their security.[9]
In December 2014, Security First released SPxSHARC for VMware's vCenter Server, running on VMWare's ESXi hypervisor.[10]
In 2015, IBM announced it was using Security First's SPxBitFiler-IPS encryption technology to allow IBM's PureApplication System virtual pattern deployers to encrypt on-disk data. The technology is also licensed by IBM for its Cloud Data Encryption Service (ICDES).[3][11]
Products[edit]
Security First's core product is Secure Parser Extended (SPx) technology, which encrypts data, scrambles it randomly and disperses it to different locations.[12] The technology combines AES-256 certified encryption, multi-factor secret sharing with keyed information dispersal, and cryptographic random bit-splitting.

Security First Corp. Competition

   Keeping data private and safe is Security First's top priority. The company's SecureParser product works by encrypting data, splitting (or parsing) it into a number of shares set by the user, then encrypting the data again and storing it in multiple locations on a network. Its software is used to securely share information, protect sensitive corporate data from unauthorized access, and enable the recovery of data if a network is damaged. Security First also sells and supports security software from other vendors such as Unisys' Stealth product; other partners include IBM and Intel. Security First was founded in 2002 by CEO Mark O'Hare.
