"Mitch has been an invaluable asset to our Company and we are delighted he has agreed to assume the Chairmanship of the Board of Directors," remarked Eric I. Richman, President and Chief Executive Officer.   "As a former Director and Treasurer of the Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO), his extensive experience and long tenure in the biotechnology industry provides a broad network of contacts and vast institutional knowledge to assist us as we continue to focus on making PharmAthene the leading provider of urgently needed medical countermeasures for the nation."
"We are extremely grateful for the wisdom, guidance and support our former Chairman, John Pappajohn, has contributed to our organization over the last several years." continued Mr. Richman.  "On behalf of our management team and fellow Board members, we extend our sincere gratitude to John for his tireless service and dedication to PharmAthene."
