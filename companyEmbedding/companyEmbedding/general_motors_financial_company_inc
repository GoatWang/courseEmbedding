General Motors Financial Company, Inc. is the financial services arm of General Motors. The company is a global provider of auto finance, with operations in the United States, Canada, Europe, China and Latin America. The company is headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, where it is one of the city's largest employers.[2]
Founded in 1992 as AmeriCredit Corp., the company was acquired by GM in October 2010 and renamed General Motors Financial Company, Inc. The company provides retail loan and lease programs through auto dealers for customers across the credit spectrum. They also offer commercial lending products, such as retail floorplan, construction and real estate loans, or insurance for car dealerships.
Before its acquisition by GM, the company ranked at 768 on the Fortune 1000.[3]
Acquisition by General Motors[edit]
In July 2010, General Motors entered into a definitive agreement to acquire AmeriCredit in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $3.5 billion. The deal provided GM with a new financial arm to replace the loss of GMAC (now Ally Financial) in 2006.[4] Following the approval of the deal by AmeriCredit shareholders, GM renamed the company "GM Financial" on Oct. 1, 2010.[5]
On Sept. 4, 2014, GM and GM Financial announced they entered into a support agreement providing for leverage limits and liquidity support to GM Financial if needed, as well as other general terms of support. Under the terms of the agreement, as GM Financial expands its product portfolio and grows its business, GM committed to provide funding to GM Financial if its earning assets leverage ratio rises above pre-determined thresholds. GM extended an intercompany revolving credit facility to GM Financial to provide up to $1 billion of liquidity if needed. This facility, which is subordinate to GM Financial’s senior unsecured and secured debt, will replace an existing $600 million line of credit from GM. The agreement also provides that GM will use its commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that GM Financial will continue to be designated as a subsidiary borrower on up to $4 billion of GM’s corporate revolving line of credit.[6]
Since being acquired by GM in 2010, GM Financial has significantly increased its share of GM’s business which now represents 75 percent of GM Financial’s consumer loan and lease originations.[6]
On Sept. 25, 2014, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services upgraded the credit ratings of both GM and GM Financial to investment grade with a stable outlook. The new GM corporate and GM Financial credit rating is BBB-.[7] On June 18, 2015, Fitch Ratings upgraded the credit ratings of both GM and GM Financial with a stable outlook. The new GM corporate and GM Financial credit rating is BBB-.[8]
International operations[edit]
In April 2011, GM Financial acquired FinanciaLinx, one of the largest independent leasing companies in Canada, to expand product offerings into Canada.[9] FinanciaLinx operates as a subsidiary of GM Financial.
In November 2012, GM Financial announced the acquisition of Ally Financial's international assets.[10] The transaction includes operations in Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, Peru, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. It also includes Ally’s 40-percent interest in its Chinese joint venture GMAC-SAIC Motor. The majority of those assets were closed in 2013, with the remaining portion, an equity interest in a joint venture in China, completed Jan. 2, 2015.[11]

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Basis of Presentation This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) should be read in conjunction with the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our 2016 Form 10-K. Our European Operations are presented as discontinued operations, and the assets and liabilities of our European Operations are presented as held for sale in our condensed consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. Unless otherwise indicated, information in this discussion and analysis relates to continuing operations. Refer to Note 2 - "Discontinued Operations" to our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding our planned disposal of these operations. Forward-looking statements in this MD&A are not guarantees of future performance and may involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Refer to the "Forward-Looking Statements" section of this MD&A and the "Risk Factors" section of our 2016 Form 10-K for a discussion of these risks and uncertainties. Except as otherwise specified, dollar amounts presented within tables are stated in millions. Retail Our retail automobile finance programs in the U.S. include full-spectrum lending and leasing offered through GM-franchised dealers under the "GM Financial" brand. We also offer a sub-prime lending product through non-GM-franchised and select independent dealers under the "AmeriCredit" brand. Our sub-prime lending program is designed to serve customers who have limited access to automobile financing through banks and credit unions. We therefore generally charge higher rates than those charged by banks and credit unions and expect to sustain a higher level of credit losses than on prime lending. We finance new GM vehicles, moderately-priced new vehicles from other manufacturers, and later-model, low mileage used vehicles. Our international retail lending and leasing programs focus on financing new GM vehicles and select used vehicles. We also offer finance and/or car-related insurance products through third parties, such as payment protection, gap, extended warranty, and motor insurance. We have expanded our leasing and prime lending programs through GM-franchised dealerships in the U.S.; therefore, leasing and prime lending have become a larger percentage of our originations and retail portfolio balance. We have been the exclusive subvented lease provider for GM in the U.S. since April 2015 and the exclusive subvented loan provider for GM in the U.S. since January 2016. The following table presents our retail loan and lease originations in the North America Segment by FICO score band or equivalents: Six Months Ended June 30, 2017 2016 Amount Percentage Amount Percentage Prime - FICO Score 680 and greater $ 16,449 74.1 % $ 12,554 68.6 % Near-prime - FICO Score 620 to 679 2,536 11.4 2,412 13.2 Sub-prime - FICO Score less than 620 3,211 14.5 3,326 18.2 Total originations $ 22,196 100.0 % $ 18,292 100.0 %  The following table summarizes additional information for operating leases (in thousands):   Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Operating leases originated(a) 185 171 356 357 Operating leases terminated(b) 85 31 144 58 Operating lease vehicles returned(c) 57 14 95 27 Return rate(d) 67 % 45 % 66 % 47 % ________________  (b) Operating leases terminated represents the number of vehicles for which the lease has ended during a given period.  (c) Operating lease vehicles returned represents the number of vehicles returned to us for remarketing at the end of the lease term.  (d) Return rates are calculated as the number of operating leases returned divided by the number of operating leases terminated.  Table of Contents   GENERAL MOTORS FINANCIAL COMPANY, INC. Operating leases terminated and operating lease vehicles returned increased due to the growth and maturity of the lease portfolio. Due to the current age and size of our lease portfolio, the current return rate is lower than we expect it to be in future periods as our lease portfolio grows and matures. The following table summarizes the residual value and the number of units included in leased vehicles, net by vehicle type (units in thousands): June 30, 2017 December 31, 2016 Residual Value Units Percentage Residual Value Units Percentage Cars $ 5,814 459 29.9 % $ 5,240 420 31.7 % Trucks 6,136 256 16.7 5,231 224 16.9 CUVs 12,383 732 47.7 10,349 604 45.7 SUVs 3,262 88 5.7 2,791 75 5.7 Total $ 27,595 1,535 100.0 % $ 23,611 1,323 100.0 %  We expect used car prices to decline approximately 7% during 2017 as compared to 2016 and expect an increased supply of used vehicles to continue to pressure used car prices through at least 2018. We are currently experiencing weaker residual values, especially in the crossover segment.  Table of Contents GENERAL MOTORS FINANCIAL COMPANY, INC.  will not occur unless the transfer of the Opel/Vauxhall Business occurs. Refer to Note 2 - "Discontinued Operations" to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more information related to the assets and liabilities held for sale and discontinued operations of our European Operations. Our principal focus is on expanding our business in the U.S. to reach full captive penetration levels; therefore, we do not expect that the sale of our European Operations will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, liquidity or financing strategies, including the mix of secured and unsecured debt issuances. We also do not expect that the sale of our European Operations will result in a material increase in our ratio of total debt to total equity or our earning assets leverage ratio as calculated under our Support Agreement with GM. Due to the size of the prime retail loan portfolio held by our European Operations, we expect that, for a period of time following the sale, retail operating leases will make up a greater percentage of our earning assets than they have historically. As our U.S. operations increase purchases of prime retail loans, we expect that our earning asset mix will return to more recent historical levels. We may make a special dividend to GM following the completion of the sale.

The effective yield on our retail finance receivables decreased due primarily to a decrease in the average annual percentage rate on new originations in the U.S. as we have increased our prime lending. The effective yield represents finance charges and fees recorded in earnings during the period as a percentage of average retail finance receivables. The effective yield, as a percentage of average retail finance receivables, is higher than the contractual rates of our auto finance contracts primarily because the effective yield includes, in addition to the contractual rates and fees, the impact of rate subvention provided by GM.

Other Comprehensive Income Foreign Currency Translation Adjustment Foreign currency translation adjustments included in other comprehensive income (loss) were $104 million and $(83) million for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016.

General Motors Financial Company, Inc. Key Developments

General Motors Financial Company, Inc. Announces Unaudited Consolidated Earnings Results for the Second Quarter and Six Months Ended June 30, 2017; Reports Net Charge-Offs for the Second Quarter Ended June 30, 2017; Provides Earnings Guidance for 2017
Jul 25 17
General Motors Financial Company, Inc. announced unaudited consolidated earnings results for the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2017. For the quarter, the company reported total revenue of $2,990 million compared to $2,138 million a year ago. Income from continuing operations before income taxes was $356 million compared to $213 million a year ago. Income from continuing operations was $270 million compared to $143 million a year ago. Net income was $62 million compared to $189 million a year ago.

For the six months, the company reported total revenue of $5,738 million compared to $4,069 million a year ago. Income from continuing operations before income taxes was $585 million compared to $406 million a year ago. Income from continuing operations was $449 million compared to $281 million a year ago. Net income was $264 million compared to $353 million a year ago.

For the second quarter ended June 30, 2017, the company reported net charge-offs was $130 million compared to $128 million a year ago.

The company expects its full year 2017 earnings to exceed full year 2016 earnings from continuing operations, which were $763 million. However, the company anticipates that its second half earnings will be down from the first half due to lower year-over-year and seasonally weaker used car pricing, higher lease returns and the retiming of some of its infrastructure spending and OpEx spending from the first half into the second half of the year.


General Motors Financial Company, Inc. expected to report Q2 2017 results on July 28, 2017. This event was calculated by Capital IQ (Created on July 25, 2017).

About GM Financial


GM Financial is the wholly owned captive finance subsidiary of General Motors, and is headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas. The company is a global provider of auto finance solutions, with operations in the U.S., Canada, China, Europe and Latin America. Through our long-standing relationships with auto dealers, we offer attractive retail financing and lease programs to meet the needs of each customer. We also offer commercial lending products to dealers to help them finance and grow their businesses.

Our Business & Our History
GM Financial was founded as AmeriCredit in September 1992 and opened its first branch office in Fort Worth, Texas. On October 1, 2010, AmeriCredit Corp. was acquired by General Motors Company and renamed General Motors Financial Company, Inc. (GM Financial). In 2011, GM Financial acquired FinanciaLinx to serve GM dealers and customers throughout Canada. In November 2012, GM Financial announced the acquisition of Ally Financial Inc.’s international operations. The majority of those acquisitions were finalized in 2013, with the remaining market, a 35 percent equity interest in a joint venture in China, acquired in January 2015.
GM Financial has operations in more than 20 countries, providing auto finance solutions to approximately 16,000 dealers worldwide and earning assets of $74 billion, at Sept. 30, 2016.

Corporate Governance 
GM Financial's success is largely dependent on building strong, lasting relationships with our dealers and the consumer customers that we serve. This is why we are committed to providing best-in-class customer service, while promoting open, honest communication at all levels.
Our executive team and all employees must adhere to GM Financial's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. Our Code outlines the principles by which all team members conduct business with customers, vendors and each other. These principles apply to all GM Financial team members and affiliates and although it does not cover every issue that may arise, the Code provides guidelines for all employees in regard to their business conduct.
For a deeper understanding of expectations and guidelines set forth for the entire GM Financial team, please review GM Financial's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics policies below.
