                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

defined in Section 9-102 of the UCC (in those capacities, the
“ Financial Institution ”).

 
ARTICLE I
USAGE AND DEFINITIONS
 

Section
1.1.          
Usage and Definitions .  Capitalized terms used but not
otherwise defined in this Agreement are defined in Appendix A to
the Sale and Servicing Agreement, dated as of November 1, 2014,

Company LLC, as Servicer.  Appendix A also contains rules as
to usage applicable to this Agreement.  Appendix A is

to the “ UCC ” mean the Uniform Commercial Code
as in effect in the State of New York.

 
ARTICLE II
ESTABLISHMENT OF COLLATERAL ACCOUNTS
 

Section
2.1.          
Description of Account .  The Financial Institution has
established the following accounts (each, a “ Collateral
Account ”):

 

“Collection Account —
The Bank of New York Mellon as Indenture Trustee, as secured party
for Ford Credit Auto Owner Trust 2014-C” with account number
856660;

 

“Reserve Account — The
Bank of New York Mellon as Indenture Trustee, as secured party for
Ford Credit Auto Owner Trust 2014-C” with account number
856661; and

 

“Principal Payment Account
— The Bank of New York Mellon as Indenture Trustee, as
secured party for Ford Credit Auto Owner Trust 2014-C” with
account number 856662.

 

Section
2.2.          
Account Modifications .  Neither the Financial
Institution nor the Grantor will change the name or account number
of any Collateral Account without the prior written consent of the
Secured Party.

 

Section
2.3.          
Type of Account .  The Financial Institution agrees
that each Collateral Account is, and will be maintained as, either
(a) a “securities account” (as defined in Section 8-501
of the UCC) or (b) a “deposit account” (as defined in
Section 9-102(a)(29) of the UCC).

 

Section
2.4.          
Securities Account Provisions .  If and to the extent
any Collateral Account is a securities account (within the meaning
of Section 8-501 of the UCC) the Financial Institution agrees
that:

 





 

(a)          
all securities, financial assets or other investment property
(other than cash) credited to each Collateral Account will be
registered in the name of the Financial Institution, indorsed to
the Financial Institution or in blank or credited to another
securities account maintained in the name of the Financial
Institution.  In no case will any financial asset credited to
any Collateral Account be registered in the name of the Grantor,
payable to the order of the Grantor or specially indorsed to the
Grantor unless the foregoing have been specially indorsed to the
Financial Institution or in blank; and

 

(b)          
all financial assets delivered to the Financial Institution
pursuant to the Indenture will be promptly credited to the
appropriate Collateral Account; and each item of property (whether
investment property, financial asset, security or instrument)
credited to any Collateral Account will be treated as a
“financial asset” within the meaning of Section
8-102(a)(9) of the UCC.

 
ARTICLE III
SECURED PARTY CONTROL
 

Section
3.1.          
Control for Purposes of UCC .  If the Financial
Institution receives any order from the Secured Party or its
authorized agent (a) directing disposition of funds in any
Collateral Account or (b) directing transfer or redemption of the
financial assets relating to the Collateral Accounts (a “
Secured Party Order ”), the Financial Institution will
comply with the Secured Party Order without further consent by the
Grantor or any other person.

 

Section
3.2.          
Conflicting Orders or Instructions .  Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if at any time, the
Financial Institution receives conflicting orders or instructions
from the Secured Party and the Grantor, the Financial Institution
will follow the orders or instructions of the Secured Party and not
the Grantor.  The Financial Institution will (a) have no
obligation to investigate or inquire as to whether the Secured
Party is entitled pursuant to the Indenture or otherwise to deliver
any Secured Party Order and (b) be entitled to rely on
communications (including Secured Party Orders) believed by it in
good faith to be genuine and given by the appropriate
party.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Fitch Expects to Rate Ford Credit Auto Owner Trust 2014-C | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Expects to Rate Ford Credit Auto Owner Trust 2014-C
    





November 14, 2014 10:15 AM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings expects to assign the following ratings and Outlooks to 
      the notes issued by Ford Credit Auto Owner Trust 2014-C:
    

      --$381,500,000 class A-1 'F1+sf';
    

      --$508,000,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$504,400,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$105,510,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$47,350,000 class B 'AA+sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$31,570,000 class C 'A+sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$31,570,000 class D 'NRsf'.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Stable Credit Quality: The 2014-C pool is consistent with prior deals, 
      with a WA FICO score of 731 and 89.4% new vehicle contracts. The pool is 
      geographically diverse with WA seasoning of 9 months, while 43.9% of the 
      pool consists of loans with terms of more than 60 months.
    

      Adequate Credit Enhancement Structure: The cash flow distribution is a 
      sequential-pay structure. Initial hard credit enhancement (CE) for the 
      class A notes totals 5.50%, consisting of 7.00% subordination and a 
      0.50% non-declining reserve offset by under-collateralization of 2.00%, 
      on an adjusted pool basis.
    

      Stable Portfolio/Securitization Performance: Delinquencies and losses on 
      Ford Credit's portfolio and 2009-2013 securitizations are currently at 
      low levels, supported by the improving U.S. economy and stable used 
      vehicle values, although they are expected to soften over the next year.
    

      Positive Corporate Performance: Fitch's current Long-Term (LT) Issuer 
      Default Ratings (IDRs) of Ford Motor Company (Ford), parent of Ford 
      Credit, and Ford Credit is 'BBB-' with a Positive Rating Outlook.
    

      Slow Economic Recovery: A slower recovery and potential for volatility 
      could affect delinquencies and losses. Fitch's analysis accounts for 
      this risk by including poorer performing vintages from the recent 
      recession in the base case loss analysis.
    

      Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: Ford Credit demonstrates 
      adequate abilities as originator, underwriter and servicer, as evidenced 
      by historical portfolio and securitizations' delinquency and loss 
      performance. Fitch deems Ford Credit an adequate servicer to service 
      2014-C.
    

      Integrity of Legal Structure: The legal structure of the transaction 
      should provide that a bankruptcy of Ford Credit would not impair the 
      timeliness of payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case. This could result in potential rating actions on the notes. Fitch 
      evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to all classes of Ford 
      Credit Auto Owner Trust 2014-C to increased losses over the life of the 
      transaction. Fitch's analysis found that the class B and C notes display 
      some sensitivity to increased defaults and losses, showing potential 
      downgrades of up to one category under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case 
      loss) scenario. All classes of notes could experience downgrades of up 
      to two rating categories under Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) 
      scenario.
    

      Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further detailed in the 
      accompanying presale report, available at 'www.fitchratings.com'
