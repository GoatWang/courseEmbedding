Our Missions In Life



 
We are very much committed to all forms of sustainable energy, sustainable housing and education of individuals learning a skilled trade that they can put to use to earn a comfortable living.
We are very committed to bringing to low income families the ability to acquire suitable Single Family Rental Housing with a Local Housing Authority Section 8 rental voucher or take the path of becoming a homeowner by providing internal financing to them without breaking the bank.
We are very much committed to teaching/educating individuals of the vast profits available to them with very little investment on their part in the industrial, commercial and residential markets.
By bringing to bear our combined strengths and intense backgrounds acquired during the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) era of failed lending institutions my mother, father, my brothers and I formed this company as we recognized the need for water resources conservation, energy resources conservation and sustainable housing in times of a financial meltdown.
That knowledge along with our expertise in MTM bundling, the business banking treasury investment mechanisms, resource allocation and acquisition, FHA, HUD, FNMA, FREDDIE MAC investment procedures and practices, internal workings of other government lending and investment vehicle programs both Nationally and Internationally are the initial reasons for the creation of Sunshine Ventures II  LLC.

About








Our History



Our company buys and sells homes. We will not be acting as your real estate agent or broker if we buy your house or sell you a house. We are excited to potentially work with you directly OR if you are represented by an agent or broker. We are focused on improving neighborhoods and redeveloping areas that we work in. If you have additional questions on agencies please contact your local real estate commission.
 











Our Story



We embrace technology because it can streamline and automate much of the home buying and selling process, cutting back on the time and frustration involved in buying your next home or selling your current one. We use a state-of-the-art business management system, keeping our business extremely organized and efficient so that we're able to spend less time shuffling paperwork and more time helping our clients through one on one interaction.
