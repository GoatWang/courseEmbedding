material change in the Realized Tax Benefit or Realized Tax Detriment for such Taxable Year attributable to an amended Tax Return filed for such Taxable Year, or (vi) to adjust the Exchange Basis Schedule to take into account payments made pursuant to this Agreement (such Schedule, an "Amended Schedule").
ARTICLE III
TAX BENEFIT PAYMENTS
Section 3.01.   Payments.
(a)           Payments. Within five (5) calendar days of a Tax Benefit Schedule delivered to an applicable Limited Partner becoming final in accordance with Section 2.04(a), each of the Corporate Taxpayers shall pay to the applicable Limited Partner for such Taxable Year the Tax Benefit Payment determined pursuant to Section 3.01(b). Each such Tax Benefit Payment shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account of the applicable Limited Partner previously designated by such Limited Partner to each of the Corporate Taxpayers or as otherwise agreed by the Corporate Taxpayer and the applicable Limited Partner. For the avoidance of doubt, no Tax Benefit Payment shall be made in respect of estimated tax payments, including, without limitation, federal income tax payments.
(b)           A "Tax Benefit Payment" means an amount, not less than zero, equal to 85% of the sum of the Net Tax Benefit and the Interest Amount. The "Net Tax Benefit" shall equal: (1) the Corporate Taxpayers' Realized Tax Benefit, if any, for a Taxable Year plus (2) the amount of the excess Realized Tax Benefit reflected on an Amended Tax Benefit Schedule for a previous Taxable Year over the Realized Tax Benefit (or Realized Tax Detriment (expressed as a negative number)) reflected on the Tax Benefit Schedule for such previous Taxable Year, minus (3) an amount equal to each of the Corporate Taxpayer's Realized Tax Detriment (if any) for the current or any previous Taxable Year, minus (4) the amount of the excess Realized Tax Benefit reflected on a Tax Benefit Schedule for a previous Taxable Year over the Realized Tax Benefit (or Realized Tax Detriment (expressed as a negative number)) reflected on the Amended Tax Benefit Schedule for such previous Taxable Year; provided, however, that to the extent of the amounts described in 3.01(b)(2), (3) and (4) were taken into account in determining any Tax Benefit Payment in a preceding Taxable Year, such amounts shall not be taken into account in determining a Tax Benefit Payment attributable to any other Taxable Year; provided, further, for the avoidance of doubt, no applicable Limited Partner shall be required to return any portion of any previously made Tax Benefit Payment. The "Interest Amount" shall equal the interest on the Net Tax Benefit calculated at the Agreed Rate from the due date (without extensions) for filing the Corporate Taxpayer Return with respect to Taxes for such Taxable Year until the Payment Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for each Taxable Year ending on or after the date of a Change of Control, all Tax Benefit Payments, whether paid with respect to Partnership Units that were exchanged (i) prior to the date of such Change of Control or (ii) on or after the date of such Change of Control, shall be calculated by utilizing Valuation Assumptions (1), (3), and (4), substituting in each case the terms "the closing date of a Change of Control" for an "Early Termination Date".

(a)           Each of Corporate Taxpayers may terminate this Agreement with respect to all of the Partnership Units held (or previously held and exchanged) by all Limited Partners at any time by paying to all of the applicable Limited Partners the Early Termination Payment; provided, however, that this Agreement shall only terminate upon the receipt of the Early Termination Payment by all Limited Partners, and provided, further, that each of the Corporate Taxpayers may withdraw any notice to execute its termination rights under this Section 4.01(a) prior to the time at which any Early Termination Payment has been paid. Upon payment of the Early Termination Payments by a Corporate Taxpayer, neither the applicable Limited Partners nor the Corporate Taxpayer shall have any further payment obligations under this Agreement in respect of such Limited Partners, other than for any (a) Tax Benefit Payment agreed to by such Corporate Taxpayer and the applicable Limited Partner as due and payable but unpaid as of the Early Termination Notice and (b) Tax Benefit Payment due for the Taxable Year ending with or including the date of the Early Termination Notice (except to the extent that the amount described in clause (b) is included in the Early Termination Payment).

(b)           In the event that a Corporate Taxpayer breaches any of its material obligations under this Agreement, whether as a result of failure to make any payment when due, failure to honor any other material obligation required hereunder or by operation of law as a result of the rejection of this Agreement in a case commenced under the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise, then all obligations hereunder shall be accelerated and such obligations shall be calculated as if an Early Termination Notice had been delivered on the date of such breach and shall include, but not be limited to, (1) the Early Termination Payment calculated as if an Early
 
 
10





Termination Notice had been delivered on the date of a breach, (2) any Tax Benefit Payment agreed to by such Corporate Taxpayer and any Limited Partners as due and payable but unpaid as of the date of a breach, and (3) any Tax Benefit Payment due for the Taxable Year ending with or including the date of a breach. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a Corporate Taxpayer breaches this Agreement, the Limited Partners shall be entitled to elect to receive the amounts set forth in (1), (2) and (3), above or to seek specific performance of the terms hereof. The parties agree that the failure to make any payment due pursuant to this Agreement within three months of the date such payment is due shall be deemed to be a breach of a material obligation under this Agreement for all purposes of this Agreement, and that it will not be considered to be a breach of a material obligation under this Agreement to make a payment due pursuant to this Agreement within three months of the date such payment is due.
(c)           The undersigned parties agree that the aggregate value of the Tax Benefit Payments cannot be ascertained with any reasonable certainty for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Section 4.02.   Early Termination Notice. If a Corporate Taxpayer chooses to exercise its right of early termination under Section 4.01 above, such Corporate Taxpayer shall deliver to the applicable Limited Partner notice of such intention to exercise such right ("Early Termination Notice") and a schedule (the "Early Termination Schedule") specifying such Corporate Taxpayer's intention to exercise such right and showing in reasonable detail the calculation of the Early Termination Payment. The applicable Early Termination Schedule shall become final and binding on all parties unless the applicable Limited Partner Group Member, within 30 calendar days after receiving the Early Termination Schedule thereto provides such Corporate Taxpayer with notice of a material objection to such Schedule made in good faith ("Material Objection Notice"); provided, for the sake of clarity, only Limited Partner Group Members shall have the right to object to any Schedule or Amended Schedule pursuant to this Section 4.02. If the parties, for any reason, are unable to successfully resolve the issues raised in such notice within 30 calendar days after receipt by such Corporate Taxpayer of the Material Objection Notice, such Corporate Taxpayer and the applicable Limited Partner Group Member shall employ the Reconciliation Procedures as described in Section 7.09 of this Agreement.
Section 4.03.   Payment upon Early Termination. (a) Within three calendar days after agreement between the applicable Limited Partner and a Corporate Taxpayer of the Early Termination Schedule, such Corporate Taxpayer shall pay to the applicable Limited Partner an amount equal to the Early Termination Payment. Such payment shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account designated by the applicable Limited Partner or as otherwise agreed by the Corporate Taxpayer and the applicable Limited Partner.
(b)           The "Early Termination Payment" as of the date of the delivery of an Early Termination Schedule shall equal with respect to the applicable Limited Partner the present value, discounted at the Early Termination Rate as of such date, of all Tax Benefit Payments that would be required to be paid by a Corporate Taxpayer to the applicable Limited Partner beginning from the Early Termination Date assuming the Valuation Assumptions are applied.

Section 7.08.   Resolution of Disputes.
(a)           Any and all disputes which cannot be settled amicably, including any ancillary claims of any party, arising out of, relating to or in connection with the validity, negotiation, execution, interpretation, performance or non-performance of this Agreement (including the validity, scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision) shall be finally settled by arbitration conducted by a single arbitrator in New York in accordance with the then-existing Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce. If the parties to the dispute fail to agree on the selection of an arbitrator within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the request for arbitration, the International Chamber of Commerce shall make the appointment.  The arbitrator shall be a lawyer and shall conduct the proceedings in the English language.
Performance under this Agreement shall continue if reasonably possible during any arbitration proceedings.
(b)           Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a), each of the Corporate Taxpayers may bring an action or special proceeding in any court of competent jurisdiction for the purpose of compelling a party to arbitrate, seeking temporary or preliminary relief in aid of an arbitration hereunder, and/or enforcing an arbitration award and, for the purposes of this paragraph (b), each Limited Partner (i) expressly consents to the application of paragraph (c) of this Section 7.08 to any such action or proceeding, (ii) agrees that proof shall not be required that monetary damages for breach of the provisions of this Agreement would be difficult to calculate and that remedies at law would be inadequate, and (iii) irrevocably appoints each of the Corporate Taxpayers as such Limited Partner's agent for service of process in connection with any such action or proceeding and agrees that service of process upon such agent, who shall promptly advise such Limited Partner of any such service of process, shall be deemed in every respect effective service of process upon the Limited Partner in any such action or proceeding.
(c)           (i) EACH LIMITED PARTNER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE JURISDICTION OF COURTS LOCATED IN NEW YORK, NEW YORK FOR THE PURPOSE OF ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF PARAGRAPH (B) OF THIS SECTION 7.08, OR ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING ANCILLARY TO AN ARBITRATION OR CONTEMPLATED ARBITRATION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO OR CONCERNING THIS AGREEMENT. Such ancillary judicial proceedings include any suit, action or proceeding to compel arbitration, to obtain temporary or preliminary judicial relief in aid of arbitration, or to confirm an arbitration award. The parties acknowledge that the fora designated by this paragraph (c) have a reasonable relation to this Agreement, and to the parties' relationship with one another.
(ii)           The parties hereby waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any objection which they now or hereafter may have to personal jurisdiction or to the laying of venue of any such ancillary suit, action or proceeding brought in any court referred to in paragraph (c) (i) of this Section 7.08 and such parties agree not to plead or claim the same.
Section 7.09.   Reconciliation. In the event that a Corporate Taxpayer and the applicable Limited Partner Group Member are unable to resolve a disagreement with respect to
 
16





the matters governed by Sections 2.04, 4.02 and 6.02 within the relevant period designated in this Agreement ("Reconciliation Dispute"), the Reconciliation Dispute shall be submitted for determination to a nationally recognized expert (the "Expert") in the particular area of disagreement mutually acceptable to both parties. The Expert shall be a partner in a nationally recognized accounting firm or a law firm, and the Expert shall not, and the firm that employs the Expert shall not, have any material relationship with such Corporate Taxpayer or the applicable Limited Partner Group Member or other actual or potential conflict of interest. If the parties are unable to agree on an Expert within fifteen (15) days of receipt by the respondent(s) of written notice of a Reconciliation Dispute, the Expert shall be appointed by the International Chamber of Commerce Centre for Expertise. The Expert shall resolve any matter relating to the Exchange Basis Schedule or an amendment thereto or the Early Termination Schedule or an amendment thereto within 30 calendar days and shall resolve any matter relating to a Tax Benefit Schedule or an amendment thereto within 15 calendar days or as soon thereafter as is reasonably practicable, in each case after the matter has been submitted to the Expert for resolution. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the matter is not resolved before any payment that is the subject of a disagreement is due or any Tax Return reflecting the subject of a disagreement is due, such payment shall be made on the date prescribed by this Agreement and such Tax Return may be filed as prepared by such Corporate Taxpayer, subject to adjustment or amendment upon resolution. The costs and expenses relating to the engagement of such Expert or amending any Tax Return shall be borne by the Corporate Taxpayer; except as provided in the next sentence. Each of the Corporate Taxpayers and each applicable Limited Partner Group Member shall bear their own costs and expenses of such proceeding, unless the Limited Partner Group Member has a prevailing position that is more than 10% of the payment at issue, in which case the Corporate Taxpayer shall reimburse such Limited Partner Group Member for any reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses in such proceeding. Any dispute as to whether a dispute is a Reconciliation Dispute within the meaning of this Section 7.09 shall be decided by the Expert. The Expert shall finally determine any Reconciliation Dispute and the determinations of the Expert pursuant to this Section 7.09 shall be binding on the Corporate Taxpayer and the applicable Limited Partner Group Member and may be entered and enforced in any court having jurisdiction.
Section 7.10.   Withholding. Each of the Corporate Taxpayers shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any payment payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as such Corporate Taxpayer is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Taxing Authority by the Corporate Taxpayer, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the applicable Limited Partner.
Section 7.11.   Affiliated Corporations of Other Blackstone Holdings General Partners; Admission of the Corporate Taxpayers into a Consolidated Group; Transfers of Corporate Assets.
(a)           The other Blackstone Holdings General Partners shall provide that all provisions of this Agreement shall correspondingly apply, including the payment of Tax Benefit Payments by any corporation owned directly or indirectly in whole or in part, now or in the future, by other Blackstone Holdings General Partners, with respect to any Realized Tax Benefit with respect to limited partner interests in other Blackstone Holdings Partnerships, that are part
 
17





of the Exchange and in which such corporation owns an interest, under the same terms and conditions as set forth in this Agreement, and the other Blackstone Holdings General Partners shall cause such corporation to execute and deliver a joinder to this Agreement to such effect.  If either (i) the Parent or any other Blackstone Holdings General Partner elects to be treated as a corporation for tax purposes, or (ii) the Parent holds any other Blackstone Holdings General Partner directly or indirectly through an entity that is treated as a corporation for tax purposes, then the provisions of this Agreement shall apply (w) to such other Blackstone Holdings General Partner in the same manner as it applies to the Corporate Taxpayers and (x) to each partnership, limited partnership and limited liability company Controlled by any other Blackstone Holdings General Partner as if each such entity were a Partnership; provided that, if any Partnership Units or limited partner interests in other Blackstone Holdings Partnerships were Exchanged prior to an event described in clause (i) or (ii) above, then (y) such Exchange shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as having occurred immediately after such event at the Fair Market Value in existence at the time of such prior Exchange, and (z) the entity that is to be treated in the same manner as the Corporate Taxpayers shall be required to make the same Tax Benefit Payments pursuant to the terms of this Agreement that it would have been required to make had it been treated in the same manner as the Corporate Taxpayers on the date of such Exchange; provided, however, that such Tax Benefit Payments shall be payable only with respect to (I) Original Assets that are still owned at the time of the event described in clause (i) or (ii) above, and (II) taxable years of such entity ending on or after the date of the event described in clause (i) or (ii) above.  The parties agree that the terms of this Agreement will be applied to any corporation under this Section 7.11 only if the aggregate Tax Benefit Payments payable with respect to such corporation are reasonably expected to be more than $10 million.
(b)           If a Corporate Taxpayer becomes a member of an affiliated or consolidated group of corporations that files a consolidated income tax return pursuant to Sections 1501 et seq. of the Code or any corresponding provisions of state, local or foreign law, then: (i) the provisions of this Agreement shall be applied with respect to the group as a whole; and (ii) Tax Benefit Payments shall be computed with reference to the consolidated taxable income of the group as a whole.
(c)           Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if Parent acquires one or more assets that, as of an Exchange Date, have not been contributed to the Corporate Taxpayers (other than Parent's interests in the other Blackstone Holdings General Partners) (such assets, "Excluded Assets"), then all Tax Benefit Payments due hereunder shall be computed as if such assets had been contributed to the Corporate Taxpayers on a pro rata basis on the date such assets were first acquired by Parent; provided, however, that if an Excluded Asset consists of stock in a corporation, then, for purposes of this Section 7.11(c), (i) such corporation (and any corporation Controlled by such corporation) shall be deemed to have contributed its assets to the Corporate Taxpayer in a transaction described in Section 351 of the Code, and (ii) such Corporate Taxpayer shall be deemed to have contributed all such assets to the Partnerships, in each case on the date on which the Parent acquired stock of such corporation.
(d)           If any entity that is obligated to make an Exchange Payment hereunder transfers one or more assets to a corporation with which such entity does not file a consolidated tax return pursuant to Section 1501 of the Code, such entity, for purposes of calculating the amount of any Exchange Payment (e.g., calculating the gross income of the entity and
 
18





determining the Realized Tax Benefit of such entity) due hereunder, shall be treated as having disposed of such asset in a fully taxable transaction on the date of such contribution. The consideration deemed to be received by such entity shall be equal to the Fair Market Value of the contributed asset, plus (i) the amount of debt to which such asset is subject, in the case of a contribution of an encumbered asset or (ii) the amount of debt allocated to such asset, in the case of a contribution of a partner interest.
Section 7.12.   Confidentiality. Each Limited Partner and assignee acknowledges and agrees that the information of each of the Corporate Taxpayers is confidential and, except in the course of performing any duties as necessary for each of the Corporate Taxpayers and its Affiliates, as required by law or legal process or to enforce the terms of this Agreement, shall keep and retain in the strictest confidence and not to disclose to any Person all confidential matters, acquired pursuant to this Agreement, of each of the Corporate Taxpayers or any Person included within the Parent and their respective Affiliates and successors and the other Limited Partners, including, without limitation, the identity of the beneficial holders of interests in any fund or account managed by the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, confidential information concerning the Parent, any Person included within the Parent and their respective Affiliates and successors, the other Limited Partners and any fund, account or investment managed by any Person included within the Parent, including marketing, investment, performance data, fund management, credit and financial information, and other business affairs of each of the Corporate Taxpayers, any Person included within the Parent and their respective Affiliates and successors, the other Limited Partners and any fund, account or investment managed directly or indirectly by any Person included within each of the Corporate Taxpayers learned by the Limited Partner heretofore or hereafter. This clause 7.12 shall not apply to (i) any information that has been made publicly available by each of the Corporate Taxpayers or any of its Affiliates, becomes public knowledge (except as a result of an act of such Limited Partner in violation of this Agreement) or is generally known to the business community and (ii) the disclosure of information to the extent necessary for a Limited Partner to prepare and file his or her tax returns, to respond to any inquiries regarding the same from any taxing authority or to prosecute or defend any action, proceeding or audit by any taxing authority with respect to such returns. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, each Limited Partner (and each employee, representative or other agent of such Limited Partner) may disclose to any and all Persons, without limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and tax structure of (x) each of the Corporate Taxpayers and (y) any of its transactions, and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to the Limited Partners relating to such tax treatment and tax structure.
If a Limited Partner or assignee commits a breach, or threatens to commit a breach, of any of the provisions of this Section 7.12, each of the Corporate Taxpayers shall have the right and remedy to have the provisions of this Section 7.12 specifically enforced by injunctive relief or otherwise by any court of competent jurisdiction without the need to post any bond or other security, it being acknowledged and agreed that any such breach or threatened breach shall cause irreparable injury to each of the Corporate Taxpayers or any of its Subsidiaries or the other Limited Partners and the accounts and funds managed by each of the Corporate Taxpayers and that money damages alone shall not provide an adequate remedy to such Persons. Such rights and remedies shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other rights and remedies available at law or in equity.

Section 7.13.   Partnership Agreement. This Agreement shall be treated as part of the partnership agreement of each Partnership as described in Section 761(c) of the Code, and Sections 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(h) and 1.761-1(c) of the Treasury Regulations.
Section 7.14.   Partnerships. Each of the Corporate Taxpayers hereby agrees that, to the extent it acquires a general partner interest, managing member interest or similar interest in any Person after the date hereof, it shall cause such Person to execute and deliver a joinder to this Agreement and become a "Partnership" for all purposes of this Agreement.
Section 7.15.   Headings. The headings in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not limit or otherwise affect the meaning hereof.
