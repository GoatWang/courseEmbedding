The three types of malpractice are: a settlement, an arbitration award, or a judgment.If my doctor has malpractice history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact the quality of care you receive. Claim settlements and arbitration awards may occur for a variety of reasons, which should not necessarily reflect negatively on the doctor's professional competence or conduct.You may want to use this information to start a discussion with the doctor about his or her history and specific ability to provide healthcare for you.How far back does Healthgrades malpractice history go?Healthgrades reports details of a doctor’s malpractice history when the doctor has at least one closed medical malpractice claim within the last five years, even if he or she no longer practices in that state.For which states does Healthgrades collect malpractice history?Healthgrades collects malpractice information from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia.

Sanctions may be imposed by a state medical board, professional medical licensing organization, or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.If my doctor has sanction history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a sanction, it does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor-quality doctor. Some sanctions are not related to medical care, and involve a doctor’s finances or administrative activities. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, we recommend that you evaluate the doctor’s sanction information and determine how severe or relevant you think the sanction cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades sanction history go?Healthgrades reports state and federal sanctions from the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect sanction history?Healthgrades collects sanction history from all 50 U.S. states. Physicians with a disciplinary action in one state may move to another state where they have a clean record. Since Healthgrades painstakingly compiles disciplinary action information from all 50 states, Healthgrades website will show if a physician has a disciplinary action in more than one state.0Board ActionsNo board actions found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What are board actionsWhat are board actions?Board actions are non-disciplinary actions imposed upon a doctor based on a complaint investigation. A patient or medical colleague may file a complaint with that state medical board or professional licensing organization, which then investigates the complaint. Board actions are intended to ensure that a doctor is able to perform safe medical and health care tasks.Types of non-disciplinary actions include an advisory letter, a corrective action agreement, a limitation or restriction on the medical or healthcare tasks a doctor can perform, or a voluntary agreement by the doctor not to practice. A board action can also include a termination of a corrective action agreement or voluntary agreement, which allows the doctor to return to full practice.If my doctor has a board action, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a board action, it means he or she has had a non-disciplinary action imposed upon him or her. It does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor quality doctor. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, evaluate the doctor's board action information and determine how severe or relevant you think the cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades non-disciplinary board action history go?Healthgrades reports non-disciplinary board action history from for the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered.

Nike announces 1,400 layoffs as discretionary money dries up
Posted under US NEWS on June 15th, 2017 by THOMASDISHAW.COM

More bad news for retail. According to this Matthew Kish report Nike will be laying off 1,400 employees.
Nike on Thursday said it will cut 2 percent of its global workforce as it restructures to more quickly get products in the hands of consumers and respond to a rapidly changing consumer landscape.
The company previously announced the basic strategy, which it refers to as a “Triple Double” of speed, on its last earnings call.
Like other retailers, Nike is adapting to a consumer shift to online shopping. It’s also battling increased competition from a resurgent Adidas.
The layoffs will likely significantly affect the company’s Washington County headquarters. Nike reported 70,700 global workers on its last annual report. A 2 percent reduction would amount to about 1,400 layoffs.
Nike last month said it had 12,000 workers in Washington County. It is the second-largest private employer in the state after Intel Corp.
The strategic shifts include the creation of a Consumer Direct Offense, which will focus on getting personalized products to market.
“The future of sport will be decided by the company that obsesses the needs of the evolving consumer,” said CEO and Chairman Mark Parker, in a news release. “Through the Consumer Direct Offense, we’re getting even more aggressive in the digital marketplace, targeting key markets and delivering product faster than ever.”
Other retailers are also responding aggressively to shifts in behavior as more shopping is done online. Columbia Sportswear continues to role out changes in an ongoing reorganization.

TestimonialsEvery time we have our hair color rep come in I cringe. I usually fall asleep. Your energy, passion, personality, and straight-forward honesty taught me more about hair color, science, and professionalism   in a few hours than I have learned over 6 months from a number of classes/teachers combined. You took what can be some very dry and confusing information and broke it down so I could understand it, use it, build my business, and retain my clients.
It’s great to have the D’Shaw product li…Jenn B., Salt Lake CityUT,I think you have found a way to teach the science and chemistry behind cosmetology in an interesting way. Most people in school don’t care to learn the chemical makeup behind hair color and other products. It should be taught more. It is important to know the chemistry of the products we are using and how they work. You were amazing today. I learned more than I have from any other guest speaker.Danielle B., Salt Lake CityUT.The D’Shaw Color Class was excellent. The ease of use of the color line was a breath of fresh air for a stuffy industry. Your knowledge of the chemistry of the colors for the D’Shaw color line is amazing. I hope to see more of you and the D’Shaw products in the near future. Great job!Andrew Sadler, Salt Lake CityUT.I really enjoyed this class. I found it more informative than the other color classes I have attended. I have really struggled with color because other classes seem to skip over a lot of the information, either because they assume you already know it or because they don’t want to get into the extra stuff. The way I like to learn is to know how something works and why it works. If I know the reason, then it makes more sense and can hold on to the information better. D’Shaw takes the time to t…Kimberly S., Salt Lake CityUT.I have really enjoyed the opportunity to be in your class. It’s really inspiring to see how much time and energy you have put into your D’Shaw Color Line, and the amazing dedication you have to what you teach. The D’Shaw Color Line is different than any other color line that has spoken at our school because you explained the science behind it. I would really like to attend more classes!Sierra M., Salt Lake CityUT.WOW! I have been using D’Shaw color for five months now.  It comes in 3 ounce tubes, so it is more cost effective for my business.  It’s silky consistency allows my color to go further and the titanium and mica content make the color very shiny and light reflective.  The concentration of pigment is amazing and I am doing the best colors of my career.  My clients have loved their color and the color lasts well.  The best thing about the color is the education that comes along with it.  I have lea…Lori O.Spanish Fork UTI love the Dirty Glam products,  I would recommend them to anyone.  I haven’t had a chance to work with the D’Shaw color line yet but that’s the next class Dustin is teaching!  I love that Dustin is very passionate about his work and that we get the chance to work with him, and share his knowledge.  I can’t wait for more!Kayla R., Idaho FallsIDI really enjoyed your class, it was easy to understand. I’m excited to start using your products at school.Rochelle H., ShelleyUTI love the Dirty Glam products!!! I recommend them to everyone. Ordering them is so easy and painless and the products are worth every penny!
