1 PROSPECTUS May 1, 2014 PRUCO LIFE OF NEW JERSEY VARIABLE CONTRACT REAL PROPERTY ACCOUNT This prospectus is attached to two other types of prospectuses. The first describes either a variable annuity contract or a variable life insurance contract (collectively, the "Contract") issued by Pruco Life Insurance Company of New Jersey ("Pruco Life of New Jersey," "us," "we," or "our"), a stock life insurance company that is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of The Prudential Insurance Company of America ("Prudential"). The second prospectus describes several investment options available under that variable contract through The Prudential Series Fund (the "Series Fund"). The Series Fund is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 as an open-end, diversified management investment company. The Series Fund consists of separate investment portfolios that are mutual funds, each with a different investment policy and objective. This prospectus describes the Pruco Life of New Jersey Variable Contract Real Property Account (the "Real Property Account"), an additional available investment option. Although it is not a mutual fund, in many ways it is like a mutual fund. Instead of holding a diversified portfolio of securities, such as stocks or bonds, it consists mainly of a portfolio of commercial and residential real properties. Pruco Life of New Jersey determines the price of a "share" or, as we call it, a "participating interest" in this portfolio of properties, just as it does for the other investment options. It is based upon our best estimate of the fair market value of the properties and other assets held in this portfolio. The portion of your "Contract Fund" (the total amount invested under the Contract) that you allocate to this investment option will change daily in value, up or down, as our estimate of the fair market value of these real properties and other assets change. The risks of investing in real property are different from the risks of investing in mutual funds. See RISK FACTORS. Also, your ability to withdraw or transfer your investment in this option is not as freely available as it is for the other investment options. See RESTRICTIONS ON WITHDRAWALS. Please read this prospectus and keep it for future reference. In compliance with US law, Pruco Life Insurance Company of New Jersey delivers this prospectus to contract owners that currently reside outside of the United States. Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") nor any state securities commission has approved or disapproved of these securities or determined if this prospectus is accurate or complete. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.

We provide further detail in the subsequent sections of this prospectus. The Real Property Account is a separate account of Pruco Life Insurance Company of New Jersey ( Pruco Life of New Jersey ) created pursuant to New Jersey insurance law. Under that law, the assets of the Real Property Account are not chargeable with liabilities arising out of any other business of Pruco Life of New Jersey. Owners of certain variable life insurance and variable annuity contracts issued by Pruco Life of New Jersey may allocate a portion of their net premiums or purchase payments, or transfer a portion of their Contract Fund, to the Real Property Account. Values and benefits under the Contracts will thereafter reflect the investment experience of the Real Property Account. Contract owners, not Pruco Life of New Jersey, bear the risks and rewards of the investment performance of the Real Property Account to the extent of the Contract owner's Contract Fund invested in the Real Property Account. This prospectus is attached to and should be read in conjunction with the prospectus for the Contract you selected. Investment of The Real Property Account Assets The Real Property Account assets are invested primarily in income-producing real estate through The Prudential Variable Contract Real Property Partnership (the "Partnership"), which is a general partnership that was established by Prudential and two of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Pruco Life Insurance Company ("Pruco Life") and Pruco Life Insurance Company of New Jersey ( Pruco Life of New Jersey ). See The Prudential Variable Contract Real Property Partnership. Currently Prudential Investment Management, Inc. ("PIM") serves as the investment manager of the Partnership. See The Investment Manager. The Partnership invests at least 65% of its assets in direct ownership interests in: 1. income-producing real estate; 2. participating mortgage loans (mortgages providing for participation in the revenues generated by, or the appreciation of, the underlying property, or both) originated for the Partnership; and 3. real property sale-leasebacks negotiated on behalf of the Partnership. The large majority of these real estate investments will be in direct ownership interests in income producing real estate, such as office buildings, shopping centers, apartments, industrial properties or hotels. The Partnership may also invest up to 5% of its assets in direct ownership interests in agricultural land. Approximately 10% of the Partnership's assets will be held in cash or invested in liquid instruments and securities. The remainder of the Partnership's assets may be invested in other types of real estate related investments, including non-participating mortgage loans and real estate investment trusts. Investment Objectives The investment objectives of the Partnership are to: 1. preserve and protect the Partnership's capital; 2. compound income by reinvesting investment cash flow; and 3. over time, increase the income amount through appreciation in the value of permitted investments and, to a lesser extent, through mortgage loans and sale-leaseback transactions. There is no assurance that the Partnership's objectives will be attained. See INVESTMENT POLICIES. Risk Factors Investment in the Real Property Account, and thereby, participation in the investment experience of the Partnership, involves significant risks. See RISK FACTORS. These include the risk of fluctuating real estate values and the risk that the appraised or estimated values of the Partnership's real property investments will not be realized upon their disposition. Many of the Partnership's real estate investments will not be quickly convertible into cash. Therefore, the Real Property Account should be viewed as a long-term investment. See RESTRICTIONS ON WITHDRAWALS. Pruco Life of New Jersey and the investment manager have taken steps that are designed to ensure that the Real Property Account and Partnership will be sufficiently liquid to satisfy all withdrawal or loan requests promptly (within seven days), see Liquidity of Investments. Prudential s management of the Partnership is subject to certain conflicts of interest, including the possible acquisition of properties from Prudential Financial affiliates. See CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. 25 Summary of Charges The Partnership pays a daily investment management fee, which amounts to 1.25% per year of the average daily gross assets of the Partnership. The Partnership also compensates the investment manager for providing certain accounting and administrative services. See CHARGES. The portion of your Contract Fund allocated to the Real Property Account is subject to the same Contract charges as the portion of your Contract Fund allocated to The Prudential Series Fund, Inc. (the "Series Fund"). The Series Fund is the underlying funding vehicle for the other variable investment options available to Contract owners. You should read the Contract prospectus for a description of those charges. Availability to Pruco Life of New Jersey Contracts The Real Property Account is currently available to purchasers of Pruco Life of New Jersey's Variable Appreciable Life Insurance Contracts, Variable Life Insurance Contracts, Discovery Life Plus Contracts and Discovery Plus Contracts. It is not available on Contracts that are purchased in connection with IRAs, Section 403(b) annuities, and other tax-qualified plans, that are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA") or to the prohibited transaction excise tax provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. See THE REAL PROPERTY ACCOUNT'S UNAVAILABILITY TO CERTAIN CONTRACTS. For example, a Variable Appreciable Life Contract owner who elects to invest part of his or her net premiums in the Pruco Life of New Jersey Variable Appreciable Account, a separate account of Pruco Life of New Jersey registered as a unit investment trust under the Investment Company Act of 1940, and part in the Real Property Account, will be subject to the same: (1) monthly sales charges; (2) risk charges; (3) administrative charges; (4) insurance charges; and (5) contingent deferred sales charges without regard to what portion is invested in the Pruco Life of New Jersey Variable Appreciable Account and what portion is invested in the Real Property Account. The Real Property Account has established different subaccounts, relating to the different types of variable Contracts that may participate in the Real Property Account. These subaccounts provide the mechanism and maintain the records whereby these different Contract charges are made. This prospectus may only be offered in jurisdictions in which the offering is lawful. No person is authorized to make any representations in connection with this offering other than those contained in this prospectus. GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT PRUCO LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY OF NEW JERSEY, PRUCO LIFE OF NEW JERSEY VARIABLE CONTRACT REAL PROPERTY ACCOUNT, THE PRUDENTIAL VARIABLE CONTRACT REAL PROPERTY PARTNERSHIP, AND THE INVESTMENT MANAGER Pruco Life Insurance Company of New Jersey Pruco Life of New Jersey, a stock life insurance company, was organized on September 17, 1982 under the laws of the State of New Jersey. It is licensed to sell life insurance and annuities only in the States of New Jersey and New York. These Contracts are not offered in any state in which the necessary approvals have not yet been obtained. Pruco Life of New Jersey is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of The Prudential Insurance Company of America ( Prudential ), a stock life insurance company that has been doing business since October 13, Prudential is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Prudential Financial, Inc. ( Prudential Financial ), a New Jersey insurance holding company. As Pruco Life of New Jersey s ultimate parent, Prudential Financial exercises significant influence over the operations and capital structure of Pruco Life of New Jersey and Prudential. However, neither Prudential Financial, Prudential, nor any other related company has any legal responsibility to pay amounts that Pruco Life of New Jersey may owe under the Contract. Pruco Life of New Jersey Variable Contract Real Property Account The Real Property Account was established on October 30, 1987 under New Jersey law as a separate investment account. The Real Property Account meets the definition of a "separate account" under the federal securities laws. The Real Property Account holds assets that are separated from all of Pruco Life of New Jersey's other assets. The Real Property Account is used only to support the variable benefits payable under the Contracts that are funded by the real estate investment option. The Contract obligations to Contract owners and beneficiaries are general corporate obligations of Pruco Life of New Jersey. Pruco Life of New Jersey is also the legal owner of the Real Property Account assets. Pruco Life of New Jersey will maintain assets in the Real Property Account with a total market value at least equal to the amounts credited under the real estate option to all the Contracts participating in the Real Property Account. These assets may not be charged with liabilities, which arise from any other business that Pruco Life of New Jersey conducts. In addition 36 to these assets, the Real Property Account's assets may include funds contributed by Pruco Life of New Jersey, and reflect any accumulations of the charges Pruco Life of New Jersey makes against the Real Property Account. See VALUATION OF CONTRACT OWNER S PARTICIPATING INTERESTS. Pruco Life of New Jersey will bear the risks and rewards of the Real Property Account's investment experience to the extent of its investment in the Real Property Account. Pruco Life of New Jersey may withdraw or redeem its investment in the Real Property Account at any time. We will not make any such redemption if it will have a materially adverse impact on the Real Property Account. Accumulations of charges will be withdrawn on a regular basis. Unlike the other separate accounts funding the Contracts, the Real Property Account is not registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") under the Investment Company Act of 1940 as an investment company. For state law purposes, the Real Property Account is treated as a part or division of Pruco Life of New Jersey. Contract owners have no voting rights with respect to the Real Property Account. The Real Property Account is under the control and management of Pruco Life of New Jersey. The Board of Directors and officers of Pruco Life of New Jersey are responsible for the management of the Real Property Account. No salaries of Pruco Life of New Jersey personnel are paid by the Real Property Account. The Prudential Variable Contract Real Property Partnership The assets of the Real Property Account are invested in the Partnership. The Partnership, a general partnership organized under New Jersey law on April 29, 1988, was formed through an agreement among Prudential, Pruco Life, and Pruco Life of New Jersey, to provide a means for assets allocated to the real estate investment option under certain variable life insurance and variable annuity contracts issued by the respective companies to be invested in a commingled pool. This was done to provide greater diversification of investments and lower transaction costs than would be possible if the assets were separately invested by each company. All amounts allocated to the Real Property Account are contributed by Pruco Life of New Jersey to the Partnership. Pruco Life of New Jersey's general partnership interest in the Partnership is held in the Real Property Account. The initial contributions to the Partnership were made on April 29, Prudential contributed $100,000 in cash to the Partnership; Pruco Life of New Jersey contributed $100,000 in cash to the Partnership; and Pruco Life contributed the real estate and other assets held in its real estate separate account, which had been actively investing in real estate for more than a year. Those assets had an estimated market value of $91,538,737 on that date. Each Partner is entitled to its respective proportionate share of all income, gains, and losses of the Partnership. The Partnership assets are valued on each business day. The value of each Partner's interest will fluctuate with the investment performance of the Partnership. In addition, the Partners interests are proportionately readjusted, at the current value, on each day when a Partner makes a contribution to, or withdrawal from, the Partnership. When you choose to allocate a portion of your net premiums or purchase payments, or transfer a portion of your Contract Fund, to the Real Property Account, Pruco Life of New Jersey will contribute that amount to the Partnership as a capital contribution. It will correspondingly increase the Real Property Account's interest in the Partnership. Values and benefits under the Contract will thereafter vary with the performance of the Partnership's investments. For more information on how the value of your interest in the Real Property Account and the value of the Partnership's investments are calculated, see VALUATION OF CONTRACT OWNERS' PARTICIPATING INTERESTS. Contract owners have no voting rights with respect to the Partnership operations. The Investment Manager Currently, Prudential Investment Management, Inc. acts as investment manager of the Partnership. PIM invests in and manages real estate equities and mortgages for the general account and separate accounts of Prudential Financial affiliates, and other third party accounts.

Statement value for general account assets is recorded at depreciated cost and for assets in separate accounts and other third party accounts at market value. For a discussion of how the Partnership's real estate-related investments are valued, see VALUATION OF CONTRACT OWNERS' PARTICIPATING INTERESTS.

Prudential Real Estate Investors ( PREI ) is the unit responsible for the investments of the Real Property 47 Partnership.

PIM has entered into an administrative services agreement with Prudential, Pruco Life, and Pruco Life of New Jersey under which it pays the companies a fee for performing certain of PIM s record keeping and other obligations under its investment management agreement with the Partnership. Overview INVESTMENT POLICIES The Partnership has an investment policy of investing at least 65% of its assets in direct ownership interests in incomeproducing real estate and participating mortgage loans. The largest portion of these real estate investments are direct ownership interests in income-producing real estate, such as office buildings, shopping centers, hotels, apartments, or industrial properties. Approximately 10% of the Partnership s assets are generally held in cash or invested in liquid instruments and securities although the Partners reserve discretion to increase this amount to meet partnership liquidity requirements. The remainder of the Partnership s assets are invested in other types of real estate-related investments, including real estate investment trusts. Investment in Direct Ownership Interests in Real Estate Acquisition. The Partnership's principal investment policy involves acquiring direct ownership interests in existing (including newly constructed) income-producing real estate, including office buildings, shopping centers, apartment buildings, industrial properties, and hotels. The Partnership may also invest up to 5% of its assets in direct ownership interests in agricultural land. Property acquisitions will generally be carried out by the real estate acquisition offices in PREI's network of field offices located in Parsippany, New Jersey, Atlanta, Georgia, Chicago, Illinois and San Francisco, California. A field office or an affiliate of Prudential Financial supervises the management of properties in all of PIM's accounts. Proposals to acquire properties for the Partnership are usually originated by a field office. They are reviewed and approved by the Investment Management Committee of PREI. Depending upon the size of the acquisition and other factors, a proposed real estate investment may also be submitted for review to the Investment Committee of the Board of Directors of Prudential. Although percentage limitations on the type and location of properties that may be acquired by the Partnership have not been established, the Partnership plans to diversify its investments through the type of property acquired and its geographic location. The Partnership's investments will be maintained to meet the Internal Revenue Code diversification requirements. See General Investment and Operating Policies. In order for the Partnership to meet its stated objectives, it will have to acquire properties that generate more cash than needed to pay its gross operating expenses. To do this, a substantial portion of the Partnership's assets will be invested in properties with operating histories that include established rent and expense schedules. However, the Partnership may also acquire recently constructed properties that may be subject to agreements with sellers providing for certain minimum levels of income. Upon the expiration of or default under these agreements, there is no assurance that the Partnership will maintain the level of operating income necessary to produce the return it was previously experiencing. The Partnership may purchase real property from Prudential Financial or its affiliates under certain conditions. See CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. The property acquired by the Partnership is usually real estate, which is ready for use. Accordingly, the Partnership is not usually subject to the development or construction risks inherent in the purchase of unimproved real estate. From time to time, however, the Partnership may invest in a developmental real estate project that is consistent with the Partnership's objectives. The Partnership will then be subject to those risks. The Partnership will often own the entire fee interest in an acquired property, but it may also hold other direct ownership interests. These include, but are not limited to, partnership interests, limited liability company interests, leaseholds, and tenancies in common. 58 Property Management and Leasing Services. The Partnership usually retains a management company operating in the area of a property to perform local property management services. A field office or other affiliate of Prudential Financial will usually: (1) supervise and monitor the performance of the local management company; (2) determine and establish the required accounting information to be supplied; (3) periodically inspect the property; (4) review and approve property operating budgets; and (5) review actual operations to ensure compliance with budgets. In addition to day-to-day management of the property, the local management company will have responsibility for: (1) supervision of any on-site personnel; (2) negotiation of maintenance and service contracts; (3) major repair advice; (4) replacements and capital improvements; (5) the review of market conditions to recommend rent schedule changes; and (6) creation of marketing and advertising programs to obtain and maintain good occupancy rates by responsible tenants. The local management company fees will reduce the cash flow from the property to the Partnership. The Partnership usually retains a leasing company to perform leasing services on any property with actual or projected vacancies. The leasing company will coordinate with the property management company to provide marketing and leasing services for the property. When the property management company is qualified to handle leasing, it may also be hired to provide leasing services. Leasing commissions and expenses will reduce the cash flow from the property to the Partnership. PREI may, on behalf of the Partnership, hire a Prudential Financial affiliate to perform property management or leasing services. The affiliate's services must be provided on terms competitive with unaffiliated entities performing similar services in the same geographic area. See CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. Annually, the field office which oversees the management of each property owned by the Partnership will, together with the local property management firm, develop a business plan and budget for each property. It will consider, among other things, the projected rollover of individual leases, necessary capital expenditures and any expansion or modification of the use of the property. The approval of an officer of PREI is required. The field office will also periodically report the operating performance of the property to PREI. Investments in Mortgage Loans Types of Mortgage Loans The Partnership is authorized to invest in mortgage loans, including conventional mortgage loans that may pay fixed or variable rates of interest and mortgage loans that have a Participation (as defined below). The Partnership will not make mortgage loans to Prudential Financial affiliates. The Partnership intends to give mortgage loans on: (1) commercial properties (such as office buildings, shopping centers, hotels, industrial properties, and office showrooms); (2) agricultural properties; and (3) residential properties (such as garden apartment complexes and high-rise apartment buildings). These loans are usually secured by properties with income-producing potential based on historical or projected data. Usually, they are not personal obligations of the borrower and are not insured or guaranteed. 1. First Mortgage Loans. The Partnership will primarily make first mortgage loans secured by mortgages on existing income-producing property. These loans may provide for interest-only payments and a balloon payment at maturity. 2. Wraparound Mortgage Loans. The Partnership also may make wraparound mortgage loans on income-producing properties which are already mortgaged to unaffiliated entities. A wraparound mortgage loan is a mortgage with a principal amount equal to the outstanding balance of the prior existing mortgage plus the amount to be advanced by the lender under the wraparound mortgage loan, thereby providing the property owner with additional funds without disturbing the existing loan. The terms of wraparound mortgage loans made by the Partnership require the borrower to make all principal and interest payments on the underlying loan to the Partnership, which will then pay the holder of the prior loan. Because the existing first mortgage loan is preserved, the lien of the wraparound mortgage loan is junior to it. The Partnership will make wraparound mortgage loans only in states where local applicable foreclosure laws permit a lender, in the event of the borrower's default, to obtain possession of the property which secures the loan. 3. Junior Mortgage Loans. The Partnership may also invest in other junior mortgage loans. Junior mortgage loans will be secured by mortgages which are subordinate to one or more prior liens on the real property. They will generally, but not in all cases, provide for repayment in full prior to the end of the amortization period of the senior mortgages. Recourse on such loans will include the real property encumbered by the Partnership's mortgage and may also include other collateral or personal guarantees by the borrower. The Partnership will generally make junior or wraparound mortgage loans only if the senior mortgage, when combined with the amount of the Partnership's mortgage loan, would not exceed the maximum amount which the Partnership would be willing to commit to a first mortgage loan and only under such circumstances and on such property as to which the Partnership would otherwise make a first mortgage loan. 69 4. Participations. The Partnership may make mortgage loans, which, in addition to charging a base rate of interest, will include provisions permitting the Partnership to participate (a "Participation") in the economic benefits of the underlying property. The Partnership would receive a percentage of: (1) the gross or net revenues from the property operations; and/or (2) the increase in the property value realized by the borrower, such as through sale or refinancing of the property. These arrangements may also grant the Partnership an option to acquire the property or an undivided interest in the property securing the loan. When the Partnership negotiates the right to receive additional interest in the form of a percentage of the gross revenues or otherwise, the fixed cash return to the Partnership from that investment will generally be less than would otherwise be the case. It is expected that the Partnership will be entitled to percentage Participations when the gross or net revenues from the property operations exceed a certain base amount. This base amount may be adjusted if real estate taxes or similar charges are increased. The form and extent of the additional interest that the Partnership receives will vary with each transaction depending on: (1) the equity investment of the owner or developer of the property; (2) other financing or credit obtained by the owner or developer; (3) the fixed base interest rate on the mortgage loan by the Partnership; (4) any other security arrangement; (5) the cash flow and pro forma cash flow from the property; and (6) market conditions. The Partnership intends to use this additional interest as a hedge against inflation. It assumes that as prices increase in the economy, the rental prices on properties, such as shopping centers or office buildings, will increase and there should be a corresponding increase in the property value. There is no assurance that additional interest or increased property values will be received. In that event, the Partnership will be entitled to receive only the fixed portion of its return. Standards for Mortgage Loan Investments In making mortgage loans, the investment manager will consider relevant real property and financial factors, including: (1) the location, condition, and use of the underlying property; (2) its operating history; (3) its future income-producing capacity; and (4) the quality, experience, and creditworthiness of the unaffiliated borrower. Before the Partnership makes a mortgage loan, the investment manager analyzes the fair market value of the underlying real estate. In general, the amount of each mortgage loan made by the Partnership will not exceed, when added to the amount of any existing indebtedness, 80% of the estimated or appraised value of the property mortgaged. Dealing With Outstanding Loans The Partnership may sell its mortgage loans prior to maturity if it is deemed advisable by the investment manager and consistent with the Partnership's investment objectives. The investment manager may also: (1) extend the maturity of any mortgage loan made by the Partnership; (2) consent to a sale of the property subject to a mortgage loan or finance the purchase of a property by making a new mortgage loan in connection with the sale of a property (either with or without requiring the repayment of the mortgage loan); (3) renegotiate the terms of a mortgage loan; and (4) otherwise deal with the mortgage loans of the Partnership. Investments in Sale-Leasebacks A portion of the Partnership's investments may consist of real property sale-leaseback transactions ("Leasebacks"). In this type of transaction, the Partnership will purchase land and income-producing improvements on the land and simultaneously lease the land and improvements, generally to the seller, under a long-term lease. Leasebacks may be for very long periods and may provide for increasing payments from the lessee. Under the terms of the Leaseback, the tenant will operate, or provide for the operation of, the property and generally be responsible for the payment of all costs, including: (1) taxes; (2) mortgage debt service; (3) maintenance and repair of the improvements; and (4) insurance. In some cases, the Partnership may also grant the lessee an option to acquire the land and improvements from the Partnership after a period of years. The option exercise price would be based on the fair market value of the property, as encumbered by the lease, the increase in the gross revenues from the property or other objective criteria reflecting the increased value of the property. In some Leaseback transactions, the Partnership may only purchase the land under an income-producing building and lease the land to the building owner. In such cases, the Partnership may seek, in addition to base rents in its Leasebacks, Participations in the gross revenues from the building in a form such as a percentage of the gross revenues of the lessee above a base amount (which may be adjusted if real property taxes increase or for other events). The Partnership may invest in Leasebacks which are subordinate to other interests in the land, buildings, and improvements, such as a first mortgage, other mortgage, or lien. In those situations, the Partnership's Leaseback interest will be subject to greater risks. 710 The Partnership will only acquire a property for a Leaseback transaction if the purchase price is equal to not more than 100% of the estimated or appraised property value. The Partnership may dispose of its Leasebacks when deemed advisable by the investment manager and consistent with the Partnership's investment objectives. General Investment and Operating Policies The Partnership does not intend to invest in any direct ownership interests in properties, mortgage loans or Leasebacks in order to make short-term profits from their sale, although in exceptional cases, the investment manager may decide to do so in the best interests of the Partnership. The Partnership may dispose of its investments whenever necessary to meet its cash requirements or when it is deemed to be desirable by the investment manager because of market conditions or otherwise. The Partnership will reinvest any proceeds from the disposition of assets (and any cash flow from operations) which are not necessary for the Partnership's operations and which are not withdrawn by the Partners in order to make distributions to investors pursuant to the variable contracts issued by the Partners, or to Prudential to return its equity interests pursuant to this prospectus. The proceeds will be reinvested in investments consistent with the Partnership's investment objectives and policies. In making investments in properties, mortgage loans, Leasebacks or other real estate investments, the Partnership will rely on the investment manager's analysis of the investment and will not receive an independent appraisal prior to acquisition. The Partnership expects, however, that all the properties it owns, and most mortgage loans it holds, will be appraised or valued annually by an independent appraiser who is a member of a nationally recognized society of appraisers. Each appraisal will be maintained in the Partnership records for at least five years. It should be noted that appraised values are opinions and, as such, may not represent the true worth or realizable value of the property being appraised. The Partnership usually purchases properties on an unleveraged basis. The properties acquired will typically be free and clear of mortgage debt immediately after their acquisition. The Partnership may, however, acquire properties subject to existing mortgage loans. In addition, the Partnership may mortgage or acquire properties partly with the proceeds of purchase money mortgage loans, up to 80% of the property value. Although this is not usually done, the Partnership may do so if the investment manager decides that it is consistent with its investment objectives. When the Partnership mortgages its properties, it bears the expense of mortgage payments. See BORROWING BY THE PARTNERSHIP. The Partnership may also invest a portion of its assets in non-participating mortgage loans, real estate limited partnerships, limited liability companies, real estate investment trusts, and other vehicles whose underlying investment is in real estate. The Partnership's investments will be maintained in order to meet the diversification requirements set forth in regulations under the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code") relating to the investments of variable life insurance and variable annuity separate accounts. In order to meet the diversification requirements under the regulations, the Partnership will meet the following test: (1) no more than 55% of the assets will be invested in any one investment; (2) no more than 70% of the assets will be invested in any two investments; (3) no more than 80% of the assets will be invested in any three investments; and (4) no more than 90% of the assets will be invested in any four investments. All interests in the same real property project are treated as a single investment. The Partnership must meet the above test within 30 days of the end of each calendar quarter. To comply with the diversification requirements of the State of Arizona, the Partnership will limit additional investments in any one parcel or related parcels to an amount not exceeding 10% of Partnership's gross assets, as of the prior fiscal year end. In managing the assets of the Partnership, the investment manager will use its discretion in determining whether to foreclose on defaulting borrowers or to evict defaulting tenants. The investment manager will decide which course of action is in the best interests of the Partnership in maintaining the value of the investment. Property management services are usually required for the Partnership's investments in properties which are owned and operated by the Partnership, but usually will not be needed for mortgage loans owned by the Partnership, except for mortgage servicing. It is possible, however, that these services will be necessary or desirable in exercising default remedies under a foreclosure on a mortgage loan. The investment manager may engage, on behalf of the Partnership, Prudential Financial affiliated or unaffiliated entities to provide these additional services to the Partnership. The investment manager may engage Prudential Financial affiliates to provide property management, property development services, loan servicing or other services if and only if the fees paid to an affiliate do not exceed the amount that would be paid to an independent party for similar services rendered in the same geographic area. See CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. 811 The investment manager will manage the Partnership so that the Real Property Account will not be subject to registration under the Investment Company Act of This requires monitoring the proportion of the Partnership's assets to be placed in various investments. CURRENT REAL ESTATE-RELATED INVESTMENTS The current principal real estate-related investments held by the Partnership are described below. Many of these investments were originated by, and previously held in, The Prudential Real Property Account of Pruco Life Insurance Company (the Pruco Life Account ), a separate account established to fund the real estate investment option under variable contracts issued by Pruco Life. Prior to the formation of the Partnership, the Pruco Life Account followed the same investment policies as those followed by the Partnership. Pruco Life contributed the assets held in the Pruco Life Account to the Partnership as its initial capital contribution to the Partnership. Properties The Partnership owns the following properties as of December 31, Office Properties 2. Apartment Complexes 3. Retail Property 4. Hotel Property 5. Investment in Real Estate Trust Detailed information about the above properties can be found in the Real Property Account Annual Report on Form 10- K for the period ended December 31, 2013 (the "Annual Report"). See INCORPORATION OF ANNUAL REPORT BY REFERENCE for more information about the Annual Report and how to obtain a copy. The following tables list the rentable area subject to expiring leases during the next five years, and an aggregate figure for expirations in 2018 and thereafter, in the Account's commercial properties. While many of these leases contain renewal options with varying terms, these charts assume that none of the tenants exercise their renewal options, including those with terms that expired on December 31, 2013 or are month-to-month leases. Office Properties Year of Lease Expiration and thereafter Total Rentable Area Subject to Expiring Leases (sq. ft.)

These include valuation risks, (see VALUATION OF CONTRACT OWNERS' PARTICIPATING INTERESTS), certain conflicts of interest, (see CONFLICTS OF INTEREST), as well as the following risks: Liquidity of Investments Because the Real Property Account will, through the Partnership, invest primarily in real estate, its assets will not be as liquid as the investments generally made by separate accounts of life insurance companies funding variable life insurance and variable annuity contracts. The Partnership will, however, hold approximately 10% of its assets in cash and invested in liquid securities. The primary purposes for such investments are to meet the expenses involved in the operation of the Partnership and to allow it to have sufficient liquid assets to meet any requests for withdrawals from the Real Property Account. Such withdrawals would be made in order to meet requested or required payments under the Contracts. The Partnership may also borrow funds to meet liquidity needs. See BORROWING BY THE PARTNERSHIP. We have taken steps to ensure that the Partnership will be liquid enough to meet all anticipated withdrawals by the Partners to meet the separate accounts' liquidity requirements. It is possible that the Partnership may need to dispose of a real property or mortgage loan investment promptly in order to meet such withdrawal requests. General Risks of Real Property Investments By participating in the Real Property Account and thereby in the investment performance of the Partnership, you will be subject to many of the risks of real property investments. These include: 1. Risks of Ownership of Real Properties. The Partnership will be subject to the risks inherent in the ownership of real property such as fluctuations in occupancy rates and operating expenses and variations in rental schedules. It may be adversely affected by general and local economic conditions, the supply of and demand for properties of the type in which the Partnership invests, zoning laws, and real property tax rates. Operation of property in which the Partnership invests will primarily involve rental of that property to tenants. The financial failure of a tenant resulting in the termination of their lease might cause a reduction in the cash flow to the Partnership. If a lease is terminated, there is no assurance that the Partnership will be able to find a new tenant for the property on terms as favorable to the Partnership as those from the prior tenant. Investments in hotels are subject to additional risk from the daily turnover and fluctuating occupancy rates of hotel rooms and the absence of long-term tenants. The Partnership's properties will also be subject to the risk of loss due to certain types of property damage (such as from nuclear power plant accidents and wars), which are either uninsurable or not economically insurable. 2. Risks of Mortgage Loan Investments. The Partnership's mortgage loan investments will be subject to the risk of default by the borrowers. In this event the Partnership would have the added responsibility of foreclosing on or pursuing other remedies on the underlying properties to protect the value of its mortgage loans. A borrower's ability to meet its mortgage loan payments will be dependent upon the risks generally inherent to the ownership of real property. Mortgage loans made by the Partnership will generally not be personal obligations of the borrowers. The Partnership will only rely on the value of the underlying property for its security. Mechanics', material men's, government, and other liens may have or obtain priority over the Partnership's security interest in the property. In addition, the Partnership's mortgage loan investments will be subject to prepayment risks. If the terms of the mortgage loans permit, mortgagors may prepay the loans, thus possibly changing the Partnership's return. Junior mortgage loans (including wraparound mortgage loans) will be subject to greater risk than first mortgage loans, since they will be subordinate to liens of senior mortgagees. In the event a default occurs on a senior mortgage, the Partnership may be required to make payments or take other actions to cure the default (if it has the right to do so) in order to prevent foreclosure on the senior mortgage and possible loss of all or portions of the Partnership's investment. "Due on sale" clauses included in some senior mortgages, accelerating the amount due under the senior mortgage in the case of sale of the property, may be applied to the sale of the property upon foreclosure by the Partnership of its junior mortgage loan. The risk of lending on real estate increases as the proportion, which the amount of the mortgage loan bears to the fair market value of the real estate increases. The Partnership usually does not make mortgage loans of over 80% of the estimated or appraised value of the property that secures the loan. There can be no assurance, that in the event of a default, the Partnership will realize an amount equal to the estimated or appraised value of the property on which a mortgage loan was made. 10  View more

INFORMATION REQUIRED IN PROSPECTUS
�
PROSPECTUS
�
May 1, 2008
�
PRUCO LIFE
VARIABLE CONTRACT
REAL PROPERTY ACCOUNT
�
This prospectus is attached to two other types of prospectuses.  The first describes either a variable annuity contract or a variable life insurance contract (collectively, the "Contract") issued by Pruco Life Insurance Company ("Pruco Life," "us," "we," or "our"), a stock life insurance company that is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Prudential Insurance Company of America ("Prudential"). The second prospectus describes several investment options available under that variable contract through The Prudential Series Fund, Inc. (the "Series
Fund").  The Series Fund is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 as an open-end, diversified management investment company. The Series Fund consists of separate investment portfolios that are mutual funds, each with a different investment policy and objective.
�
This prospectus describes the Pruco Life Variable Contract Real Property Account (the "Real Property Account"), an additional available investment option.  Although it is not a mutual fund, in many ways it is like a mutual fund.  Instead of holding a diversified portfolio of securities, such as stocks or bonds, it consists mainly of a portfolio of commercial and residential real properties. 
�
Pruco Life determines the price of a "share" or, as we call it, a "participating interest" in this portfolio of properties, just as it does for the other investment options.  It is based upon our best estimate of the fair market value of the properties and other assets held in this portfolio.  The portion of your "Contract Fund" (the total amount invested under the Contract) that you allocate to this investment option will change daily in value, up or down, as the fair market value of these real properties and other assets change.
�
The risks of investing in real property are different from the risks of investing in mutual funds.  See RISK FACTORS.  Also, your ability to withdraw or transfer your investment in this option is not as freely available as it is for the other investment options.  See RESTRICTIONS ON WITHDRAWALS.
�
�
Please read this prospectus and keep it for future reference. 
�
The Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") maintains a Web site (http://www.sec.gov) that contains material incorporated by reference and other information regarding registrants that file electronically with the SEC.  
�
Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities commission has approved or disapproved of these securities or determined if this prospectus is accurate or complete.  Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.

SUMMARY
�
This Summary provides a brief overview of the more significant aspects of the Real Property Account.  We provide further detail in the subsequent sections of this prospectus.
�
The Real Property Account is a separate account of Pruco Life Insurance Company (�Pruco Life�) created pursuant to Arizona insurance law.  Under that law, the assets of the Real Property Account are not chargeable with liabilities arising out of any other business of Pruco Life.  Owners of certain variable life insurance and variable annuity contracts issued by Pruco Life may allocate a portion of their net premiums or purchase payments, or transfer a portion of their Contract Fund, to the Real Property Account.  Values and benefits under the Contracts will thereafter reflect the investment experience of the Real Property Account.  Contract
owners, not Pruco Life, bear the risks and rewards of the investment performance of the Real Property Account to the extent of the Contract owner's Contract Fund invested in the Real Property Account. This prospectus is attached to and should be read in
conjunction with the prospectus for the Contract you selected.
�
Investment of The Real Property Account Assets
�
The Real Property Account assets are invested primarily in income-producing real estate through The Prudential Variable Contract Real Property Partnership (the "Partnership"), which is a general partnership that was established by Prudential and two of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Pruco Life Insurance Company ("Pruco Life") and Pruco Life Insurance Company of New Jersey (�Pruco Life of New Jersey�). See The Prudential Variable Contract Real Property Partnership.  Currently Prudential serves as the investment manager of the Partnership. Prudential acts through Prudential Investment Management, Inc.  See The
Investment Manager.  The Partnership invests at least 65% of its assets in direct ownership interests in:
�




1. 

income-producing real estate;  





2. 

participating mortgage loans (mortgages providing for participation in the revenues generated by, or the appreciation of, the underlying property, or both) originated for the Partnership; and   





3. 

real property sale-leasebacks negotiated  on behalf of the Partnership.   

�
The large majority of these real estate investments will be in direct ownership interests in income producing real estate, such as office buildings, shopping centers, apartments, industrial properties or hotels.  The Partnership may also invest up to 5% of its assets in direct ownership interests in agricultural land.  Approximately 10% of the Partnership's assets will be held in cash or invested in liquid instruments and securities.  The remainder of the Partnership's assets may be invested in other types of real estate related investments, including non-participating mortgage loans and real estate investment trusts.
�
Investment Objectives
�
The investment objectives of the Partnership are to:
�




1. 

preserve and protect the Partnership's capital;   





2. 

compound income by reinvesting  investment cash flow; and   





3. 

over time, increase the income amount through appreciation in the value of permitted investments and, to a lesser extent, through mortgage loans and sale-leaseback transactions.    

�
There is no assurance that the Partnership's objectives will be attained. See INVESTMENT POLICIES.
�
Risk Factors
�
Investment in the Real Property Account, and thereby, participation in the investment experience of the Partnership, involves significant risks.  See RISK FACTORS.  These include the risk of fluctuating real estate values and the risk that the appraised or estimated values of the Partnership's real property investments will not be realized upon their disposition.  Many of the Partnership's real estate investments will not be quickly convertible into cash. Therefore, the Real Property Account should be viewed as a long-term investment.  See RESTRICTIONS ON WITHDRAWALS.  
�
Pruco Life and the investment manager have taken steps to ensure that the Real Property Account and Partnership will be sufficiently liquid to satisfy all withdrawal or loan requests promptly (within seven days), see Liquidity of Investments.  Prudential�s management of the Partnership is subject to certain conflicts of interest, including the possible acquisition of properties from Prudential Financial affiliates.  See CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.
�
2 - Real Property
�

Summary of Charges
�
The Partnership pays a daily investment management fee, which amounts to 1.25% per year of the average daily gross assets of the Partnership.  The Partnership also compensates the investment manager for providing certain accounting and administrative services.  See CHARGES.  The portion of your Contract Fund allocated to the Real Property Account is subject to the same Contract charges as the portion of your Contract Fund allocated to The Prudential Series Fund, Inc. (the "Series Fund").  The Series Fund is the underlying funding vehicle for the other variable investment options available to Contract
owners.  You should read the Contract prospectus for a description of those charges.
�
Availability to Pruco Life Contracts
�
The Real Property Account is currently available to purchasers of Pruco Life's Variable Appreciable Life� Insurance Contracts, Variable Life Insurance Contracts, Discovery� Life Plus Contracts, and Discovery� Plus Contracts.  It is not available on Contracts
that are purchased in connection with IRAs, Section 403(b) annuities, and other tax-qualified plans, that are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA") or to the prohibited transaction excise tax provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.  See THE REAL PROPERTY ACCOUNT'S UNAVAILABILITY TO CERTAIN CONTRACTS.  For example, a Variable Appreciable Life Contract owner who elects to invest part of his or her net premiums in the Pruco Life Variable Appreciable Account, a separate account of Pruco Life registered as a unit investment trust under the Investment Company Act of 1940, and part in the Real Property Account, will be subject to the same:  (1) monthly sales charges;
(2) risk charges; (3) administrative charges; (4) insurance charges; and (5) contingent deferred sales charges without regard to what portion is invested in the Pruco Life Variable Appreciable Account and what portion is invested in the Real Property Account.  The Real Property Account has established different subaccounts, relating to the different types of variable Contracts that may participate in the Real Property Account.  These subaccounts provide the mechanism and maintain the records whereby these different Contract charges are made.

Pruco Life Insurance Company ("Pruco Life"), a stock life insurance company, was organized on December 23, 1971 under the laws of the State of Arizona.  It is licensed to sell life insurance and annuities in the District of Columbia, Guam, and in all states except New York.  These Contracts are not offered in any state in which the necessary approvals have not been obtained.
�
Pruco Life is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Prudential, a stock life insurance company that has been doing business since October 13, 1875.  Prudential is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Prudential Financial, Inc. (�Prudential Financial�), a New Jersey insurance holding company.  As Pruco Life�s ultimate parent, Prudential Financial exercises significant influence over the operations and capital structure of Pruco Life and Prudential.  However, neither Prudential Financial, Prudential, nor any other related company has any legal responsibility to pay amounts that Pruco Life may owe under the Contract.
�
Pruco Life's consolidated financial statements appear in the statement of additional information for the Contract prospectus, which is available upon request.
�
Pruco Life Variable Contract Real Property Account
�
The Real Property Account was established on August 27, 1986 under Arizona law as a separate investment account.  The Real Property Account meets the definition of a "separate account" under the federal securities laws.  The Real Property Account holds assets that are separated from all of Pruco Life's other assets.  The Real Property Account is used only to support the variable benefits payable under the Contracts that are funded by the real estate investment option.
�

3 - Real Property
�

The Contract obligations to Contract owners and beneficiaries are general corporate obligations of Pruco Life.  Pruco Life is also the legal owner of the Real Property Account assets.  Pruco Life will maintain assets in the Real Property Account with a total market value at least equal to the amounts credited under the real estate option to all the Contracts participating in the Real Property Account.  These assets may not be charged with liabilities, which arise from any other business that Pruco Life conducts.  In addition to these assets, the Real Property Account's assets may include funds contributed by Pruco Life, and reflect any accumulations of the charges Pruco Life
makes against the Real Property Account.  See VALUATION OF CONTRACT OWNER'S PARTICIPATING INTERESTS.
�
Pruco Life will bear the risks and rewards of the Real Property Account's investment experience to the extent of its investment in the Real Property Account.  Pruco Life may withdraw or redeem its investment in the Real Property Account at any time.  We will not make any such redemption if it will have a materially adverse impact on the Real Property Account.  Accumulations of charges will be withdrawn on a regular basis.
�
Unlike the other separate accounts funding the Contracts, the Real Property Account is not registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") under the Investment Company Act of 1940 as an investment company. For state law purposes, the Real Property Account is treated as a part or division of Pruco Life.  Contract owners have no voting rights with respect to the Real Property Account.  The Real Property Account is under the control and management of Pruco Life.  The Board of Directors and officers of Pruco Life are responsible for the management of the Real Property Account.  No salaries of Pruco Life personnel are paid by the Real Property Account.  Information regarding the directors and officers of Pruco Life is contained in the attached prospectus
for the Contract.  The financial statements of the Real Property Account begin on page A1.
�
The Prudential Variable Contract Real Property Partnership
�
The assets of the Real Property Account are invested in the Partnership.  The Partnership,  a general  partnership  organized under New
Jersey law on April 29, 1988, was formed through an agreement among  Prudential,  Pruco Life, and Pruco Life of New Jersey,  to provide
a means for assets  allocated  to the real estate  investment  option under  certain  variable  life  insurance  and  variable  annuity
contracts  issued by the respective  companies to be invested in a commingled  pool. This was done to provide  greater  diversification
of  investments  and lower  transaction  costs than would be possible  if the assets were  separately  invested  by each  company.  All
amounts  allocated to the Real Property  Account are  contributed by Pruco Life to the  Partnership.  Pruco Life's general  partnership
interest in the Partnership is held in the Real Property Account.
�
The initial contributions to the Partnership were made on April 29, 1988.  Prudential contributed $100,000 in cash to the Partnership; Pruco Life of New Jersey contributed $100,000 in cash to the Partnership; and Pruco Life contributed the real estate and other assets held in its real estate separate account, which had been actively investing in real estate for more than a year.  Those assets had an estimated market value of $91,538,737 on that date.  Each Partner is entitled to its respective proportionate share of all income, gains, and losses of the Partnership.
�
The Partnership assets are valued on each business day.  The value of each Partner's interest will fluctuate with the investment performance of the Partnership.  In addition, the Partners� interests are proportionately readjusted, at the current value, on each day when a Partner makes a contribution to, or withdrawal from, the Partnership.  When you choose to allocate a portion of your net premiums or purchase payments, or transfer a portion of your Contract Fund, to the Real Property Account, Pruco Life will contribute that amount to the Partnership as a capital contribution.  It will correspondingly increase the Real Property Account's interest in the Partnership. Values and benefits under the Contract will thereafter vary with the performance of the Partnership's
investments.  For more information on how the value of your interest in the Real Property Account and the value of the Partnership's
investments are calculated, see VALUATION OF CONTRACT OWNERS' PARTICIPATING INTERESTS.
�
Contract owners have no voting rights with respect to the Partnership operations. The financial statements of the Partnership begin on page B1.
�
The Investment Manager
�
Currently, Prudential Investment Management, Inc. (�PIM�) acts as investment manager of the Partnership.  PIM invests in and manages real estate equities and mortgages for the general account and separate accounts of Prudential Financial affiliates, and other third party accounts.  
�
PIM, on behalf of the general account, and separate accounts of Prudential Financial affiliates, and other third party accounts, is one of the largest real estate investors in North America. PIM and Prudential Financial affiliates participate in real estate ventures through public and private partnerships.  As of December 31, 2007, PIM managed $61.2 billion of net domestic real estate mortgages and equities of which $30.0 billion is in Prudential�s general 
�

�

account and $31.2 billion is in separate accounts and other third party accounts.  Statement value for general account assets is recorded at depreciated cost and for assets in separate accounts and other third party accounts at market value.  For a discussion of how the Partnership's real estate-related investments are valued, see VALUATION OF CONTRACT OWNERS' PARTICIPATING INTERESTS.
�
PIM has organized its real estate activities into separate business units within Prudential's Global Asset Management Group.  Prudential Real Estate Investors ("PREI"�) is the unit responsible for the investments of the Real Property Partnership.  PREI's investment staff is responsible for both general account and third party account real estate investment management activities.
�
PREI provides global investment management services to institutional investors worldwide.  PREI is headquartered in Parsippany, New Jersey and has 4 field offices across the United States.  As of December 31, 2007, PREI had under management, within the US, approximately 29.1 million net rentable square feet of office real estate, 36.3 million net rentable square feet of industrial real estate, 27.1 million net rentable square feet of retail real estate, 3,492 hotel rooms, 16,629 multifamily residential units, and 14.9 million units of self-storage real estate.
�
PIM has entered into an administrative services agreement with Prudential, Pruco Life, and Pruco Life of New Jersey under which it pays the companies a fee for performing certain of PIM�s record keeping and other obligations under its investment management agreement with the Partnership.
�
INVESTMENT POLICIES
�
Overview
�
The Partnership has an investment policy of investing at least 65% of its assets in direct ownership interests in income-producing real estate and participating mortgage loans.  The largest portion of these real estate investments are direct ownership interests in income-producing real estate, such as office buildings, shopping centers, hotels, apartments, or industrial properties.  Approximately 10% of the Partnership�s assets are generally held in cash or invested in liquid instruments and securities although the Partners reserve discretion to increase this amount to meet partnership liquidity requirements.  The remainder of the Partnership�s assets are invested in other types of real estate-related investments, including real estate investment trusts.
�
Investment in Direct Ownership Interests in Real Estate
�
Acquisition.  The Partnership's principal investment policy involves acquiring direct ownership interests in existing (including newly constructed) income-producing real estate, including office buildings, shopping centers, apartment buildings, industrial properties, and hotels.  The Partnership may also invest up to 5% of its assets in direct ownership interests in agricultural land.  Property acquisitions will generally be carried out by the real estate acquisition offices in PREI's network of field offices located in Parsippany, New Jersey, Atlanta, Georgia, Chicago, Illinois and San Francisco, California.  A field office or an affiliate of Prudential Financial supervises the management of properties in all of PIM's accounts. 
�
Proposals to acquire properties for the Partnership are usually originated by a field office.  They are reviewed and approved by the Investment Management Committee of PREI.  Depending upon the size of the acquisition and other factors, a proposed real estate investment may also be submitted for review to the Investment Committee of the Board of Directors of Prudential.
�
Although percentage limitations on the type and location of properties that may be acquired by the Partnership have not been established, the Partnership plans to diversify its investments through the type of property acquired and its geographic location.  The Partnership's investments will be maintained to meet the Internal Revenue Code diversification requirements.  See General Investment and Operating Policies.
�
In order for the Partnership to meet its stated objectives, it will have to acquire properties that generate more cash than needed to pay its gross operating expenses.  To do this, a substantial portion of the Partnership's assets will be invested in properties with operating histories that include established rent and expense schedules.  However, the Partnership may also acquire recently constructed properties that may be subject to agreements with sellers providing for certain minimum levels of income.  Upon the expiration of or default under these agreements, there is no assurance that the Partnership will maintain the level of operating income necessary to produce the return it was previously experiencing. The Partnership may purchase real property from Prudential Financial or its affiliates under certain conditions.  See CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.
�
The property acquired by the Partnership is usually real estate, which is ready for use.  Accordingly, the Partnership is not usually subject to the development or construction risks inherent in the purchase of unimproved real estate.  From 
�

5 - Real Property
�

time to time, however, the Partnership may invest in a developmental real estate project that is consistent with the Partnership's objectives.  The Partnership will then be subject to those risks.
�
The Partnership will often own the entire fee interest in an acquired property, but it may also hold other direct ownership interests.  These include, but are not limited to, partnership interests, limited liability company interests, leaseholds, and tenancies in common.
�
Property Management and Leasing Services.  The Partnership usually retains a management company operating in the area of a property to perform local property management services.  A field office or other affiliate of Prudential Financial will usually:  (1) supervise and monitor the performance of the local management company; (2) determine and establish the required accounting information to be supplied; (3) periodically inspect the property; (4) review and approve property operating budgets; and (5) review actual operations to ensure compliance with budgets.  In addition to day-to-day management of the property, the local management company will have responsibility for:  (1) supervision of any on-site personnel; (2) negotiation of maintenance and service contracts; (3) major repair advice; (4) replacements and capital
improvements; (5) the review of market conditions to
recommend rent schedule changes; and (6) creation of marketing and advertising programs to obtain and maintain good occupancy rates by responsible tenants.  The local management company fees will reduce the cash flow from the property to the Partnership. 
�
The Partnership usually retains a leasing company to perform leasing services on any property with actual or projected vacancies.  The leasing company will coordinate with the property management company to provide marketing and leasing services for the property.  When the property management company is qualified to handle leasing, it may also be hired to provide leasing services.  Leasing commissions and expenses will reduce the cash flow from the property to the Partnership.
�
PREI may, on behalf of the Partnership, hire a Prudential Financial affiliate to perform property management or leasing services. The affiliate's services must be provided on terms competitive with unaffiliated entities performing similar services in the same geographic area.  See CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.
�
Annually, the field office which oversees the management of each property owned by the Partnership will, together with the local property management firm, develop a business plan and budget for each property. It will consider, among other things, the projected rollover of individual leases, necessary capital expenditures and any expansion or modification of the use of the property.  The approval of an officer of PREI is required.  The field office will also periodically report the operating performance of the property to PREI.
�
Investments in Mortgage Loans
�
Types of Mortgage Loans
�
The Partnership is authorized to invest in mortgage loans, including conventional mortgage loans that may pay fixed or variable rates of interest and mortgage loans that have a Participation (as defined below).  The Partnership will not make mortgage loans to Prudential Financial affiliates.
�
The Partnership intends to give mortgage loans on:  (1) commercial properties (such as office buildings, shopping centers, hotels, industrial properties, and office showrooms); (2) agricultural properties; and (3) residential properties (such as garden apartment complexes and high-rise apartment buildings).  These loans are usually secured by properties with income-producing potential based on historical or projected data.  Usually, they are not personal obligations of the borrower and are not insured or guaranteed.
�
1. First Mortgage Loans.  The Partnership will primarily make first mortgage loans secured by mortgages on existing income-producing property.  These loans may provide for interest-only payments and a balloon payment at maturity.
�
2. Wraparound Mortgage Loans.  The Partnership also may make wraparound mortgage loans on income-producing properties which are already mortgaged  to unaffiliated entities.  A wraparound mortgage loan is a mortgage with a principal amount equal to the outstanding balance of the prior existing mortgage plus the amount to be advanced by the lender under the wraparound mortgage loan, thereby providing the property owner with additional funds without disturbing the existing loan.  The terms of wraparound mortgage loans made by the Partnership require the borrower to make all principal and interest payments on the underlying loan to the Partnership, which will then pay the holder of the prior loan.  Because the existing first mortgage loan is preserved, the lien of the wraparound mortgage loan is junior to it.  The Partnership will make wraparound mortgage
loans only in states where local applicable foreclosure laws permit a lender, in the event of the borrower's default, to obtain possession of the property, which secures the loan.  
�

6 - Real Property
�

3. Junior Mortgage Loans.  The Partnership may also invest in other junior mortgage loans.  Junior mortgage loans will be secured by mortgages, which are subordinate to one or more prior liens on the real property.  They will generally, but not in all cases, provide for repayment in full prior to the end of the amortization period of the senior mortgages. Recourse on such loans will include the real property encumbered by the Partnership's mortgage and may also include other collateral or personal guarantees by the borrower.
�
The Partnership will generally make junior or wraparound mortgage loans only if the senior mortgage, when combined with the amount of the Partnership's mortgage loan, would not exceed the maximum amount which the Partnership would be willing to commit to a first mortgage loan and only under such circumstances and on such property as to which the Partnership would otherwise make a first mortgage loan.
�
4. Participations.  The Partnership may make mortgage loans, which, in addition to charging a base rate of interest, will include provisions permitting the Partnership to participate (a "Participation") in the economic benefits of the underlying property.  The Partnership would receive a percentage of:  (1) the gross or net revenues from the property operations; and/or (2) the increase in the property value realized by the borrower, such as through sale or refinancing of the property.  These arrangements may also grant the Partnership an option to acquire the property or an undivided interest in the property securing the loan.  When the Partnership negotiates the right to receive additional interest in the form of a percentage of the gross revenues or otherwise, the fixed cash return to the Partnership from that investment will generally be less than
would otherwise be the case.  It is expected that the Partnership will be entitled to percentage Participations when the gross or net revenues from the property operations exceed a certain base amount. This base amount may be adjusted if real estate taxes or similar charges are increased.  The form and extent of the additional interest that the Partnership receives will vary with each transaction depending on:  (1) the equity investment of the owner or developer of the property; (2) other financing or credit obtained by the owner or developer; (3) the fixed base interest rate on the mortgage loan by the Partnership; (4) any other security arrangement; (5) the cash flow and pro forma cash flow from the property; and (6) market conditions.
�
The Partnership intends to use this additional interest as a hedge against inflation.  It assumes that as prices increase in the economy, the rental prices on properties, such as shopping centers or office buildings, will increase and there should be a corresponding increase in the property value.  There is no assurance that additional interest or increased property values will be received.  In that event, the Partnership will be entitled to receive only the fixed portion of its return.
�
Standards for Mortgage Loan Investments
�
In making mortgage loans, the investment manager will consider relevant real property and financial factors, including: (1) the location, condition, and use of the underlying property; (2) its operating history; (3) its future income-producing capacity; and (4) the quality, experience, and creditworthiness of the unaffiliated borrower.
�
Before the Partnership makes a mortgage loan, the investment manager analyzes the fair market value of the underlying real estate.  In general, the amount of each mortgage loan made by the Partnership will not exceed, when added to the amount of any existing indebtedness, 80% of the estimated or appraised value of the property mortgaged.
�
Dealing With Outstanding Loans
�
The Partnership may sell its mortgage loans prior to maturity if it is deemed advisable by the investment manager and consistent with the Partnership's investment objectives.  The investment manager may also:  (1) extend the maturity of any mortgage loan made by the Partnership; (2) consent to a sale of the property subject to a mortgage loan or finance the purchase of a property by making a new mortgage loan in connection with the sale of a property (either with or without requiring the repayment of the mortgage loan); (3) renegotiate the terms of a mortgage loan; and (4) otherwise deal with the mortgage loans of the Partnership.
�
Investments in Sale-Leasebacks
�
A portion of the Partnership�s investments may consist of real property sale-leaseback transactions (�Leasebacks�).  In this type of transaction, the Partnership will purchase land and income-producing improvements on the land and simultaneously lease the land and improvements, generally to the seller, under a long-term lease.  Leasebacks may be for very long periods and may provide for increasing payments from the lessee.
�
Under the terms of the Leaseback, the tenant will operate, or provide for the operation of, the property and generally be responsible for the payment of all costs, including:  (1) taxes; (2) mortgage debt service; (3) maintenance and repair of the improvements; and (4) insurance.  In some cases, the Partnership may also grant the lessee an option to acquire the land and improvements from the Partnership after a period of years.  The option exercise price would be based on 
�

7 - Real Property
�

the fair market value of the property, as encumbered by the lease, the increase in the gross revenues from the property or other objective criteria reflecting the increased value of the property. 
�
In some Leaseback transactions, the Partnership may only purchase the land under an income-producing building and lease the land to the building owner.  In such cases, the Partnership may seek, in addition to base rents in its leasebacks, participations in the gross revenues from the building in a form such as a percentage of the gross revenues of the lessee above a base amount (which may be adjusted if real property taxes increase or for other events).  The Partnership may invest in leasebacks which are subordinate to other interests in the land, buildings, and improvements, such as a first mortgage, other mortgage, or lien.  In those situations, the Partnership's leaseback interest will be subject to greater risks.
�
The Partnership will only acquire a property for a Leaseback transaction if the purchase price is equal to not more than 100% of the estimated or appraised property value.  The Partnership may dispose of its leasebacks when deemed advisable by the investment manager and consistent with the Partnership's investment objectives.
�
General Investment and Operating Policies
�
The Partnership does not intend to invest in any direct ownership interests in properties, mortgage loans or Leasebacks in order to make short-term profits from their sale, although in exceptional cases, the investment manager may decide to do so in the best interests of the Partnership.  The Partnership may dispose of its investments whenever necessary to meet its cash requirements or when it is deemed to be desirable by the investment manager because of market conditions or otherwise.  The Partnership will reinvest any proceeds from the disposition of assets (and any cash flow from operations) which are not necessary for the Partnership's operations and which are not withdrawn by the Partners in order to make distributions to investors pursuant to the variable contracts issued by the Partners, or to Prudential to return its equity interests pursuant
to this prospectus.  The proceeds will be reinvested in
investments consistent with the Partnership's investment objectives and policies.
�
In making investments in properties, mortgage loans, Leasebacks or other real estate investments, the Partnership will rely on the investment manager's analysis of the investment and will not receive an independent appraisal prior to acquisition.  The Partnership expects, however, that all the properties it owns, and most mortgage loans it holds, will be appraised or valued annually by an independent appraiser who is a member of a nationally recognized society of appraisers.  Each appraisal will be maintained in the Partnership records for at least five years.  It should be noted that appraised values are opinions and, as such, may not represent the true worth or realizable value of the property being appraised.
�
The Partnership usually purchases properties on an unleveraged basis.  The properties acquired will typically be free and clear of mortgage debt immediately after their acquisition.  The Partnership may, however, acquire properties subject to existing mortgage loans.  In addition, the Partnership may mortgage or acquire properties partly with the proceeds of purchase money mortgage loans, up to 80% of the property value.  Although this is not usually done, the Partnership may do so if the investment manager decides that it is consistent with its investment objectives.  When the Partnership mortgages its properties, it bears the expense of mortgage payments.  See BORROWING BY THE PARTNERSHIP.
�
The Partnership may also invest a portion of its assets in non-participating mortgage loans, real estate limited partnerships, limited liability companies, real estate investment trusts, and other vehicles whose underlying investment is in real estate.
�
The Partnership's investments will be maintained in order to meet the diversification requirements set forth in regulations under the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code") relating to the investments of variable life insurance and variable annuity separate accounts.  In order to meet the diversification requirements under the regulations, the Partnership will meet the following test:  (1) no more than 55% of the assets will be invested in any one investment; (2) no more than 70% of the assets will be invested in any two investments; (3) no more than 80% of the assets will be invested in any three investments; and (4) no more than 90% of the assets will be invested in any four investments.  All interests in the same real property project are treated as a single investment.  The Partnership must meet the above test within 30 days of the end of each calendar quarter.  To comply with the diversification
requirements of the State of Arizona, the Partnership will limit additional investments in any one parcel or related parcels to an amount not exceeding 10% of Partnership's gross assets, as of the prior fiscal year end.
�
In managing the assets of the Partnership, the investment manager will use its discretion in determining whether to foreclose on defaulting borrowers or to evict defaulting tenants.  The investment manager will decide which course of action is in the best interests of the Partnership in maintaining the value of the investment.
�

8 - Real Property
�

Property management services are usually required for the Partnership's investments in properties which are owned and operated by the Partnership, but usually will not be needed for mortgage loans owned by the Partnership, except for mortgage servicing.  It is possible, however, that these services will be necessary or desirable in exercising default remedies under a foreclosure on a mortgage loan.  The investment manager may engage, on behalf of the Partnership, Prudential Financial affiliated or unaffiliated entities to provide these additional services to the Partnership. The investment manager may engage Prudential Financial affiliates to provide property management, property development services, loan servicing or other services if and only if the fees paid to an affiliate do not exceed the amount that would be paid to an independent party for similar services rendered in the same geographic area.
See CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.
�
The investment manager will manage the Partnership so that the Real Property Account will not be subject to registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940.  This requires monitoring the proportion of the Partnership's assets to be placed in various investments.
�
CURRENT REAL ESTATE-RELATED INVESTMENTS
�
The current principal real estate-related investments held by the Partnership are described below.  Many of these investments were originated by, and previously held in, The Prudential Real Property Account of Pruco Life Insurance Company (the �Pruco Life Account�), a separate account established to fund the real estate investment option under variable contracts issued by Pruco Life.  Prior to the formation of the Partnership, the Pruco Life Account followed the same investment policies as those followed by the Partnership.  Pruco Life contributed the assets held in the Pruco Life Account to the Partnership as its initial capital contribution to the Partnership.
�
Properties
�
The Partnership owns the following properties as of December 31, 2007. 
�




1.  

Office Properties

The Partnership liquidated its entire investment in REIT shares in December�2001. The Partnership does, however, maintain a preferred equity investment in an existing private real estate investment trust, or �REIT.� 
�
RISK FACTORS
�
There are certain risk factors that you should consider before allocating a portion of your net premiums or purchase payments, or transferring a portion of your Contract Fund, to the Real Property Account.  These include valuation risks, (see VALUATION OF CONTRACT OWNERS' PARTICIPATING INTERESTS), certain conflicts of interest, (see CONFLICTS OF INTEREST), as well as the following risks:
�

9 - Real Property
�

Liquidity of Investments
�
Because the Real Property Account will, through the Partnership, invest primarily in real estate, its assets will not be as liquid as the investments generally made by separate accounts of life insurance companies funding variable life insurance and variable annuity contracts.  The Partnership will, however, hold approximately 10% of its assets in cash and invested in liquid securities.  The primary purposes for such investments are to meet the expenses involved in the operation of the Partnership and to allow it to have sufficient liquid assets to meet any requests for withdrawals from the Real Property Account.  Such withdrawals would be made in order to meet requested or required payments under the Contracts.  The Partnership may also borrow funds to meet liquidity
needs.  See BORROWING BY THE PARTNERSHIP.
�
We have taken steps to ensure that the Partnership will be liquid enough to meet all anticipated withdrawals by the Partners to meet the separate accounts' liquidity requirements.  It is possible that the Partnership may need to dispose of a real property or mortgage loan investment promptly in order to meet such withdrawal requests.
�
General Risks of Real Property Investments
�
By participating in the Real Property Account and thereby in the investment performance of the Partnership, you will be subject to many of the risks of real property investments.  These include:
�
1. Risks of Ownership of Real Properties.  The Partnership will be subject to the risks inherent in the ownership of real property such as fluctuations in occupancy rates and operating expenses and variations in rental schedules.  It may be adversely affected by general and local economic conditions, the supply of and demand for properties of the type in which the Partnership invests, zoning laws, and real property tax rates.  Operation of property in which the Partnership invests will primarily involve rental of that property to tenants.  The financial failure of a tenant resulting in the termination of their lease might cause a reduction in the cash flow to the Partnership.  If a lease is terminated, there is no assurance that the Partnership will be able to find a new tenant for the property on terms as favorable to the Partnership as those from the
prior tenant.  Investments in hotels are subject to additional risk from the daily turnover and fluctuating occupancy rates of hotel rooms and the absence of long-term tenants.
�
The Partnership's properties will also be subject to the risk of loss due to certain types of property damage (such as from nuclear power plant accidents and wars) which are either uninsurable or not economically insurable.
�
2. Risks of Mortgage Loan Investments.  The Partnership's mortgage loan investments will be subject to the risk of default by the borrowers.  In this event the Partnership would have the added responsibility of foreclosing on or pursuing other remedies on the underlying properties to protect the value of its mortgage loans.  A borrower's ability to meet its mortgage loan payments will be dependent upon the risks generally inherent to the ownership of real property. Mortgage loans made by the Partnership will generally not be personal obligations of the borrowers.  The Partnership will only rely on the value of the underlying property for its security.  Mechanics', material men's, government, and other liens may have or obtain priority over the Partnership's security interest in the property.
�
In addition, the Partnership's mortgage loan investments will be subject to prepayment risks.  If the terms of the mortgage loans permit, mortgagors may prepay the loans, thus possibly changing the Partnership's return.
�
Junior mortgage loans (including wraparound mortgage loans) will be subject to greater risk than first mortgage loans, since they will be subordinate to liens of senior mortgagees.  In the event a default occurs on a senior mortgage, the Partnership may be required to make payments or take other actions to cure the default (if it has the right to do so) in order to prevent foreclosure on the senior mortgage and possible loss of all or portions of the Partnership's investment. "Due on sale" clauses included in some senior mortgages, accelerating the amount due under the senior mortgage in the case of sale of the property, may be applied to the sale of the property upon foreclosure by the Partnership of its junior mortgage loan.
�
The risk of lending on real estate increases as the proportion, which the amount of the mortgage loan bears to the fair market value of the real estate increases.  The Partnership usually does not make mortgage loans of over 80% of the estimated or appraised value of the property that secures the loan.  There can be no assurance, that in the event of a default, the Partnership will realize an amount equal to the estimated or appraised value of the property on which a mortgage loan was made.
�
Mortgage loans made by the Partnership may be subject to state usury laws.  These laws impose limits on interest charges and possible penalties for violation of those limits, including restitution of excess interest, unenforceability of debt, and treble damages.  The Partnership does not intend to make mortgage loans at usurious rates of interest. Uncertainties in determining the legality of interest rates and other borrowing charges under some statutes could result in inadvertent violations, in which case the Partnership could incur the penalties mentioned above.
�

10 - Real Property
�

�
3. Risks with Participations.  The Partnership may seek to invest in mortgage loans and Leasebacks with Participations, which will provide the Partnership with both fixed interest and additional interest based upon gross revenues, sale proceeds, and/or other variable amounts.  If the interest income received by the Partnership is based, in part, on a percentage of the gross revenues or sale proceeds of the underlying property, the Partnership's income will depend on the success in the leasing of the underlying property, the management and operation of such property by the borrower or lessee and upon the market value of the property upon ultimate disposition.  If the Partnership negotiates a mortgage loan with a lower fixed interest rate and an additional percentage of the gross revenues or eventual sale proceeds of the underlying property, and the
underlying property fails to generate increased revenues or to appreciate, the Partnership will have foregone a potentially greater fixed return without receiving the benefit of appreciation.  State laws may limit Participations.  In the event of the borrower�s bankruptcy, it is possible that as a result of the Partnership's interest in the gross revenues or sale proceeds, a court could treat the Partnership as a partner or joint venturer with the borrower, and the Partnership could lose the priority its security interest would have been given, or be liable for the borrower�s debts.  The Partnership will structure its Participations to avoid being characterized as a partner or joint venturer with the borrower.
�
4. Risks with Sale-Leaseback Transactions. Leaseback transactions typically involve the acquisition of land and improvements thereon and the leaseback of such land and improvements to the seller or another party.  The value of the land and improvements will depend, in large part, on the performance and financial stability of the lessee and its tenants, if any.  The tenants� leases may have shorter terms than the leaseback.  Therefore, the lessee's future ability to meet payment obligations to the Partnership will depend on its ability to obtain renewals of such leases or new leases upon satisfactory terms and the ability of the tenants to meet their rental payments to the lessee.
�
PREI investigates the stability and creditworthiness of lessees in all commercial properties it may acquire, including leaseback transactions.  However, a lessee in a leaseback transaction may have few, if any, assets.  The Partnership will therefore rely for its security on the value of the land and improvements.  When the Partnership's leaseback interest is subordinate to other interests in the land or improvements, such as a first mortgage or other lien, the Partnership's leaseback will be subject to greater risk.  A default by a lessee or other premature termination of the leaseback may result in the Partnership being unable to recover its investment unless the property is sold or leased on favorable terms. The ability of the lessee to meet its obligations under the leaseback, and the value of a property, may be affected by a number of factors inherent in the ownership of real property which are
described above.  Furthermore, the long-term nature of a leaseback may, in the future, result in the Partnership receiving lower average annual rentals. However, this risk may be lessened if the Partnership obtains Participations in connection with its Leasebacks.
�
Reliance on The Partners and The Investment Manager
�
You do not have a vote in determining the policies of the Partnership or the Real Property Account.  You also have no right or power to take part in the management of the Partnership or the Real Property Account.  The investment manager alone, subject to the supervision of the Partners, will make all decisions with respect to the management of the Partnership, including the determination as to what properties to acquire, subject to the investment policies and restrictions.  Although the Partners have the right to replace the investment manager, it should be noted that Prudential, Pruco Life, Pruco Life of New Jersey, and the investment manager are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Prudential Financial.
�
The Partnership will compete in the acquisition of its investments with many other individuals and entities engaged in real estate activities, including the investment manager and its affiliates.  See CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. There may be intense competition in obtaining properties or mortgages in which the Partnership intends to invest. Competition may result in increased costs of suitable investments.
�
Since the Partnership will continuously look for new investments, you will not be able to evaluate the economic merit of many of the investments, which may be acquired by the Partnership.  You must depend upon the ability of the investment manager to select investments.
�
����������������INVESTMENT RESTRICTIONS
�
The Partnership has adopted certain restrictions relating to its investment activities.  These restrictions may be changed, if the law permits, by the Partners.  Pursuant to these restrictions, the Partnership will not:
�




� 

1. 

Make any investments not related to real estate, other than liquid instruments and securities.  

�




� 

2. 

Engage in underwriting of securities issued by others.  

�

11 - Real Property
�





� 

3. 

Invest in securities issued by any investment company.  

�




� 

4. 

Sell securities short.  

�




� 

5. 

Purchase or sell oil, gas, or other mineral exploration or development programs.  

�




� 

6. 

Make loans to the Partners, any of their affiliates, or any investment program sponsored by such parties.  

�




� 

7. 

Enter into leaseback transactions in which the lessee is Prudential, Pruco Life, Pruco Life of New Jersey, their affiliates, or any investment program sponsored by such parties.  

�




� 

8. 

Borrow more than 331/3% (pursuant to California state requirements) of the value of the assets of the Partnership (based upon periodic valuations and appraisals).  See VALUATION OF CONTRACT OWNERS' PARTICIPATING INTERESTS.  

�
DIVERSIFICATION REQUIREMENTS
�
The Partnership�s investments are maintained so as to meet the diversification requirements set forth in Treasury Regulations issued pursuant to Section 817(h) of the Internal Revenue Code relating to the investments of variable life insurance and variable annuity separate accounts.  Section 817(h) requires, among other things, that the partnership will have no more than 55% of the assets invested in any one investment, no more than 70% of the assets will be invested in any two investments, no more than 80% of the assets will be invested in any three investments, and no more than 90% of the assets will be invested in any four investments.  To comply with requirements of the State of Arizona, the Partnership will limit additional investments in any one parcel or
related parcels to an amount not exceeding 10% of the Partnership�s gross assets as of the prior fiscal year.
�
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
�
The investment manager, will be subject to various conflicts of interest in managing the Partnership.  PIM invests in real estate equities and mortgages for the general account of Prudential Financial affiliates and for third parties, including through separate accounts established for the benefit of qualified pension and profit-sharing plans. PIM also manages, or advises in the management of, real estate equities and mortgages owned by other persons.  In addition, affiliates of Prudential Financial are general partners in publicly offered limited partnerships that invest in real estate equities and mortgage loans.  Prudential Financial and its affiliates may engage in business activities, which will be competitive with the Partnership. Moreover, the Partnership may purchase properties from Prudential Financial or its affiliates.
�
The potential conflicts involved in managing the Partnership include:
�
1. Lack of Independent Negotiations between the Partnership and The Investment Manager.  All agreements and arrangements relating to compensation between the Partnership and the investment manager, or any affiliate of Prudential Financial, may not be the result of arm's-length negotiations.
�
2. Competition by the Partnership with Prudential Financial�s Affiliates for Acquisition and Disposition of Investments.  Prudential Financial affiliates are involved in numerous real estate investment activities for their general account, their separate accounts, and other entities.  They may involve investment policies comparable to the Partnership�s and may compete with the Partnership for the acquisition and disposition of investments.  Moreover, additional accounts or affiliated entities may be formed in the future with investment objectives similar to those of the Partnership.  In short, existing or future real estate investment accounts or entities managed or advised by Prudential Financial affiliates may have the same management as the Partnership and may be in competition with the Partnership regarding real
property investments, mortgage loan investments, Leasebacks, and the management and sale of such investments.  Prudential Financial affiliates are not obligated to present to the Partnership any particular investment opportunity, regardless of whether the opportunity would be suitable for investment by the Partnership.
�
Prudential Financial affiliates have, however, adopted procedures to distinguish between equity investments available for the Partnership as opposed to the other programs and entities described above.  If investment accounts or entities managed by Prudential Financial affiliates have investment objectives and policies similar to the Partnership and are in the market to acquire properties or make investments at the same time as the Partnership, the following procedures will be followed to resolve any conflict of interest.  The Investment Allocation Procedure (�IAP�) has been established to provide a reasonable and fair procedure for allocating real estate investments among the several accounts managed by PREI. The IAP is administered by an Allocation Committee composed of the Managing Directors, Portfolio Management.  Allocation decisions are made by
vote of the Allocation 
�

12 - Real Property
�

Committee, and are approved by the Chief Executive Officer of PREI (�CEO�).  Sufficient information on each investment opportunity is distributed to all portfolio managers, who each indicate to the Allocation Committee their account�s interest in the opportunity.  Based on such expressions of interest, the Allocation Committee allocates the investment opportunity to an account (and may also determine a back-up account or accounts to receive the allocation in the event the account, which is first allocated the opportunity, fails to pursue the investment for any reason) after giving appropriate consideration to the following factors and with the goal of providing each account a fair allotment of investment opportunities:  (1) the investment opportunity�s conformity with an account�s investment criteria and objectives (including property type, size and location, diversification,
anticipated returns, investment structure, etc.); (2) the amount of funds available for investment (in total and by property type) by an account; (3) the length of time such funds (in total and by property type) have been available for investment; (4) any limitations or restrictions upon the availability of funds for investment; (5) the absolute and relative (to amount of funds available) amount of funds invested and committed for the account; (6) whether funds available for investment are discretionary or non-discretionary, particularly in relation to the timing of the investment opportunity; (7) an account�s prior dealings or investments with the seller, developer, lender or other counterparty; and (8) other factors which the Allocation Committee feel should be considered in fairness to all accounts participating in the IAP.
�
If an account which has been allocated an investment opportunity does not proceed with the acquisition, and either (i) no back-up account has been determined by the Allocation Committee, or (ii) all accounts which were deemed back-up accounts do not proceed with the acquisition, the opportunity may be reallocated to another account by the Allocation Committee.  If an investment opportunity is appropriate for more than one account, the Allocation Committee may (subject to the CEO�s approval) permit the sharing of the investment among accounts, which permit such sharing.  Such division of the investment opportunity may be accomplished by separating properties (in a multi-property investment), by co-investment, or otherwise. 
�
3. Competition with the Partnership from Affiliates for the Time and Services of Common Officers, Directors, and Management Personnel.  As noted above, PIM and Prudential Financial affiliates are involved in numerous real estate investment activities.  Accordingly, many of the personnel of PIM and Prudential Financial affiliates who will be involved in performing services for the Partnership have competing demands on their time.  Conflicts of interest may arise with respect to allocating time among such entities and the Partnership.  The directors and officers of Prudential Financial and affiliates will determine how much time will be devoted to the Partnership affairs.  Prudential Financial believes it has sufficient personnel to meet its responsibilities to all entities to which it is affiliated.
�
4. Competitive Properties.  Some properties of affiliates may be competitive with Partnership properties.  Among other things, the properties could be in competition with the Partnership's properties for prospective tenants.
�
5. Lessee Position.  It is possible that Prudential Financial or its affiliates may be a lessee in one or more of the properties owned by the Partnership.  The terms of such a lease will be competitive with leases with non-affiliated third parties. The Partnership limits the amount of space that an affiliate of Prudential may rent in a property owned by the Partnership.
�
6. Use of Affiliates to Perform Additional Services for the Partnership.  The Partnership may engage Prudential Financial affiliates to provide additional services to the Partnership, such as real estate brokerage, mortgage servicing, property management, leasing, property development, and other real estate-related services.  The Partnership may utilize the services of such affiliates and pay their fees, as long as the fees paid to an affiliate do not exceed the amount that would be paid to an independent party for similar services rendered in the same geographic area.
�
7. Joint Ventures with Affiliates.  The Partnership may enter into investments through joint ventures with Prudential Financial, its affiliates, or investment programs they sponsor.  The Partnership may enter into such a joint venture investment with an affiliate only if the following conditions are met:  (1) the affiliate must have investment objectives substantially identical to those of the Partnership; (2) there must be no duplicative property management fee, mortgage servicing fee or other fees; (3) the compensation payable to the sponsor of the affiliate must be no greater than that payable to the Partnership's investment manager; (4) the Partnership must have a right of first refusal to buy if such affiliate wishes to sell the property held in the joint venture; and (5) the investment of the Partnership and the affiliate
in the joint venture must be made on  the same terms and conditions (although not the same percentage).  In connection with such an investment, both affiliated parties would be required to approve any decision concerning the investment.  Thus, an impasse may result in the event the affiliated joint venture partners disagree.  However, in the event of a disagreement regarding a proposed sale or other disposition of the investment, the party not desiring to sell would have a right of first refusal to purchase the affiliated joint venture partner's interest in the investment.  If this happens, it is possible that in the future the joint venture partners would no longer be affiliated.  In the event of a proposed sale initiated by the joint venture partner, the Partnership would also have a right of first refusal to purchase the joint venture partner's interest in the investment.  The exercise of a right of first refusal would be subject to the Partnership's having the financial
resources
to effectuate such a purchase.
�

13 - Real Property
�

If the Partnership invests in joint venture partnerships which own properties, instead of investing directly in the properties themselves, they may be subject to risks not otherwise present.  These risks include risks associated with the possible bankruptcy of the Partnership's co-venturer or such co-venturer at any time having economic or business interests or goals which are inconsistent with those of the Partnership.
�
8. Purchase of Real Property From Prudential Financial or Affiliates.  The Partnership may acquire properties owned by Prudential Financial or its affiliates, subject to compliance with special conditions designed to minimize the conflicts of interests. The Partnership may purchase property satisfying the Partnership's investment objectives and policies from an affiliate only if:  (1) the applicable insurance regulators approve the Partnership�s acquisition of real property from Prudential Financial or affiliates to the extent such approval is required under applicable insurance regulations; (2) the Partnership acquires the property at a price not greater than the appraised value, with the appraisal being conducted by a qualified, unaffiliated appraiser; (3) a qualified and independent real estate adviser (other than the appraiser) reviews
the proposed acquisition and provides a letter of opinion that the transaction is fair to the Partnership; and (4) the affiliate has owned the property at least two years, the cost paid by the affiliate is established, and any increase in the proposed purchase price over the cost to the affiliate is, in the opinion of the independent real estate adviser, explicable by material factors (including the passage of time) that have increased the value of the property.
�
THE REAL PROPERTY ACCOUNT�S UNAVAILABILITY TO CERTAIN CONTRACTS
�
Pruco Life has determined that it is in the best interest of Contract owners participating in the Real Property Account to provide the Real Property Account with the flexibility to engage in transactions that may be prohibited if the Real Property Account accepts funds under Contracts subject to ERISA or the prohibited transaction excise tax provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.  Accordingly, owners of Pruco Life Contracts that are purchased in connection with:  (1) IRAs; (2) tax deferred annuities subject to Section 403(b) of the Code; (3) other employee benefit plans which are subject to ERISA; or (4) prohibited transaction excise tax provisions of the Code, may not select
the Real Property Account as one of the investment options under their Contract.  By not offering the Real Property Account as an investment option under such contracts, Pruco Life is able to comply with state insurance law
requirements that policy loans be made available to Contract owners.
�
VALUATION OF CONTRACT OWNERS� PARTICIPATING INTERESTS
�
A Contract owner's interest in the Real Property Account will initially be the amount they allocated to the Real Property Account.  Thereafter, that value will change daily.  The value of a Contract owner's interest in the Real Property Account at the close of any day is equal to its amount at the close of the preceding day, multiplied by the "net investment factor" for that day arising from the Real Property Account's participation in the Partnership, plus any additional amounts allocated to the Real Property Account by the Contract owner, and reduced by any withdrawals by the Contract
owner from the Real Property Account and by the applicable Contract charges recorded in that Contract's subaccount.  Some of the charges will be made:  (1) daily; (2) on the Contract's monthly anniversary date; (3) at the end of each Contract year; and (4) upon withdrawal or annuitization.  Periodically Pruco Life will
withdraw from the Real Property Account an amount equal to the aggregate charges recorded in the subaccounts.
�
The "net investment factor" is calculated on each business day by dividing the value of the net assets of the Partnership at the end of that day (ignoring, for this purpose, changes resulting from new contributions to or withdrawals from the Partnership) by the value of the net assets of the Partnership at the end of the preceding business day.  The value of the net assets of the Partnership at the end of any business day is equal to the sum of all cash held by the Partnership plus the aggregate value of the Partnership's liquid securities and instruments, the individual real properties and the other real estate-related investments owned by the Partnership, determined in the manner described below, and an estimate of the accrued net operating income earned by the Partnership from properties and other real estate-related investments, reduced by the liabilities of the Partnership, including the daily
investment management fee and certain other expenses attributable to the operation of the Partnership.  See CHARGES.
�
The Partnership may invest in various liquid securities and instruments.  These investments will generally be carried at their market value as determine by a valuation method, which the Partners deem appropriate for the particular type of liquid security or instrument.
�
The value of the individual real properties and other real estate-related investments, including mortgages, acquired by the Partnership will be determined as follows.  Each property or other real estate-related investment acquired by the Partnership will initially be valued at its purchase price.  In acquiring a property or other real estate-related investment, PIM will not obtain an independent appraisal but will instead rely on its own analysis of the investment's fair market 
�

14 - Real Property
�

value.  Thereafter, all properties and most real estate-related investments will ordinarily be appraised by an independent appraiser at least annually.  At least every three months, PIM will review each property or other real estate-related investments and adjust its valuation if it concludes there has been a change in the value of the property or other real estate-related investment since the last valuation.  The revised value will remain in effect and will be used in each day's calculation of the value of the Partnership's assets until the next review or appraisal.  It should be noted that appraisals are only estimates and do not necessarily reflect the realizable value of an investment.
�
The estimated amount of the net operating income of the Partnership from properties and other real  estate-related  investments will be
based on estimates of revenues and expenses for each property and other real  estate-related  investments.  Annually,  PIM will prepare
a  month-by-month  estimate  of the  revenues  and  expenses  ("Estimated  Net  Operating  Income")  for each  property  and other real
estate-related  investments  owned by the  Partnership.  Each day PIM will add to the  value of the  assets,  as  determined  above,  a
proportionate  part of the Estimated Net Operating  Income for the month. In effect,  PIM will establish a daily accrued  receivable of
the Estimated Net Operating Income from each property and other real  estate-related  investments  owned by the Partnership (the "Daily
Accrued  Receivable").  On a monthly basis,  the Partnership  will receive a report of actual  operating  results for each property and
other real  estate-related  investments  ("Actual Net Operating  Income").  Such Actual Net Operating  Income will be recognized on the
books of the  Partnership  and the amount of the  then-outstanding  daily  accrued  receivable  will be  correspondingly  adjusted.  In
addition,  as cash from a property or other real  estate-related  investment is actually  received by the Partnership,  receivables and
other  accounts  will be  appropriately  adjusted.  Periodically,  but at least every  three  months,  PIM will review its  prospective
estimates of net operating  income in light of actual  experience  and make an adjustment to such estimates if  circumstances  indicate
that such an adjustment is warranted.  PIM follows this practice of accruing  Estimated Net Operating  Income from properties and other
real  estate-related  investments  because net operating income from such investments is generally  received on an intermittent  rather
than daily basis,  and the Partners  believe it is more  equitable to  participating  Contract  owners if such net operating  income is
estimated and a  proportionate  amount is  recognized  daily.  Because the daily accrual of Estimated Net Operating  Income is based on
estimates  that may not turn out to reflect  actual  revenue and expenses,  Contract  owners will bear the risk that this practice will
result in the undervaluing or overvaluing of the Partnership's assets.
�
PIM may adjust the value of any asset held by the Partnership based on events that have increased or decreased the realizable value of a property or other real estate-related investment.  For example, adjustments may be made for events indicating an impairment of a borrower's or a lessee's ability to pay any amounts due or events which affect the property values of the surrounding area.  There can be no assurance that the factors for which an adjustment may be made will immediately come to the attention of PIM.  Additionally, because the evaluation of such factors may be subjective, there can be no assurance that such adjustments will be timely made in all cases where the value of the Partnership's investments may be affected.  All adjustments made to the valuation of the Partnership's investments, including adjustments to Estimated Net Operating Income, the daily accrued receivable, and adjustments to the
valuation of properties and other real estate-related investments, will be on a prospective basis only.
�
The above method of valuation of the Partnership's assets may be changed, without the consent of Contract owners, should the Partners determine that another method would more accurately reflect the value of the Partnership�s investments.  Changes in the method of valuation could result in a change in the Contract Fund values which may have either an adverse or beneficial effect on Contract owners.  Information concerning any material change in the valuation method will be given to all Contract owners in the annual report of the operations of the Real Property Account.
�
Although the above-described valuation methods have been adopted because the Partners believe they will provide a reasonable way to determine the fair market value of the Partnership's investments, there may well be variations between the amount realizable upon disposition and the Partnership's valuation of such assets.  Contract owners may be either favorably or adversely affected if the valuation method results in either overvaluing or undervaluing the Partnership's investments.  If a Contract owner invests in the Real Property Account at a time in which the Partnership's investments are overvalued, the Contract owner will be credited with less of an interest than if the
value had been correctly stated.  A Contract owner withdrawing from the Real Property Account during such time will receive more than he or she would if the value had been correctly stated, to the detriment of other Contract owners.  The
converse situation will exist if the Partnership's assets are undervalued.
�
BORROWING BY THE PARTNERSHIP
�
The Partnership may borrow for Partnership purposes, including to meet its liquidity requirements and the leveraging of currently-owned property to buy new property, subject to a maximum debt to value ratio of 331/3% (pursuant to California state requirements) based on the aggregate value of all Partnership assets. The Partnership will bear the cost of all such borrowings. The Real Property Account, and Contract owners participating in it, will bear a portion of any  borrowing costs equal to their percentage interest in the Partnership.  Moreover, although the Partnership will generally make unleveraged investments, it reserves the right to borrow up to 80% of the value of a property (with the 
�

15 - Real Property
�

value of a property determined as explained under VALUATION OF CONTRACT OWNERS' PARTICIPATING INTERESTS).  Increasing the Partnership's assets through leveraged investments would increase the compensation paid to PIM since its investment management fee is a percentage of the Partnership's gross assets.  Any borrowing by the Partnership would increase the Partnership's risk of loss.  It could also inhibit the Partnership from achieving its investment objectives because the Partnership's payments on any loans would have to be made regardless of the profitability of its investments.
�
CHARGES
�
Pursuant to the investment management agreement, the Partnership pays a daily investment management fee, which is equal to an effective annual rate of 1.25% of the average daily gross assets of the Partnership.  Certain other expenses and charges attributable to the operation of the Partnership are also charged against the Partnership.  In acquiring an investment, the Partnership may incur various types of expenses paid to third parties, including but not limited to, brokerage fees, attorneys' fees, architects' fees, engineers' fees, and accounting fees.  After acquisition of an investment, the Partnership will incur recurring expenses for the preparation of annual reports, periodic appraisal costs, mortgage servicing fees, annual audit charges, accounting and legal fees, and various administrative expenses. These expenses will be charged against the Partnership's assets.  Some of these operating expenses
represent reimbursement of the investment manager for the cost of providing certain services necessary to the operation of the Partnership, such as daily accounting services, preparation of annual reports, and various administrative services.  The investment manager charges the Partnership mortgage loan servicing fees pursuant to the standards outlined in item 6 under CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.  In addition to the various expenses charged against the Partnership's assets, other expenses such as insurance costs, taxes, and property management fees will ordinarily be deducted from rental income, thereby reducing the gross income of the Partnership.
�
As explained earlier, charges to the Contracts will be recorded in the corresponding subaccounts of the Real Property Account.  From time to time, Pruco Life will withdraw from the Real Property Account an amount equal to the aggregate amount of these charges.  Aside from the charges to the Contracts, Pruco Life does not charge the Real Property Account for the expenses involved in the Real Property Account�s operation. The Real Property Account will, however, bear its proportionate share of the charges made to the Partnership as described above.
�
The Partnership is not a taxable entity under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.  The income, gains, and losses of the Partnership are attributed, for federal income tax purposes, to the Partners in the Partnership. The earnings of the Real Property Account are, in turn, taxed as part of the operations of Pruco Life.  Pruco Life is currently not charging the Real Property Account for company federal income taxes.  Pruco Life may make such a charge in the future.
�
Under current laws Pruco Life may incur state and local taxes (in addition to premium taxes) in several states.  At present, Pruco Life does not charge these taxes against the Contracts or the Real Property Account, but Pruco Life may decide to charge the Real Property Account for such taxes in the future.
�
RESTRICTIONS ON WITHDRAWALS
�
Before allocating any portion of your net premium or purchase payments, or transferring any portion of your Contract Fund, to the Real Property Account, you should be aware that withdrawals from the Real Property Account may have greater restrictions than the other variable investment options available under the Contracts.  Pruco Life reserves the right to restrict transfers into or out of the Real Property Account.  Apart from the limitations on transfers out of the Real Property Account described below, Pruco Life will only restrict transfers out of the Real Property Account if there is insufficient cash available to meet Contract owners' requests and prompt disposition of
the Partnership's investments to meet such requests could not be made on commercially reasonable terms.
�
Generally, we will pay any death benefit, cash surrender value, loan proceeds, or partial withdrawal within seven days after all the documents required for such a payment are received at the Payment Office.  Other than the death benefit, which is determined as of the date of death, the amount will be determined as of the end of the valuation period in which the necessary documents are received at a Service Office.
�
The funds necessary to pay any death benefit, cash surrender value, withdrawal or loan proceeds funded by the Real Property Account will normally be obtained, first, from any cash flows into the Real Property Account on the day the funds are required.  If, on the day the funds are required, cash flows into the Real Property Account are less than the amount of funds required, Pruco Life will seek to obtain such funds by withdrawing a portion of its interest in the Partnership.  The Partnership will normally obtain funds to meet such a withdrawal request from its net operating income and from the liquid securities and instruments it holds.  If the Partners determine that these sources are insufficient to meet anticipated withdrawals from the Partnership, the Partnership may use a line of credit or otherwise 
�

16 - Real Property
�

borrow up to 331/3% (pursuant to California state requirements) of the value of the Partnership's assets.  See BORROWING BY THE PARTNERSHIP.  If the Partners determine that such a borrowing by the Partnership would not serve the best interests of Contract owners, Pruco Life may, in the event of a Contract loan or withdrawal, rather than take the amount of any loan or withdrawal request proportionately from all investment options under the Contract (including the Real Property Account), take any such loan or withdrawal first from the other investment options under the Contract.
�
Transfers from the Real Property Account to the other investment options available under the Contract are currently permitted only during the 30-day period beginning on the Contract anniversary.  The maximum amount that may be transferred out of the Real Property Account each year is the greater of: (a) 50% of the amount invested in the Real Property Account or (b) $10,000.  Such transfer requests received prior to the Contract anniversary will be effected on the Contract anniversary.  Transfer requests received within the 30-day period beginning on the Contract
anniversary will be effected as of the end of the valuation period in which a proper written request or authorized telephone request is received.  The "valuation period" means the period of time from one determination of the value of the amount invested in the Real Property Account to the next.  Such determinations are made when the value of the
assets and liabilities of the Partnership is calculated, which is generally at 4:00 p.m. Eastern time on each day during which the New York Stock Exchange is open.  Transfers into or out of the Real Property Account are also subject to the general limits under the Contracts.
�
RESTRICTIONS ON CONTRACT OWNERS� INVESTMENT IN THE REAL PROPERTY ACCOUNT
�
As explained earlier, identification and acquisition of real estate investments meeting the Partnership's investment objectives is a time-consuming process.  Because the Real Property Account and the Partnership are managed so they will not become investment companies subject to the Investment Company Act of 1940, the portion of the Partnership's assets that may be invested in securities, as opposed to non-securities real estate investments, is strictly limited.  For these reasons, Pruco Life reserves the right to restrict or limit Contract owners' allocation of funds to the Real Property Account.  Any such restrictions are likely to take the form of restricting the timing, amount and/or frequency of transfers into the Real Property Account and/or precluding Contract
owners who have not previously selected the Real Property Account from allocating a portion of their net premiums or purchase payments to the
Real Property Account.
�
FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS
�
The federal income tax treatment of Contract benefits is described briefly in the attached prospectus for the particular Contract you selected.  Pruco Life believes that the same principles will apply with respect to Contracts funded in whole or part by the Real Property Account.  The Partnership's conformity with the diversification standards for the investments of variable life insurance and variable annuity separate accounts is essential to ensure that treatment. See General Investment and Operating Policies.  Pruco Life urges you to consult a qualified tax adviser.
�
Under the Internal Revenue Code, the Partnership is not a taxable entity and any income, gains or losses of the Partnership are passed through to the Partners, including Pruco Life, with respect to the Real Property Account.  The Real Property Account is not a separate taxpayer for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code.  The earnings of the Real Property Account are taxed as part of the operations of Pruco Life.  No charge is currently being made to the Real Property Account for company federal income taxes.  We may make such a charge in the future, see CHARGES.
�
DISTRIBUTION OF THE CONTRACTS
�
As explained in the attached prospectus for the Contracts, Pruco Securities, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Prudential Financial, acts as the principal underwriter of the Contracts.  Consult that prospectus for information about commission scales and other facts relating to sale of the Contracts.
�
STATE REGULATION
�
Pruco Life is subject to regulation and supervision by the Department of Insurance of the State of Arizona, which periodically examines its operations and financial condition.  It is also subject to the insurance laws and regulations of all jurisdictions in which it is authorized to do business.
�

17 - Real Property
�

Pruco Life is required to submit annual statements of its operations, including financial statements, to the insurance departments of the various jurisdictions in which it does business to determine solvency and compliance with local insurance laws and regulations.
�
In addition to the annual statements referred to above, Pruco Life is required to file with Arizona and other jurisdictions a separate statement with respect to the operations of all its variable contract accounts, in a form promulgated by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.
�
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
�

The decrease was primarily due to the acquisition of the Partnership�s retail investment in Dunn, North Carolina and apartment investments in Charlotte, North Carolina and Austin, Texas, as described below. Partially offsetting this decrease was the sale of the Partnership�s industrial investment in Aurora, Colorado and retail investment in Kansas City, Kansas, as described below. In addition, sources of liquidity included net cash flow from property operations. The 
Partnership uses cash for its real estate investment activities and for its distributions to its partners. As of December�31, 2007, approximately 6% of the Partnership�s total assets consisted of cash and cash equivalents.
�
Acquisitions for the year ended December�31, 2007 included the purchase of three properties. In May, the Partnership invested approximately $22.7�million to acquire a 225-unit garden apartment property located in Austin, Texas. In August, the Partnership made a contribution of approximately $6.0�million to fund the purchase of a 193,235 square foot neighborhood/community shopping center located in Dunn, North Carolina. In September, the Partnership invested approximately $13.5�million to acquire a 140-unit garden apartment property located in Charlotte, North Carolina.
�
Dispositions for the year ended December�31, 2007 included the sale of two properties. On February 7, 2007 the Partnership�s industrial property located in Aurora, Colorado was sold, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $14.7�million to the Partnership. On June�29, 2007 the Partnership sold the retail investment in Kansas City, Kansas, which resulted in net proceeds of approximately $3.7�million after the repayment of debt.
�
The Partnership spent approximately $3.2�million on capital improvements to various existing properties during 2007. Approximately $1.5�million was associated with redevelopment costs at the retail property in Ocean City, Maryland, approximately $0.6�million funded the renovation of the apartment property in Atlanta, Georgia, approximately $0.3�million was associated with capital improvements at the office properties in Nashville, Tennessee and approximately $0.3�million was associated with leasing costs at the office property in Beaverton, Oregon. The remaining $0.5 million was associated with minor capital improvements and transaction costs related to leasing expenses of various other properties.

(b) Results of Operations
�
The following is a comparison of the Partnership�s results of operations for the periods ended December�31, 2007 and 2006.

Net Investment Income Overview
�
The Partnership�s net investment income for the year ended December�31, 2007 was approximately $12.7�million, an increase of approximately $1.5�million from approximately $11.2�million from the prior year. The office, apartment, retail and hotel sector investments posted increases of approximately $0.5�million, $1.0�million, $0.9 and $0.1�million, respectively, from the prior year. Partially offsetting this increase was a decrease in net investment income in the industrial sector of approximately $0.7�million.

The components of this net investment income are discussed below by property type sector.
�

The Partnership recorded a net realized gain of approximately $0.7�million for the year ended December�31, 2007, compared to a net realized gain of approximately $0.1�million for the prior year. The Partnership recorded a net unrealized gain of approximately $4.8�million for the year ended December�31, 2007, compared to a net unrealized gain of approximately $18.3�million for the prior year. The Partnership recorded a net realized and unrealized gain of approximately $5.5 million for the year ended December�31, 2007, compared to a net realized and unrealized gain of approximately $18.4�million for the prior year.

The increase in net investment income for the year ended December�31, 2007 was primarily due to the acquisition of the apartment properties in Austin, Texas and Charlotte, North Carolina on May�8, 2007 and September�6, 2007, respectively.

�
The apartment properties owned by the Partnership recorded a net unrealized gain of approximately $3.1�million for the year ended December�31, 2007, compared to a net realized and unrealized gain of approximately $3.7�million for the prior year.

Partially offsetting this gain were unrealized losses of approximately $0.7�million at the apartment property in Raleigh, North Carolina, due to continued soft market conditions and $0.5�million at the apartment property in Atlanta, Georgia, due to capital improvements expended in connection with the renovation of the property.

�
Net Investment Income
�
Net investment income for the Partnership�s retail properties was approximately $7.0�million for the year ended December�31, 2007, an increase of approximately $0.9�million from the prior year. The increase was primarily due to the additional net investment income generated by the Westminster, Maryland and Dunn, North Carolina retail properties that were acquired on June�13, 2006, and August�17, 2007, respectively, and reduced expenses at the Kansas City, Kansas retail property prior to the sale.
�
Total Realized and Unrealized Gain/Loss
�
On an aggregate basis, the retail properties owned by the Partnership recorded a net realized and unrealized loss of approximately $2.4�million for the year ended December�31, 2007, compared to a net realized and unrealized gain of approximately $6.3�million for the prior year. The net realized and unrealized loss for the year ended December�31, 2007 was primarily due to the $3.8�million loss recorded at the retail property in Roswell, Georgia, which reflects revised offers received in connection with the continued sale marketing efforts of the property. In addition, redevelopment and leasing expenses amounted to approximately $0.1�million in unrealized losses for the retail property in Ocean City, Maryland. Partially offsetting these unrealized losses were (a)�unrealized gains at the retail property in Dunn, North Carolina subsequent to its acquisition
on August�17, 2007 at a discount to
replacement cost, which resulted in approximately $0.7�million in valuation gains; (b) unrealized gains of approximately $0.5�million at the retail property in Hampton, Virginia due to continued investor demand; (c)�realized gains of $0.3�million due to the disposition of the retail property in Kansas City, Kansas on June�29, 2007; and (d)�unrealized gains of $0.1�million at the retail property in Westminster, Maryland due to improving market fundamentals.

The industrial property owned by the Partnership recorded a realized gain of approximately $0.3 million for the year ended December�31, 2007, compared to an unrealized gain of approximately $2.1 million for the prior year.

�
The hotel property owned by the Partnership recorded an unrealized gain of approximately $2.4 million for the year ended December�31, 2007, compared to an unrealized gain of approximately $3.8 million for the prior year. The unrealized gain for the year ended December�31, 2007 reflects continued improving property fundamentals as a result of improvements and renovations performed at the property.
�
Other
�
Other net investment income (loss)�increased approximately $0.3�million during the year ended December�31, 2007 from the prior year. Other net investment income includes interest income from short-term investments and investment management fees, and portfolio level expenses.  
�
(c) Inflation
�
The Partnership�s leases with a majority of its commercial tenants provide for recoveries of expenses based upon the tenant�s proportionate share of, and/or increases in, real estate taxes and certain operating costs, which may partially reduce the Partnership�s exposure to increases in operating costs resulting from inflation.
�
Critical Accounting Policies
�
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or �U.S. GAAP�, requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment. Management reviews critical estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. If management determines, as a result of its consideration of facts and circumstances that modifications in assumptions and estimates are appropriate, results of operations and financial position as reported in the audited Consolidated Financial Statements of the Account and the Partnership may change significantly.
�
The following sections discuss those critical accounting policies applied in preparing the audited Consolidated Financial Statements of the Account and the Partnership that are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions.
�
Valuation of Investments
�
Real Estate Investments � Real estate investments are shown at estimated market value in accordance with the terms of the Partnership�s contracts. Properties owned are initially recorded at the purchase price plus closing costs. 
�
23 - Real Property

Development costs and major renovations are capitalized as a component of cost, and routine maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Real estate costs include the cost of acquired property, including all the tangible and intangible assets. Tangible assets include the value of all land, building and tenant improvements at the time of acquisition. Intangible assets include the value of any above and below market leases, in-place leases, and tenant relationships at the time of acquisition. Market value estimates are based upon property appraisal reports prepared by independent real estate appraisers (members of the Appraisal Institute or an equivalent organization) within a reasonable amount of time following acquisition of the real estate and no less frequently than annually thereafter. The Chief Real Estate Appraiser of Prudential Investment Management, Inc., or �PIM�, which is
an indirectly owned subsidiary of Prudential Financial, is responsible for assuring that the valuation process provides independent and reasonable property market value estimates. An unaffiliated third party appraisal firm has been appointed by PIM to assist the Chief Real Estate Appraiser in maintaining and monitoring the independence and the accuracy of the appraisal process. Unless a property is currently held for sale, the market value of real estate investments does not reflect the transaction sale costs, which may be incurred upon disposition of the real estate investments.
�
Unconsolidated real estate partnerships are valued at the Partnership�s equity in net assets as reflected in the partnership�s financial statements with properties valued as described above. Under the equity method, the investment is initially recorded at the original investment amount, plus or minus additional amounts invested or distributed, and is subsequently adjusted for the Partnership�s share of undistributed earnings or losses, including unrealized appreciation and depreciation, from the underlying entity.
�
The Partnership periodically enters into forward contracts to acquire, for a fixed price, real estate investments to be constructed in accordance with predetermined plans and specifications or that achieve a certain level of leasing. Where conditions precedent to funding have been met by its development partner, and the Partnership�s commitment to fund is firm, the amount of any unrealized gain or loss is recognized based upon the difference between the estimated investment�s market value as described above and the Partnership�s funding obligation. The funding obligation and related assets are recorded in the consolidated financial statements.
�
Land and development properties held for future development are carried at acquisition cost including soft costs incurred prior to development.
�
As described above, the estimated market value of real estate and real estate related assets is determined through an appraisal process. These estimated market values may vary significantly from the prices at which the real estate investments would sell, because market prices of real estate investments can only be determined by negotiation between a willing buyer and seller and could be material to the consolidated financial statements. Although the estimated market values represent subjective estimates, management believes that these estimated market values are reasonable approximations of market prices and that the aggregate estimated value of investments in real estate is fairly presented as of December�31, 2007, and 2006.
�
Other Estimates
�
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
�
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
�
Interest Rate Risk - The Partnership�s exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates to approximately 20.4% of its investment portfolio as of December�31, 2007, which consists primarily of short-term fixed rate commercial paper and fixed and variable interest rate debt. The Partnership does not use derivative financial instruments. In accordance with its policy, the Partnership places its investments with high quality debt security issuers, limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer, limits duration by restricting the term, and holds investments to maturity except under unusual circumstances.
�
The table below presents the amounts and related weighted interest rates of the Partnership�s cash equivalents and short-term investments at December�31, 2007:

The Partnership is exposed to market risk from tenants. While the Partnership has not experienced any significant credit losses, in the event of significant increases in interest rates and/or an economic downturn, delinquencies could increase and result in losses to the Partnership and the Account that could adversely affect its operating results and liquidity.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF
PRUCO LIFE VARIABLE CONTRACT REAL PROPERTY ACCOUNT
December�31, 2007
Note 1:�����General

Pruco Life Variable Contract Real Property Account (the
�Account�) was established on August�27,
1986 and commenced business September�5, 1986. Pursuant to Arizona law, the Account was established
as a separate investment account of Pruco Life Insurance Company (�Pruco Life�), a wholly-owned
subsidiary of The Prudential Insurance Company of America (�Prudential�), an indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary of Prudential Financial, Inc. (�PFI�) and is registered under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended. The assets of the Account are segregated from Pruco Life�s other assets. The
Account is used to fund benefits under certain variable life insurance and variable annuity
contracts issued by Pruco Life. These products are Appreciable Life (�VAL�), Variable Life (�VLI�),
Discovery Plus (�SPVA�), and Discovery Life Plus (�SPVL�).

The assets of the Account are invested in The Prudential Variable Contract
Real Property
Partnership (the �Partnership�). The Partnership is the investment vehicle for assets allocated to
the real estate investment option under certain variable life insurance and annuity contracts. The
Account, along with The Prudential Variable Contract Real Property Account and the Pruco Life of
New Jersey Variable Contract Real Property Account, are the sole investors in the Partnership.
These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of the
Partnership.

The Partnership has a policy of investing at least 65% of its assets in
direct ownership interests
in income-producing real estate and participating mortgage loans.

Note 2:�����Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies and Pronouncements

A. Basis of Accounting

The accompanying financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S.
GAAP. The preparation of
the financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.

In September�2006, the staff of the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, or �SEC�, issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin, or �SAB�, No.�108, �Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when
Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements.� The interpretations in this SAB
express the staff�s views regarding the process of quantifying financial statement misstatements.
Specifically, the SEC staff believes that registrants must quantify the impact on current period
financial statements of correcting all misstatements, including both those occurring in the current
period and the effect of reversing those that have accumulated from prior periods. This SAB must be
applied beginning with the first fiscal year ending after November�15, 2006, with early adoption
encouraged. Since the Account�s method for quantifying financial statement misstatements already
considers those occurring in the current period and the effect of reversing those that have
accumulated from prior periods, the adoption of SAB No.�108 should have no effect on the financial
position and result of operations of the Account.

In September�2006, the FASB issued SFAS No.�157, �Fair
Value Measurements.� This Statement defines
fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting
principles, and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements. This Statement does
not require any new fair value measurements, but the application of this Statement could change
current practices in determining fair value. The Account expects to adopt this guidance effective
January�1, 2008. The Account�s adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material effect
on the Account�s financial position and results of operations.

In February�2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.�159, �The Fair
Value Option for Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities,� including an amendment of FASB Statement No.�115. This statement provides
companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value. This
statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after November�15, 2007 with early adoption
permitted. The Account expects to adopt this guidance effective January�1, 2008. The Account�s
adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material effect on the Account�s financial
position and results of operations.

B. Investment in Partnership Interest

The investment in the Partnership is based on the Account�s
proportionate interest of the
Partnership�s market value. At December�31, 2007 and 2006 the Account�s interest in the Partnership
was 55.1% or 3,722,570 shares. Properties owned by the Partnership
are illiquid and based on estimated fair value as discussed in the
notes to the Partnership�s audited financial statements.

C. Income Recognition

Net investment income and realized and unrealized gains and losses are
recognized daily. Amounts
are based upon the Account�s proportionate interest in the Partnership.

December�31, 2007
D. Equity of Pruco Life Insurance Company

Pruco Life maintains a position in the Account for property liquidity
purposes, including unit
purchases and redemptions, Partnership share transactions, and expense processing. The position
does not have an effect on the contract owners� accounts or the related unit values.

Note 3:�����Taxes

Pruco Life is taxed as a �life insurance company�, as defined by
the Internal Revenue Code. The
results of operations of the Account form a part of PFI�s consolidated federal tax return. Under
current federal law, no federal income taxes are payable by the Account. As such, no provision for
the tax liability has been recorded in these financial statements.

Note 4:�����Net Withdrawals by Contract

Note 7:�����Financial Highlights

Pruco Life sells a number of variable annuity and variable life insurance
products. These products
have unique combinations of features and fees that are charged against the contract owner�s account
balance. Differences in the fee structures result in a variety of unit values, expense ratios and
total returns.

The following table was developed by determining which products offered by
Pruco Life have the
lowest and highest total expense ratio. The summary may not reflect the minimum and maximum
contract charges offered by the Company as contract owners may not have selected all available and
applicable contract options as discussed in Note 1. The table reflects contract owner units only.

The table above reflects information for units held by contract owners.
Pruco Life also maintains a
position in the Real Property Account, to provide for property acquisitions and capital expenditure
funding needs. Pruco Life held 13,521,139, 12,226,968, 12,102,475, 12,134,074 and 11,781,786 units
representing $42,690,230, $35,985,213, $31,315,232, $27,951,903 and $25,741,655 of net assets as
of December�31, 2007, 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Charges for mortality risk, expense
risk and administrative expenses are used by Pruco Life to purchase additional units in its account
resulting in no impact to its net assets.


�








*
�
This amount represents the proportionate share of the net investment income from the
underlying Partnership divided by the total average assets of the Account. This ratio excludes
those expenses, such as mortality risk, expense risk and administrative charges, that result
in direct reductions in the unit values.

�

**
�
These ratios represent the annualized contract expenses of the separate account, consisting
primarily of mortality and expense charges, for each period indicated. The ratios include only
those expenses that result in a direct reduction to unit values. Charges made directly to
contract owner accounts through the redemption of units and expenses of the underlying
Partnership are excluded.

�

***
�
These amounts represent the total return for the periods indicated, including changes in the
value of the underlying Partnership, and reflect deductions for all items included in the
expense ratio. The total return does not include any expense assessed through the redemption
of units; inclusion of these expenses in the calculation would result in a reduction in the
total return presented.


Charges and Expenses

A. Mortality Risk and Expense Risk Charges

Mortality risk and expense risk charges are determined daily using an
effective annual rate of
0.6%, 0.35%, 0.9% and 0.9% for VAL, VLI, SPVA and SPVL, respectively. Mortality risk is the risk
that life insurance contract owners may not live as long as estimated or annuitants may live longer
than estimated and expense risk is the risk that the cost of issuing and administering the policies
may exceed related charges by Pruco Life. The mortality risk and expense risk charges are assessed
through reduction in unit values.

B. Administrative Charges

Administrative charges are determined daily using an effective annual rate
of 0.35% applied daily
against the net assets representing equity of contract owners held in each subaccount for SPVA and
SPVL. Administrative charges include costs associated with issuing the contract, establishing and
maintaining records, and providing reports to contract owners. The administrative charge is
assessed through reduction in unit values.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF
PRUCO LIFE VARIABLE CONTRACT REAL PROPERTY ACCOUNT
December�31, 2007


C. Cost of Insurance and Other Related Charges

Contract owner contributions are subject to certain deductions prior to
being invested in the Real
Property Account. The deductions for VAL and VLI are (1)�state premium taxes; (2)�sales charges,
not to exceed 5% for VAL and 9% for VLI, which are deducted in order to compensate Pruco Life for
the cost of selling the contract and (3)�transaction costs, applicable to VAL, which are deducted
from each premium payment to cover premium collection and processing costs. Contracts are subject
to charges on each basic premium for assuming a guaranteed minimum death benefit risk. This charge
compensates Pruco Life for the risk that an insured may die at a time when the death benefit
exceeds the benefit that would have been payable in the absence of a minimum guarantee. These
charges are assessed through the redemption of units.

D. Deferred Sales Charge

A deferred sales charge is imposed upon the surrender of certain variable
life insurance contracts
to compensate Pruco Life for sales and other marketing expenses. The amount of any sales charge
will depend on the number of years that have elapsed since the contract was issued but will not
exceed 45% of one scheduled annual premium for VAL contracts and 9% of the initial premium payment
for SPVL. No sales charge will be imposed after the sixth and tenth year of the contract for SPVL
and VAL, respectively. No sales charge will be imposed on death benefits. This deferred sales
charge is assessed through the redemption of units.

E. Partial Withdrawal Charge

A charge is imposed by Pruco Life on partial withdrawals of the cash
surrender value for VAL. A
charge equal to the lesser of $15 or 2% will be made in connection with each partial withdrawal of
the cash surrender value of a contract. This charge is assessed through the redemption of units.

Note 8:�����Related Party

Prudential and its affiliates perform various services on behalf of the
Partnership in which the
Account invests and may receive fees for the services performed. These services include, among
other things, shareholder communications, preparation, postage, fund transfer agency and various
other record keeping and customer service functions.

Report of Independent
Registered Public Accounting Firm


To the Contract Owners of the
Pruco Life Variable Contract Real Property Account
and the Board of Directors of
Pruco Life Insurance Company


����������In our
opinion, the accompanying statements of net assets and the related statements of operations
and of changes in net assets present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Pruco Life Variable Contract Real Property Account at December�31, 2007 and 2006, and the results
of its operations and the changes in its net assets for each of the three years in the period ended
December�31, 2007, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the management of Pruco Life
Insurance Company. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audits. We conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits, which included confirmation of shares
at December�31, 2007 with The Prudential Variable Contract Real Property Partnership, provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF 
THE PRUDENTIAL VARIABLE CONTRACT REAL PROPERTY PARTNERSHIP 
For Years Ended December�31, 2007, 2006, and 2005








Note 1:����Organization



On April�29, 1988, The Prudential Variable Contract Real Property
Partnership (the �Partnership�),
a general partnership organized under New Jersey law, was formed through an agreement among The
Prudential Insurance Company of America (�Prudential�), Pruco Life Insurance Company (�Pruco
Life�), and Pruco Life Insurance Company of New Jersey (�Pruco Life of New Jersey�). The
Partnership was established as a means by which assets allocated to the real estate investment
option under certain variable life insurance and variable annuity contracts issued by the
respective companies could be invested in a commingled pool. The partners in the Partnership are
Prudential, Pruco Life and Pruco Life of New Jersey.

The Partnership�s policy is to invest at least 65% of its assets in
direct ownership interests in
income-producing real estate and participating mortgage loans.

The estimated market value of the Partnership�s shares is determined
daily, consistent with the
Partnership Agreement. On each day during which the New York Stock Exchange is open for business,
the net asset value of the Partnership is estimated using the estimated market value of its assets,
principally as described in Notes 2A, 2B and 2C below, reduced by any liabilities of the
Partnership. The periodic adjustments to property values described in Notes 2A, 2B and 2C below and
other adjustments to previous estimates are made on a prospective basis. There can be no assurance
that all such adjustments to estimates will be made timely.

Shares of the Partnership are held by The Prudential Variable Contract
Real Property Account, Pruco
Life Variable Contract Real Property Account and Pruco Life of New Jersey Variable Contract Real
Property Account (the �Real Property Accounts�) and may be purchased and sold at the then current
share value of the Partnership�s net assets. Share value is calculated by dividing the estimated
market value of net assets of the Partnership as determined above by the number of shares
outstanding. A contract owner participates in the Partnership through interests in the Real
Property Accounts.

PREI � is
the real estate advisory unit of Prudential Investment Management, Inc.
(�PIM�), which is an indirectly owned subsidiary of Prudential Financial, Inc. (�PFI�). PREI
provides investment advisory services to the Partnership�s partners pursuant to the terms of the
Advisory Agreement as described in Note 9.








Note 2:����Summary of Significant Accounting Policies






A:�
�
Basis of Presentation � The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the
Partnership have been presented on the market value basis of accounting in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The
consolidated financial statements of Partnership include wholly owned entities, and those
real estate partnerships in which the Partnership has a controlling interest. All
significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.






B:�
�
Management�s Use of Estimates in the Financial
Statements � The preparation of
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying
notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.



B-7 Real Property

 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF 
THE PRUDENTIAL VARIABLE CONTRACT REAL PROPERTY PARTNERSHIP 
For Years Ended December�31, 2007, 2006, and 2005








Note 2:����Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
(continued)






C:�
�
Real Estate Investments � Real estate investments are shown at estimated market
value in accordance with the terms of the Partnership�s contracts. Properties owned are
initially recorded at the purchase price plus closing costs. Development costs and major
renovations are capitalized as a component of cost, and routine maintenance and repairs
are charged to expense as incurred. Real estate costs include the cost of acquired
property, including all the tangible and intangible assets. Tangible assets include the
value of all land, building and tenant improvements at the time of acquisition.
Intangible assets include the value of any above and below market leases, in-place
leases, and tenant relationships at the time of acquisition. Market value estimates are
based upon property appraisal reports prepared by independent real estate appraisers
(members of the Appraisal Institute or an equivalent organization) within a reasonable
amount of time following acquisition of the real estate and no less frequently than
annually thereafter. The Chief Real Estate Appraiser of PIM is responsible to assure
that the valuation process provides independent and reasonable property market value
estimates. An unaffiliated third party appraisal firm has been appointed by PIM to
assist the Chief Real Estate Appraiser in maintaining and monitoring the independence and
the accuracy of the appraisal process. Unless a property is currently held for sale, the
market value of real estate investments does not reflect the transaction sale costs,
which may be incurred upon disposition of the real estate investments.


�

�
�
Unconsolidated real estate partnerships are valued at the Partnership�s equity in net
assets as reflected in the partnerships� financial statements with properties valued as
described above. Under the equity method, the investment is initially recorded at the
original investment amount, plus or minus additional amounts invested or distributed,
and is subsequently adjusted for the Partnership�s share of undistributed earnings or
losses, including unrealized appreciation and depreciation, from the underlying entity.


�

�
�
Land and development properties held for future development is carried at acquisition
cost including soft costs incurred prior to development.


�

�
�
The Partnership periodically enters into forward contracts to acquire, for a fixed
price, real estate investments to be constructed in accordance with predetermined plans
and specifications or those achieve a certain level of leasing. Where conditions
precedent to funding have been met by its development partners, and the Partnership�s
commitment to fund is firm, the amount of any unrealized gain or loss is recognized
based upon the difference between the estimated investment�s market value as described
above and the Partnership�s funding obligation. The funding obligation and related
assets are recorded in the consolidated financial statements. As of December�31, 2007
and 2006, no such funding obligation existed.


�

�
�
As described above, the estimated market value of real estate and real estate related
assets is determined through an appraisal process. These estimated market values may
vary significantly from the prices at which the real estate investments would sell,
since market prices of real estate investments can only be determined by negotiation
between a willing buyer and seller and could be material to the consolidated financial
statements. Although the estimated market values represent subjective estimates,
management believes these estimated market values are reasonable approximations of
market prices and the aggregate estimated value of investments in real estate is fairly
presented as of December�31, 2007 and 2006.


�

D:�
�
Other Real Estate Investments � Other real estate investments include short term
notes receivable, which are valued at the amount due and approximate market value.


�

E:�
�
Cash and Cash Equivalents � Cash and cash equivalent are comprised of all
short-term investments and investments in money market funds with a maximum maturity of
three months. Cash equivalents consist of investments in the Prudential Investment
Liquidity Pool offered and managed by an affiliate of PFI and are accounted for at market
value.


�

F:�
�
Other Assets � Restricted cash of $186,736 and $167,311 was maintained by the
wholly owned and consolidated properties at December�31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, for
tenant security deposits and is included in Other Assets on the Consolidated Statements
of Assets and Liabilities. Other assets also include tenant receivables and are net of
allowance for uncollectible accounts of $39,764 and $211,058 at December�31, 2007 and
2006, respectively.

 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF 
THE PRUDENTIAL VARIABLE CONTRACT REAL PROPERTY PARTNERSHIP 
For Years Ended December�31, 2007, 2006, and 2005








Note 2:����Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
(continued)






G:�
�
Investment Level Debt � Investment level debt is stated at the principal
amount of the obligations outstanding. At times the Partnership may assume debt in
connection with the purchase of real estate. For debt assumed, the Partnership allocates
a portion of the purchase price to the below/above market debt and amortizes the
premium/discount over the remaining life of the debt.


�

H:�
�
Deferred Financing Costs � Included in Other Assets are deferred financing costs
amounting to $36,072 and $309,894 which are net of accumulated amortization of $273,822
and $80,227 as of December�31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and which are being amortized
over the term of the related obligation.


�

I:�
�
Revenue Recognition � Revenue from real estate is recognized when earned in
accordance with the terms of the respective leases. Revenue from certain real estate
investments is net of all or a portion of related real estate expenses, as lease
arrangements vary as to responsibility for payment of these expenses between tenants and
the Partnership. Since real estate is stated at estimated market value, net income is not
reduced by depreciation or amortization expense.


�

J:�
�
Equity in Income of Real Estate Partnership � Equity in income from real estate
partnership operations represents the Partnership�s share of the current year�s
partnership income as provided for under the terms of the partnership agreements. As is
the case with wholly owned real estate, partnership net income is not reduced by
depreciation or amortization expense. Frequency of distribution of income is determined
by formal agreements or by the executive committee of the partnership.


�

K:�
�
Federal Income Taxes � The Partnership is not a taxable entity under the
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. The income and capital gains and losses of the
Partnership are attributed, for federal income tax purposes, to the Partners in the
Partnership. The Partnership may be subject to state and local taxes in jurisdictions in
which it operates.


�

L:�
�
New Accounting Pronouncements � FASB Interpretation No.�46, �Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities� (�FIN 46�), was issued in January�2003. In December�2003,
FASB issued a revised interpretation of FIN 46 (FIN 46-R�) that supersedes FIN 46. FIN
46-R defers the effective date for applying the provisions of FIN46 for those companies
currently accounting for their investments in accordance with the AICPA Audit and
Accounting Guide, �Audits of Investment Companies� (the �Audit Guide�). The FASB is
currently considering modifying FIN 46-R to provide an exception for companies that apply
the Audit Guide. The Partnership is awaiting the final determination from the FASB in
order to evaluate the extent in which, if any, its equity investments may need to be
consolidated as a result of this FIN 46-R.


�

�
�
In September�2006, the staff of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or �SEC�,
issued Staff Accounting Bulletin, or �SAB�, No.�108, �Considering the Effects of Prior
Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements.�
The interpretations in this SAB express the staff�s views regarding the process of
quantifying financial statement misstatements. Specifically, the SEC staff believes
that registrants must quantify the impact on current period financial statements of
correcting all misstatements, including both those occurring in the current period and
the effect of reversing those that have accumulated from prior periods. This SAB must
be applied beginning with the first fiscal year ending after November�15, 2006, with
early adoption encouraged. Since the Partnership�s method for quantifying financial
statement misstatements already considers those occurring in the current period and the
effect of reversing those that have accumulated from prior periods, the adoption of SAB
No.�108 had no effect on the financial position and result of operations of the
Partnership.


�

�
�
The Partnership adopted FASB Interpretation No.�48 (�FIN 48�), �Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes,� an Interpretation of FASB Statement No.�109 as of January
1, 2007. This interpretation prescribes a comprehensive model for how a partnership
should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in its financial statements uncertain
tax positions that the partnership has taken or expects to take on a tax return. The
adoption of FIN 48 had no effect to the financial position and result of operations of
the Partnership.

L:�
�
New Accounting Pronouncements (continued)


�

�
�
In September�2006, the FASB issued SFAS No.�157, �Fair Value Measurements.� This statement
defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted
accounting principles, and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements. This
statement does not require any new fair value measurements, but the application of this
statement could change current practices in determining fair value.


�

�
�
In February�2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.�159, �The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets
and Financial Liabilities,� including an amendment of FASB Statement No.�115. This statement
provides partnerships with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at
fair value.


�

�
�
SFAS No.�157 and SFAS No.�159 are effective for fiscal years beginning after November�15, 2007
with early adoption permitted. The Partnership plans to adopt this guidance effective January
1, 2008. The Partnership is currently assessing the impact of SFAS 157 and SFAS 159 on the
Partnership�s consolidated financial position and results of operations.


�

�
�
In June�2007, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee issued Statement of Position 07-1,
�Clarification of the Scope of the Audit and Accounting Guide Investment Companies and
Accounting by Parent Companies and Equity Method Investors for Investments in Investment
Companies� (�SOP 07-1�). SOP 07-1 provides guidance for determining whether an entity is
within the scope of the AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide Investment Companies (the �Audit

Note 8:����Commitments and Contingencies

In 1986, Prudential committed to fund up to $100�million to enable
the Partnership to acquire real
estate investments. Contributions to the Partnership under this commitment have been utilized for
property acquisitions, and were to be returned to Prudential on an ongoing basis from contract
owners� net contributions and other available cash. The amount of the commitment has been reduced
by $10�million for every $100�million in current value net assets of the Partnership. As of
December�31, 2007, the cost basis of Prudential�s equity interest in the Partnership under this
commitment (held through the Real Property Accounts) was $44.2�million. Prudential terminated this
commitment on December�31, 2002.

The Partnership is subject to various legal proceedings and claims arising
in the ordinary course
of business. These matters are generally covered by insurance. In the opinion of Prudential�s
management, the outcome of such matters will not have a significant effect on the financial
position of the Partnership.

Note 9:����Other Related Party Transactions

Pursuant to an investment management agreement, PIM charges the
Partnership a daily investment
management fee at an annual rate of 1.25% of the average daily gross asset valuation of the
Partnership. For the years ended December�31, 2007, 2006, and 2005 management fees incurred by the
Partnership were $3.4�million, $3.1�million, and $2.8�million, for each of the years, respectively.
The Partnership also reimburses PIM for certain administrative services rendered by PIM. The
amounts incurred for the years ended December�31, 2007, 2006, and 2005 were $53,630, $146,930; and
$123,630; respectively, and are classified as administrative expenses in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations.

During the years ended December�31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the
Partnership made the following

Report of Independent
Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Partners of
The Prudential Variable Contract Real Property Partnership:

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated statements
of assets and liabilities, including the
schedule of real estate investments, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of
changes in net assets and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of The Prudential Variable Contract Real Property Partnership (the �Partnership�) at
December�31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of its operations, the changes in its net assets and
its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December�31, 2007 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the management of The Prudential Insurance Company of America.
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

INFORMATION NOT REQUIRED IN PROSPECTUS

ITEM 14.  INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS
�
The Registrant, in connection with certain affiliates, maintains various insurance coverages under which the underwriter and certain affiliated persons may be insured against liability which may be incurred in such capacity, subject to the terms, conditions, and exclusions of the insurance policies.
�
Arizona, being the state of organization of Pruco Life Insurance Company ("Pruco Life"), permits entities organized under its jurisdiction to indemnify directors and officers with certain limitations.  The relevant provisions of Arizona law permitting indemnification can be found in Section 10-850 et seq. of the Arizona Statutes Annotated.  The text of Pruco Life's By-law, Article VIII, which relates to indemnification of officers and directors, is incorporated by reference to Exhibit 3(ii) to its Form 10-Q, SEC File No. 33-37587, filed August 15, 1997. 
�
Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Act") may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the Registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions or otherwise, the Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.  In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the
Registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the Registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by
controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

Back to topProperty Agreement BasicsWhen dealing with real estate, you want to cover all your bases. A Property Agreement can help address everyone's best interest. After all, property is usually a person's biggest investment. You may be putting hundreds of thousands-or even millions-on the table, so there's no room for mistakes. A lot can happen between the offer and the handing over the keys. Signing a Property Agreement means that both buyer and seller have made a commitment-neither can back out without a good reason, and breaking the agreement usually means paying a penalty. If you're a buyer, you'll likely have to hand over some earnest money as part of a Property Agreement. Don't skimp on the details: create a Property Agreement to give your real estate deal a strong foundation.

Back to topConsent to Sublease BasicsMaking sure the details of a new sublease agreement are clearly ironed out, and documented, is important for everyone involved—the tenant, the subletter, and the landlord all benefit from a Consent to Sublease. As many landlords don't allow subleasing, if you're the tenant you'll need to check your lease first. Even if it's not allowed according to the lease, you can check with your landlord and you may discover they're amenable to a sublease. And as a landlord, subleasing can ensure continuance of rent payment if your current tenant is unable to fulfill their obligations. Whether you're the tenant, landlord, or potential subletting tenant, everyone can be on the same page, in writing, with a Consent to Sublease.
