Gave as a gift and the girls loved it!SturdyThis was a great quality and gorgeous necklace but unfortunately my daughter dropped it down the drain.Great gift for that teenaged girlI ordered one of these sterling silver charm necklaces for my niece for Christmas. It's very sweet and just the right size for a teenaged girl.Great for everydayThis initial is a little smaller than I expected, but it's perfect for an everyday necklace without drawing too much attention.Beautiful Very elegant and beautiful necklace.
