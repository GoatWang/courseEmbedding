Joey New York: A Paid Promotion Which Won't Pay - Joey New York, Inc. (OTCMKTS:JOEY) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Joey New York: A Paid Promotion Which Won't PayFeb.27.15 | About: Joey New (JOEY) Hunter Straus Long-term horizon, Growth, long/short equitySummaryJoey New York is a paid stock promotion.Over 75% of the stock is owned by insiders.The company's financials are inconsistent with what the promotion claims.JOEY stock does not currently have an active market.Background
Following the close of the market on February 26, 2015, a series of promotional emails from Penny Picks, DamnGood PennyPicks, and BeatPennyStocks were sent out encouraging investors to purchase the common stock of Joey New York, Inc. (OTCQB:JOEY), citing that the company has major upside and is on the verge of completing a major acquisition.
However, if one reads through the company's financial statements, it's clear that the paid promotion is intended to create a market for a third party to sell its shares, not to inform investors of a fantastic investment opportunity.
Business
Joey New York, Inc. is a company that distributes cosmetics. From the company's 10-K, it reads:

The Company through its wholly owned subsidiary, RAR Beauty, LLC doing business under the name Joey New York, distributes natural skin care and beauty products on wholesale and retail levels.
The Company's headquarters is based in Sunny Isles Beach, Florida. The Company seeks to increase market share and introduce its product line through multiple channel markets. The Company faces competition from nationally recognized firms that may have greater resources of personnel, capitalization, and reputation. The Company has therefore concentrated its efforts on product quality and performance.
Joey New York product lines include skin care treatments and beauty enhancements that are health conscious, effective and affordable. In keeping with our beauty mission, we have utilized the water from tender young green coconuts, blended with Indian ginseng extract, into our new fast-acting QUICK RESULTS skincare collection.

Sounds relatively straightforward - they distribute cosmetics. However, if one goes back a few years in the company's filings, you can see that the company was formerly called Pronto Corporation, but was renamed on September 5, 2013 in conjunction with a 20 for 1 stock split. At the time of the final 10-Q as Pronto (July 16, 2013), the company was defined as a shell.

I've always been wary of splits and name changes in micro-cap stocks, and this one is no exception. If you look at the company's most recent 10-K, it states that there are only three employees in the company, which seems a very small staff for a company that claims to be engaged in the distribution of products on the retail and wholesale level.
Financials
From the latest 10-Q, the company's balance sheet shows that the company has just under $34,000 in cash, while its cash flow statement shows that it went through nearly $133,000 in cash in the first nine months of 2014 ending November 30. Additionally, the company has an accumulated deficit of $3.97 million. Given the company's burn rate, $33,000 is not going to be enough to continue to run the business on, and the company's current market cap of $20 million just doesn't seem justified.
Apparently, the company's auditors agree, as they have issued a Going Concern note in the company's 10-Q, which reads:

For the nine month period ended November 30, 2014 the Company has incurred a loss from operations of $419,551. The Company has a history of losses resulting in an accumulated deficit. The Company has negative working capital, in the amount of $808,626, as of November 30, 2014. The Company intends to fund operations and continuing product development through debt and equity financing arrangements, which efforts may be insufficient to fund its capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements. The Company cannot be certain that it will be successful in its efforts to attain such capital or that the terms of capital will be at acceptable terms.
These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Indicating that the company's accounting firm recognizes that the company is in poor financial shape, and that the company is likely going to issue equity in order to stay afloat. I expect to see some 8-Ks in the future that make note of a "Private Placement" or possibly an S-1 for the issuance of more shares.

Promotion
As mentioned previously, JOEY has been the subject of a paid promotion, which went out on February 26th following the close of the market. The promotion stated in part:
The company is working on a major acquisition. The target company is making over $10 million a year in sales, something JOEY is keen to bring into its already strong operational setup.
Given that JOEY has only about $33,000 in the bank, and not given any other details, this proposition doesn't really make any sense - beyond the issue that sales don't necessarily correlate to profitability, the numbers just don't scale. I don't see how any company that brings in over $10 million in revenue will be bought out for less than $33,000.
There are other claims that encourage potential investors to look at JOEY, but what is really important is the disclaimer at the bottom of the advertisement.
The disclaimer, which reads:
This newsletter is a paid advertisement, not a recommendation nor an offer to buy or sell securities. This newsletter is owned, operated and edited by Stellar Media Group, LLC….Stellar Media's business model is to receive financial compensation to promote public companies. We have been compensated Twenty thousand dollars cash via bank wire by a third party, OTP Group, LLC, to conduct investor relations advertising and marketing for JOEY. This compensation is a major conflict of interest in our ability to be unbiased regarding. Therefore, this communication should be viewed as a commercial advertisement only. We have not investigated the background of the hiring third party or parties. The third party, profiled company, or their affiliates likely wish to liquidate shares of the profiled company at or near the time you receive this communication, which has the potential to hurt share prices…
This promotional email hit my inbox just after the market closed on February 26th, indicating that its purpose is to create a market on the following day. Given that the average daily volume of JOEY common stock is about 6000 shares, and that the promoters paid over twenty thousand dollars, it's pretty clear that there is not currently a big market for JOEY stock - sending out the promotion looks like it is intended to generate investor interest in order to create a sizeable enough market for OTP (or its clients) to sell its shares.

Insider Ownership
From the company's most recent 10-K, 75.36% of the shares are owned by officers or directors of the company, which makes me even more wary of this promotion. While there is no mention of OTP Group, LLC in the company's recent filings, I think that it would speak well for management if they could clarify whether there is a relationship between this entity or not. A Google search for OTP Group, LLC yields a LinkedIn page for the company, where it describes itself as:

OTP Group is a small-cap research, investor relations, and media company headquartered in New York City; with affiliate offices in Texas and Florida.
OTP Group specializes in delivering concrete, measurable results for its clients through its extensive global network of small-cap institutional and retail investors. The OTP Team has developed the most comprehensive platform of products and services for small-cap companies, which includes: Research Reports, Retail and Institutional Marketing, Institutional and Retail Road Shows, CEO Audio Interviews, The OTP Report, featuring small-cap companies, Shareholder Intelligence, Strategic Marketing, Crisis Management, Social Media, and Blogging Services.

So the third party paying for the promotion looks to be working on behalf of its undisclosed clients but is probably not a major shareholder itself, as it is not a named shareholder. This was surprising and pretty interesting - usually when there is a paying third party listed in the disclaimer section of an ad, searches yield nothing, but here, we actually know who is paying for the promotion.
Conclusion
I am always wary of promoted stocks, and Joey New York is no exception; it has poor financials, which merit a Going Concern note from its auditors, and has a market cap that seems unjustified by its balance sheet and cash flow. Furthermore, because of its financial situation, investors can expect dilution in the form of equity issuances. Additionally, there is substantial insider ownership, and the third party paying for the promotion is clearly working on behalf of major shareholders. While there is no definitive link between the insiders and the paying entity, it would not surprise me at all if management was paying to have the stock promoted so that they could unload some of their shares. If you are considering taking a long position in JOEY, think again - this company has too many red flags to make it a suitable long-term investment. I'm not going anywhere near this one.

Nearby Midtown This is the iconic New York that so many visitorsimagine before they visit - spectacular skyscraperslike the Chrysler Building and Empire State Building,iconic public buildings like Grand Central Terminaland the New York Public Library, and the non-stophustle and bustle of the city streets. Fifth Avenue isa shopper's paradise where you can find every kind ofstore imaginable, with fashion brands ranging from the...Moreaffordable to the ultra-fancy. Visit RockefellerCenter to experience towering Art Deco grandeur, andfoodies will love the busy restaurants that stay openlate in Koreatown. After dark, Midtown calms down abit, but at any time of day or night it still feels100% New York.LessNearby RestaurantsFamous Famiglia Pizzeria403 reviews .05 miles away Trattoria Bianca156 reviews .03 miles away Culture Espresso Bar159 reviews .06 miles away Starbucks115 reviews .03 miles away Nearby Attractions34th Street29 reviews .11 miles away On Location Tours2,672 reviews .11 miles away The Ride1,982 reviews .15 miles away Mood Fabrics83 reviews .11 miles away

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
