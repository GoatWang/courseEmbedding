Corporations Compared to LLCs - Corporation Topics | LegalZoom


































In addition to certain guarantees provided by law, LegalZoom guarantees your satisfaction with our services and support. Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.
LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Corporations Compared to LLCs









Knowledge Center&rtrif;Corporation&rtrif;Corporations Compared to LLCs 













        Corporations Compared to LLCs      
Limited liability companies (LLCs) are one of the newest types of business entities. Like corporations, they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships. Whether an LLC or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business. The best comparison here is between an LLC and an S corporation, because an LLC can choose to be taxed as an S corporation.
Social Security Taxes
The owners of the S corporation can take out some profits without Social Security taxes. For a large business in which the owners take out salaries of $118,500 or more plus profits, there would not be much difference, since the Social Security tax cuts out at that level as of 2015. However, for a smaller business, in which an owner could take out a $30,000 salary and $20,000 profit, the extra taxes on the $20,000 would be over $3,000.
Raising Money
If a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people, the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the LLC.
Liability Protection
An important advantage of an LLC is that in some states, a creditor cannot collect the members’ LLC distributions. With a corporation, creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets, but can collect the shareholder’s dividends.
Profits, Losses, and Taxes
The other advantages of LLCs are found in certain tax situations. For example, an LLC can make special allocations of profits and losses among members, whereas S corporations cannot. S corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership. In an LLC, money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis (and lower the taxes) of the owners, whereas in an S corporation, it does not. Contributing property to set up an LLC is not taxable, even for minority interest owners, whereas for a corporation, regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business.
Foreign Ownership
The owners of an LLC can be foreign persons, other corporations, or any kind of trust, whereas the owners of S corporations cannot. An LLC may have an unlimited number of members, while an S corporation is limited to one hundred.
Management Options
LLCs are also popular because of their flexible management options, allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations. LLCs have fewer formalities than corporations, another advantage for some business owners.
Fringe Benefits
Corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity. Various retirement, stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations. Plus, sole proprietors, partners and employees owning more than 2% of an S corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits (such as group-term life insurance, medical reimbursement plans, medical insurance premiums and parking). Shareholder-employees of a C corporation do not have to pay taxes on these benefits.

Skip to main content







In addition to certain guarantees provided by law, LegalZoom guarantees your satisfaction with our services and support. Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.
LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Knowledge Center&rtrif;Limited Liability Company&rtrif;FAQ 









Limited Liability Company FAQ
Find FAQs related to starting an LLC.
















What is a limited liability company (LLC)?


    
A limited liability company, or LLC, is a business entity created under state laws which has the characteristics of both a corporation and a partnership. Like a corporation, the owners of an LLC are not personally liable for business debts. Like a sole proprietorship or partnership, an LLC has operating flexibility and is a pass-through entity for tax purposes. This means the LLC's profits are passed through and taxable to the owners of the LLC. 




 





What legal documents do I need to form an LLC?


    
To create an LLC, Articles of Organization must be filed with the Secretary of State or appropriate state agency. Next, the LLC members should enter into an operating agreement, which sets forth the rights of the members and the rules for running the company. An LLC may also need to apply for a tax identification number with the IRS. LegalZoom can prepare all of the required documents for you. 

  


 





Can my LLC have an unlimited lifespan?

Yes. Recent changes to the IRS code have promoted changes in state laws permitting LLCs to be created with an unlimited life.


 





What is the difference between a "member" and a "manager" of an LLC?


    
A member is an owner of the LLC and is similar to a stockholder of a corporation. A manager is a person chosen by the members to manage the LLC and is similar to a director of a corporation. A manager can also be a member. 
  


 





Does an LLC have to hold meetings?


    
The answer is usually no, unless the LLC's operating agreement requires meetings. LegalZoom's operating agreements make meetings optional. This is one of the key advantages of an LLC - fewer formalities. This means less paperwork and less chance that the members will accidentally violate the law and thereby lose their liability protection. 


  


 





How much will it cost to form and operate an LLC?

Each state charges an annual fee to maintain an LLC. In many states, you must also submit an annual report or statement of information, which is a one-page form sent by the state. Some states also have state taxes. The annual fees for three popular states—California, Nevada and Delaware—are as follows (prices shown are as of 2015):

California: A $20 reporting fee and a statement of information are required 90 days after formation and then every two years. An annual $800 LLC tax is due by the 15th day of the fourth month after LLC formation and every year thereafter. If the LLC's income exceeds $250,000, it will owe an additional LLC tax based on the income amount.


Nevada: A $150 fee and the Initial List of Managers or Managing Members, as well as a $200 fee and a Business Licence Application, are due within 30 days of formation. There is no state income tax.


Delaware: There is an annual LLC tax of $300 due each June 1st, beginning the year following formation. There is no state income tax.


New York: Every LLC must publish notice of its formation in two newspapers in the county in which it was created. In some areas, the fees for this publication can run up to $2,000. The company must then submit a certificate of this publication to the state, together with a $50 filing fee. For LLCs that choose to be treated as a partnership, there are annual taxes that are based on total income (from a minimum of $25 to a maximum of $4,500).


Every other state: Contact a local accountant.

 
LegalZoom can help you save time when you form an LLC. Answer a few questions in our online questionnaire, we’ll check your answers for consistency and completeness, and file the required documentation with your state. Once your LLC is formed, we send you a final package with all of your documents. We also can help you get in touch with independent attorneys to answer questions about your business.


 





What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?


Although an S corporation shares many of the same tax characteristics as an LLC, an LLC has more flexibility and fewer restrictions than an S corporation. An S corporation cannot have more than 100 stockholders, cannot issue more than one class of shares, and is subject to more formalities than an LLC. However, owners of an LLC are required to pay Social Security and Medicare taxes on profits. Corporate stockholders are not required to pay these taxes on profits over and above the stockholders' salaries.



 





Do I need an attorney to form an LLC?


    
No, you do not need an attorney to form an LLC. You can prepare the legal paperwork and file it yourself, or use a professional business formation service, such as LegalZoom. If you choose to form your LLC through LegalZoom, you will only need to answer a few simple questions online.  We will take care of all of your paperwork, file the necessary documents with the state and even send you an LLC kit with seals and certificates. 



 





How many people are needed to form an LLC?


    
In all states, only one person is needed to form an LLC. Recent changes to the IRS code have promoted reforms in state laws, permitting one-member LLCs.

We love to help!Should I form my business as an LLC?Despite being a relatively new option, the limited liability company (LLC) is now one of the most popular business structures among smaller organizations. While allowing business owners to remain free from a great deal of the regulations imposed on other types of companies, it still provides limited liability protection for its owners (members). This means that the personal assets of an LLC's ownership cannot be collected to fulfill the debts of the business. What is involved in forming an LLC?All states require potential LLC owners to file a substantial set of documents, typically called the Articles of Organization, in order to establish their business. We can take care of this process for you, saving you time, effort, and allowing you to focus on developing your business – not filing paperwork. How should I name my LLC?The name you choose for your LLC is an important decision, as it will be how you represent yourself to potential associates and clients. With that in mind, it is advisable that you take some time to craft a name that you will be proud to have representing you and your business.Your name must be unique, and not deceptively similar, to any other trademarked name or business. It is also required that your name not be used to intentionally misrepresent the products or services you offer. For LLCs, nearly all states will also require you to add a signifier of your limited liability status, such as "LLC" or "L.L.C." to the end of your company's name. You may be able to operate under a name other than your formal LLC name by applying for and using a dba. Are there a required number of individuals needed to form an LLC?There is no minimum requirement as to the number of owners (also referred to as members) that an LLC must have. At the federal level, single-member LLCs qualify for pass-through taxation, however this is not always true at the state level.

In addition to certain guarantees provided by law, LegalZoom guarantees your satisfaction with our services and support. Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.
LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Definition of a Limited Liability Company or LLC









Knowledge Center&rtrif;Limited Liability Company&rtrif;Definition of a Limited Liability Company or LLC 













        Definition of a Limited Liability Company or LLC      
Like a corporation, a limited liability company or "LLC," is a separate and distinct legal entity. This means that an LLC can get a tax identification number, open a bank account and do business, all under its own name.
How Does an LLC Protect You?
One of the primary advantages of an LLC is that its owners, called members, have "limited liability," meaning that, under most circumstances, they are not personally liable for the debts and liabilities of the LLC.
For example, if an LLC is forced into bankruptcy, then the members will not be usually be required to pay the LLC's debts with their own money. If the assets of the LLC are not enough to  the debts and liabilities, the creditors generally cannot look to the owners for payment. Their debt was with the LLC, not the people that owned the LLC.
Benefits of an LLC: Flexible, Scalable, and Simple
LLCs aren't bound by the same rigid rules of corporations, but this doesn't stop them from being just as useful. It doesn't matter if you're a one-man business or if you have hundreds of employees, an LLC keeps protecting you while allowing for expansion and growth. With an LLC, there's no requirement for special meetings, extensive corporate records, or many other formalities. Limited liability companies are even flexible when it comes to taxes, offering lots of options so you can create a tax plan that works for you.
This simplicity, protection, and ease of use have made forming an LLC a popular choice for small businesses in America.
LegalZoom makes it easy and affordable to form an LLC. Get started by answering a few questions about your new business. We use your answers to assemble your LLC documents and file them with the Secretary of State, and you will receive your completed LLC package by mail.

LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

 Limited Liability Company
Each year, millions of new businesses are registered throughout the country. For years corporations have been the preferred form of business, but the limited liability company is becoming more popular every year. The reason for this is that limited liability companies provide more flexibility and less paperwork than corporations, while offering nearly identical benefits.

LLC Basics




Limited liability companies combine the best parts of partnerships and corporations.


By Beth Laurence, J.D.




Share on Google Plus





Share on Facebook













 





A limited liability company (LLC) offers protection from personal liability for business debts, just like a corporation. However, unlike a corporation, which must pay its own taxes, an LLC is a pass-through tax entity: The profits and losses of the business pass through to its owners, who report them on their personal tax returns just as they would if they owned a partnership or sole proprietorship. Moreover, while setting up an LLC is more difficult than creating a partnership or sole proprietorship, running one is significantly easier than running a corporation.
Here are the main features of an LLC:
Limited Personal Liability
Like shareholders of a corporation, all LLC owners are protected from personal liability for business debts and claims. This means that if the business itself can't pay a creditor -- such as a supplier, a lender, or a landlord -- the creditor cannot legally come after an LLC member's house, car, or other personal possessions. Because only LLC assets are used to pay off business debts, LLC owners stand to lose only the money that they've invested in the LLC. This feature is often called "limited liability."
Exceptions to Limited Liability
While LLC owners enjoy limited personal liability for many of their business transactions, this protection is not absolute. This drawback is not unique to LLCs, however -- the same exceptions apply to corporations. An LLC owner can be held personally liable if he or she:

personally and directly injures someone
personally guarantees a bank loan or a business debt on which the LLC defaults
fails to deposit taxes withheld from employees' wages
intentionally does something fraudulent, illegal, or reckless that causes harm to the company or to someone else, or
treats the LLC as an extension of his or her personal affairs, rather than as a separate legal entity.

This last exception is the most important. If owners don't treat the LLC as a separate business, a court might decide that the LLC doesn't really exist and find that its owners are really doing business as individuals who are personally liable for their acts. To keep this from happening, make sure you and your co-owners:

Act fairly and legally. Do not conceal or misrepresent material facts or the state of your finances to vendors, creditors, or other outsiders.
Fund your LLC adequately. Invest enough cash in the business so that your LLC can meet foreseeable expenses and liabilities.
Keep LLC and personal business separate. Get a federal employer identification number, open up a business-only checking account, and keep your personal finances out of your LLC accounting books.
Create an operating agreement. Having a formal written operating agreement lends credibility to your LLC's separate existence. For more on this, see Nolo's article The LLC Operating Agreement.

For more information on LLC limited liability protection and the differences in state laws, see  LLCs and Limited  Liability - What Protection Do You Get?.  


Additional Protection: Business Insurance
A good liability insurance policy can shield your personal assets when limited liability protection does not. For instance, if you are a massage therapist and you accidentally injure a client's back, your liability insurance policy should cover you. Insurance can also protect your personal assets in the event that your limited liability status is ignored by a court.
In addition to protecting your personal assets in such situations, insurance can protect the LLC's assets from lawsuits and claims. But your LLC won't be protected if it doesn't pay its bills: Commercial insurance usually does not protect personal or corporate assets from unpaid business debts, whether or not they're personally guaranteed.
For more information on insurance, see Nolo's article Obtaining Small Business Insurance.
LLC Taxes
Unlike a corporation, an LLC is not considered separate from its owners for tax purposes. Instead, it is what the IRS calls a "pass-through entity," like a partnership or sole proprietorship. This means that business income passes through the business to the LLC members, who report their share of profits -- or losses -- on their individual income tax returns. Each LLC member must make quarterly estimated tax payments to the IRS.
While an LLC itself doesn't pay taxes, co-owned LLCs must file Form 1065, an informational return, with the IRS each year. This form, which partnerships also have to file, sets out each LLC member's share of the LLC's profits (or losses), which the IRS reviews to make sure LLC members are correctly reporting their income.
For more information on LLC taxes, see Nolo's article How LLCs Are Taxed.
LLC Management
The owners of most small LLCs participate equally in the management of their business. This arrangement is called "member management."
There is an alternative management structure -- somewhat awkwardly called "manager management" -- in which you designate one or more owners (or even an outsider) to take responsibility for managing the LLC. The nonmanaging owners (sometimes family members who have invested in the company) simply sit back and share in LLC profits.
In a manager-managed LLC, only the named managers get to vote on management decisions and act as agents of the LLC. Choosing manager management sometimes makes sense, but it might require you to deal with state and federal laws regulating the sale of securities. (For more information, see Nolo's Limited Liability Company (LLC) FAQ.)
Forming an LLC
To create an LLC, you file "articles of organization" (in some states called a "certificate of organization" or "certificate of formation") with the LLC division of your state government. This office is often in the same department as the corporations division, which is usually part of the secretary of state's office. Filing fees range from about $100 to $800. Now, in every state, you can  form an LLC with just one person.
Many states supply a blank one-page form for the articles of organization, on which you need only specify a few basic details about your LLC, such as its name and address, and contact information for a person involved with the LLC (usually called a "registered agent") who will receive legal papers on its behalf. Some states also require you to list the names and addresses of the LLC members.
In addition to filing articles of organization, you must create a written LLC operating agreement. You don't have to file your operating agreement with the state, but that doesn't mean you can get by without one. The operating agreement is a crucial document because it sets out the LLC members' rights and responsibilities, their percentage interests in the business, and their share of the profits.
To learn more about these and other details involved in setting up an LLC, read Nolo's article How to Form an LLC. To form your LLC right now, use Nolo's Online LLC, which will collect the required information and file your articles of organization with your state.
Ending an LLC
Under the laws of many states, unless your operating agreement says otherwise, when one member wants to leave the LLC, the company dissolves. In that case, the LLC members must fulfill any remaining business obligations, pay off all debts, divide any assets and profits among themselves, and then decide whether they want to start a new LLC to continue the business with the remaining members.
Your LLC operating agreement can prevent this kind of abrupt ending to your business by including "buy-sell," or buyout, provisions that set up guidelines for what will happen when one member retires, dies, becomes disabled, or leaves the LLC to pursue other interests. (For more information, see Nolo's article Plan Ahead for LLC Ownership Changes.)

How to Start an LLC in Nevada

How to Start an LLC in Nevada
by Michael H. Cohen, Esq., October 2014





Forming a Nevada LLC is affordable and easy. As with other states, the State of Nevada has some specific requirements that are idiosyncratic.
Interested parties must register with the Secretary of State by filing the necessary forms, paying the necessary fees and meeting all naming and formation requirements.
Overall, here are some of the essential requirements for forming an LLC in Nevada:
Registration. File the Articles of Organization form with the Secretary of State. The form must include all the pertinent information, such as the LLC name and address; the name and address of the resident agent; the dissolution date, if applicable; the employer identification number or, for single-member LLCs, the social security number; the necessary state licenses and business permits; the member’s or manager’s name; and the name and address of the organizers. Do not forget to include the filing fee, about $75. You may register online or by mail.
Forms and fees. All LLCs are required to submit the Articles of Organization Form following NRS Chapter 86 with the Secretary of State. The Initial List of Managers and Members Form, along with the business license, should be filed with the Secretary of State after filing the Articles of Organization. The fees to be submitted with the forms are $75, $125 and $200, respectively. Filing fees can change, you should check with the Secretary of State for the most current fees.
Timeline. Generally, it takes a few business days for all forms filed with the Secretary of State to get processed. However, there are expedited processing services available. For a 24-hour expedited processing service, the fee is about $125 per form. For a 24-hour expedited name-reservation processing service, the fee is $50. There are also two- and one-hour expedited processing services, costing $500 and $1,000, respectively, per form. Since fees can change, check with the Secretary of State for the most recent processing fees.
Naming requirements. LLC naming requirements are not strict in Nevada. The LLC name must be distinguishable from other LLCs, must be approved by state agencies and must include certain words in order to qualify and be approved by the Secretary of State. You may opt to have a preferred name checked for availability.
Formation requirements. All entities conducting business transactions in Nevada are required to have a business license issued by the Secretary of State. Also, all LLCs in Nevada are required to have a registered agent with a permanent address within the state. There are no requirements for operating agreements for LLCs in Nevada, but it is still advisable to have one, as it clearly delineates each member’s contribution to the company and what portion of the company’s profits, credits and losses go to each member.

Starting an LLC in Nevada
Before deciding to form an LLC in Nevada, you must understand what an LLC is and if it's a viable business structure for your company. To begin, an LLC is a business structure that has a flexible organization, is privy to tax efficiencies and provides limited liability for its members. Members may include individuals, corporations, other LLCs and foreign entities. One good thing about LLCs is that there is no maximum number of members. An LLC is also known as a ”hybrid” business structure in the sense that it brings together elements of a corporation and limited liability partnerships.
Here are some tips for helping you put together what you need to begin the registration process with the Nevada Secretary of State:
1. Decide on a name for your business. You can choose any name as long as it ends with “Limited Liability Company,” “Ltd. Liability Co.,” or any variant of its abbreviation—e.g., LLC or L.L.C. You may check if the name you want for your LLC is available by crosschecking its availability with the Secretary of State business name database. You may reserve a name for 90 days by filing a name reservation request with the Secretary of State, which can be done online or by mail. There is a filing fee of about $25. The name reservation process can be expedited for an additional fee, usually about $50.
2. Assign an agent for service of process. Also referred to as the resident agent, this is any individual who resides in Nevada or a business that has filed an appropriate certificate. This person or business is the entity that will receive service of process for any lawsuit naming the LLC as defendant.
3. Make sure to file the Initial List of Managers and Members along with the business permit. This allows the LLC to conduct business transactions in Nevada. There are fees that must be paid in order for these permits to be processed.
4. Get your employer identification number (EIN). If there are two or more members in your LLC, make sure to obtain your EIN from the IRS for tax purposes.
5. If your LLC has more than one member, make sure that you have a limited liability company operating agreement in place with other members. Although this is not included in the filing requirements with the Nevada Secretary of State, the LLC operating agreement must be submitted when filing for your Nevada tax license.
6. Familiarize yourself with the LLC’s continuing legal obligations. As noted, the LLC must file a Statement of Information. It must also maintain internal books and records that are open to inspection by the Nevada Secretary of State. This includes the LLC’s operating agreement.
Filing an LLC and Fees
Following are the forms and fees that are required when starting an LLC in Nevada:
1. Forms. First, you need to fill out the Articles of Organization Form. Do not forget to include the following information/fees:
LLC name that meets state requirements and the LLC’s address
Names, addresses and signatures of all LLC managers, members and organizers
Name, address and signature of the resident agent
Dissolution date, if applicable
Payment of the necessary fees
2. Fees. Processing fees for the Articles of Organization form is about $75 but may be expedited for a fee of about $150. Expedited orders are processed within 24 hours. Fees can be paid by check, money order, credit card or trust account. These amounts can change so contact the Secretary of State for the most current fees.
3. Limited liability company operating agreement. Although this is not required in Nevada, it is highly advisable to have an LLC operating agreement among members. This should be kept on file by the resident agent.
4. Taxes. LLCs in Nevada are treated as corporations, limited liability partnerships or single-member LLCs and are subject to federal income tax classifications. Depending on the type of taxation you opt to have for your LLC, the tax responsibilities are as follows:
a) An LLC treated as a limited liability partnership. These LLCs are required to file Form 1065, U.S. Return of Partnership Income, and show equal distribution of profits, losses and credit on a Schedule K-1 Form with the IRS.
b) An LLC treated as a C corporation for federal tax purposes. These LLCs are required to file Form 8832 first and must opt to be taxed as a corporation. Next, they must file Form 1120, U.S. Corporate Income Tax Return, with the IRS.
c) An LLC treated as an S corporation. These LLCs are required to file Form 1120S accompanied by a report from each owner expressing the equal distribution of profits, losses and credit with the IRS.
d) An LLC treated as a sole proprietorship. These LLCs must report all business income and expenses via the sole proprietor’s personal income tax returns, Schedule C (Form 1040), Profit or Loss From Business, with the IRS.

The Elusive Hunt for Stealthy Entity WMDs (Weapons of Mass Deception)
By Richard Keyt, Arizona business, contracts and entity formation attorney
I am an Arizona business lawyer who has formed corporations and partnerships since 1980.  I formed my first LLC the day the Arizona’s LLC law became effective in 1992. Since 2001 I have formed 

						5,500+ Arizona limited liability companies. Every day I talk to several people who have questions about forming an entity. One of the most common questions people ask me when they are considering forming a corporation or a limited liability company is “should I form my company in Nevada instead of Arizona?” For the reasons stated below, I rarely recommend that people form an entity in Nevada.
Alleged Reasons to Form an LLC or Corporation in Nevada
Most of people who ask me about forming a Nevada corporation or limited liability company live in Arizona, will operate their business or own real estate in Arizona and will derive all income solely from within Arizona. When I ask them why they want to form a company in Nevada they usually say:

To save state income taxes, and/or


To hide the fact I own the company (the mythical hunt for stealth).

My typical response is to say “whoever told you that is either: (i) misinformed (giving the “Nevada law expert” the benefit of the doubt), (ii) an idiot, (iii) intentionally trying to deceive you to sell their Nevada ultimate asset protection entity product, or (iv) all of the above.
A few people also say they want to form their entity in Nevada because:

Nevada has the best entity laws of any state, and/or


Nevada has the series LLC.

Reality vs. Spin
Let us look at each of the alleged reasons to form an entity in Nevada.
Reason 1 – Save Taxes: Forming an entity in Nevada will only allow you to avoid income taxes only if all of the revenue of the entity is derived in Nevada or states that do not have an income tax. The law of the United States is that if an LLC or a corporation formed in state #1 has a presence in state #2 that has a state income tax and if the LLC or corporation derives income from within state #2, then state #2 can tax all income derived within its borders. Thus, a Nevada LLC or corporation that operates a retail store in Arizona must report and pay Arizona state income tax on the income derived from the Arizona business.
Reason 2 – Hide Ownership: The California Court of Appeals in the well known case of Associated Vendors, Inc. v. Oakland Meat Co., Inc. (1962) 210 Cal. App. 2d 825, 26 Cal. Rptr. 806, listed facts that should be analyzed in determining if an alter ego situation exists and the corporate veil should be pierced and hold the shareholders liable for the debts of the corporation. One of the 19 negative facts the court listed is the “concealment and misrepresentation of the identity of the responsible ownership, management and financial interest, or concealment of personal business activities.” If you hide your ownership of your entity and you end up in court, you will have some “splaining” to do to the judge or jury as to the business purpose in hiding the ownership of the company.
Reason 3 – Nevada Laws Best: Says who? The person who is trying to sell you a Nevada entity? Asset protection attorney Jay Adkinson says “Nevada’s laws are not substantially better than the laws of any other state.” Randall K. Edwards, an asset protection lawyer and litigator who has been licensed to practice law in Nevada since 1983, agrees with Jay Adkinson that Nevada entity law is not better than entity laws of other states. Randall said, “I rarely recommend to any of my clients that they utilize Nevada entities, unless they have some connection to Nevada.” That statement is from an attorney licensed in Nevada who forms Nevada entities. See also the 2008 State Liability Systems Ranking Study prepared by the U.S. Chamber Institute for Legal Reform, which ranks Nevada 40th in a national sample of in-house general counsel or other senior corporate litigators asked to rate the states in terms of how reasonable and fair their tort liability systems are perceived by U.S. businesses.
Reason 4 – Series LLC: Presumably the series LLC works to segregate and limit liability among each series LLC if all of the LLC’s assets and activities occur in the state of formation, the plaintiff is in the state of formation and the lawsuit is filed in the state of formation. If, however, the plaintiff is a tenant injured on property located in California that is owned by a Nevada series LLC and the lawsuit is in a California court, there is a good chance the California court will apply California law and disregard the series feature of the Nevada LLC. There are no appellate court cases that have ruled that the series LLC limits liability when the plaintiff and the court are outside the state in which the LLC was formed. Jay Adkinson said, “the non-Series state is very unlikely to apply the Series-legislation as to creditors, claimants, and other third-parties who did not agree to be bound by the Series legislation.” You may want to be a pioneer and create new appellate law in your state, but I do not want my clients to hope the series LLC will work when for a relatively small cost they can form an additional LLC to hold assets.
Nevada Entities are on the National Radar Scope
A February 23, 2007, story in USA Today entitled “Corporate Owners Hide Assets, Identities” says:
“A multi-agency U.S. Money Laundering Threat Assessment issued in 2005 cited Nevada, Wyoming and Delaware as the states with laws most conducive to anonymous corporate ownership.”
“USA TODAY’s findings buttressed the money laundering report’s warning that a “race to the bottom” among states vying to set minimal corporate information requirements has enabled companies to hide the identities of their owners, thereby making it harder for law enforcement agencies to track suspected tax evasion, money laundering and other crimes.”
“Concern about camouflaged corporate ownership prompted the IRS to list the tactic this week in its 2007 “Dirty Dozen” tax scams. The IRS said anonymous entities are facilitating “underreporting of income, non-filing of tax returns . . . money laundering, financial crimes and possibly terrorist financing.”
A February 2, 2009, story entitled “Forgery alleged in fraud probe,” states, “‘Federal law enforcement officials are concerned that criminals are increasingly using U.S. ‘shell’ companies … to conceal identities and illicit activities,’ a U.S. Government Accountability Office report stated in late 2006.” The story tells how attorney Michael L. Potter’s name was forged on a contract for Centurion Asset Management, or CAM, a company involved with Dennis Bolze. CAM is alleged to have defrauded investors of more than $20 million. Potter said his name likely came to Dennis Bolze’s attention when he was general counsel for CAM’s incorporator, Nevada Corporate Services, Nevada’s largest incorporation service.
See also “Nevada a Scam Haven,” an April 29, 2007, story in the Las Vegas Sun newspaper.
IRS Targets Nevada Entities
On November 14, 2006, K. Steven Burgess, Director, Examination Small Business/Self employed Division, IRS, testified before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations Hearing. His topic was on company formations in states that encourage owner secrecy.
The following key statements in Director Burgess’ testimony should make everybody carefully consider whether they want to risk forming an entity in Nevada:

The IRS has authorized several investigations under Section 6700 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) into promoters of Nevada corporations and resident agents.


An initial sampling of the client lists showed that anywhere from 50 to 90 percent of those listed are currently, or have been previously, non-compliant with Federal tax laws


We are contemplating mass audits of non-filers that would produce a list of non-filer and non-compliant participants.


We are also looking at additional promoter investigations.


The Service will consider “John Doe summonses” to resident agents.

SRobert Lambert, a nationally known asset protection expert, recently told me that a friend of his in the U.S. Department of Justice told him that the DOJ was investigating entities formed in Nevada. See Mr. Lambert’s website called Asset Protection Corporation. It is an excellent asset protection information resource.
Entity Formation Fundamental Concept Number 1
If you want to form an entity to operate a business or own investments, the first question you should ask is:
In what state should I form the entity?
Most of the time, the answer to that question is:
In the state where the entity’s activities will occur.
For example, a person who wants to form an entity to operate a widget sales business in Arizona should form the entity in Arizona unless there is some over-riding reason to form in another state, which rarely exists by the way. If your entity will be doing business in more than one state, you should compare the legal attributes of the entity in each state and form the entity in the state that has the best entity law unless there are good reasons to form in a different state.
Entity formation fundamental concept number 1 is:
Form your entity in the state where it will be located or in which it will engage in business unless there are one or more good reasons to form in another state.
For the reason I discuss below, you should note that whether the state has or does not have a state income tax is not a consideration in determining if you should form an entity in the state.
Entity Formation Fundamental Concept Number 2
The second question you must ask when you are forming a new entity is:
What type of entity should I form?
Most of the time, the answer to that question is:
a limited liability company
Entity formation fundamental concept number 2 is:
Form a limited liability company unless there is a compelling reason to form a different type of entity.
Nevada Entities & Applicable Adages
When people ask me about forming a Nevada limited liability company or corporation I immediately think of the following trite, but applicable proverbs:

A little knowledge is a dangerous thing.


It sounds too good to be true.


All that glitters is not gold.


A fool and his money are soon parted.


There’s no such thing as a free lunch.


Look before you leap.


There are none so blind as those who refuse to see.


Fools rush in where angels fear to tread.


A sucker is born every minute.

If at this point you have gotten the impression that I am not a fan of forming a limited liability company or a corporation in Nevada unless the entity will do business in Nevada, you would be correct.
Asset Protection Resources
Randall K. Edwards
Randall K. Edwards is another nationally known asset protection lawyer who also has a great website. His website contains a lot of informative articles on asset protection, including:
What about Nevada?
The Asset Protection Scams Never End
How to Avoid an Asset Protection Disaster – A Few Tips
Randall K. Edwards on Forming Entities in Nevada

“I’ve been practicing law in Nevada since 1983. . . . At present, I rarely recommend to any of my clients that they utilize Nevada entities, unless they have some connection to Nevada other than a perception that they will have better privacy or some tax advantage. Regardless of the purported advantages for corporations provided in the Nevada Revised Statutes (and I would disagree that they are really any more advantageous than the laws of any other state, if the laws of that other state are utilized correctly), I believe that the burden is on the owner of a Nevada corporation to justify using a Nevada entity, given the current political and legal climate. Unfortunately, for a non-Nevadan, having a Nevada corporation is more and more seen as a per se attempt to defraud a creditor, unless there exists some easily identifiable reason for using an entity from Nevada as opposed to an entity from that person’s home state.”


“When it comes to seeking and taking advice about the efficacy of Nevada legal entities, I believe that the consumer should rely on someone other than a promoter of Nevada companies, who makes his living setting up and maintaining Nevada entities. All of the huff and puff of such promoters about Nevada’s strong ranking for asset protection (by whom, one might ask) is usually just hustle. There may be some advantages to using a Nevada company under certain circumstances (Nevada resident, actual operations in Nevada, Nevada manufacturing or Nevada warehousing), but relentlessly pushing Nevada corporations or LLCs on the public simply on the basis of some perceived “Nevada advantage” is simply unjustifiable. I am amazed at the number of people who continue to push the same old scam regarding Nevada corporations, using the same tactics, the same sales pitch and the same strategies that sunk APG. Folks, it doesn’t work. It can’t work. It’s crap. Don’t fall for it.”


“Of course, as I’ve said . . ., any asset protection strategy that relies on ‘hide the ball’ privacy, nominee officers and directors, blind bank accounts and, worst of all, so-called “bearer shares,” is doomed from the outset. The only meaningful way to protect one’s assets is going to be based on a combination of factors and strategies that are legally and logically defensible. Right now, I’d say that Nevada entities are under a microscope (some might argue, a proctoscope), and their use will be automatically suspect where debtors are challenged. That’s the simple fact, right or wrong. The USA Today article is only the tip of the iceberg in this regard.”


“For most entities, the choice of jurisdiction is not as crucial as the bylaws (for a corporation) or the operating agreement (for a LLC). And while some simple governance matters for these defining documents may be spit out from a basic template, it really takes an expert to fashion the nuances and details to optimize both tax and asset protections for any particular business entity. This should usually be done by an experienced lawyer, accountant or financial planner (or, better yet, a combination of these advisers) — not a promoter whose “asset protection packet” or “corporate packet” or whatever it is they are hawking looks the same regardless of who the client is or what their particular needs are.”


“[Y]ou might want to check out the State Liability Systems Ranking Report for 2006. . . . After considering not only the statutes, but also a state’s case law and the general ‘liability friendliness’ tenor of the legislature’s approach to corporate and personal liability issues, the Ranking analyzes all 50 states. It finds the best as Delaware. Interestingly, Nevada, which ranks 37th, is in the “worst” category. Yeah, that’s right, there are 36 states ranked better than Nevada. That, coupled with the increased scrutiny that Nevada entities are undergoing right now, should give one pause about whether Nevada’s really the best way to go, unless you happen to be a Nevada resident, have important Nevada contacts, or have your business either headquartered in or engaging in operations in Nevada.”

Robert Lambert
Robert Lambert’s website says that it is the “Internet’s leading resource for current, up to the minute information on Asset Protection. The purpose of this web site is to provide you with an introduction to Asset Protection and attempt to answer all your questions. We will also debunk many of the myths and provide you with valuable data to protect yourself from scammers.” Here are three articles by Robert that relate to forming entities in Nevada.
Jay Adkinson
Jay Adkinson is a nationally known asset protection attorney and prolific writer and speaker about asset protection law. Mr. Adkinson is the creator of Quatloos.com, one of the first internet websites to educate the public about financial scams and tax frauds. His website at www.assetprotectionbook.com is one of the best asset protection websites on the internet. In addition to general discussions on various asset protection topics, the website contains in depth analysis of asset protection in all fifty states. See more on this topic in an article called False and Misleading Claims Regarding Nevada Corporations.
Jay Adkinson on Forming Entities in Nevada

“I don’t have anything against Nevada, and in fact I like some features of their laws, but it’s reputation is getting REALLY bad. In a given case, the difference between somebody having a Nevada corporation and a (and I pick this state randomly) Kansas corporation might make the difference in a judge deciding that the arrangement was a sham. Because of this, Nevada is now probably the one state that you DON’T want to use for asset protection planning.”


“IMHO, a person is 100x better having a properly organized entity with good operating documents in their home state than they are attempting to “import” an entity and its laws from another state.”


“The “best” state for forming an entity is 99% the state you are resident in, have assets in, or are doing business in. Attempting to “import” law from another state is generally more of a forlorn hope than a strategy.”

Written by Richard Keyt on January 28, 2009.

 Questions   Do I need to know about securities laws to set up an LLC?   How many people do I need to form an LLC?   Who should form an LLC?   How do I form an LLC?   Do I need a lawyer to form an LLC?   Does my LLC need an operating agreement?   How are LLCs taxed?   What are the differences between a limited liability company and a partnership?   Can I convert my existing business to an LLC?   What is an LLC?     Do I need to know about securities laws to set up an LLC?  If you'll be the sole owner of your LLC and you don't plan to take investments from outsiders, your ownership interest in the LLC will not be considered a "security," and you don't have to concern yourself with these laws.For co-owned LLCs, however, the answer to this question is not so clear. A security is an investment in a profit-making enterprise that is not run by the investor. If a person invests in a business with the expectation of making money from the efforts of others, that person's investment is generally considered a "security" under federal and state law. Conversely, when a person will rely on his or her own efforts to make a profit (that is, he or she will be an active owner of an LLC), that person's ownership interest in the company will not usually be treated as a security.How does this apply to you? Generally, if all of the owners will actively manage the LLC -- which is typical in most small start-up LLCs -- the LLC ownership interests will not be considered securities. But if one or more of your co-owners will not work for the company or play an active role in managing the company -- as may be true for LLCs that accept investments from friends and family or that are run by a special management group -- your LLC's ownership interests may be treated as securities by your state and by the federal Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).If your ownership interests are considered securities, you must qualify for an exemption from the state and federal securities laws before the initial owners of your LLC invest their money. If you don't fall within an exemption to the securities laws, you must register the sale of your LLC's ownership interests with the SEC and your state.Fortunately, smaller LLCs, even those that plan to sell memberships to passive investors, usually qualify for securities law exemptions. For example, SEC rules exempt the private sale of securities if all owners reside in one state and all sales are made within the state; this is called the "intrastate offering" exemption. Another federal exemption covers "private offerings." A private offering is an unadvertised sale that is limited to a small number of people (35 or fewer) or to those who, because of their net worth or income earning capacity, can reasonably be expected to be able to take care of themselves in the investment process. Most states have enacted their own versions of these popular federal exemptions.For more information about SEC exemptions, visit the SEC website at www.sec.gov. A quick way to research your state's exemption rules is to go to the home page of your state's securities agency, which typically posts the state's exemptions rules and procedures. To find your state securities agency, go to your secretary of state's website.If your business doesn't qualify for an exemption, you may want to explore other ways of raising money. See Nolo's Business Financing FAQ for more information.    How many people do I need to form an LLC?  You can form an LLC in any state with just one owner. For more information on forming an LLC, see Nolo's article How to Form an LLC.      Who should form an LLC?  You should consider forming an LLC if you are concerned about personal exposure to lawsuits or debts arising from your business. For example, if you decide to open a store-front business that deals directly with the public, you may worry that your commercial liability insurance won't fully protect your personal assets from potential slip-and-fall lawsuits or claims by your suppliers for unpaid bills. Running your business as an LLC may help you sleep better, because it gives you personal protection against these and other potential claims against your business.Not all businesses can operate as LLCs, however. Businesses in the banking, trust, and insurance industry, for example, are typically prohibited from forming LLCs. In addition, some states, including California, prohibit professionals such as architects, accountants, doctors, and licensed healthcare workers from forming LLCs.You can also get limited liability for your business by forming a corporation. For information on the differences between these two business structures, see Nolo's article Corporations vs. LLCs. For more information on forming an LLC, read Nolo's article How to Form an LLC.    How do I form an LLC?  In most states, you create an LLC simply by filing "articles of organization" with your state's LLC filing office (which is usually part of the secretary of state's office) and paying a filing fee. A few states refer to this organizational document as a "certificate of organization" or a "certificate of formation." Most states provide a fill-in-the-blank form that takes just a few minutes to prepare. You can obtain the form by mail or download it from your state's website (check your state's secretary of state or corporations division home page). A few states impose an additional requirement: Prior to filing your articles of organization, you must publish your intention to form an LLC in a local newspaper. You'll also want to prepare an LLC operating agreement, though it isn't legally required in most states. Your operating agreement explicitly states the rights and responsibilities of the LLC owners. The main reasons to do this are to clarify your business arrangements and to decide how your LLC will be run. If you don't create a written operating agreement, the LLC laws of your state will govern the inner workings of your LLC. More Information You can use a self-help book or software program to guide you through the process of creating personalized articles of organization and writing an LLC operating agreement. For more information, see Nolo's articles How to Form an LLC or 50-State Guide to Forming an LLC. To form your LLC right now, use Nolo's online formation service, which will collect the required information and file your articles of organization with your state.    Do I need a lawyer to form an LLC?  No. All states allow business owners to form their own LLC by filing articles of organization. In most states, the information you must provide for the articles of organization is very basic -- typically, you have to supply the name of the LLC, the location of its principal office, the names and addresses of the LLC's owners, and the name and address of the LLC's registered agent (a person or company that agrees to accept legal papers on behalf of the LLC).Now that most states provide downloadable fill-in-the-blank forms and instructions, the process is even easier. And LLC filing offices are becoming more accustomed to dealing directly with business owners; they often allow business owners to email questions to them directly.Of course, if you're trying to decide whether the LLC is the right structure for your business, you may want to consult an expert. You may also want an expert to review your operating agreement or set up your bookkeeping and accounting systems. Our website features an online lawyer directory as a free resource to our customers. Comprehensive profiles of attorneys in your state can be found at  www.nolo.com.    Does my LLC need an operating agreement?  Although most states' LLC laws don't require a written operating agreement, you shouldn't consider starting business without one. Here's why an operating agreement is necessary:It helps to ensure that courts will respect your personal liability protection by showing that you have been conscientious about organizing your LLC as a legitimate business.It sets out rules that govern how profits will be split up, how major business decisions will be made, and the procedures for handling the departure and addition of members.It helps to avert misunderstandings among the owners over finances and management.It allows you to create your own operating rules rather than being governed by the default rules in your state's LLC laws, which might not be to your benefit.For more information, see Nolo's article The LLC Operating Agreement.    How are LLCs taxed?  Like sole proprietorships (one-owner businesses) and partnerships, an LLC is not considered a separate entity from its owners for tax purposes. This means that the LLC does not generally pay any income taxes itself; instead, the LLC owners pay taxes on their allocated share of profits (or deduct their share of business losses) on their personal tax returns.LLC owners can elect to have their LLC taxed like a corporation. This may reduce taxes for LLC owners who need to retain a significant amount of profits in the company. For more on reporting and paying taxes as an LLC owner, see How LLCs Are Taxed.     What are the differences between a limited liability company and a partnership?  The main difference between an LLC and a partnership is that LLC owners are not personally liable for the company's debts and liabilities. This means that creditors of the LLC usually cannot go after the owners' personal assets to pay off LLC debts. Partners, on the other hand, do not receive this limited liability protection unless they are designated "limited" partners in their partnership agreement.Also, owners of limited liability companies must file formal articles of organization with their state's LLC filing office, pay a filing fee, and comply with certain other state filing requirements before they open for business. By contrast, people who form a partnership don't need to file any formal paperwork or pay any special fees.LLCs and partnerships are almost identical when it comes to taxation, however. In both types of businesses, the owners report business income or losses on their personal tax returns; the business itself does not pay tax on this money. In fact, LLC and partnerships file the same informational tax return with the IRS (Form 1065) and distribute the same schedules to the business's owners (Schedule K-1, which lists each owner's share of income).For more information on LLCs, see the Limited Liability Companies section of Nolo's website. To learn more about partnerships, see the Partnerships  section. Finally, for guidance on deciding which ownership structure is most suitable for your business, read Nolo's article Choosing the Best Ownership Structure for Your Business.    Can I convert my existing business to an LLC?  Yes. Converting a sole proprietorship or a partnership to an LLC is an easy way for sole proprietors and partners to protect their personal assets without changing the way their business income is taxed.Some states provide a simple form for converting a partnership to an LLC (often called a "certificate of conversion"). Sole proprietors and partners in states that don't provide a conversion form must file regular articles of organization to create an LLC.In some states, before a partnership can officially convert to an LLC, it must publish a notice in a local newspaper that the partnership is being terminated. And in all states, you'll have to transfer all identification numbers, licenses, and permits to the name of your new LLC, including:your federal employer identification numberyour state employer identification numberyour sales tax permityour business license (or tax registration), andany professional licenses or permits.For general information on forming an LLC, read Nolo's article How to Form an LLC.    What is an LLC?  A limited liability company, commonly called an "LLC," is a business structure that combines the pass-through taxation of a partnership or sole proprietorship with the limited liability of a corporation. Like owners of partnerships or sole proprietorships, LLC owners report business profits or losses on their personal income tax returns; the LLC itself is not a separate taxable entity. Like owners of a corporation, however, all LLC owners are protected from personal liability for business debts and claims -- a feature known as "limited liability." This means that if the business owes money or faces a lawsuit, only the assets of the business itself are at risk. Creditors usually can't reach the personal assets of the LLC owners, such as a house or car. (Both LLC owners and corporate shareholders can lose this protection by acting illegally, unethically, or irresponsibly.) For these reasons, many people say the LLC combines the best features of the partnership and corporate business structures. To learn more about limited liability companies and limited liability, see Nolo's LLC Basics.

Jupiterimages/Polka Dot/Getty Images   Related Articles  Is a 1099 Required for an LLC? Do LLCs Have to File a 1099? How to Pay Yourself in an LLC    If you have paid for services by a limited liability company, the IRS may require that you issue a Form 1099 statement to the LLC. The rules for issuing 1099s to LLCs are somewhat complicated, however, and involve determining with exactly what kind of LLC you are dealing. If you are unsure, consult your accountant or tax advisor.   Ready to start your LLC? Start an LLC Online Now   The 1099 Information Return Internal Revenue Service Form 1099 is a statement of money or other benefits paid to an independent contractor, subcontractor, or other business or individual who has performed services for your company, or who is owed money via contract. The IRS classifies the document as an “information return.” The issuer of a 1099 uses it to prove costs and/or expenses to the IRS; the payee uses the 1099 to figure taxable income.   1099 Classifications There are many different types of 1099, including the 1099-MISC, used to report royalties, rental income, and other payments; the 1099-DIV for capital gains and dividend distributions; and the 1099-S for real estate transactions.   Issuing Requirements The IRS requires that you issue 1099s to any independent contractor who provided at least $600 worth of services to your business. Many businesses are unsure of the requirements for issuing 1099s to limited liability companies. The answer depends on how the LLC is treated by the IRS. For federal tax purposes, a limited liability company may elect to be taxed as a sole proprietorship, or Type D or "disregarded entity;" a partnership, or Type P; or a corporation, Type C.   Sole Proprietorships and Partnerships If your payee is an LLC that is taxed as a sole proprietorship, you must issue the 1099 with certain information needed by the IRS. This includes the name of the sole proprietor, the name of the LLC and the Social Security number of the sole proprietor, which serves him as the tax identification number. If the LLC is taxed as a partnership, then the 1099 must carry the name of the business as well as its employer identification number, or EIN.   Corporations You do not need to issue the 1099 to an LLC that is classified as a corporation for federal tax purposes. Corporations have strict IRS guidelines and different forms for reporting income that replace the use of a 1099. You may issue the 1099 to a corporation if you wish, but the purpose would only be to simplify your own recordkeeping. You also do not need to issue a 1099 to any LLC structure when you pay transaction costs for merchandise including the item cost, postage charges, delivery costs and storage.

How Limited is Limited Liability?
One of the key advantages of a limited liability company (LLC) over a sole proprietorship or general partnership is the fact that the owners (members) of the LLC are not personally liable for the debts and claims of the business.  Normally, that means that if the business is unable to pay a supplier, lender, landlord or other creditor, that person cannot go after the personal assets of the members of the LLC.  The members may lose their entire investment in the business, but their other assets - car, home, and personal bank accounts - are safe from the creditors of the business.
Or are they?  In truth, there are many exceptions to the rule of limited liability. Many LLC members will find that, due to the way the business was operated, the promised protection from the liabilities and claims of the business is not meaningful.
How Personal Liability Arises
A member of an LLC can be held personally liable for many different types of claims, but they typically arise under four different scenarios:

Claims arising out of an act or omission by the member, such as the member's own negligence, fraud or illegal act
Claims arising out of a contract, particularly one that was personally guaranteed by the member
Claims based on the concept of "piercing the veil" of the LLC
Liability for consenting to or receiving a distribution in violation of the LLC's operating agreement or the applicable LLC statute

These claims are not a result of choosing an LLC as a form of entity.  All of these exceptions apply equally to shareholders in corporations and, in fact, the exceptions were developed first under corporate law.
Actions of a Member
Every member who actively participates in the business of the LLC runs the risk that his action or inaction will result in personal liability.  This is particularly a risk of a service business in which the members provide the key service.  If you are an electrician and you leave an exposed wire that electrocutes someone, your LLC is not going to protect you.  
Similarly, if you make promises about your product or service that are not true, the first claim may be against the LLC for breach of contract, but if the LLC cannot perform or pay damages, the injured party may come after you for fraud or a similar claim based upon your own action.
Even if you have an employee who committed the action, you may not be out of the woods.  If you personally hired the employee, the injured party may have a claim against you for negligent hiring if a reasonable person would not have hired that employee.
A special category of personal liability that may trip up a member of an LLC is failure to pay payroll taxes to the IRS.  To protect these so-called "trust fund taxes," any person who had the ability to prevent the non-payment can be personally liable for the failure to pay these taxes.  The IRS applies this provision broadly, so if you had power to direct which bills got paid and which didn't, you are probably liable.
Claims Based on Contract
Another, and probably more common, source of personal liability for many small business owners is the voluntary assumption of liability, usually by means of a personal guarantee.  For many small businesses, particularly new businesses with no credit history, obtaining a loan without a personal guarantee is virtually impossible.  Landlords, too, often insist on a personal guarantee, particularly if the lease requires the landlord to incur costs such as build-outs that it expects to recoup over the term of the lease.
Suppliers are sometimes more flexible on extending credit, especially after the business is up and running.  Getting payment terms out of the gate, however, often requires a personal guarantee.
Even when the creditor isn't seeking a personal guarantee, a member of the LLC can inadvertently become a party to the contract by failing to clearly note his role. If she signs her own name and does not indicate that she is executing the contract on behalf of the LLC, it is very likely that a court will hold her responsible for the contract. Every contract should clearly indicate that the party to the contract is the LLC (full name!) and should indicate the role of the person who is signing (member or manager).
Piercing the Veil of the LLC
Even if a member avoids personal guarantees, he may find himself liable to creditors of the business under a theory developed under corporate law and known as "piercing the corporate veil." Although the factors that courts look at vary to some extent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, the courts typically look at whether there is a unity of interest and ownership such that the separate personalities of the entity and the owner no longer exists and whether to respect the distinction between the owner and the entity would be an injustice.
In almost all cases of piercing the veil, there is either commingling or diversion of assets.  Some other facts that courts examine in corporate cases include: 

Inadequate capitalization
Failure to issue stock
Failure to observe corporate formalities
Nonpayment of dividends
Insolvency of the debtor corporation at the time
Non-functioning of other officers or directors
Absence of corporate records
Commingling of funds
Diversion of assets
Failure to maintain arm's length relationships among related entities
Whether the corporation is a mere facade for the operation of the dominant shareholders

A possible benefit of an LLC over a corporation is that several of the commonly listed factors (failure to issue stock, failure to observe corporate formalities, and absence of corporate records) have no real counterparts in an LLC.  However, as case law develops, the absence of those factors may simply shift emphasis on some of the other factors.
Distributions in Violation of Law or Agreement
LLC Acts typically prohibit an LLC from making certain distributions.  For example, the final draft of the Revised Uniform Limited Liability Company Act provides that a limited liability company may not make a distribution if after the distribution: (1) the company would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the ordinary course of the limited liability company�s activities; or (2) the company�s total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed, if the company were to be dissolved, wound up, and terminated at the time of the distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution, winding up, and termination of members whose preferential rights are superior to those of persons receiving the distribution.
A member of a member-managed limited liability company or manager of a manager-managed limited liability company who consents to an improper distribution  is personally liable to the company for the amount of the distribution which is improper distributions. In addition, a person who receives a distribution knowing that it is in violation of the Act is typically personally liable for the portion of the distribution that is improper.
Is Limited Liability an Illusion?
Although it may seem that the exceptions swallow the rule, the LLC offers excellent protection from many types of 
liabilities.  For example if you properly hire and train an employee who then commits an act of negligence or fraud, the LLC should shield you from personal liability.  If you sell a product that, without your knowledge or fault, is defective, you should not have personal liability.  Trade creditors who deal with the LLC without a personal guarantee should have no right to look to you for payment.
Shoring up Limited Liability
There are several things that you can do to strengthen the protection of limited liability within the LLC:
Business insurance.  Carrying adequate business insurance won't change the fact that you are personally liable for your own negligence, but it can help by providing a source for payment.  You might also consider a personal umbrella policy.
Avoid personal guarantees.  Not all personal guarantees can be avoided but do not automatically consent to every guarantee.  In many cases, landlords or vendors routinely request personal guarantees even where the facts do not dictate that one be provided.  Learn to question the request.
Capitalize the business adequately.  Provide adequate capital for the entity's intended purposes and document the capital infusion.
Keep the LLC separate from your personal business.  No matter how small the business is, it should have its own bank account.  Don't pay personal expenses from the business account.  Instead, write yourself a check (called a draw) on the LLC account and deposit it in your account from which you pay expenses.  Likewise, don't use personal checks to pay LLC bills.  If the LLC needs funds, make a capital contribution or loan.  And account for everything.
Act ethically.  Don't attempt to mislead the LLC's creditors about the financial condition of the business.
Do not divert assets.  If the business looks like it is going down, don't attempt to lessen your own loss by taking big draws or moving assets out of the LLC.  That will only help open the floodgates to your personal assets.
If you act responsibly and take a few precautions, the limited liability of the LLC is still a major benefit over a sole proprietorship or general partnership.

LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order.

The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Corporations Compared to LLCs









Knowledge Center&rtrif;Corporation&rtrif;Corporations Compared to LLCs 













        Corporations Compared to LLCs      
Limited liability companies (LLCs) are one of the newest types of business entities. Like corporations, they offer many benefits over partnerships and sole proprietorships. Whether an LLC or a corporation is better for a small business depends on the type of business. The best comparison here is between an LLC and an S corporation, because an LLC can choose to be taxed as an S corporation.
Social Security Taxes
The owners of the S corporation can take out some profits without Social Security taxes. For a large business in which the owners take out salaries of $118,500 or more plus profits, there would not be much difference, since the Social Security tax cuts out at that level as of 2015. However, for a smaller business, in which an owner could take out a $30,000 salary and $20,000 profit, the extra taxes on the $20,000 would be over $3,000.
Raising Money
If a corporation plans to go public or sell stock to a large group of people, the corporate stock might be easier to sell than membership interests in the LLC.
Liability Protection
An important advantage of an LLC is that in some states, a creditor cannot collect the members’ LLC distributions. With a corporation, creditors cannot collect a shareholder’s personal assets, but can collect the shareholder’s dividends.
Profits, Losses, and Taxes
The other advantages of LLCs are found in certain tax situations. For example, an LLC can make special allocations of profits and losses among members, whereas S corporations cannot. S corporations must have one class of ownership in which profits and losses are allocated according to the percentage ownership. In an LLC, money borrowed by the company can increase the tax basis (and lower the taxes) of the owners, whereas in an S corporation, it does not. Contributing property to set up an LLC is not taxable, even for minority interest owners, whereas for a corporation, regulations only allow it to be tax­ free for the contributors who have control of the business.
Foreign Ownership
The owners of an LLC can be foreign persons, other corporations, or any kind of trust, whereas the owners of S corporations cannot. An LLC may have an unlimited number of members, while an S corporation is limited to one hundred.
Management Options
LLCs are also popular because of their flexible management options, allowing owners to directly managed the business or have others handle the day to day operations. LLCs have fewer formalities than corporations, another advantage for some business owners.
Fringe Benefits
Corporations offer a greater variety of fringe benefit plans than any other business entity. Various retirement, stock option and employee stock purchase plans are available only for corporations. Plus, sole proprietors, partners and employees owning more than 2% of an S corporation must pay taxes on fringe benefits (such as group-term life insurance, medical reimbursement plans, medical insurance premiums and parking). Shareholder-employees of a C corporation do not have to pay taxes on these benefits.

Knowledge Center&rtrif;Limited Liability Company&rtrif;FAQ 









Limited Liability Company FAQ
Find FAQs related to starting an LLC.
















What is a limited liability company (LLC)?


    
A limited liability company, or LLC, is a business entity created under state laws which has the characteristics of both a corporation and a partnership. Like a corporation, the owners of an LLC are not personally liable for business debts. Like a sole proprietorship or partnership, an LLC has operating flexibility and is a pass-through entity for tax purposes. This means the LLC's profits are passed through and taxable to the owners of the LLC. 




 





What legal documents do I need to form an LLC?


    
To create an LLC, Articles of Organization must be filed with the Secretary of State or appropriate state agency. Next, the LLC members should enter into an operating agreement, which sets forth the rights of the members and the rules for running the company. An LLC may also need to apply for a tax identification number with the IRS. LegalZoom can prepare all of the required documents for you. 

  


 





Can my LLC have an unlimited lifespan?

Yes. Recent changes to the IRS code have promoted changes in state laws permitting LLCs to be created with an unlimited life.


 





What is the difference between a "member" and a "manager" of an LLC?


    
A member is an owner of the LLC and is similar to a stockholder of a corporation. A manager is a person chosen by the members to manage the LLC and is similar to a director of a corporation. A manager can also be a member. 
  


 





Does an LLC have to hold meetings?


    
The answer is usually no, unless the LLC's operating agreement requires meetings. LegalZoom's operating agreements make meetings optional. This is one of the key advantages of an LLC - fewer formalities. This means less paperwork and less chance that the members will accidentally violate the law and thereby lose their liability protection. 


  


 





How much will it cost to form and operate an LLC?

Each state charges an annual fee to maintain an LLC. In many states, you must also submit an annual report or statement of information, which is a one-page form sent by the state. Some states also have state taxes. The annual fees for three popular states—California, Nevada and Delaware—are as follows (prices shown are as of 2015):

California: A $20 reporting fee and a statement of information are required 90 days after formation and then every two years. An annual $800 LLC tax is due by the 15th day of the fourth month after LLC formation and every year thereafter. If the LLC's income exceeds $250,000, it will owe an additional LLC tax based on the income amount.


Nevada: A $150 fee and the Initial List of Managers or Managing Members, as well as a $200 fee and a Business Licence Application, are due within 30 days of formation. There is no state income tax.


Delaware: There is an annual LLC tax of $300 due each June 1st, beginning the year following formation. There is no state income tax.


New York: Every LLC must publish notice of its formation in two newspapers in the county in which it was created. In some areas, the fees for this publication can run up to $2,000. The company must then submit a certificate of this publication to the state, together with a $50 filing fee. For LLCs that choose to be treated as a partnership, there are annual taxes that are based on total income (from a minimum of $25 to a maximum of $4,500).


Every other state: Contact a local accountant.

 
LegalZoom can help you save time when you form an LLC. Answer a few questions in our online questionnaire, we’ll check your answers for consistency and completeness, and file the required documentation with your state. Once your LLC is formed, we send you a final package with all of your documents. We also can help you get in touch with independent attorneys to answer questions about your business.


 





What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?


Although an S corporation shares many of the same tax characteristics as an LLC, an LLC has more flexibility and fewer restrictions than an S corporation. An S corporation cannot have more than 100 stockholders, cannot issue more than one class of shares, and is subject to more formalities than an LLC. However, owners of an LLC are required to pay Social Security and Medicare taxes on profits. Corporate stockholders are not required to pay these taxes on profits over and above the stockholders' salaries.



 





Do I need an attorney to form an LLC?


    
No, you do not need an attorney to form an LLC. You can prepare the legal paperwork and file it yourself, or use a professional business formation service, such as LegalZoom. If you choose to form your LLC through LegalZoom, you will only need to answer a few simple questions online.  We will take care of all of your paperwork, file the necessary documents with the state and even send you an LLC kit with seals and certificates. 



 





How many people are needed to form an LLC?


    
In all states, only one person is needed to form an LLC. Recent changes to the IRS code have promoted reforms in state laws, permitting one-member LLCs.

We love to help!Should I form my business as an LLC?Despite being a relatively new option, the limited liability company (LLC) is now one of the most popular business structures among smaller organizations. While allowing business owners to remain free from a great deal of the regulations imposed on other types of companies, it still provides limited liability protection for its owners (members). This means that the personal assets of an LLC's ownership cannot be collected to fulfill the debts of the business. What is involved in forming an LLC?All states require potential LLC owners to file a substantial set of documents, typically called the Articles of Organization, in order to establish their business. We can take care of this process for you, saving you time, effort, and allowing you to focus on developing your business – not filing paperwork. How should I name my LLC?The name you choose for your LLC is an important decision, as it will be how you represent yourself to potential associates and clients. With that in mind, it is advisable that you take some time to craft a name that you will be proud to have representing you and your business.Your name must be unique, and not deceptively similar, to any other trademarked name or business. It is also required that your name not be used to intentionally misrepresent the products or services you offer. For LLCs, nearly all states will also require you to add a signifier of your limited liability status, such as "LLC" or "L.L.C." to the end of your company's name. You may be able to operate under a name other than your formal LLC name by applying for and using a dba. Are there a required number of individuals needed to form an LLC?There is no minimum requirement as to the number of owners (also referred to as members) that an LLC must have.
