NEWPORT BEACH, Calif., Sept. 23, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Accelerize New Media, Inc. (OTCQB: ACLZ) (OTCBB: ACLZ), a leader in marketing technology solutions, today announced the appointment of Santi Pierini as Chief Operating Officer of Accelerize. As part of this role, Mr. Pierini has also been named President of CAKE, the digital marketing software division of Accelerize, where he has served as an Executive Vice President. Mr. Pierini will be responsible for the global expansion of Accelerize into new and existing markets. 
"Over the past several years we have established our company as a leading provider of digital marketing software in the affiliate marketing space. While we take great pride in this accomplishment, we believe it only scratches the surface of the global opportunities for our CAKE software platform," said Brian Ross, CEO of Accelerize. "Santi brings a wealth of leadership experience in the vertical and horizontal market expansion of emerging software technology companies which makes him a perfect fit for his new roles at Accelerize and CAKE. As we continue to innovate our product line and expand our reach into new market opportunities both at home and abroad, Santi's vision and experience will prove invaluable. We look forward to working with him to build on the promising future of Accelerize in the years to come." 
Prior to joining the Accelerize team Mr. Pierini has established a long history of providing leadership in executing the strategic expansion of high-growth companies in the enterprise software industry. He served as Chief Marketing Officer of InQuira, a knowledge based management software provider, where he was instrumental in developing the SaaS-based software go-to-market with Oracle, which ultimately led to Oracle's acquisition of InQuira in 2011. He also served in executive marketing positions at Day Software as it transitioned from a Swiss services-oriented business to a global enterprise content management software company.  During his tenure at Day the company's stock, which traded on the Swiss Stock Exchange, increased in value by thirty fold. Day was acquired by Adobe Systems for $270 million in 2010. He also was an executive officer at OnDisplay, a business-to-business data exchange and e-commerce provider, where during his tenure sales went from pre-revenue to an annual run rate of over $50 million when it was acquired by Vignette for $1.7 billion in 2000. Earlier in his career, he was Director of Field Marketing at industry-leading enterprise software company Dun & Bradstreet, Systems Architect at Jet Propulsion Laboratory and a Senior Management Consultant for Andersen Consulting (now Accenture). 
"I'm thrilled to take on this new role to help capitalize on the remarkable opportunities that lay ahead as we continue to push the boundaries of marketing technologies," said Mr. Pierini. "As the ad tech industry continues to become more accountable, performance-based marketing is rising to the top of the CMO's agenda. Our CAKE software platform is uniquely positioned to revolutionize the way marketers leverage their advertising data and optimize spend. I intend to work diligently with our exceptional team to open vast market opportunities in new business verticals while continuing to build on our growth in the affiliate space."
