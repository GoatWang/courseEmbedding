Background[edit]
FMC provides professional investment management services to high-net-worth individuals, as well as to partnerships, trusts, retirement accounts, mutual funds and institutional clients. The firm manages investments on a fully discretionary basis for accounts ranging from under $1 million to over $100 million. The firm currently manages in excess of $14 billion, utilizing a long-term, value-oriented investment approach.[2]
The firm’s clients are significant owners of Berkshire Hathaway stock,[3] and the firm has established a reputation for utilizing investing strategies similar to that espoused by Warren Buffett.[4] The firm’s founder, David Gottesman, was an early investor in Berkshire Hathaway and he has maintained a long-standing friendship with Mr. Buffett.[5] The firm’s investment approach is to establish long term positions in portfolio companies, most often relying on fundamental analysis and targeting value in the public equity and fixed income markets of the United States.
Leadership[edit]
David Gottesman founded the firm in 1964.[5] Mr. Gottesman is a member of the Board of Directors of Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. He was a director of the Securities Industry Association.
Robert Gottesman joined First Manhattan Co. in 1987 and is currently the firm’s Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Management Committee.[6]
The firm’s Management Committee is responsible for the management and day-to-day operations of the firm. It is currently composed of: Robert Gottesman (CEO), Cheryl Kallem (CFO), Timothy Muccia, Neal Stearns, Jack Varon and Jay Vodofsky.[citation needed]
Recent Developments[edit]
In an unusual step for FMC, the firm took an active role in a proxy contest involving the management of a biotech company, VIVUS, Inc., a company in which the firm and its clients hold a significant position. FMC led the initiative to replace the board and its CEO. The contest was settled in July 2013 with the company appointing a new CEO and replacing a majority of the board in an effort to maximize shareholder value.[7]
Other[edit]
The firm currently advises two mutual funds, the FMC Select Fund and the FMC Strategic Value Fund.

First Manhattan Co Company Profile

   The first Manhattan was made in the 1870s using whiskey, vermouth, and a dash of bitters. However, this First Manhattan was made in 1964 of CFAs, MBAs, CPAs, and a dash of JDs. The company specializes in investment management services primarily for individuals, but also for institutional clients such as partnerships, pension plans, and trusts. Its customers typically have  between $1 million and $100 million to invest. First Manhattan focuses on value-oriented equity investments with an eye toward long-term growth; its analysts follow a broad range of companies in industries such as banking, consumer products, health care, and oil. The company also manages investments in taxable and municipal bonds.

Our Investment Approach |  First Manhattan Co.




























Menu














“We buy businesses for our clients, rather than stocks which represent pieces of paper. We do extensive research on every investment before we decide to make a commitment. The reason for this is because our intended holding period is a very long time; we want to be convinced that these are understandable businesses with strong management, a good long-term record of profitability and a favorable industry environment that will allow for continued growth.”





Our Investment Approach

Portfolio management is both art and science. As value-oriented, long-term investors, we believe the discipline calls for fundamental research, thorough accounting-oriented financial analysis, and the exercise of sound judgment. To that end, we feel it is important that our Portfolio Managers have research backgrounds and devote substantial amounts of time to personally generating and examining investment ideas.

While each First Manhattan Portfolio Manager is empowered to make his or her own decisions about how to invest clients’ capital, there are certain investing principles we share. We seek to:

Practice transparency and accountability. We believe that it’s important to know exactly what’s in your portfolio and why it’s there. We primarily invest in publicly traded companies that we can analyze thoroughly. We can explain to any client why we have bought a particular stock and why we continue to hold it.
Look for unrealized value. As Portfolio Managers, we seek to find and invest in undervalued businesses at attractive prices. These companies are often trading at a “discount” to their intrinsic value due to temporary issues that lead to a market overreaction.
Align with the exceptional. We do not aim to replicate the broader market. Instead, we seek to own a select group of companies with proven track records of shareholder value creation.
Ensure that intensive and thorough research drives our decision-making. Above all, preserving client capital is our number-one priority. That is why we take a decidedly in-depth approach when considering any new investment, emphasizing a detailed understanding of the company’s fundamental business, financial prospects, and management quality. To gather information, we often spend weeks visiting a company’s facilities, meeting with senior management, and speaking to their customers. We seek companies that generate strong cash flow, have a responsible level of debt (relative to their industry), and have managements that deploy capital in a shareholder-friendly way.
Strongly believe in the power of tax-efficient, lower friction compounding. We strive to minimize changes in a portfolio in order to limit capital gains taxes for our taxable clients. To that end, we look to invest in companies with strong and understandable underlying businesses, leading competitive positioning, and long runways for future growth. We tend to own these companies for an extended period of time, enabling our clients to reap the benefits of compounding value of their accounts over a long period.

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry
                        
3. honor any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process

                            4. complete the required application and pay all monetary obligations to BBB in a timely manner
                        









Advertise Honestly









            Adhere to established standards of advertising and selling.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.
                
3. Adhere to applicable BBB industry codes of advertising.
4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth









            Honestly represent products and services, including clear and adequate disclosures of all material terms.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Make known all material facts in both written and verbal representations, remembering that misrepresentation may result not only from direct statements but by omitting or obscuring relevant facts.
                

                    2. Ensure that any written materials are readily available, clear, accurate and complete.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

                                            Overall very positive culture and relatively flat organization.  Leadership is willing and often solicites feedback on a wide range of subjects. Discussions with HR are currently taking place on increasing primary and non-primary caregiver leave - fingers crossed this is approved and launched soon, as currently policies are a bit behind.  There are also several wellness initiatives and plenty of awesome benefits that balance this out however (ex: new mothers rooms, meditation / prayer rooms, wellness rooms, yoga and pilates classes at the office, meditation sessions, several discount partnerships with surrounding retailers, college coach and women's leadership seminars etc....)

Flexibility depends on your department and your manager.  Most managers are flexible and accomodating, but the stigma that comes with it within the culture is bad.  A big part of that problem is the constant abuse of the flexibility and lack of accountability.  It penalizes the conscious, hardworking employees and encourages the ones with a lack in work ethic.  This is a major issue within the organization as a whole.  The company needs more accountability.

                                                                                                    Maybe. I think its a great place to start and depending on the woman and manager can be a great place to florish.  However there are major challenges as a woman in this organization including equal pay, equal treatement, and a double-standard culture.

			First Manhattan: 50th Anniversary Video
		



About Us

First Manhattan was founded in 1964 by a group of individuals led by David Gottesman, who was the managing partner for more than 40 years and remains actively involved in the firm. The firm provides professional investment management services to individuals, partnerships, trusts, retirement accounts, and institutional clients. Our clients work directly with a Portfolio Manager who has the expertise and experience needed to make unbiased investment decisions on their behalf. Our client relationships are typically long-term. For many clients, we are managing accounts that have been at First Manhattan for many decades and generations.
Today, First Manhattan manages $16+ billion* on behalf of our clients.
The firm’s primary focus is on building individual stock portfolios with the goal of capital appreciation over time. We also manage municipal and corporate bond portfolios for clients who seek income or a balanced allocation. Partners at the firm have a significant amount of their own capital invested alongside clients. We believe strongly in our approach and alignment with our clients.

Our Philosophy
For more than 50 years, First Manhattan has been managing clients’ money using a risk-averse, long-term, value-oriented investment approach. Since our founding, we have honed our research and analysis methodologies, developed talent, explored new opportunities for investment, and helped our clients thrive through many market cycles and all market conditions. Throughout it all, however, our core philosophy has remained the same. We believe in:

Hiring the best people and challenging them to deliver.
Performing in-house, proprietary research to identify attractive opportunities.
Avoiding undue risks, and being rigorous in portfolio construction.
Delivering outstanding client service.
Building a strong organization operationally and a culture of excellence and respect.
Remaining focused on our core competencies.

Our narrow focus, adherence to our founders’ ideals, and enduring investment discipline have helped our firm and clients thrive for over five decades—and we believe that these attributes will help us continue to succeed in the future. 
A Personal Commitment
Many of our client relationships have continued over multiple generations and countless market cycles. Long-term performance is only one reason that these relationships have endured. We are committed to building meaningful relationships with clients as we believe that a deep understanding of their needs enables us to be best positioned to protect and grow their assets.
As a trusted advisor to many clients, we often act as sounding boards and confidants on a wide variety of financial and other matters. We pledge that our advice will be straightforward, unbiased, and unquestionably in the best interest of the client.   
We are proud of our personal commitment to helping clients find broad financial health and security and will remain unwavering in our efforts to meet their needs.
