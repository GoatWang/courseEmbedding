	Corvus Gold Continues to Expand Open-ended Western


	Zone, North Bullfrog Project









	Highlights:




	NB-17-332:  42.7m @ 0.78 g/t Gold & 15.2m @ 0.82 g/t Gold





	 



	NB-17-333:  19.8m @ 1.05 g/t Gold





	 



	NB-17-338:  15.2m @ 0.98 g/t Gold





	 



	NB-17-340:  12.2m @ 0.88 g/t Gold & 11.2 g/t Silver









	Vancouver, B.C… Corvus Gold Inc. ("Corvus" or the "Company") - (TSX: KOR, OTCQX: CORVF) announces results from an additional nine holes in the Western Zone (Table 1). These latest results continue to outline a broad zone of near surface, shallow mineralization over a strike length of at least 700 metres and over a width of at least 200 metres, which lies immediately west of the current designed pit perimeter (Figure 1).  The Western Zone has two, broad, higher grade, and structurally controlled, stockwork quartz zones internally, with grades above the 0.52 g /t mill cutoff grade and is believed to have higher grade potential at depth.  It appears the Western Zone remains open to the south, west and at depth and is an immediate follow-up drill target for further potential resource expansion.

	Jeff Pontius, President and CEO of Corvus said, "The follow-up results from our drilling on the Western Zone have been encouraging and are outlining what appears to be a potential expansion of the main deposit to the west under shallow gravel cover.  As this zone is still open in many directions, its impact on any potential resource expansion is unconstrained at this point.  For the past 4 weeks Corvus has been testing our first group of "New Discovery" targets away from the main deposit area and we are encouraged by the strength and size of the alteration systems we have been intersecting, with initial results expected in the next few weeks.  We are of the view that the more we work and drill on the North Bullfrog project, the more potential emerges for a major discovery."

	(Reported drill intercepts are not true widths.  At this time, there is insufficient data with respect to the shape of the mineralization to calculate its true orientation in space.)

	* Mineralized thickness calculated @ 0.10 g/t Au cutoff with internal intervals calculated @ 1.0 g/t Au cutoff








	Western Zone





	The mineralization intersected in the Western Zone is controlled by a large northeast trending structural zone which can be tracked for a strike length of nearly 1.5 kilometres.  Drilling to date has tested about ½ the length of the Western Zone structural extent.  The zone contains two discreet fault zones that host higher grade mineralization and display good continuity along strike.  These zones have been intersected from near surface down to a vertical depth of about 150 metres which is the depth of the currently designed pit to the east.





	Additional potential exists for one or more zones to develop to the west of the current drill area as illustrated in prior hole NB-17-329 (NR17-2, February 23, 2017) with 38.1m @ 0.97 g/t gold from a new zone.  In addition, exploration in 2014 tested a structural target some 300 metres west of the Western Zone and outlined a small higher grade resource whose expansion potential has yet to be followed up.  The Western Zone and the large area of shallow gravel cover which could host a number of new zone of shallow, higher grade mineralization.


	 


	About the North Bullfrog Project, Nevada





	Corvus controls 100% of its North Bullfrog Project, which covers approximately 72 km² in southern Nevada.  The property package is made up of a number of private mineral leases of patented federal mining claims and 865 federal unpatented mining claims.  The project has excellent infrastructure, being adjacent to a major highway and power corridor as well as a large water right.

	optimization using all cost and recovery data and a breakeven cut-off grade of 0.52 g/t gold. In addition, the project contains a measured mineral resource of  0.3 Mt at an average grade of 0.25 g/t gold and 2.76 g/t silver, containing 2.4k ounces of gold and 26.6k ounces of silver, an indicated mineral resource of 22.86 Mt at an average grade of 0.30 g/t gold and 0.43 g/t silver, containing 220.5k ounces of gold and 316.1k ounces of silver and an inferred mineral resource of 176.3 Mt at an average grade of 0.19 g/t gold and 0.67 g/t silver, containing 1,077.4k ounces of gold and 3,799.2k ounces of silver for oxide, heap leach processing. The mineral resource for heap leach processing was defined by Whittle

	Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements






	This press release contains forward-looking statements and forward-looking information (collectively, "forward-looking statements") within the meaning of applicable Canadian and US securities legislation.  All statements, other than statements of historical fact, included herein including, without limitation, statements regarding the potential for new deposits and expected increases in a system's potential; anticipated content, commencement and cost of exploration programs, anticipated exploration program results, the discovery and delineation of mineral deposits/resources/reserves, the potential to develop multiple YellowJacket style high-grade zones, the Company's belief that the parameters used in the Whittle


	TM


	pit optimization process are realistic and reasonable, the potential to discover additional high grade veins or additional deposits, the potential to expand the existing estimated resource at the North Bullfrog project, the potential for any mining or production at North Bullfrog, are forward-looking statements.  Information concerning mineral resource estimates may be deemed to be forward-looking statements in that it reflects a prediction of the mineralization that would be encountered if a mineral deposit were developed and mined.  Although the Company believes that such statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct.  Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as: believe, expect, anticipate, intend, estimate, postulate and similar expressions, or are those, which, by their nature, refer to future events.  The Company cautions investors that any forward-looking statements by the Company are not guarantees of future results or performance, and that actual results may differ materially from those in forward looking statements as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, variations in the nature, quality and quantity of any mineral deposits that may be located,


	 


	variations in the market price of any mineral products the Company may produce or plan to produce, the Company's inability to obtain any necessary permits, consents or authorizations required for its activities, the Company's inability to produce minerals from its properties successfully or profitably, to continue its projected growth, to raise the necessary capital or to be fully able to implement its business strategies, and other risks and uncertainties disclosed in the Company's 2014 Annual Information Form and latest interim Management Discussion and Analysis filed with certain securities commissions in Canada and the Company's most recent filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC").  All of the Company's Canadian public disclosure filings in Canada may be accessed via


	www.sedar.com


	 


	and filings with the SEC may be accessed via


	www.sec.gov


	and readers are urged to review these materials, including the technical reports filed with respect to the Company's mineral properties.






	Cautionary Note Regarding References to Resources and Reserves





	NI 43-101 is a rule developed by the Canadian Securities Administrators which establishes standards for all public disclosure an issuer makes of scientific and technical information concerning mineral projects.  Unless otherwise indicated, all resource estimates contained in or incorporated by reference in this press release have been prepared in accordance with NI 43-101 and the guidelines set out in the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (the "CIM") Standards on Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserves, adopted by the CIM Council on May 10, 2014 (the "CIM Standards") as they may be amended from time to time by the CIM.

	United States investors are cautioned that the requirements and terminology of NI 43-101 and the CIM Standards differ significantly from the requirements and terminology of the SEC set forth in the SEC's Industry Guide 7 ("SEC Industry Guide 7").  Accordingly, the Company's disclosures regarding mineralization may not be comparable to similar information disclosed by companies subject to SEC Industry Guide 7.  Without limiting the foregoing, while the terms "mineral resources", "inferred mineral resources", "indicated mineral resources" and "measured mineral resources" are recognized and required by NI 43-101 and the CIM Standards, they are not recognized by the SEC and are not permitted to be used in documents filed with the SEC by companies subject to SEC Industry Guide 7.  Mineral resources which are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability, and US investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of a mineral resource will ever be converted into reserves.  Further, inferred resources have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and as to whether they can be mined legally or economically.  It cannot be assumed that all or any part of the inferred resources will ever be upgraded to a higher resource category.  Under Canadian rules, estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of a feasibility study or prefeasibility study, except in rare cases.  The SEC normally only permits issuers to report mineralization that does not constitute SEC Industry Guide 7 compliant "reserves" as in-place tonnage and grade without reference to unit amounts.  The term "contained ounces" is not permitted under the rules of SEC Industry Guide 7.  In addition, the NI 43-101 and CIM Standards definition of a "reserve" differs from the definition in SEC Industry Guide 7.  In SEC Industry Guide 7, a mineral reserve is defined as a part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time the mineral reserve determination is made, and a "final" or "bankable" feasibility study is required to report reserves, the three-year historical price is used in any reserve or cash flow analysis of designated reserves and the primary environmental analysis or report must be filed with the appropriate governmental authority. U.S. investors are urged to consider closely the disclosure in our latest reports and registration statements filed with the SEC. You can review and obtain copies of these filings at http://www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml. U.S. Investors are cautioned not to assume that any defined resource will ever be converted into SEC Industry Guide 7 compliant reserves.





	This press release is not, and is not to be construed in any way as, an offer to buy or sell securities in the United States.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
