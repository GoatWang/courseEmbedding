In mathematical group theory, given a prime number p, a p-group is a group in which each element has a power of p as its order. That is, for each element g of a p-group, there exists a nonnegative integer n such that the product of pn copies of g, and not less, is equal to the identity element. The orders of different elements may be different powers of p. Such groups are also called p-primary or simply primary.
A finite group is a p-group if and only if its order (the number of its elements) is a power of p. Given a finite group G, the Sylow theorems guarantee for every prime power pn that divides the order of G the existence of a subgroup of G of order pn.
The remainder of this article deals with finite p-groups. For an example of an infinite abelian p-group, see Prüfer group, and for an example of an infinite simple p-group, see Tarski monster group.

Properties[edit]
Every p-group is periodic since by definition every element has finite order.
Non-trivial center[edit]
One of the first standard results using the class equation is that the center of a non-trivial finite p-group cannot be the trivial subgroup.[1]
This forms the basis for many inductive methods in p-groups.
For instance, the normalizer N of a proper subgroup H of a finite p-group G properly contains H, because for any counterexample with H=N, the center Z is contained in N, and so also in H, but then there is a smaller example H/Z whose normalizer in G/Z is N/Z=H/Z, creating an infinite descent. As a corollary, every finite p-group is nilpotent.
In another direction, every normal subgroup of a finite p-group intersects the center nontrivially as may be proved by considering the elements of N which are fixed when G acts on N by conjugation. Since every central subgroup is normal, it follows that every minimal normal subgroup of a finite p-group is central and has order p. Indeed, the socle of a finite p-group is the subgroup of the center consisting of the central elements of order p.
If G is a p-group, then so is G/Z, and so it too has a nontrivial center. The preimage in G of the center of G/Z is called the second center and these groups begin the upper central series. Generalizing the earlier comments about the socle, a finite p-group with order pn contains normal subgroups of order pi with 0 ≤ i ≤ n, and any normal subgroup of order pi is contained in the ith center Zi. If a normal subgroup is not contained in Zi, then its intersection with Zi+1 has size at least pi+1.
Automorphisms[edit]
The automorphism groups of p-groups are well studied. Just as every finite p-group has a nontrivial center so that the inner automorphism group is a proper quotient of the group, every finite p-group has a nontrivial outer automorphism group. Every automorphism of G induces an automorphism on G/Φ(G), where Φ(G) is the Frattini subgroup of G. The quotient G/Φ(G) is an elementary abelian group and its automorphism group is a general linear group, so very well understood. The map from the automorphism group of G into this general linear group has been studied by Burnside, who showed that the kernel of this map is a p-group.
Examples[edit]
p-groups of the same order are not necessarily isomorphic; for example, the cyclic group C4 and the Klein four-group V4 are both 2-groups of order 4, but they are not isomorphic.
Nor need a p-group be abelian; the dihedral group Dih4 of order 8 is a non-abelian 2-group. However, every group of order p2 is abelian.[note 1]
The dihedral groups are both very similar to and very dissimilar from the quaternion groups and the semidihedral groups. Together the dihedral, semidihedral, and quaternion groups form the 2-groups of maximal class, that is those groups of order 2n+1 and nilpotency class n.
Iterated wreath products[edit]
The iterated wreath products of cyclic groups of order p are very important examples of p-groups. Denote the cyclic group of order p as W(1), and the wreath product of W(n) with W(1) as W(n + 1). Then W(n) is the Sylow p-subgroup of the symmetric group Sym(pn). Maximal p-subgroups of the general linear group GL(n,Q) are direct products of various W(n). It has order pk where k = (pn − 1)/(p − 1). It has nilpotency class pn−1, and its lower central series, upper central series, lower exponent-p central series, and upper exponent-p central series are equal. It is generated by its elements of order p, but its exponent is pn. The second such group, W(2), is also a p-group of maximal class, since it has order pp+1 and nilpotency class p, but is not a regular p-group. Since groups of order pp are always regular groups, it is also a minimal such example.
Generalized dihedral groups[edit]
When p = 2 and n = 2, W(n) is the dihedral group of order 8, so in some sense W(n) provides an analogue for the dihedral group for all primes p when n = 2. However, for higher n the analogy becomes strained. There is a different family of examples that more closely mimics the dihedral groups of order 2n, but that requires a bit more setup. Let ζ denote a primitive pth root of unity in the complex numbers, let Z[ζ] be the ring of cyclotomic integers generated by it, and let P be the prime ideal generated by 1−ζ. Let G be a cyclic group of order p generated by an element z. Form the semidirect product E(p) of Z[ζ] and G where z acts as multiplication by ζ. The powers Pn are normal subgroups of E(p), and the example groups are E(p,n) = E(p)/Pn. E(p,n) has order pn+1 and nilpotency class n, so is a p-group of maximal class. When p = 2, E(2,n) is the dihedral group of order 2n. When p is odd, both W(2) and E(p,p) are irregular groups of maximal class and order pp+1, but are not isomorphic.
Unitriangular matrix groups[edit]
The Sylow subgroups of general linear groups are another fundamental family of examples. Let V be a vector space of dimension n with basis { e1, e2, …, en } and define Vi to be the vector space generated by { ei, ei+1, …, en } for 1 ≤ i ≤ n, and define Vi = 0 when i > n. For each 1 ≤ m ≤ n, the set of invertible linear transformations of V which take each Vi to Vi+m form a subgroup of Aut(V) denoted Um. If V is a vector space over Z/pZ, then U1 is a Sylow p-subgroup of Aut(V) = GL(n, p), and the terms of its lower central series are just the Um. In terms of matrices, Um are those upper triangular matrices with 1s one the diagonal and 0s on the first m−1 superdiagonals. The group U1 has order pn·(n−1)/2, nilpotency class n, and exponent pk where k is the least integer at least as large as the base p logarithm of n.
Classification[edit]
The groups of order pn for 0 ≤ n ≤ 4 were classified early in the history of group theory,[2] and modern work has extended these classifications to groups whose order divides p7, though the sheer number of families of such groups grows so quickly that further classifications along these lines are judged difficult for the human mind to comprehend.[3] For example, Marshall Hall Jr. and James K. Senior classified groups of order 2n for n ≤ 6 in 1964. [4]
Rather than classify the groups by order, Philip Hall proposed using a notion of isoclinism of groups which gathered finite p-groups into families based on large quotient and subgroups.[5]
An entirely different method classifies finite p-groups by their coclass, that is, the difference between their composition length and their nilpotency class. The so-called coclass conjectures described the set of all finite p-groups of fixed coclass as perturbations of finitely many pro-p groups. The coclass conjectures were proven in the 1980s using techniques related to Lie algebras and powerful p-groups.[6] The final proofs of the coclass theorems are due to A. Shalev and independently to C. R. Leedham-Green, both in 1994. They admit a classification of finite p-groups in directed coclass graphs consisting of only finitely many coclass trees whose (infinitely many) members are characterized by finitely many parametrized presentations.
Every group of order p5 is metabelian.[7]
Up to p3[edit]
The trivial group is the only group of order one, and the cyclic group Cp is the only group of order p. There are exactly two groups of order p2, both abelian, namely Cp2 and Cp × Cp. For example, the cyclic group C4 and the Klein four-group V4 which is C2 × C2 are both 2-groups of order 4.
There are three abelian groups of order p3, namely Cp3, Cp2×Cp, and Cp×Cp×Cp. There are also two non-abelian groups.
For p ≠ 2, one is a semi-direct product of Cp×Cp with Cp, and the other is a semi-direct product of Cp2 with Cp. The first one can be described in other terms as group UT(3,p) of unitriangular matrices over finite field with p elements, also called the Heisenberg group mod p.
For p = 2, both the semi-direct products mentioned above are isomorphic to the dihedral group Dih4 of order 8. The other non-abelian group of order 8 is the quaternion group Q8.
Prevalence[edit]
Among groups[edit]
The number of isomorphism classes of groups of order pn grows as 




p

n

+
O
(

)




{\displaystyle p^{{\frac {2}{27}}n^{3}+O(n^{8/3})}}

, and these are dominated by the classes that are two-step nilpotent.[8] Because of this rapid growth, there is a folklore conjecture asserting that almost all finite groups are 2-groups: the fraction of isomorphism classes of 2-groups among isomorphism classes of groups of order at most n is thought to tend to 1 as n tends to infinity. For instance, of the 49 910 529 484 different groups of order at most 2000, 49 487 365 422, or just over 99%, are 2-groups of order 1024.[9]
Within a group[edit]
Every finite group whose order is divisible by p contains a subgroup which is a non-trivial p-group, namely a cyclic group of order p generated by an element of order p obtained from Cauchy's theorem. In fact, it contains a p-group of maximal possible order: if

 where p does not divide m, then G has a subgroup P of order

{\displaystyle p^{k},}

 called a Sylow p-subgroup. This subgroup need not be unique, but any subgroups of this order are conjugate, and any p-subgroup of G is contained in a Sylow p-subgroup. This and other properties are proved in the Sylow theorems.
Application to structure of a group[edit]
p-groups are fundamental tools in understanding the structure of groups and in the classification of finite simple groups. p-groups arise both as subgroups and as quotient groups. As subgroups, for a given prime p one has the Sylow p-subgroups P (largest p-subgroup not unique but all conjugate) and the p-core 




O

p

{\displaystyle O_{p}(G)}

 (the unique largest normal p-subgroup), and various others. As quotients, the largest p-group quotient is the quotient of G by the p-residual subgroup 




O

p


(
G
)
.


{\displaystyle O^{p}(G).}

 These groups are related (for different primes), possess important properties such as the focal subgroup theorem, and allow one to determine many aspects of the structure of the group.
Local control[edit]
Much of the structure of a finite group is carried in the structure of its so-called local subgroups, the normalizers of non-identity p-subgroups.[10]
The large elementary abelian subgroups of a finite group exert control over the group that was used in the proof of the Feit–Thompson theorem. Certain central extensions of elementary abelian groups called extraspecial groups help describe the structure of groups as acting on symplectic vector spaces.
Brauer classified all groups whose Sylow 2-subgroups are the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 4, and Walter, Gorenstein, Bender, Suzuki, Glauberman, and others classified those simple groups whose Sylow 2-subgroups were abelian, dihedral, semidihedral, or quaternion.

In mathematical group theory, given a prime number p, a p-group is a group in which each element has a power of p as its order. That is, for each element g of a p-group, there exists a nonnegative integer n such that the product of pn copies of g, and not less, is equal to the identity element. The orders of different elements may be different powers of p. Such groups are also called p-primary or simply primary.
A finite group is a p-group if and only if its order (the number of its elements) is a power of p. Given a finite group G, the Sylow theorems guarantee for every prime power pn that divides the order of G the existence of a subgroup of G of order pn.

Properties[edit]
Every p-group is periodic since by definition every element has finite order.
Non-trivial center[edit]
One of the first standard results using the class equation is that the center of a non-trivial finite p-group cannot be the trivial subgroup.[1]
This forms the basis for many inductive methods in p-groups.
For instance, the normalizer N of a proper subgroup H of a finite p-group G properly contains H, because for any counterexample with H=N, the center Z is contained in N, and so also in H, but then there is a smaller example H/Z whose normalizer in G/Z is N/Z=H/Z, creating an infinite descent. As a corollary, every finite p-group is nilpotent.
In another direction, every normal subgroup of a finite p-group intersects the center nontrivially as may be proved by considering the elements of N which are fixed when G acts on N by conjugation. Since every central subgroup is normal, it follows that every minimal normal subgroup of a finite p-group is central and has order p. Indeed, the socle of a finite p-group is the subgroup of the center consisting of the central elements of order p.
If G is a p-group, then so is G/Z, and so it too has a nontrivial center. The preimage in G of the center of G/Z is called the second center and these groups begin the upper central series. Generalizing the earlier comments about the socle, a finite p-group with order pn contains normal subgroups of order pi with 0 ≤ i ≤ n, and any normal subgroup of order pi is contained in the ith center Zi. If a normal subgroup is not contained in Zi, then its intersection with Zi+1 has size at least pi+1.
Automorphisms[edit]
The automorphism groups of p-groups are well studied. Just as every finite p-group has a nontrivial center so that the inner automorphism group is a proper quotient of the group, every finite p-group has a nontrivial outer automorphism group. Every automorphism of G induces an automorphism on G/Φ(G), where Φ(G) is the Frattini subgroup of G. The quotient G/Φ(G) is an elementary abelian group and its automorphism group is a general linear group, so very well understood. The map from the automorphism group of G into this general linear group has been studied by Burnside, who showed that the kernel of this map is a p-group.
Examples[edit]
p-groups of the same order are not necessarily isomorphic; for example, the cyclic group C4 and the Klein four-group V4 are both 2-groups of order 4, but they are not isomorphic.
Nor need a p-group be abelian; the dihedral group Dih4 of order 8 is a non-abelian 2-group. However, every group of order p2 is abelian.[note 1]
The dihedral groups are both very similar to and very dissimilar from the quaternion groups and the semidihedral groups. Together the dihedral, semidihedral, and quaternion groups form the 2-groups of maximal class, that is those groups of order 2n+1 and nilpotency class n.
Iterated wreath products[edit]
The iterated wreath products of cyclic groups of order p are very important examples of p-groups. Denote the cyclic group of order p as W(1), and the wreath product of W(n) with W(1) as W(n + 1). Then W(n) is the Sylow p-subgroup of the symmetric group Sym(pn). Maximal p-subgroups of the general linear group GL(n,Q) are direct products of various W(n). It has order pk where k = (pn − 1)/(p − 1). It has nilpotency class pn−1, and its lower central series, upper central series, lower exponent-p central series, and upper exponent-p central series are equal. It is generated by its elements of order p, but its exponent is pn. The second such group, W(2), is also a p-group of maximal class, since it has order pp+1 and nilpotency class p, but is not a regular p-group. Since groups of order pp are always regular groups, it is also a minimal such example.
Generalized dihedral groups[edit]
When p = 2 and n = 2, W(n) is the dihedral group of order 8, so in some sense W(n) provides an analogue for the dihedral group for all primes p when n = 2. However, for higher n the analogy becomes strained. There is a different family of examples that more closely mimics the dihedral groups of order 2n, but that requires a bit more setup. Let ζ denote a primitive pth root of unity in the complex numbers, let Z[ζ] be the ring of cyclotomic integers generated by it, and let P be the prime ideal generated by 1−ζ. Let G be a cyclic group of order p generated by an element z. Form the semidirect product E(p) of Z[ζ] and G where z acts as multiplication by ζ. The powers Pn are normal subgroups of E(p), and the example groups are E(p,n) = E(p)/Pn. E(p,n) has order pn+1 and nilpotency class n, so is a p-group of maximal class. When p = 2, E(2,n) is the dihedral group of order 2n. When p is odd, both W(2) and E(p,p) are irregular groups of maximal class and order pp+1, but are not isomorphic.
Unitriangular matrix groups[edit]
The Sylow subgroups of general linear groups are another fundamental family of examples. Let V be a vector space of dimension n with basis { e1, e2, …, en } and define Vi to be the vector space generated by { ei, ei+1, …, en } for 1 ≤ i ≤ n, and define Vi = 0 when i > n. For each 1 ≤ m ≤ n, the set of invertible linear transformations of V which take each Vi to Vi+m form a subgroup of Aut(V) denoted Um. If V is a vector space over Z/pZ, then U1 is a Sylow p-subgroup of Aut(V) = GL(n, p), and the terms of its lower central series are just the Um. In terms of matrices, Um are those upper triangular matrices with 1s one the diagonal and 0s on the first m−1 superdiagonals. The group U1 has order pn·(n−1)/2, nilpotency class n, and exponent pk where k is the least integer at least as large as the base p logarithm of n.
Classification[edit]
The groups of order pn for 0 ≤ n ≤ 4 were classified early in the history of group theory,[2] and modern work has extended these classifications to groups whose order divides p7, though the sheer number of families of such groups grows so quickly that further classifications along these lines are judged difficult for the human mind to comprehend.[3] For example, Marshall Hall Jr. and James K. Senior classified groups of order 2n for n ≤ 6 in 1964. [4]
Rather than classify the groups by order, Philip Hall proposed using a notion of isoclinism of groups which gathered finite p-groups into families based on large quotient and subgroups.[5]
An entirely different method classifies finite p-groups by their coclass, that is, the difference between their composition length and their nilpotency class. The so-called coclass conjectures described the set of all finite p-groups of fixed coclass as perturbations of finitely many pro-p groups. The coclass conjectures were proven in the 1980s using techniques related to Lie algebras and powerful p-groups.[6] The final proofs of the coclass theorems are due to A. Shalev and independently to C. R. Leedham-Green, both in 1994. They admit a classification of finite p-groups in directed coclass graphs consisting of only finitely many coclass trees whose (infinitely many) members are characterized by finitely many parametrized presentations.
Every group of order p5 is metabelian.[7]
Up to p3[edit]
The trivial group is the only group of order one, and the cyclic group Cp is the only group of order p. There are exactly two groups of order p2, both abelian, namely Cp2 and Cp × Cp. For example, the cyclic group C4 and the Klein four-group V4 which is C2 × C2 are both 2-groups of order 4.
There are three abelian groups of order p3, namely Cp3, Cp2×Cp, and Cp×Cp×Cp. There are also two non-abelian groups.
For p ≠ 2, one is a semi-direct product of Cp×Cp with Cp, and the other is a semi-direct product of Cp2 with Cp. The first one can be described in other terms as group UT(3,p) of unitriangular matrices over finite field with p elements, also called the Heisenberg group mod p.
For p = 2, both the semi-direct products mentioned above are isomorphic to the dihedral group Dih4 of order 8. The other non-abelian group of order 8 is the quaternion group Q8.

{\displaystyle p^{{\frac {2}{27}}n^{3}+O(n^{8/3})}}

, and these are dominated by the classes that are two-step nilpotent.[8] Because of this rapid growth, there is a folklore conjecture asserting that almost all finite groups are 2-groups: the fraction of isomorphism classes of 2-groups among isomorphism classes of groups of order at most n is thought to tend to 1 as n tends to infinity. For instance, of the 49 910 529 484 different groups of order at most 2000, 49 487 365 422, or just over 99%, are 2-groups of order 1024.[9]
Within a group[edit]
Every finite group whose order is divisible by p contains a subgroup which is a non-trivial p-group, namely a cyclic group of order p generated by an element of order p obtained from Cauchy's theorem. In fact, it contains a p-group of maximal possible order: if

 where p does not divide m, then G has a subgroup P of order

{\displaystyle p^{k},}

 called a Sylow p-subgroup. This subgroup need not be unique, but any subgroups of this order are conjugate, and any p-subgroup of G is contained in a Sylow p-subgroup. This and other properties are proved in the Sylow theorems.
Application to structure of a group[edit]
p-groups are fundamental tools in understanding the structure of groups and in the classification of finite simple groups. p-groups arise both as subgroups and as quotient groups. As subgroups, for a given prime p one has the Sylow p-subgroups P (largest p-subgroup not unique but all conjugate) and the p-core 




O

p


(

{\displaystyle O_{p}(G)}

 (the unique largest normal p-subgroup), and various others. As quotients, the largest p-group quotient is the quotient of G by the p-residual subgroup

{\displaystyle O^{p}(G).}

 These groups are related (for different primes), possess important properties such as the focal subgroup theorem, and allow one to determine many aspects of the structure of the group.
Local control[edit]
Much of the structure of a finite group is carried in the structure of its so-called local subgroups, the normalizers of non-identity p-subgroups.[10]
The large elementary abelian subgroups of a finite group exert control over the group that was used in the proof of the Feit–Thompson theorem. Certain central extensions of elementary abelian groups called extraspecial groups help describe the structure of groups as acting on symplectic vector spaces.
Brauer classified all groups whose Sylow 2-subgroups are the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 4, and Walter, Gorenstein, Bender, Suzuki, Glauberman, and others classified those simple groups whose Sylow 2-subgroups were abelian, dihedral, semidihedral, or quaternion.

In mathematical group theory, given a prime number p, a p-group is a group in which each element has a power of p as its order. That is, for each element g of a p-group, there exists a nonnegative integer n such that the product of pn copies of g, and not less, is equal to the identity element. The orders of different elements may be different powers of p. Such groups are also called p-primary or simply primary.
A finite group is a p-group if and only if its order (the number of its elements) is a power of p. Given a finite group G, the Sylow theorems guarantee for every prime power pn that divides the order of G the existence of a subgroup of G of order pn.
The remainder of this article deals with finite p-groups. For an example of an infinite abelian p-group, see Prüfer group, and for an example of an infinite simple p-group, see Tarski monster group.

Properties[edit]
Every p-group is periodic since by definition every element has finite order.
Non-trivial center[edit]
One of the first standard results using the class equation is that the center of a non-trivial finite p-group cannot be the trivial subgroup.[1]
This forms the basis for many inductive methods in p-groups.
For instance, the normalizer N of a proper subgroup H of a finite p-group G properly contains H, because for any counterexample with H=N, the center Z is contained in N, and so also in H, but then there is a smaller example H/Z whose normalizer in G/Z is N/Z=H/Z, creating an infinite descent. As a corollary, every finite p-group is nilpotent.
In another direction, every normal subgroup of a finite p-group intersects the center nontrivially as may be proved by considering the elements of N which are fixed when G acts on N by conjugation. Since every central subgroup is normal, it follows that every minimal normal subgroup of a finite p-group is central and has order p. Indeed, the socle of a finite p-group is the subgroup of the center consisting of the central elements of order p.
If G is a p-group, then so is G/Z, and so it too has a nontrivial center. The preimage in G of the center of G/Z is called the second center and these groups begin the upper central series. Generalizing the earlier comments about the socle, a finite p-group with order pn contains normal subgroups of order pi with 0 ≤ i ≤ n, and any normal subgroup of order pi is contained in the ith center Zi. If a normal subgroup is not contained in Zi, then its intersection with Zi+1 has size at least pi+1.
Automorphisms[edit]
The automorphism groups of p-groups are well studied. Just as every finite p-group has a nontrivial center so that the inner automorphism group is a proper quotient of the group, every finite p-group has a nontrivial outer automorphism group. Every automorphism of G induces an automorphism on G/Φ(G), where Φ(G) is the Frattini subgroup of G. The quotient G/Φ(G) is an elementary abelian group and its automorphism group is a general linear group, so very well understood. The map from the automorphism group of G into this general linear group has been studied by Burnside, who showed that the kernel of this map is a p-group.
Examples[edit]
p-groups of the same order are not necessarily isomorphic; for example, the cyclic group C4 and the Klein four-group V4 are both 2-groups of order 4, but they are not isomorphic.
Nor need a p-group be abelian; the dihedral group Dih4 of order 8 is a non-abelian 2-group. However, every group of order p2 is abelian.[note 1]
The dihedral groups are both very similar to and very dissimilar from the quaternion groups and the semidihedral groups. Together the dihedral, semidihedral, and quaternion groups form the 2-groups of maximal class, that is those groups of order 2n+1 and nilpotency class n.
Iterated wreath products[edit]
The iterated wreath products of cyclic groups of order p are very important examples of p-groups. Denote the cyclic group of order p as W(1), and the wreath product of W(n) with W(1) as W(n + 1). Then W(n) is the Sylow p-subgroup of the symmetric group Sym(pn). Maximal p-subgroups of the general linear group GL(n,Q) are direct products of various W(n). It has order pk where k = (pn − 1)/(p − 1). It has nilpotency class pn−1, and its lower central series, upper central series, lower exponent-p central series, and upper exponent-p central series are equal. It is generated by its elements of order p, but its exponent is pn. The second such group, W(2), is also a p-group of maximal class, since it has order pp+1 and nilpotency class p, but is not a regular p-group. Since groups of order pp are always regular groups, it is also a minimal such example.
Generalized dihedral groups[edit]
When p = 2 and n = 2, W(n) is the dihedral group of order 8, so in some sense W(n) provides an analogue for the dihedral group for all primes p when n = 2. However, for higher n the analogy becomes strained. There is a different family of examples that more closely mimics the dihedral groups of order 2n, but that requires a bit more setup. Let ζ denote a primitive pth root of unity in the complex numbers, let Z[ζ] be the ring of cyclotomic integers generated by it, and let P be the prime ideal generated by 1−ζ. Let G be a cyclic group of order p generated by an element z. Form the semidirect product E(p) of Z[ζ] and G where z acts as multiplication by ζ. The powers Pn are normal subgroups of E(p), and the example groups are E(p,n) = E(p)/Pn. E(p,n) has order pn+1 and nilpotency class n, so is a p-group of maximal class. When p = 2, E(2,n) is the dihedral group of order 2n. When p is odd, both W(2) and E(p,p) are irregular groups of maximal class and order pp+1, but are not isomorphic.
Unitriangular matrix groups[edit]
The Sylow subgroups of general linear groups are another fundamental family of examples. Let V be a vector space of dimension n with basis { e1, e2, …, en } and define Vi to be the vector space generated by { ei, ei+1, …, en } for 1 ≤ i ≤ n, and define Vi = 0 when i > n. For each 1 ≤ m ≤ n, the set of invertible linear transformations of V which take each Vi to Vi+m form a subgroup of Aut(V) denoted Um. If V is a vector space over Z/pZ, then U1 is a Sylow p-subgroup of Aut(V) = GL(n, p), and the terms of its lower central series are just the Um. In terms of matrices, Um are those upper triangular matrices with 1s one the diagonal and 0s on the first m−1 superdiagonals. The group U1 has order pn·(n−1)/2, nilpotency class n, and exponent pk where k is the least integer at least as large as the base p logarithm of n.
Classification[edit]
The groups of order pn for 0 ≤ n ≤ 4 were classified early in the history of group theory,[2] and modern work has extended these classifications to groups whose order divides p7, though the sheer number of families of such groups grows so quickly that further classifications along these lines are judged difficult for the human mind to comprehend.[3] For example, Marshall Hall Jr. and James K. Senior classified groups of order 2n for n ≤ 6 in 1964. [4]

An entirely different method classifies finite p-groups by their coclass, that is, the difference between their composition length and their nilpotency class.

Shalev and independently to C. R. Leedham-Green, both in 1994.

Every group of order p5 is metabelian.[7]

The trivial group is the only group of order one, and the cyclic group Cp is the only group of order p. There are exactly two groups of order p2, both abelian, namely Cp2 and Cp × Cp. For example, the cyclic group C4 and the Klein four-group V4 which is C2 × C2 are both 2-groups of order 4.
There are three abelian groups of order p3, namely Cp3, Cp2×Cp, and Cp×Cp×Cp. There are also two non-abelian groups.
For p ≠ 2, one is a semi-direct product of Cp×Cp with Cp, and the other is a semi-direct product of Cp2 with Cp. The first one can be described in other terms as group UT(3,p) of unitriangular matrices over finite field with p elements, also called the Heisenberg group mod p.

In mathematical group theory, given a prime number p, a p-group is a group in which each element has a power of p as its order. That is, for each element g of a p-group, there exists a nonnegative integer n such that the product of pn copies of g, and not less, is equal to the identity element. The orders of different elements may be different powers of p. Such groups are also called p-primary or simply primary.
A finite group is a p-group if and only if its order (the number of its elements) is a power of p. Given a finite group G, the Sylow theorems guarantee for every prime power pn that divides the order of G the existence of a subgroup of G of order pn.
The remainder of this article deals with finite p-groups. For an example of an infinite abelian p-group, see Prüfer group, and for an example of an infinite simple p-group, see Tarski monster group.

Properties[edit]
Every p-group is periodic since by definition every element has finite order.
Non-trivial center[edit]
One of the first standard results using the class equation is that the center of a non-trivial finite p-group cannot be the trivial subgroup.[1]
This forms the basis for many inductive methods in p-groups.
For instance, the normalizer N of a proper subgroup H of a finite p-group G properly contains H, because for any counterexample with H=N, the center Z is contained in N, and so also in H, but then there is a smaller example H/Z whose normalizer in G/Z is N/Z=H/Z, creating an infinite descent. As a corollary, every finite p-group is nilpotent.
In another direction, every normal subgroup of a finite p-group intersects the center nontrivially as may be proved by considering the elements of N which are fixed when G acts on N by conjugation. Since every central subgroup is normal, it follows that every minimal normal subgroup of a finite p-group is central and has order p. Indeed, the socle of a finite p-group is the subgroup of the center consisting of the central elements of order p.
If G is a p-group, then so is G/Z, and so it too has a nontrivial center. The preimage in G of the center of G/Z is called the second center and these groups begin the upper central series. Generalizing the earlier comments about the socle, a finite p-group with order pn contains normal subgroups of order pi with 0 ≤ i ≤ n, and any normal subgroup of order pi is contained in the ith center Zi. If a normal subgroup is not contained in Zi, then its intersection with Zi+1 has size at least pi+1.
Automorphisms[edit]
The automorphism groups of p-groups are well studied. Just as every finite p-group has a nontrivial center so that the inner automorphism group is a proper quotient of the group, every finite p-group has a nontrivial outer automorphism group. Every automorphism of G induces an automorphism on G/Φ(G), where Φ(G) is the Frattini subgroup of G. The quotient G/Φ(G) is an elementary abelian group and its automorphism group is a general linear group, so very well understood. The map from the automorphism group of G into this general linear group has been studied by Burnside, who showed that the kernel of this map is a p-group.
Examples[edit]
p-groups of the same order are not necessarily isomorphic; for example, the cyclic group C4 and the Klein four-group V4 are both 2-groups of order 4, but they are not isomorphic.
Nor need a p-group be abelian; the dihedral group Dih4 of order 8 is a non-abelian 2-group. However, every group of order p2 is abelian.[note 1]
The dihedral groups are both very similar to and very dissimilar from the quaternion groups and the semidihedral groups. Together the dihedral, semidihedral, and quaternion groups form the 2-groups of maximal class, that is those groups of order 2n+1 and nilpotency class n.
Iterated wreath products[edit]
The iterated wreath products of cyclic groups of order p are very important examples of p-groups. Denote the cyclic group of order p as W(1), and the wreath product of W(n) with W(1) as W(n + 1). Then W(n) is the Sylow p-subgroup of the symmetric group Sym(pn). Maximal p-subgroups of the general linear group GL(n,Q) are direct products of various W(n). It has order pk where k = (pn − 1)/(p − 1). It has nilpotency class pn−1, and its lower central series, upper central series, lower exponent-p central series, and upper exponent-p central series are equal. It is generated by its elements of order p, but its exponent is pn. The second such group, W(2), is also a p-group of maximal class, since it has order pp+1 and nilpotency class p, but is not a regular p-group. Since groups of order pp are always regular groups, it is also a minimal such example.
Generalized dihedral groups[edit]
When p = 2 and n = 2, W(n) is the dihedral group of order 8, so in some sense W(n) provides an analogue for the dihedral group for all primes p when n = 2. However, for higher n the analogy becomes strained. There is a different family of examples that more closely mimics the dihedral groups of order 2n, but that requires a bit more setup. Let ζ denote a primitive pth root of unity in the complex numbers, let Z[ζ] be the ring of cyclotomic integers generated by it, and let P be the prime ideal generated by 1−ζ. Let G be a cyclic group of order p generated by an element z. Form the semidirect product E(p) of Z[ζ] and G where z acts as multiplication by ζ. The powers Pn are normal subgroups of E(p), and the example groups are E(p,n) = E(p)/Pn. E(p,n) has order pn+1 and nilpotency class n, so is a p-group of maximal class. When p = 2, E(2,n) is the dihedral group of order 2n. When p is odd, both W(2) and E(p,p) are irregular groups of maximal class and order pp+1, but are not isomorphic.
Unitriangular matrix groups[edit]
The Sylow subgroups of general linear groups are another fundamental family of examples. Let V be a vector space of dimension n with basis { e1, e2, …, en } and define Vi to be the vector space generated by { ei, ei+1, …, en } for 1 ≤ i ≤ n, and define Vi = 0 when i > n. For each 1 ≤ m ≤ n, the set of invertible linear transformations of V which take each Vi to Vi+m form a subgroup of Aut(V) denoted Um. If V is a vector space over Z/pZ, then U1 is a Sylow p-subgroup of Aut(V) = GL(n, p), and the terms of its lower central series are just the Um. In terms of matrices, Um are those upper triangular matrices with 1s one the diagonal and 0s on the first m−1 superdiagonals. The group U1 has order pn·(n−1)/2, nilpotency class n, and exponent pk where k is the least integer at least as large as the base p logarithm of n.
Classification[edit]
The groups of order pn for 0 ≤ n ≤ 4 were classified early in the history of group theory,[2] and modern work has extended these classifications to groups whose order divides p7, though the sheer number of families of such groups grows so quickly that further classifications along these lines are judged difficult for the human mind to comprehend.[3] For example, Marshall Hall Jr. and James K. Senior classified groups of order 2n for n ≤ 6 in 1964. [4]
Rather than classify the groups by order, Philip Hall proposed using a notion of isoclinism of groups which gathered finite p-groups into families based on large quotient and subgroups.[5]
An entirely different method classifies finite p-groups by their coclass, that is, the difference between their composition length and their nilpotency class. The so-called coclass conjectures described the set of all finite p-groups of fixed coclass as perturbations of finitely many pro-p groups. The coclass conjectures were proven in the 1980s using techniques related to Lie algebras and powerful p-groups.[6] The final proofs of the coclass theorems are due to A. Shalev and independently to C. R. Leedham-Green, both in 1994. They admit a classification of finite p-groups in directed coclass graphs consisting of only finitely many coclass trees whose (infinitely many) members are characterized by finitely many parametrized presentations.
Every group of order p5 is metabelian.[7]
Up to p3[edit]
The trivial group is the only group of order one, and the cyclic group Cp is the only group of order p. There are exactly two groups of order p2, both abelian, namely Cp2 and Cp × Cp. For example, the cyclic group C4 and the Klein four-group V4 which is C2 × C2 are both 2-groups of order 4.
There are three abelian groups of order p3, namely Cp3, Cp2×Cp, and Cp×Cp×Cp. There are also two non-abelian groups.
For p ≠ 2, one is a semi-direct product of Cp×Cp with Cp, and the other is a semi-direct product of Cp2 with Cp. The first one can be described in other terms as group UT(3,p) of unitriangular matrices over finite field with p elements, also called the Heisenberg group mod p.
For p = 2, both the semi-direct products mentioned above are isomorphic to the dihedral group Dih4 of order 8. The other non-abelian group of order 8 is the quaternion group Q8.
Prevalence[edit]
Among groups[edit]
The number of isomorphism classes of groups of order pn grows as 




p



2
27



n

3


+
O
(

n

8

/

3


)




{\displaystyle p^{{\frac {2}{27}}n^{3}+O(n^{8/3})}}

, and these are dominated by the classes that are two-step nilpotent.[8] Because of this rapid growth, there is a folklore conjecture asserting that almost all finite groups are 2-groups: the fraction of isomorphism classes of 2-groups among isomorphism classes of groups of order at most n is thought to tend to 1 as n tends to infinity. For instance, of the 49 910 529 484 different groups of order at most 2000, 49 487 365 422, or just over 99%, are 2-groups of order 1024.[9]
Within a group[edit]
Every finite group whose order is divisible by p contains a subgroup which is a non-trivial p-group, namely a cyclic group of order p generated by an element of order p obtained from Cauchy's theorem. In fact, it contains a p-group of maximal possible order: if

p

m


{\displaystyle |G|=n=p^{k}m}

 where p does not divide m, then G has a subgroup P of order 




p

k


,


{\displaystyle p^{k},}

 called a Sylow p-subgroup. This subgroup need not be unique, but any subgroups of this order are conjugate, and any p-subgroup of G is contained in a Sylow p-subgroup. This and other properties are proved in the Sylow theorems.
Application to structure of a group[edit]
p-groups are fundamental tools in understanding the structure of groups and in the classification of finite simple groups. p-groups arise both as subgroups and as quotient groups. As subgroups, for a given prime p one has the Sylow p-subgroups P (largest p-subgroup not unique but all conjugate) and the p-core 




O

p


(
G
)


{\displaystyle O_{p}(G)}

 (the unique largest normal p-subgroup), and various others. As quotients, the largest p-group quotient is the quotient of G by the p-residual subgroup 




O

p


(
G
)
.


{\displaystyle O^{p}(G).}

 These groups are related (for different primes), possess important properties such as the focal subgroup theorem, and allow one to determine many aspects of the structure of the group.
Local control[edit]
Much of the structure of a finite group is carried in the structure of its so-called local subgroups, the normalizers of non-identity p-subgroups.[10]
The large elementary abelian subgroups of a finite group exert control over the group that was used in the proof of the Feit–Thompson theorem. Certain central extensions of elementary abelian groups called extraspecial groups help describe the structure of groups as acting on symplectic vector spaces.
Brauer classified all groups whose Sylow 2-subgroups are the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 4, and Walter, Gorenstein, Bender, Suzuki, Glauberman, and others classified those simple groups whose Sylow 2-subgroups were abelian, dihedral, semidihedral, or quaternion.

Notes[edit]



^ To prove that a group of order p2 is abelian, note that it is a p-group so has non-trivial center, so given a non-trivial element of the center g, this either generates the group (so G is cyclic, hence abelian: 



G
=

C


p

{\displaystyle G=C_{p^{2}}}

), or it generates a subgroup of order p, so g and some element h not in its orbit generate G, (since the subgroup they generate must have order 




p

{\displaystyle p^{2}}

) but they commute since g is central, so the group is abelian, and in fact

The symmetry group of a snowflake is D6, a dihedral symmetry, the same as for a regular hexagon.


In mathematics, a dihedral group is the group of symmetries of a regular polygon,[1][2] which includes rotations and reflections. Dihedral groups are among the simplest examples of finite groups, and they play an important role in group theory, geometry, and chemistry.
The notation for the dihedral group of order n differs in geometry and abstract algebra. In geometry, Dn or Dihn refers to the symmetries of the n-gon, a group of order 2n. In abstract algebra, Dn refers to the dihedral group of order n.[3] The geometric convention is used in this article.

A regular polygon with

 different symmetries: 



n

 rotational symmetries and 



n


{\displaystyle n}

 reflection symmetries. Usually, we take 



n


{\displaystyle n}

≥3 here.The associated rotations and reflections make up the dihedral group 




D

n




{\displaystyle D_{n}}

 . If 



n


{\displaystyle n}

 is odd, each axis of symmetry connects the midpoint of one side to the opposite vertex. If 



n


{\displaystyle n}

 is even, there are n/2 axes of symmetry connecting the midpoints of opposite sides and 



n

/

2


{\displaystyle n/2}

 axes of symmetry connecting opposite vertices. In either case, there are 



n


{\displaystyle n}

 axes of symmetry and 



2
n


{\displaystyle 2n}

 elements in the symmetry group. Reflecting in one axis of symmetry followed by reflecting in another axis of symmetry produces a rotation through twice the angle between the axes.
The following picture shows the effect of the sixteen elements of 




D

8




{\displaystyle D_{8}}

 on a stop sign:

The first row shows the effect of the eight rotations, and the second row shows the effect of the eight reflections, in each case acting on the stop sign with the orientation as shown at the top left.
Group structure[edit]
As with any geometric object, the composition of two symmetries of a regular polygon is again a symmetry of this object. With composition of symmetries to produce another as the binary operation, this gives the symmetries of a polygon the algebraic structure of a finite group.











The composition of these two reflections is a rotation.


The following Cayley table shows the effect of composition in the group D3 (the symmetries of an equilateral triangle). r0 denotes the identity; r1 and r2 denote counterclockwise rotations by 120° and 240° respectively, and s0, s1 and s2 denote reflections across the three lines shown in the adjacent picture.

For example, s2s1 = r1, because the reflection s1 followed by the reflection s2 results in a rotation of 120°. The order of elements denoting the composition is right to left, reflecting the convention that the element acts on the expression to its right. The composition operation is not commutative.
In general, the group Dn has elements r0, …, rn−1 and s0, …, sn−1, with composition given by the following formulae:

In all cases, addition and subtraction of subscripts are to be performed using modular arithmetic with modulus n.
Matrix representation[edit]




The symmetries of this pentagon are linear transformations of the plane as a vector space.


If we center the regular polygon at the origin, then elements of the dihedral group act as linear transformations of the plane. This lets us represent elements of Dn as matrices, with composition being matrix multiplication. This is an example of a (2-dimensional) group representation.
For example, the elements of the group D4 can be represented by the following eight matrices:

From the second presentation follows that Dn belongs to the class of Coxeter groups.
The semidirect product of cyclic groups Zn and Z2, with Z2 acting on Zn by inversion (thus, Dn always has a normal subgroup isomorphic to the group Zn). Zn ⋊φ Z2 is isomorphic to Dn if φ(0) is the identity and φ(1) is inversion.


Small dihedral groups[edit]




Example subgroups from a hexagonal dihedral symmetry


D1 is isomorphic to Z2, the cyclic group of order 2.
D2 is isomorphic to K4, the Klein four-group.
D1 and D2 are exceptional in that:

D1 and D2 are the only abelian dihedral groups. Otherwise, Dn is non-abelian.
Dn is a subgroup of the symmetric group Sn for n ≥ 3. Since 2n > n! for n = 1 or n = 2, for these values, Dn is too large to be a subgroup.
The inner automorphism group of D2 is trivial, whereas for other even values of n, this is Dn / Z2.

The cycle graphs of dihedral groups consist of an n-element cycle and n 2-element cycles. The dark vertex in the cycle graphs below of various dihedral groups represents the identity element, and the other vertices are the other elements of the group. A cycle consists of successive powers of either of the elements connected to the identity element.

The dihedral group as symmetry group in 2D and rotation group in 3D[edit]
An example of abstract group Dn, and a common way to visualize it, is the group of Euclidean plane isometries which keep the origin fixed. These groups form one of the two series of discrete point groups in two dimensions. Dn consists of n rotations of multiples of 360°/n about the origin, and reflections across n lines through the origin, making angles of multiples of 180°/n with each other. This is the symmetry group of a regular polygon with n sides (for n ≥ 3; this extends to the cases n = 1 and n = 2 where we have a plane with respectively a point offset from the "center" of the "1-gon" and a "2-gon" or line segment).
Dn is generated by a rotation r of order n and a reflection s of order 2 such that

(Compare coordinate rotations and reflections.)
The dihedral group D2 is generated by the rotation r of 180 degrees, and the reflection s across the x-axis. The elements of D2 can then be represented as {e, r, s, rs}, where e is the identity or null transformation and rs is the reflection across the y-axis.




The four elements of D2 (x-axis is vertical here)


D2 is isomorphic to the Klein four-group.
For n>2 the operations of rotation and reflection in general do not commute and Dn is not abelian; for example, in D4, a rotation of 90 degrees followed by a reflection yields a different result from a reflection followed by a rotation of 90 degrees.




D4 is nonabelian (x-axis is vertical here).


Thus, beyond their obvious application to problems of symmetry in the plane, these groups are among the simplest examples of non-abelian groups, and as such arise frequently as easy counterexamples to theorems which are restricted to abelian groups.
The 2n elements of Dn can be written as e, r, r2, … , rn−1, s, r s, r2s, … , rn−1s. The first n listed elements are rotations and the remaining n elements are axis-reflections (all of which have order 2). The product of two rotations or two reflections is a rotation; the product of a rotation and a reflection is a reflection.
So far, we have considered Dn to be a subgroup of O(2), i.e. the group of rotations (about the origin) and reflections (across axes through the origin) of the plane. However, notation Dn is also used for a subgroup of SO(3) which is also of abstract group type Dn: the proper symmetry group of a regular polygon embedded in three-dimensional space (if n ≥ 3). Such a figure may be considered as a degenerate regular solid with its face counted twice. Therefore, it is also called a dihedron (Greek: solid with two faces), which explains the name dihedral group (in analogy to tetrahedral, octahedral and icosahedral group, referring to the proper symmetry groups of a regular tetrahedron, octahedron, and icosahedron respectively).
Examples of 2D dihedral symmetry[edit]

Properties[edit]
The properties of the dihedral groups Dn with n ≥ 3 depend on whether n is even or odd. For example, the center of Dn consists only of the identity if n is odd, but if n is even the center has two elements, namely the identity and the element rn/2 (with Dn as a subgroup of O(2), this is inversion; since it is scalar multiplication by −1, it is clear that it commutes with any linear transformation).
In the case of 2D isometries, this corresponds to adding inversion, giving rotations and mirrors in between the existing ones.
For n twice an odd number, the abstract group Dn is isomorphic with the direct product of Dn / 2 and Z2. Generally, if m divides n, then Dn has n/m subgroups of type Dm, and one subgroup ℤm. Therefore, the total number of subgroups of Dn (n ≥ 1), is equal to d(n) + σ(n), where d(n) is the number of positive divisors of n and σ(n) is the sum of the positive divisors of n. See list of small groups for the cases n ≤ 8.
The dihedral group of order 8 (D4) is the smallest example of a group that is not a T-group. Any of its two Klein four-group subgroups (which are normal in D4) has as normal subgroup order-2 subgroups generated by a reflection (flip) in D4, but these subgroups are not normal in D4.
Conjugacy classes of reflections[edit]
All the reflections are conjugate to each other in case n is odd, but they fall into two conjugacy classes if n is even. If we think of the isometries of a regular n-gon: for odd n there are rotations in the group between every pair of mirrors, while for even n only half of the mirrors can be reached from one by these rotations. Geometrically, in an odd polygon every axis of symmetry passes through a vertex and a side, while in an even polygon there are two sets of axes, each corresponding to a conjugacy class: those that pass through two vertices and those that pass through two sides.
Algebraically, this is an instance of the conjugate Sylow theorem (for n odd): for n odd, each reflection, together with the identity, form a subgroup of order 2, which is a Sylow 2-subgroup (2 = 21 is the maximum power of 2 dividing 2n = 2[2k + 1]), while for n even, these order 2 subgroups are not Sylow subgroups because 4 (a higher power of 2) divides the order of the group.
For n even there is instead an outer automorphism interchanging the two types of reflections (properly, a class of outer automorphisms, which are all conjugate by an inner automorphism).
Automorphism group[edit]
The automorphism group of Dn is isomorphic to the holomorph of ℤ/nℤ, i.e., to Hol(ℤ/nℤ) = {ax + b | (a, n) = 1} and has order nϕ(n), where ϕ is Euler's totient function, the number of k in 1, …, n − 1 coprime to n.
It can be understood in terms of the generators of a reflection and an elementary rotation (rotation by k(2π/n), for k coprime to n); which automorphisms are inner and outer depends on the parity of n.

For n odd, the dihedral group is centerless, so any element defines a non-trivial inner automorphism; for n even, the rotation by 180° (reflection through the origin) is the non-trivial element of the center.
Thus for n odd, the inner automorphism group has order 2n, and for n even (other than n = 2) the inner automorphism group has order n.
For n odd, all reflections are conjugate; for n even, they fall into two classes (those through two vertices and those through two faces), related by an outer automorphism, which can be represented by rotation by π/n (half the minimal rotation).
The rotations are a normal subgroup; conjugation by a reflection changes the sign (direction) of the rotation, but otherwise leaves them unchanged. Thus automorphisms that multiply angles by k (coprime to n) are outer unless k = ±1.

Examples of automorphism groups[edit]
D9 has 18 inner automorphisms. As 2D isometry group D9, the group has mirrors at 20° intervals. The 18 inner automorphisms provide rotation of the mirrors by multiples of 20°, and reflections. As isometry group these are all automorphisms. As abstract group there are in addition to these, 36 outer automorphisms; e.g., multiplying angles of rotation by 2.
D10 has 10 inner automorphisms. As 2D isometry group D10, the group has mirrors at 18° intervals. The 10 inner automorphisms provide rotation of the mirrors by multiples of 36°, and reflections. As isometry group there are 10 more automorphisms; they are conjugates by isometries outside the group, rotating the mirrors 18° with respect to the inner automorphisms. As abstract group there are in addition to these 10 inner and 10 outer automorphisms, 20 more outer automorphisms; e.g., multiplying rotations by 3.
Compare the values 6 and 4 for Euler's totient function, the multiplicative group of integers modulo n for n = 9 and 10, respectively. This triples and doubles the number of automorphisms compared with the two automorphisms as isometries (keeping the order of the rotations the same or reversing the order).
The only values of n for which φ(n) = 2 are 3, 4, and 6, and consequently, there are only three dihedral groups that are isomorphic to their own automorphism groups, namely D3 (order 6), D4 (order 8), and D6 (order 12).[4][5][6]
Inner automorphism group[edit]
The inner automorphism group of Dn is isomorphic to:[7]

Dn if n is odd;
Trivial if n = 2;
Dn / Z2 if n is even and n > 2.

Generalizations[edit]
There are several important generalizations of the dihedral groups:

The infinite dihedral group is an infinite group with algebraic structure similar to the finite dihedral groups. It can be viewed as the group of symmetries of the integers.
The orthogonal group O(2), i.e. the symmetry group of the circle, also has similar properties to the dihedral groups.
The family of generalized dihedral groups includes both of the examples above, as well as many other groups.
The quasidihedral groups are family of finite groups with similar properties to the dihedral groups.

In mathematical group theory, given a prime number p, a p-group is a group in which each element has a power of p as its order. That is, for each element g of a p-group, there exists a nonnegative integer n such that the product of pn copies of g, and not less, is equal to the identity element. The orders of different elements may be different powers of p. Such groups are also called p-primary or simply primary.
A finite group is a p-group if and only if its order (the number of its elements) is a power of p. Given a finite group G, the Sylow theorems guarantee for every prime power pn that divides the order of G the existence of a subgroup of G of order pn.
The remainder of this article deals with finite p-groups. For an example of an infinite abelian p-group, see Prüfer group, and for an example of an infinite simple p-group, see Tarski monster group.

Properties[edit]
Every p-group is periodic since by definition every element has finite order.
Non-trivial center[edit]
One of the first standard results using the class equation is that the center of a non-trivial finite p-group cannot be the trivial subgroup.[1]
This forms the basis for many inductive methods in p-groups.
For instance, the normalizer N of a proper subgroup H of a finite p-group G properly contains H, because for any counterexample with H=N, the center Z is contained in N, and so also in H, but then there is a smaller example H/Z whose normalizer in G/Z is N/Z=H/Z, creating an infinite descent. As a corollary, every finite p-group is nilpotent.
In another direction, every normal subgroup of a finite p-group intersects the center nontrivially as may be proved by considering the elements of N which are fixed when G acts on N by conjugation. Since every central subgroup is normal, it follows that every minimal normal subgroup of a finite p-group is central and has order p. Indeed, the socle of a finite p-group is the subgroup of the center consisting of the central elements of order p.
If G is a p-group, then so is G/Z, and so it too has a nontrivial center. The preimage in G of the center of G/Z is called the second center and these groups begin the upper central series. Generalizing the earlier comments about the socle, a finite p-group with order pn contains normal subgroups of order pi with 0 ≤ i ≤ n, and any normal subgroup of order pi is contained in the ith center Zi. If a normal subgroup is not contained in Zi, then its intersection with Zi+1 has size at least pi+1.
Automorphisms[edit]
The automorphism groups of p-groups are well studied. Just as every finite p-group has a nontrivial center so that the inner automorphism group is a proper quotient of the group, every finite p-group has a nontrivial outer automorphism group. Every automorphism of G induces an automorphism on G/Φ(G), where Φ(G) is the Frattini subgroup of G. The quotient G/Φ(G) is an elementary abelian group and its automorphism group is a general linear group, so very well understood. The map from the automorphism group of G into this general linear group has been studied by Burnside, who showed that the kernel of this map is a p-group.
Examples[edit]
p-groups of the same order are not necessarily isomorphic; for example, the cyclic group C4 and the Klein four-group V4 are both 2-groups of order 4, but they are not isomorphic.
Nor need a p-group be abelian; the dihedral group Dih4 of order 8 is a non-abelian 2-group. However, every group of order p2 is abelian.[note 1]
The dihedral groups are both very similar to and very dissimilar from the quaternion groups and the semidihedral groups. Together the dihedral, semidihedral, and quaternion groups form the 2-groups of maximal class, that is those groups of order 2n+1 and nilpotency class n.
Iterated wreath products[edit]
The iterated wreath products of cyclic groups of order p are very important examples of p-groups. Denote the cyclic group of order p as W(1), and the wreath product of W(n) with W(1) as W(n + 1). Then W(n) is the Sylow p-subgroup of the symmetric group Sym(pn). Maximal p-subgroups of the general linear group GL(n,Q) are direct products of various W(n). It has order pk where k = (pn − 1)/(p − 1). It has nilpotency class pn−1, and its lower central series, upper central series, lower exponent-p central series, and upper exponent-p central series are equal. It is generated by its elements of order p, but its exponent is pn. The second such group, W(2), is also a p-group of maximal class, since it has order pp+1 and nilpotency class p, but is not a regular p-group. Since groups of order pp are always regular groups, it is also a minimal such example.
Generalized dihedral groups[edit]
When p = 2 and n = 2, W(n) is the dihedral group of order 8, so in some sense W(n) provides an analogue for the dihedral group for all primes p when n = 2. However, for higher n the analogy becomes strained. There is a different family of examples that more closely mimics the dihedral groups of order 2n, but that requires a bit more setup. Let ζ denote a primitive pth root of unity in the complex numbers, let Z[ζ] be the ring of cyclotomic integers generated by it, and let P be the prime ideal generated by 1−ζ. Let G be a cyclic group of order p generated by an element z. Form the semidirect product E(p) of Z[ζ] and G where z acts as multiplication by ζ. The powers Pn are normal subgroups of E(p), and the example groups are E(p,n) = E(p)/Pn. E(p,n) has order pn+1 and nilpotency class n, so is a p-group of maximal class. When p = 2, E(2,n) is the dihedral group of order 2n. When p is odd, both W(2) and E(p,p) are irregular groups of maximal class and order pp+1, but are not isomorphic.
Unitriangular matrix groups[edit]
The Sylow subgroups of general linear groups are another fundamental family of examples. Let V be a vector space of dimension n with basis { e1, e2, …, en } and define Vi to be the vector space generated by { ei, ei+1, …, en } for 1 ≤ i ≤ n, and define Vi = 0 when i > n. For each 1 ≤ m ≤ n, the set of invertible linear transformations of V which take each Vi to Vi+m form a subgroup of Aut(V) denoted Um. If V is a vector space over Z/pZ, then U1 is a Sylow p-subgroup of Aut(V) = GL(n, p), and the terms of its lower central series are just the Um. In terms of matrices, Um are those upper triangular matrices with 1s one the diagonal and 0s on the first m−1 superdiagonals. The group U1 has order pn·(n−1)/2, nilpotency class n, and exponent pk where k is the least integer at least as large as the base p logarithm of n.
Classification[edit]
The groups of order pn for 0 ≤ n ≤ 4 were classified early in the history of group theory,[2] and modern work has extended these classifications to groups whose order divides p7, though the sheer number of families of such groups grows so quickly that further classifications along these lines are judged difficult for the human mind to comprehend.[3] For example, Marshall Hall Jr. and James K. Senior classified groups of order 2n for n ≤ 6 in 1964. [4]
Rather than classify the groups by order, Philip Hall proposed using a notion of isoclinism of groups which gathered finite p-groups into families based on large quotient and subgroups.[5]
An entirely different method classifies finite p-groups by their coclass, that is, the difference between their composition length and their nilpotency class. The so-called coclass conjectures described the set of all finite p-groups of fixed coclass as perturbations of finitely many pro-p groups. The coclass conjectures were proven in the 1980s using techniques related to Lie algebras and powerful p-groups.[6] The final proofs of the coclass theorems are due to A. Shalev and independently to C. R. Leedham-Green, both in 1994. They admit a classification of finite p-groups in directed coclass graphs consisting of only finitely many coclass trees whose (infinitely many) members are characterized by finitely many parametrized presentations.
Every group of order p5 is metabelian.[7]
Up to p3[edit]
The trivial group is the only group of order one, and the cyclic group Cp is the only group of order p. There are exactly two groups of order p2, both abelian, namely Cp2 and Cp × Cp. For example, the cyclic group C4 and the Klein four-group V4 which is C2 × C2 are both 2-groups of order 4.
There are three abelian groups of order p3, namely Cp3, Cp2×Cp, and Cp×Cp×Cp. There are also two non-abelian groups.
For p ≠ 2, one is a semi-direct product of Cp×Cp with Cp, and the other is a semi-direct product of Cp2 with Cp. The first one can be described in other terms as group UT(3,p) of unitriangular matrices over finite field with p elements, also called the Heisenberg group mod p.
For p = 2, both the semi-direct products mentioned above are isomorphic to the dihedral group Dih4 of order 8. The other non-abelian group of order 8 is the quaternion group Q8.

, and these are dominated by the classes that are two-step nilpotent.[8] Because of this rapid growth, there is a folklore conjecture asserting that almost all finite groups are 2-groups: the fraction of isomorphism classes of 2-groups among isomorphism classes of groups of order at most n is thought to tend to 1 as n tends to infinity. For instance, of the 49 910 529 484 different groups of order at most 2000, 49 487 365 422, or just over 99%, are 2-groups of order 1024.[9]
Within a group[edit]
Every finite group whose order is divisible by p contains a subgroup which is a non-trivial p-group, namely a cyclic group of order p generated by an element of order p obtained from Cauchy's theorem. In fact, it contains a p-group of maximal possible order: if

m


{\displaystyle |G|=n=p^{k}m}

 where p does not divide m, then G has a subgroup P of order 




p

,


{\displaystyle p^{k},}

 called a Sylow p-subgroup. This subgroup need not be unique, but any subgroups of this order are conjugate, and any p-subgroup of G is contained in a Sylow p-subgroup. This and other properties are proved in the Sylow theorems.
Application to structure of a group[edit]
p-groups are fundamental tools in understanding the structure of groups and in the classification of finite simple groups. p-groups arise both as subgroups and as quotient groups. As subgroups, for a given prime p one has the Sylow p-subgroups P (largest p-subgroup not unique but all conjugate) and the p-core 




O

{\displaystyle O_{p}(G)}

 (the unique largest normal p-subgroup), and various others. As quotients, the largest p-group quotient is the quotient of G by the p-residual subgroup 




O

G
)
.


{\displaystyle O^{p}(G).}

 These groups are related (for different primes), possess important properties such as the focal subgroup theorem, and allow one to determine many aspects of the structure of the group.
Local control[edit]
Much of the structure of a finite group is carried in the structure of its so-called local subgroups, the normalizers of non-identity p-subgroups.[10]
The large elementary abelian subgroups of a finite group exert control over the group that was used in the proof of the Feit–Thompson theorem. Certain central extensions of elementary abelian groups called extraspecial groups help describe the structure of groups as acting on symplectic vector spaces.
Brauer classified all groups whose Sylow 2-subgroups are the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 4, and Walter, Gorenstein, Bender, Suzuki, Glauberman, and others classified those simple groups whose Sylow 2-subgroups were abelian, dihedral, semidihedral, or quaternion.

In mathematical group theory, given a prime number p, a p-group is a group in which each element has a power of p as its order. That is, for each element g of a p-group, there exists a nonnegative integer n such that the product of pn copies of g, and not less, is equal to the identity element. The orders of different elements may be different powers of p. Such groups are also called p-primary or simply primary.
A finite group is a p-group if and only if its order (the number of its elements) is a power of p. Given a finite group G, the Sylow theorems guarantee for every prime power pn that divides the order of G the existence of a subgroup of G of order pn.
The remainder of this article deals with finite p-groups. For an example of an infinite abelian p-group, see Prüfer group, and for an example of an infinite simple p-group, see Tarski monster group.

Properties[edit]
Every p-group is periodic since by definition every element has finite order.
Non-trivial center[edit]
One of the first standard results using the class equation is that the center of a non-trivial finite p-group cannot be the trivial subgroup.[1]
This forms the basis for many inductive methods in p-groups.
For instance, the normalizer N of a proper subgroup H of a finite p-group G properly contains H, because for any counterexample with H=N, the center Z is contained in N, and so also in H, but then there is a smaller example H/Z whose normalizer in G/Z is N/Z=H/Z, creating an infinite descent. As a corollary, every finite p-group is nilpotent.
In another direction, every normal subgroup of a finite p-group intersects the center nontrivially as may be proved by considering the elements of N which are fixed when G acts on N by conjugation. Since every central subgroup is normal, it follows that every minimal normal subgroup of a finite p-group is central and has order p. Indeed, the socle of a finite p-group is the subgroup of the center consisting of the central elements of order p.
If G is a p-group, then so is G/Z, and so it too has a nontrivial center. The preimage in G of the center of G/Z is called the second center and these groups begin the upper central series. Generalizing the earlier comments about the socle, a finite p-group with order pn contains normal subgroups of order pi with 0 ≤ i ≤ n, and any normal subgroup of order pi is contained in the ith center Zi. If a normal subgroup is not contained in Zi, then its intersection with Zi+1 has size at least pi+1.
Automorphisms[edit]
The automorphism groups of p-groups are well studied. Just as every finite p-group has a nontrivial center so that the inner automorphism group is a proper quotient of the group, every finite p-group has a nontrivial outer automorphism group. Every automorphism of G induces an automorphism on G/Φ(G), where Φ(G) is the Frattini subgroup of G. The quotient G/Φ(G) is an elementary abelian group and its automorphism group is a general linear group, so very well understood. The map from the automorphism group of G into this general linear group has been studied by Burnside, who showed that the kernel of this map is a p-group.
Examples[edit]
p-groups of the same order are not necessarily isomorphic; for example, the cyclic group C4 and the Klein four-group V4 are both 2-groups of order 4, but they are not isomorphic.
Nor need a p-group be abelian; the dihedral group Dih4 of order 8 is a non-abelian 2-group. However, every group of order p2 is abelian.[note 1]
The dihedral groups are both very similar to and very dissimilar from the quaternion groups and the semidihedral groups. Together the dihedral, semidihedral, and quaternion groups form the 2-groups of maximal class, that is those groups of order 2n+1 and nilpotency class n.
Iterated wreath products[edit]
The iterated wreath products of cyclic groups of order p are very important examples of p-groups. Denote the cyclic group of order p as W(1), and the wreath product of W(n) with W(1) as W(n + 1). Then W(n) is the Sylow p-subgroup of the symmetric group Sym(pn). Maximal p-subgroups of the general linear group GL(n,Q) are direct products of various W(n). It has order pk where k = (pn − 1)/(p − 1). It has nilpotency class pn−1, and its lower central series, upper central series, lower exponent-p central series, and upper exponent-p central series are equal. It is generated by its elements of order p, but its exponent is pn. The second such group, W(2), is also a p-group of maximal class, since it has order pp+1 and nilpotency class p, but is not a regular p-group. Since groups of order pp are always regular groups, it is also a minimal such example.
Generalized dihedral groups[edit]
When p = 2 and n = 2, W(n) is the dihedral group of order 8, so in some sense W(n) provides an analogue for the dihedral group for all primes p when n = 2. However, for higher n the analogy becomes strained. There is a different family of examples that more closely mimics the dihedral groups of order 2n, but that requires a bit more setup. Let ζ denote a primitive pth root of unity in the complex numbers, let Z[ζ] be the ring of cyclotomic integers generated by it, and let P be the prime ideal generated by 1−ζ. Let G be a cyclic group of order p generated by an element z. Form the semidirect product E(p) of Z[ζ] and G where z acts as multiplication by ζ. The powers Pn are normal subgroups of E(p), and the example groups are E(p,n) = E(p)/Pn. E(p,n) has order pn+1 and nilpotency class n, so is a p-group of maximal class. When p = 2, E(2,n) is the dihedral group of order 2n. When p is odd, both W(2) and E(p,p) are irregular groups of maximal class and order pp+1, but are not isomorphic.
Unitriangular matrix groups[edit]
The Sylow subgroups of general linear groups are another fundamental family of examples. Let V be a vector space of dimension n with basis { e1, e2, …, en } and define Vi to be the vector space generated by { ei, ei+1, …, en } for 1 ≤ i ≤ n, and define Vi = 0 when i > n. For each 1 ≤ m ≤ n, the set of invertible linear transformations of V which take each Vi to Vi+m form a subgroup of Aut(V) denoted Um. If V is a vector space over Z/pZ, then U1 is a Sylow p-subgroup of Aut(V) = GL(n, p), and the terms of its lower central series are just the Um. In terms of matrices, Um are those upper triangular matrices with 1s one the diagonal and 0s on the first m−1 superdiagonals. The group U1 has order pn·(n−1)/2, nilpotency class n, and exponent pk where k is the least integer at least as large as the base p logarithm of n.
Classification[edit]
The groups of order pn for 0 ≤ n ≤ 4 were classified early in the history of group theory,[2] and modern work has extended these classifications to groups whose order divides p7, though the sheer number of families of such groups grows so quickly that further classifications along these lines are judged difficult for the human mind to comprehend.[3] For example, Marshall Hall Jr. and James K. Senior classified groups of order 2n for n ≤ 6 in 1964. [4]
Rather than classify the groups by order, Philip Hall proposed using a notion of isoclinism of groups which gathered finite p-groups into families based on large quotient and subgroups.[5]
An entirely different method classifies finite p-groups by their coclass, that is, the difference between their composition length and their nilpotency class. The so-called coclass conjectures described the set of all finite p-groups of fixed coclass as perturbations of finitely many pro-p groups. The coclass conjectures were proven in the 1980s using techniques related to Lie algebras and powerful p-groups.[6] The final proofs of the coclass theorems are due to A. Shalev and independently to C. R. Leedham-Green, both in 1994. They admit a classification of finite p-groups in directed coclass graphs consisting of only finitely many coclass trees whose (infinitely many) members are characterized by finitely many parametrized presentations.
Every group of order p5 is metabelian.[7]
Up to p3[edit]
The trivial group is the only group of order one, and the cyclic group Cp is the only group of order p. There are exactly two groups of order p2, both abelian, namely Cp2 and Cp × Cp. For example, the cyclic group C4 and the Klein four-group V4 which is C2 × C2 are both 2-groups of order 4.
There are three abelian groups of order p3, namely Cp3, Cp2×Cp, and Cp×Cp×Cp. There are also two non-abelian groups.
For p ≠ 2, one is a semi-direct product of Cp×Cp with Cp, and the other is a semi-direct product of Cp2 with Cp. The first one can be described in other terms as group UT(3,p) of unitriangular matrices over finite field with p elements, also called the Heisenberg group mod p.
For p = 2, both the semi-direct products mentioned above are isomorphic to the dihedral group Dih4 of order 8. The other non-abelian group of order 8 is the quaternion group Q8.
Prevalence[edit]

The number of isomorphism classes of groups of order pn grows as

{\displaystyle p^{{\frac {2}{27}}n^{3}+O(n^{8/3})}}

For instance, of the 49 910 529 484 different groups of order at most 2000, 49 487 365 422, or just over 99%, are 2-groups of order 1024.[9]

Every finite group whose order is divisible by p contains a subgroup which is a non-trivial p-group, namely a cyclic group of order p generated by an element of order p obtained from Cauchy's theorem. In fact, it contains a p-group of maximal possible order: if

 called a Sylow p-subgroup. This subgroup need not be unique, but any subgroups of this order are conjugate, and any p-subgroup of G is contained in a Sylow p-subgroup. This and other properties are proved in the Sylow theorems.
Application to structure of a group[edit]
p-groups are fundamental tools in understanding the structure of groups and in the classification of finite simple groups. p-groups arise both as subgroups and as quotient groups.

Brauer classified all groups whose Sylow 2-subgroups are the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 4, and Walter, Gorenstein, Bender, Suzuki, Glauberman, and others classified those simple groups whose Sylow 2-subgroups were abelian, dihedral, semidihedral, or quaternion.

The symmetry group of a snowflake is D6, a dihedral symmetry, the same as for a regular hexagon.


In mathematics, a dihedral group is the group of symmetries of a regular polygon,[1][2] which includes rotations and reflections. Dihedral groups are among the simplest examples of finite groups, and they play an important role in group theory, geometry, and chemistry.
The notation for the dihedral group of order n differs in geometry and abstract algebra. In geometry, Dn or Dihn refers to the symmetries of the n-gon, a group of order 2n. In abstract algebra, Dn refers to the dihedral group of order n.[3] The geometric convention is used in this article.

The six axes of reflection of a regular hexagon


A regular polygon with

{\displaystyle n}

 sides has

{\displaystyle 2n}

 different symmetries: 



n


{\displaystyle n}

 rotational symmetries and 



n


{\displaystyle n}

 reflection symmetries. Usually, we take 



n


{\displaystyle n}

≥3 here.The associated rotations and reflections make up the dihedral group 




D

n




{\displaystyle D_{n}}

 . If 



n


{\displaystyle n}

 is odd, each axis of symmetry connects the midpoint of one side to the opposite vertex. If 



n


{\displaystyle n}

 is even, there are n/2 axes of symmetry connecting the midpoints of opposite sides and 



n

/

2


{\displaystyle n/2}

 axes of symmetry connecting opposite vertices. In either case, there are 



n


{\displaystyle n}

 axes of symmetry and

n


{\displaystyle 2n}

 elements in the symmetry group. Reflecting in one axis of symmetry followed by reflecting in another axis of symmetry produces a rotation through twice the angle between the axes.
The following picture shows the effect of the sixteen elements of 




D

{\displaystyle D_{8}}

 on a stop sign:

The first row shows the effect of the eight rotations, and the second row shows the effect of the eight reflections, in each case acting on the stop sign with the orientation as shown at the top left.
Group structure[edit]
As with any geometric object, the composition of two symmetries of a regular polygon is again a symmetry of this object. With composition of symmetries to produce another as the binary operation, this gives the symmetries of a polygon the algebraic structure of a finite group.











The composition of these two reflections is a rotation.


The following Cayley table shows the effect of composition in the group D3 (the symmetries of an equilateral triangle). r0 denotes the identity; r1 and r2 denote counterclockwise rotations by 120° and 240° respectively, and s0, s1 and s2 denote reflections across the three lines shown in the adjacent picture.

For example, s2s1 = r1, because the reflection s1 followed by the reflection s2 results in a rotation of 120°. The order of elements denoting the composition is right to left, reflecting the convention that the element acts on the expression to its right. The composition operation is not commutative.
In general, the group Dn has elements r0, …, rn−1 and s0, …, sn−1, with composition given by the following formulae:

In all cases, addition and subtraction of subscripts are to be performed using modular arithmetic with modulus n.
Matrix representation[edit]




The symmetries of this pentagon are linear transformations of the plane as a vector space.


If we center the regular polygon at the origin, then elements of the dihedral group act as linear transformations of the plane. This lets us represent elements of Dn as matrices, with composition being matrix multiplication. This is an example of a (2-dimensional) group representation.
For example, the elements of the group D4 can be represented by the following eight matrices:

rk is a rotation matrix, expressing a counterclockwise rotation through an angle of 2πk/n. sk is a reflection across a line that makes an angle of πk/n with the x-axis.

From the second presentation follows that Dn belongs to the class of Coxeter groups.
The semidirect product of cyclic groups Zn and Z2, with Z2 acting on Zn by inversion (thus, Dn always has a normal subgroup isomorphic to the group Zn). Zn ⋊φ Z2 is isomorphic to Dn if φ(0) is the identity and φ(1) is inversion.


Small dihedral groups[edit]




Example subgroups from a hexagonal dihedral symmetry


D1 is isomorphic to Z2, the cyclic group of order 2.
D2 is isomorphic to K4, the Klein four-group.
D1 and D2 are exceptional in that:

D1 and D2 are the only abelian dihedral groups. Otherwise, Dn is non-abelian.
Dn is a subgroup of the symmetric group Sn for n ≥ 3. Since 2n > n! for n = 1 or n = 2, for these values, Dn is too large to be a subgroup.
The inner automorphism group of D2 is trivial, whereas for other even values of n, this is Dn / Z2.

The cycle graphs of dihedral groups consist of an n-element cycle and n 2-element cycles. The dark vertex in the cycle graphs below of various dihedral groups represents the identity element, and the other vertices are the other elements of the group. A cycle consists of successive powers of either of the elements connected to the identity element.

The dihedral group as symmetry group in 2D and rotation group in 3D[edit]
An example of abstract group Dn, and a common way to visualize it, is the group of Euclidean plane isometries which keep the origin fixed. These groups form one of the two series of discrete point groups in two dimensions. Dn consists of n rotations of multiples of 360°/n about the origin, and reflections across n lines through the origin, making angles of multiples of 180°/n with each other. This is the symmetry group of a regular polygon with n sides (for n ≥ 3; this extends to the cases n = 1 and n = 2 where we have a plane with respectively a point offset from the "center" of the "1-gon" and a "2-gon" or line segment).
Dn is generated by a rotation r of order n and a reflection s of order 2 such that

(Compare coordinate rotations and reflections.)
The dihedral group D2 is generated by the rotation r of 180 degrees, and the reflection s across the x-axis. The elements of D2 can then be represented as {e, r, s, rs}, where e is the identity or null transformation and rs is the reflection across the y-axis.




The four elements of D2 (x-axis is vertical here)


D2 is isomorphic to the Klein four-group.
For n>2 the operations of rotation and reflection in general do not commute and Dn is not abelian; for example, in D4, a rotation of 90 degrees followed by a reflection yields a different result from a reflection followed by a rotation of 90 degrees.




D4 is nonabelian (x-axis is vertical here).


Thus, beyond their obvious application to problems of symmetry in the plane, these groups are among the simplest examples of non-abelian groups, and as such arise frequently as easy counterexamples to theorems which are restricted to abelian groups.
The 2n elements of Dn can be written as e, r, r2, … , rn−1, s, r s, r2s, … , rn−1s. The first n listed elements are rotations and the remaining n elements are axis-reflections (all of which have order 2). The product of two rotations or two reflections is a rotation; the product of a rotation and a reflection is a reflection.
So far, we have considered Dn to be a subgroup of O(2), i.e. the group of rotations (about the origin) and reflections (across axes through the origin) of the plane. However, notation Dn is also used for a subgroup of SO(3) which is also of abstract group type Dn: the proper symmetry group of a regular polygon embedded in three-dimensional space (if n ≥ 3). Such a figure may be considered as a degenerate regular solid with its face counted twice. Therefore, it is also called a dihedron (Greek: solid with two faces), which explains the name dihedral group (in analogy to tetrahedral, octahedral and icosahedral group, referring to the proper symmetry groups of a regular tetrahedron, octahedron, and icosahedron respectively).
Examples of 2D dihedral symmetry[edit]

Properties[edit]
The properties of the dihedral groups Dn with n ≥ 3 depend on whether n is even or odd. For example, the center of Dn consists only of the identity if n is odd, but if n is even the center has two elements, namely the identity and the element rn/2 (with Dn as a subgroup of O(2), this is inversion; since it is scalar multiplication by −1, it is clear that it commutes with any linear transformation).
In the case of 2D isometries, this corresponds to adding inversion, giving rotations and mirrors in between the existing ones.
For n twice an odd number, the abstract group Dn is isomorphic with the direct product of Dn / 2 and Z2. Generally, if m divides n, then Dn has n/m subgroups of type Dm, and one subgroup ℤm. Therefore, the total number of subgroups of Dn (n ≥ 1), is equal to d(n) + σ(n), where d(n) is the number of positive divisors of n and σ(n) is the sum of the positive divisors of n. See list of small groups for the cases n ≤ 8.
The dihedral group of order 8 (D4) is the smallest example of a group that is not a T-group. Any of its two Klein four-group subgroups (which are normal in D4) has as normal subgroup order-2 subgroups generated by a reflection (flip) in D4, but these subgroups are not normal in D4.
Conjugacy classes of reflections[edit]
All the reflections are conjugate to each other in case n is odd, but they fall into two conjugacy classes if n is even. If we think of the isometries of a regular n-gon: for odd n there are rotations in the group between every pair of mirrors, while for even n only half of the mirrors can be reached from one by these rotations. Geometrically, in an odd polygon every axis of symmetry passes through a vertex and a side, while in an even polygon there are two sets of axes, each corresponding to a conjugacy class: those that pass through two vertices and those that pass through two sides.
Algebraically, this is an instance of the conjugate Sylow theorem (for n odd): for n odd, each reflection, together with the identity, form a subgroup of order 2, which is a Sylow 2-subgroup (2 = 21 is the maximum power of 2 dividing 2n = 2[2k + 1]), while for n even, these order 2 subgroups are not Sylow subgroups because 4 (a higher power of 2) divides the order of the group.
For n even there is instead an outer automorphism interchanging the two types of reflections (properly, a class of outer automorphisms, which are all conjugate by an inner automorphism).
Automorphism group[edit]
The automorphism group of Dn is isomorphic to the holomorph of ℤ/nℤ, i.e., to Hol(ℤ/nℤ) = {ax + b | (a, n) = 1} and has order nϕ(n), where ϕ is Euler's totient function, the number of k in 1, …, n − 1 coprime to n.
It can be understood in terms of the generators of a reflection and an elementary rotation (rotation by k(2π/n), for k coprime to n); which automorphisms are inner and outer depends on the parity of n.

For n odd, the dihedral group is centerless, so any element defines a non-trivial inner automorphism; for n even, the rotation by 180° (reflection through the origin) is the non-trivial element of the center.
Thus for n odd, the inner automorphism group has order 2n, and for n even (other than n = 2) the inner automorphism group has order n.
For n odd, all reflections are conjugate; for n even, they fall into two classes (those through two vertices and those through two faces), related by an outer automorphism, which can be represented by rotation by π/n (half the minimal rotation).
The rotations are a normal subgroup; conjugation by a reflection changes the sign (direction) of the rotation, but otherwise leaves them unchanged. Thus automorphisms that multiply angles by k (coprime to n) are outer unless k = ±1.

Examples of automorphism groups[edit]
D9 has 18 inner automorphisms. As 2D isometry group D9, the group has mirrors at 20° intervals. The 18 inner automorphisms provide rotation of the mirrors by multiples of 20°, and reflections. As isometry group these are all automorphisms. As abstract group there are in addition to these, 36 outer automorphisms; e.g., multiplying angles of rotation by 2.
D10 has 10 inner automorphisms. As 2D isometry group D10, the group has mirrors at 18° intervals. The 10 inner automorphisms provide rotation of the mirrors by multiples of 36°, and reflections. As isometry group there are 10 more automorphisms; they are conjugates by isometries outside the group, rotating the mirrors 18° with respect to the inner automorphisms. As abstract group there are in addition to these 10 inner and 10 outer automorphisms, 20 more outer automorphisms; e.g., multiplying rotations by 3.
Compare the values 6 and 4 for Euler's totient function, the multiplicative group of integers modulo n for n = 9 and 10, respectively. This triples and doubles the number of automorphisms compared with the two automorphisms as isometries (keeping the order of the rotations the same or reversing the order).
The only values of n for which φ(n) = 2 are 3, 4, and 6, and consequently, there are only three dihedral groups that are isomorphic to their own automorphism groups, namely D3 (order 6), D4 (order 8), and D6 (order 12).[4][5][6]
Inner automorphism group[edit]
The inner automorphism group of Dn is isomorphic to:[7]

Dn if n is odd;
Trivial if n = 2;
Dn / Z2 if n is even and n > 2.

Generalizations[edit]
There are several important generalizations of the dihedral groups:

The infinite dihedral group is an infinite group with algebraic structure similar to the finite dihedral groups. It can be viewed as the group of symmetries of the integers.
The orthogonal group O(2), i.e. the symmetry group of the circle, also has similar properties to the dihedral groups.
The family of generalized dihedral groups includes both of the examples above, as well as many other groups.
The quasidihedral groups are family of finite groups with similar properties to the dihedral groups.

The symmetry group of a snowflake is D6, a dihedral symmetry, the same as for a regular hexagon.


In mathematics, a dihedral group is the group of symmetries of a regular polygon,[1][2] which includes rotations and reflections. Dihedral groups are among the simplest examples of finite groups, and they play an important role in group theory, geometry, and chemistry.
The notation for the dihedral group of order n differs in geometry and abstract algebra. In geometry, Dn or Dihn refers to the symmetries of the n-gon, a group of order 2n. In abstract algebra, Dn refers to the dihedral group of order n.[3] The geometric convention is used in this article.

Group structure[edit]
As with any geometric object, the composition of two symmetries of a regular polygon is again a symmetry of this object. With composition of symmetries to produce another as the binary operation, this gives the symmetries of a polygon the algebraic structure of a finite group.











The composition of these two reflections is a rotation.


The following Cayley table shows the effect of composition in the group D3 (the symmetries of an equilateral triangle). r0 denotes the identity; r1 and r2 denote counterclockwise rotations by 120° and 240° respectively, and s0, s1 and s2 denote reflections across the three lines shown in the adjacent picture.

For example, s2s1 = r1, because the reflection s1 followed by the reflection s2 results in a rotation of 120°. The order of elements denoting the composition is right to left, reflecting the convention that the element acts on the expression to its right. The composition operation is not commutative.
In general, the group Dn has elements r0, …, rn−1 and s0, …, sn−1, with composition given by the following formulae:

In all cases, addition and subtraction of subscripts are to be performed using modular arithmetic with modulus n.
Matrix representation[edit]




The symmetries of this pentagon are linear transformations of the plane as a vector space.


If we center the regular polygon at the origin, then elements of the dihedral group act as linear transformations of the plane. This lets us represent elements of Dn as matrices, with composition being matrix multiplication. This is an example of a (2-dimensional) group representation.
For example, the elements of the group D4 can be represented by the following eight matrices:

rk is a rotation matrix, expressing a counterclockwise rotation through an angle of 2πk/n. sk is a reflection across a line that makes an angle of πk/n with the x-axis.

From the second presentation follows that Dn belongs to the class of Coxeter groups.
The semidirect product of cyclic groups Zn and Z2, with Z2 acting on Zn by inversion (thus, Dn always has a normal subgroup isomorphic to the group Zn). Zn ⋊φ Z2 is isomorphic to Dn if φ(0) is the identity and φ(1) is inversion.


Small dihedral groups[edit]




Example subgroups from a hexagonal dihedral symmetry


D1 is isomorphic to Z2, the cyclic group of order 2.
D2 is isomorphic to K4, the Klein four-group.
D1 and D2 are exceptional in that:

D1 and D2 are the only abelian dihedral groups. Otherwise, Dn is non-abelian.
Dn is a subgroup of the symmetric group Sn for n ≥ 3. Since 2n > n! for n = 1 or n = 2, for these values, Dn is too large to be a subgroup.
The inner automorphism group of D2 is trivial, whereas for other even values of n, this is Dn / Z2.

The cycle graphs of dihedral groups consist of an n-element cycle and n 2-element cycles. The dark vertex in the cycle graphs below of various dihedral groups represents the identity element, and the other vertices are the other elements of the group. A cycle consists of successive powers of either of the elements connected to the identity element.

The dihedral group as symmetry group in 2D and rotation group in 3D[edit]
An example of abstract group Dn, and a common way to visualize it, is the group of Euclidean plane isometries which keep the origin fixed. These groups form one of the two series of discrete point groups in two dimensions. Dn consists of n rotations of multiples of 360°/n about the origin, and reflections across n lines through the origin, making angles of multiples of 180°/n with each other. This is the symmetry group of a regular polygon with n sides (for n ≥ 3; this extends to the cases n = 1 and n = 2 where we have a plane with respectively a point offset from the "center" of the "1-gon" and a "2-gon" or line segment).
Dn is generated by a rotation r of order n and a reflection s of order 2 such that

(Compare coordinate rotations and reflections.)
The dihedral group D2 is generated by the rotation r of 180 degrees, and the reflection s across the x-axis. The elements of D2 can then be represented as {e, r, s, rs}, where e is the identity or null transformation and rs is the reflection across the y-axis.




The four elements of D2 (x-axis is vertical here)


D2 is isomorphic to the Klein four-group.
For n>2 the operations of rotation and reflection in general do not commute and Dn is not abelian; for example, in D4, a rotation of 90 degrees followed by a reflection yields a different result from a reflection followed by a rotation of 90 degrees.




D4 is nonabelian (x-axis is vertical here).


Thus, beyond their obvious application to problems of symmetry in the plane, these groups are among the simplest examples of non-abelian groups, and as such arise frequently as easy counterexamples to theorems which are restricted to abelian groups.
The 2n elements of Dn can be written as e, r, r2, … , rn−1, s, r s, r2s, … , rn−1s. The first n listed elements are rotations and the remaining n elements are axis-reflections (all of which have order 2). The product of two rotations or two reflections is a rotation; the product of a rotation and a reflection is a reflection.
So far, we have considered Dn to be a subgroup of O(2), i.e. the group of rotations (about the origin) and reflections (across axes through the origin) of the plane. However, notation Dn is also used for a subgroup of SO(3) which is also of abstract group type Dn: the proper symmetry group of a regular polygon embedded in three-dimensional space (if n ≥ 3). Such a figure may be considered as a degenerate regular solid with its face counted twice. Therefore, it is also called a dihedron (Greek: solid with two faces), which explains the name dihedral group (in analogy to tetrahedral, octahedral and icosahedral group, referring to the proper symmetry groups of a regular tetrahedron, octahedron, and icosahedron respectively).
Examples of 2D dihedral symmetry[edit]

Properties[edit]
The properties of the dihedral groups Dn with n ≥ 3 depend on whether n is even or odd. For example, the center of Dn consists only of the identity if n is odd, but if n is even the center has two elements, namely the identity and the element rn/2 (with Dn as a subgroup of O(2), this is inversion; since it is scalar multiplication by −1, it is clear that it commutes with any linear transformation).
In the case of 2D isometries, this corresponds to adding inversion, giving rotations and mirrors in between the existing ones.
For n twice an odd number, the abstract group Dn is isomorphic with the direct product of Dn / 2 and Z2. Generally, if m divides n, then Dn has n/m subgroups of type Dm, and one subgroup ℤm. Therefore, the total number of subgroups of Dn (n ≥ 1), is equal to d(n) + σ(n), where d(n) is the number of positive divisors of n and σ(n) is the sum of the positive divisors of n. See list of small groups for the cases n ≤ 8.
The dihedral group of order 8 (D4) is the smallest example of a group that is not a T-group. Any of its two Klein four-group subgroups (which are normal in D4) has as normal subgroup order-2 subgroups generated by a reflection (flip) in D4, but these subgroups are not normal in D4.
Conjugacy classes of reflections[edit]
All the reflections are conjugate to each other in case n is odd, but they fall into two conjugacy classes if n is even. If we think of the isometries of a regular n-gon: for odd n there are rotations in the group between every pair of mirrors, while for even n only half of the mirrors can be reached from one by these rotations. Geometrically, in an odd polygon every axis of symmetry passes through a vertex and a side, while in an even polygon there are two sets of axes, each corresponding to a conjugacy class: those that pass through two vertices and those that pass through two sides.
Algebraically, this is an instance of the conjugate Sylow theorem (for n odd): for n odd, each reflection, together with the identity, form a subgroup of order 2, which is a Sylow 2-subgroup (2 = 21 is the maximum power of 2 dividing 2n = 2[2k + 1]), while for n even, these order 2 subgroups are not Sylow subgroups because 4 (a higher power of 2) divides the order of the group.
For n even there is instead an outer automorphism interchanging the two types of reflections (properly, a class of outer automorphisms, which are all conjugate by an inner automorphism).
Automorphism group[edit]
The automorphism group of Dn is isomorphic to the holomorph of ℤ/nℤ, i.e., to Hol(ℤ/nℤ) = {ax + b | (a, n) = 1} and has order nϕ(n), where ϕ is Euler's totient function, the number of k in 1, …, n − 1 coprime to n.
It can be understood in terms of the generators of a reflection and an elementary rotation (rotation by k(2π/n), for k coprime to n); which automorphisms are inner and outer depends on the parity of n.

For n odd, the dihedral group is centerless, so any element defines a non-trivial inner automorphism; for n even, the rotation by 180° (reflection through the origin) is the non-trivial element of the center.
Thus for n odd, the inner automorphism group has order 2n, and for n even (other than n = 2) the inner automorphism group has order n.
For n odd, all reflections are conjugate; for n even, they fall into two classes (those through two vertices and those through two faces), related by an outer automorphism, which can be represented by rotation by π/n (half the minimal rotation).
The rotations are a normal subgroup; conjugation by a reflection changes the sign (direction) of the rotation, but otherwise leaves them unchanged. Thus automorphisms that multiply angles by k (coprime to n) are outer unless k = ±1.

Examples of automorphism groups[edit]
D9 has 18 inner automorphisms. As 2D isometry group D9, the group has mirrors at 20° intervals. The 18 inner automorphisms provide rotation of the mirrors by multiples of 20°, and reflections. As isometry group these are all automorphisms. As abstract group there are in addition to these, 36 outer automorphisms; e.g., multiplying angles of rotation by 2.
D10 has 10 inner automorphisms. As 2D isometry group D10, the group has mirrors at 18° intervals. The 10 inner automorphisms provide rotation of the mirrors by multiples of 36°, and reflections. As isometry group there are 10 more automorphisms; they are conjugates by isometries outside the group, rotating the mirrors 18° with respect to the inner automorphisms. As abstract group there are in addition to these 10 inner and 10 outer automorphisms, 20 more outer automorphisms; e.g., multiplying rotations by 3.
Compare the values 6 and 4 for Euler's totient function, the multiplicative group of integers modulo n for n = 9 and 10, respectively. This triples and doubles the number of automorphisms compared with the two automorphisms as isometries (keeping the order of the rotations the same or reversing the order).
The only values of n for which φ(n) = 2 are 3, 4, and 6, and consequently, there are only three dihedral groups that are isomorphic to their own automorphism groups, namely D3 (order 6), D4 (order 8), and D6 (order 12).[4][5][6]
Inner automorphism group[edit]
The inner automorphism group of Dn is isomorphic to:[7]

Dn if n is odd;
Trivial if n = 2;
Dn / Z2 if n is even and n > 2.

Generalizations[edit]
There are several important generalizations of the dihedral groups:

The infinite dihedral group is an infinite group with algebraic structure similar to the finite dihedral groups. It can be viewed as the group of symmetries of the integers.
The orthogonal group O(2), i.e. the symmetry group of the circle, also has similar properties to the dihedral groups.
The family of generalized dihedral groups includes both of the examples above, as well as many other groups.
The quasidihedral groups are family of finite groups with similar properties to the dihedral groups.

The symmetry group of a snowflake is D6, a dihedral symmetry, the same as for a regular hexagon.


In mathematics, a dihedral group is the group of symmetries of a regular polygon,[1][2] which includes rotations and reflections. Dihedral groups are among the simplest examples of finite groups, and they play an important role in group theory, geometry, and chemistry.
The notation for the dihedral group of order n differs in geometry and abstract algebra. In geometry, Dn or Dihn refers to the symmetries of the n-gon, a group of order 2n. In abstract algebra, Dn refers to the dihedral group of order n.[3] The geometric convention is used in this article.

The six axes of reflection of a regular hexagon


A regular polygon with

{\displaystyle n}

{\displaystyle 2n}

 different symmetries: 



n


{\displaystyle n}

 rotational symmetries and 



n


{\displaystyle n}

 reflection symmetries. Usually, we take 



n


{\displaystyle n}

≥3 here.The associated rotations and reflections make up the dihedral group 




D

n




{\displaystyle D_{n}}

 . If 



n


{\displaystyle n}

 is odd, each axis of symmetry connects the midpoint of one side to the opposite vertex. If 



n


{\displaystyle n}

 is even, there are n/2 axes of symmetry connecting the midpoints of opposite sides and 



n

/

2


{\displaystyle n/2}

 axes of symmetry connecting opposite vertices. In either case, there are 



n


{\displaystyle n}

 axes of symmetry and 



2
n


{\displaystyle 2n}

 elements in the symmetry group. Reflecting in one axis of symmetry followed by reflecting in another axis of symmetry produces a rotation through twice the angle between the axes.
The following picture shows the effect of the sixteen elements of 




D

{\displaystyle D_{8}}

 on a stop sign:

The first row shows the effect of the eight rotations, and the second row shows the effect of the eight reflections, in each case acting on the stop sign with the orientation as shown at the top left.
Group structure[edit]
As with any geometric object, the composition of two symmetries of a regular polygon is again a symmetry of this object. With composition of symmetries to produce another as the binary operation, this gives the symmetries of a polygon the algebraic structure of a finite group.











The composition of these two reflections is a rotation.


The following Cayley table shows the effect of composition in the group D3 (the symmetries of an equilateral triangle). r0 denotes the identity; r1 and r2 denote counterclockwise rotations by 120° and 240° respectively, and s0, s1 and s2 denote reflections across the three lines shown in the adjacent picture.

For example, s2s1 = r1, because the reflection s1 followed by the reflection s2 results in a rotation of 120°. The order of elements denoting the composition is right to left, reflecting the convention that the element acts on the expression to its right. The composition operation is not commutative.
In general, the group Dn has elements r0, …, rn−1 and s0, …, sn−1, with composition given by the following formulae:

In all cases, addition and subtraction of subscripts are to be performed using modular arithmetic with modulus n.
Matrix representation[edit]




The symmetries of this pentagon are linear transformations of the plane as a vector space.


If we center the regular polygon at the origin, then elements of the dihedral group act as linear transformations of the plane. This lets us represent elements of Dn as matrices, with composition being matrix multiplication. This is an example of a (2-dimensional) group representation.
For example, the elements of the group D4 can be represented by the following eight matrices:

rk is a rotation matrix, expressing a counterclockwise rotation through an angle of 2πk/n. sk is a reflection across a line that makes an angle of πk/n with the x-axis.

From the second presentation follows that Dn belongs to the class of Coxeter groups.
The semidirect product of cyclic groups Zn and Z2, with Z2 acting on Zn by inversion (thus, Dn always has a normal subgroup isomorphic to the group Zn). Zn ⋊φ Z2 is isomorphic to Dn if φ(0) is the identity and φ(1) is inversion.


Small dihedral groups[edit]




Example subgroups from a hexagonal dihedral symmetry


D1 is isomorphic to Z2, the cyclic group of order 2.
D2 is isomorphic to K4, the Klein four-group.
D1 and D2 are exceptional in that:

D1 and D2 are the only abelian dihedral groups. Otherwise, Dn is non-abelian.
Dn is a subgroup of the symmetric group Sn for n ≥ 3. Since 2n > n! for n = 1 or n = 2, for these values, Dn is too large to be a subgroup.
The inner automorphism group of D2 is trivial, whereas for other even values of n, this is Dn / Z2.

The cycle graphs of dihedral groups consist of an n-element cycle and n 2-element cycles. The dark vertex in the cycle graphs below of various dihedral groups represents the identity element, and the other vertices are the other elements of the group. A cycle consists of successive powers of either of the elements connected to the identity element.

The dihedral group as symmetry group in 2D and rotation group in 3D[edit]
An example of abstract group Dn, and a common way to visualize it, is the group of Euclidean plane isometries which keep the origin fixed. These groups form one of the two series of discrete point groups in two dimensions. Dn consists of n rotations of multiples of 360°/n about the origin, and reflections across n lines through the origin, making angles of multiples of 180°/n with each other. This is the symmetry group of a regular polygon with n sides (for n ≥ 3; this extends to the cases n = 1 and n = 2 where we have a plane with respectively a point offset from the "center" of the "1-gon" and a "2-gon" or line segment).
Dn is generated by a rotation r of order n and a reflection s of order 2 such that

(Compare coordinate rotations and reflections.)
The dihedral group D2 is generated by the rotation r of 180 degrees, and the reflection s across the x-axis. The elements of D2 can then be represented as {e, r, s, rs}, where e is the identity or null transformation and rs is the reflection across the y-axis.




The four elements of D2 (x-axis is vertical here)


D2 is isomorphic to the Klein four-group.
For n>2 the operations of rotation and reflection in general do not commute and Dn is not abelian; for example, in D4, a rotation of 90 degrees followed by a reflection yields a different result from a reflection followed by a rotation of 90 degrees.




D4 is nonabelian (x-axis is vertical here).


Thus, beyond their obvious application to problems of symmetry in the plane, these groups are among the simplest examples of non-abelian groups, and as such arise frequently as easy counterexamples to theorems which are restricted to abelian groups.
The 2n elements of Dn can be written as e, r, r2, … , rn−1, s, r s, r2s, … , rn−1s. The first n listed elements are rotations and the remaining n elements are axis-reflections (all of which have order 2). The product of two rotations or two reflections is a rotation; the product of a rotation and a reflection is a reflection.
So far, we have considered Dn to be a subgroup of O(2), i.e. the group of rotations (about the origin) and reflections (across axes through the origin) of the plane. However, notation Dn is also used for a subgroup of SO(3) which is also of abstract group type Dn: the proper symmetry group of a regular polygon embedded in three-dimensional space (if n ≥ 3). Such a figure may be considered as a degenerate regular solid with its face counted twice. Therefore, it is also called a dihedron (Greek: solid with two faces), which explains the name dihedral group (in analogy to tetrahedral, octahedral and icosahedral group, referring to the proper symmetry groups of a regular tetrahedron, octahedron, and icosahedron respectively).
Examples of 2D dihedral symmetry[edit]

Properties[edit]
The properties of the dihedral groups Dn with n ≥ 3 depend on whether n is even or odd. For example, the center of Dn consists only of the identity if n is odd, but if n is even the center has two elements, namely the identity and the element rn/2 (with Dn as a subgroup of O(2), this is inversion; since it is scalar multiplication by −1, it is clear that it commutes with any linear transformation).
In the case of 2D isometries, this corresponds to adding inversion, giving rotations and mirrors in between the existing ones.
For n twice an odd number, the abstract group Dn is isomorphic with the direct product of Dn / 2 and Z2. Generally, if m divides n, then Dn has n/m subgroups of type Dm, and one subgroup ℤm. Therefore, the total number of subgroups of Dn (n ≥ 1), is equal to d(n) + σ(n), where d(n) is the number of positive divisors of n and σ(n) is the sum of the positive divisors of n. See list of small groups for the cases n ≤ 8.
The dihedral group of order 8 (D4) is the smallest example of a group that is not a T-group. Any of its two Klein four-group subgroups (which are normal in D4) has as normal subgroup order-2 subgroups generated by a reflection (flip) in D4, but these subgroups are not normal in D4.
Conjugacy classes of reflections[edit]
All the reflections are conjugate to each other in case n is odd, but they fall into two conjugacy classes if n is even. If we think of the isometries of a regular n-gon: for odd n there are rotations in the group between every pair of mirrors, while for even n only half of the mirrors can be reached from one by these rotations. Geometrically, in an odd polygon every axis of symmetry passes through a vertex and a side, while in an even polygon there are two sets of axes, each corresponding to a conjugacy class: those that pass through two vertices and those that pass through two sides.
Algebraically, this is an instance of the conjugate Sylow theorem (for n odd): for n odd, each reflection, together with the identity, form a subgroup of order 2, which is a Sylow 2-subgroup (2 = 21 is the maximum power of 2 dividing 2n = 2[2k + 1]), while for n even, these order 2 subgroups are not Sylow subgroups because 4 (a higher power of 2) divides the order of the group.
For n even there is instead an outer automorphism interchanging the two types of reflections (properly, a class of outer automorphisms, which are all conjugate by an inner automorphism).
Automorphism group[edit]
The automorphism group of Dn is isomorphic to the holomorph of ℤ/nℤ, i.e., to Hol(ℤ/nℤ) = {ax + b | (a, n) = 1} and has order nϕ(n), where ϕ is Euler's totient function, the number of k in 1, …, n − 1 coprime to n.
It can be understood in terms of the generators of a reflection and an elementary rotation (rotation by k(2π/n), for k coprime to n); which automorphisms are inner and outer depends on the parity of n.

For n odd, the dihedral group is centerless, so any element defines a non-trivial inner automorphism; for n even, the rotation by 180° (reflection through the origin) is the non-trivial element of the center.
Thus for n odd, the inner automorphism group has order 2n, and for n even (other than n = 2) the inner automorphism group has order n.
For n odd, all reflections are conjugate; for n even, they fall into two classes (those through two vertices and those through two faces), related by an outer automorphism, which can be represented by rotation by π/n (half the minimal rotation).
The rotations are a normal subgroup; conjugation by a reflection changes the sign (direction) of the rotation, but otherwise leaves them unchanged. Thus automorphisms that multiply angles by k (coprime to n) are outer unless k = ±1.

Examples of automorphism groups[edit]
D9 has 18 inner automorphisms. As 2D isometry group D9, the group has mirrors at 20° intervals. The 18 inner automorphisms provide rotation of the mirrors by multiples of 20°, and reflections. As isometry group these are all automorphisms. As abstract group there are in addition to these, 36 outer automorphisms; e.g., multiplying angles of rotation by 2.
D10 has 10 inner automorphisms. As 2D isometry group D10, the group has mirrors at 18° intervals. The 10 inner automorphisms provide rotation of the mirrors by multiples of 36°, and reflections. As isometry group there are 10 more automorphisms; they are conjugates by isometries outside the group, rotating the mirrors 18° with respect to the inner automorphisms. As abstract group there are in addition to these 10 inner and 10 outer automorphisms, 20 more outer automorphisms; e.g., multiplying rotations by 3.
Compare the values 6 and 4 for Euler's totient function, the multiplicative group of integers modulo n for n = 9 and 10, respectively. This triples and doubles the number of automorphisms compared with the two automorphisms as isometries (keeping the order of the rotations the same or reversing the order).
The only values of n for which φ(n) = 2 are 3, 4, and 6, and consequently, there are only three dihedral groups that are isomorphic to their own automorphism groups, namely D3 (order 6), D4 (order 8), and D6 (order 12).[4][5][6]
Inner automorphism group[edit]
The inner automorphism group of Dn is isomorphic to:[7]

Dn if n is odd;
Trivial if n = 2;
Dn / Z2 if n is even and n > 2.

Generalizations[edit]
There are several important generalizations of the dihedral groups:

The infinite dihedral group is an infinite group with algebraic structure similar to the finite dihedral groups. It can be viewed as the group of symmetries of the integers.
The orthogonal group O(2), i.e. the symmetry group of the circle, also has similar properties to the dihedral groups.
The family of generalized dihedral groups includes both of the examples above, as well as many other groups.
The quasidihedral groups are family of finite groups with similar properties to the dihedral groups.

The symmetry group of a snowflake is D6, a dihedral symmetry, the same as for a regular hexagon.


In mathematics, a dihedral group is the group of symmetries of a regular polygon,[1][2] which includes rotations and reflections. Dihedral groups are among the simplest examples of finite groups, and they play an important role in group theory, geometry, and chemistry.
The notation for the dihedral group of order n differs in geometry and abstract algebra. In geometry, Dn or Dihn refers to the symmetries of the n-gon, a group of order 2n. In abstract algebra, Dn refers to the dihedral group of order n.[3] The geometric convention is used in this article.

The six axes of reflection of a regular hexagon


A regular polygon with

{\displaystyle n}

{\displaystyle 2n}

 different symmetries: 



n


{\displaystyle n}

 rotational symmetries and 



n


{\displaystyle n}

 reflection symmetries. Usually, we take 



n


{\displaystyle n}

≥3 here.The associated rotations and reflections make up the dihedral group 




D

n




{\displaystyle D_{n}}

 . If 



n


{\displaystyle n}

 is odd, each axis of symmetry connects the midpoint of one side to the opposite vertex. If 



n


{\displaystyle n}

 is even, there are n/2 axes of symmetry connecting the midpoints of opposite sides and 



n

/

2


{\displaystyle n/2}

 axes of symmetry connecting opposite vertices. In either case, there are 



n


{\displaystyle n}

 axes of symmetry and 



2
n


{\displaystyle 2n}

 elements in the symmetry group. Reflecting in one axis of symmetry followed by reflecting in another axis of symmetry produces a rotation through twice the angle between the axes.
The following picture shows the effect of the sixteen elements of 




D

{\displaystyle D_{8}}

 on a stop sign:

The first row shows the effect of the eight rotations, and the second row shows the effect of the eight reflections, in each case acting on the stop sign with the orientation as shown at the top left.
Group structure[edit]
As with any geometric object, the composition of two symmetries of a regular polygon is again a symmetry of this object. With composition of symmetries to produce another as the binary operation, this gives the symmetries of a polygon the algebraic structure of a finite group.











The composition of these two reflections is a rotation.


The following Cayley table shows the effect of composition in the group D3 (the symmetries of an equilateral triangle). r0 denotes the identity; r1 and r2 denote counterclockwise rotations by 120° and 240° respectively, and s0, s1 and s2 denote reflections across the three lines shown in the adjacent picture.

For example, s2s1 = r1, because the reflection s1 followed by the reflection s2 results in a rotation of 120°. The order of elements denoting the composition is right to left, reflecting the convention that the element acts on the expression to its right. The composition operation is not commutative.
In general, the group Dn has elements r0, …, rn−1 and s0, …, sn−1, with composition given by the following formulae:

In all cases, addition and subtraction of subscripts are to be performed using modular arithmetic with modulus n.
Matrix representation[edit]




The symmetries of this pentagon are linear transformations of the plane as a vector space.


If we center the regular polygon at the origin, then elements of the dihedral group act as linear transformations of the plane. This lets us represent elements of Dn as matrices, with composition being matrix multiplication. This is an example of a (2-dimensional) group representation.
For example, the elements of the group D4 can be represented by the following eight matrices:

rk is a rotation matrix, expressing a counterclockwise rotation through an angle of 2πk/n. sk is a reflection across a line that makes an angle of πk/n with the x-axis.

From the second presentation follows that Dn belongs to the class of Coxeter groups.
The semidirect product of cyclic groups Zn and Z2, with Z2 acting on Zn by inversion (thus, Dn always has a normal subgroup isomorphic to the group Zn). Zn ⋊φ Z2 is isomorphic to Dn if φ(0) is the identity and φ(1) is inversion.


Small dihedral groups[edit]




Example subgroups from a hexagonal dihedral symmetry


D1 is isomorphic to Z2, the cyclic group of order 2.
D2 is isomorphic to K4, the Klein four-group.
D1 and D2 are exceptional in that:

D1 and D2 are the only abelian dihedral groups. Otherwise, Dn is non-abelian.
Dn is a subgroup of the symmetric group Sn for n ≥ 3. Since 2n > n! for n = 1 or n = 2, for these values, Dn is too large to be a subgroup.
The inner automorphism group of D2 is trivial, whereas for other even values of n, this is Dn / Z2.

The cycle graphs of dihedral groups consist of an n-element cycle and n 2-element cycles. The dark vertex in the cycle graphs below of various dihedral groups represents the identity element, and the other vertices are the other elements of the group. A cycle consists of successive powers of either of the elements connected to the identity element.

The dihedral group as symmetry group in 2D and rotation group in 3D[edit]
An example of abstract group Dn, and a common way to visualize it, is the group of Euclidean plane isometries which keep the origin fixed. These groups form one of the two series of discrete point groups in two dimensions. Dn consists of n rotations of multiples of 360°/n about the origin, and reflections across n lines through the origin, making angles of multiples of 180°/n with each other. This is the symmetry group of a regular polygon with n sides (for n ≥ 3; this extends to the cases n = 1 and n = 2 where we have a plane with respectively a point offset from the "center" of the "1-gon" and a "2-gon" or line segment).
Dn is generated by a rotation r of order n and a reflection s of order 2 such that

(Compare coordinate rotations and reflections.)
The dihedral group D2 is generated by the rotation r of 180 degrees, and the reflection s across the x-axis. The elements of D2 can then be represented as {e, r, s, rs}, where e is the identity or null transformation and rs is the reflection across the y-axis.




The four elements of D2 (x-axis is vertical here)


D2 is isomorphic to the Klein four-group.
For n>2 the operations of rotation and reflection in general do not commute and Dn is not abelian; for example, in D4, a rotation of 90 degrees followed by a reflection yields a different result from a reflection followed by a rotation of 90 degrees.




D4 is nonabelian (x-axis is vertical here).


Thus, beyond their obvious application to problems of symmetry in the plane, these groups are among the simplest examples of non-abelian groups, and as such arise frequently as easy counterexamples to theorems which are restricted to abelian groups.
The 2n elements of Dn can be written as e, r, r2, … , rn−1, s, r s, r2s, … , rn−1s. The first n listed elements are rotations and the remaining n elements are axis-reflections (all of which have order 2). The product of two rotations or two reflections is a rotation; the product of a rotation and a reflection is a reflection.
So far, we have considered Dn to be a subgroup of O(2), i.e. the group of rotations (about the origin) and reflections (across axes through the origin) of the plane. However, notation Dn is also used for a subgroup of SO(3) which is also of abstract group type Dn: the proper symmetry group of a regular polygon embedded in three-dimensional space (if n ≥ 3). Such a figure may be considered as a degenerate regular solid with its face counted twice. Therefore, it is also called a dihedron (Greek: solid with two faces), which explains the name dihedral group (in analogy to tetrahedral, octahedral and icosahedral group, referring to the proper symmetry groups of a regular tetrahedron, octahedron, and icosahedron respectively).
Examples of 2D dihedral symmetry[edit]

2D D24 symmetry – Ashoka Chakra, as depicted on the National flag of the Republic of India.




Properties[edit]
The properties of the dihedral groups Dn with n ≥ 3 depend on whether n is even or odd. For example, the center of Dn consists only of the identity if n is odd, but if n is even the center has two elements, namely the identity and the element rn/2 (with Dn as a subgroup of O(2), this is inversion; since it is scalar multiplication by −1, it is clear that it commutes with any linear transformation).
In the case of 2D isometries, this corresponds to adding inversion, giving rotations and mirrors in between the existing ones.
For n twice an odd number, the abstract group Dn is isomorphic with the direct product of Dn / 2 and Z2. Generally, if m divides n, then Dn has n/m subgroups of type Dm, and one subgroup ℤm. Therefore, the total number of subgroups of Dn (n ≥ 1), is equal to d(n) + σ(n), where d(n) is the number of positive divisors of n and σ(n) is the sum of the positive divisors of n. See list of small groups for the cases n ≤ 8.
The dihedral group of order 8 (D4) is the smallest example of a group that is not a T-group. Any of its two Klein four-group subgroups (which are normal in D4) has as normal subgroup order-2 subgroups generated by a reflection (flip) in D4, but these subgroups are not normal in D4.
Conjugacy classes of reflections[edit]
All the reflections are conjugate to each other in case n is odd, but they fall into two conjugacy classes if n is even. If we think of the isometries of a regular n-gon: for odd n there are rotations in the group between every pair of mirrors, while for even n only half of the mirrors can be reached from one by these rotations. Geometrically, in an odd polygon every axis of symmetry passes through a vertex and a side, while in an even polygon there are two sets of axes, each corresponding to a conjugacy class: those that pass through two vertices and those that pass through two sides.
Algebraically, this is an instance of the conjugate Sylow theorem (for n odd): for n odd, each reflection, together with the identity, form a subgroup of order 2, which is a Sylow 2-subgroup (2 = 21 is the maximum power of 2 dividing 2n = 2[2k + 1]), while for n even, these order 2 subgroups are not Sylow subgroups because 4 (a higher power of 2) divides the order of the group.
For n even there is instead an outer automorphism interchanging the two types of reflections (properly, a class of outer automorphisms, which are all conjugate by an inner automorphism).
Automorphism group[edit]
The automorphism group of Dn is isomorphic to the holomorph of ℤ/nℤ, i.e., to Hol(ℤ/nℤ) = {ax + b | (a, n) = 1} and has order nϕ(n), where ϕ is Euler's totient function, the number of k in 1, …, n − 1 coprime to n.
It can be understood in terms of the generators of a reflection and an elementary rotation (rotation by k(2π/n), for k coprime to n); which automorphisms are inner and outer depends on the parity of n.

For n odd, the dihedral group is centerless, so any element defines a non-trivial inner automorphism; for n even, the rotation by 180° (reflection through the origin) is the non-trivial element of the center.
Thus for n odd, the inner automorphism group has order 2n, and for n even (other than n = 2) the inner automorphism group has order n.
For n odd, all reflections are conjugate; for n even, they fall into two classes (those through two vertices and those through two faces), related by an outer automorphism, which can be represented by rotation by π/n (half the minimal rotation).
The rotations are a normal subgroup; conjugation by a reflection changes the sign (direction) of the rotation, but otherwise leaves them unchanged. Thus automorphisms that multiply angles by k (coprime to n) are outer unless k = ±1.

Examples of automorphism groups[edit]
D9 has 18 inner automorphisms. As 2D isometry group D9, the group has mirrors at 20° intervals. The 18 inner automorphisms provide rotation of the mirrors by multiples of 20°, and reflections. As isometry group these are all automorphisms. As abstract group there are in addition to these, 36 outer automorphisms; e.g., multiplying angles of rotation by 2.
D10 has 10 inner automorphisms. As 2D isometry group D10, the group has mirrors at 18° intervals. The 10 inner automorphisms provide rotation of the mirrors by multiples of 36°, and reflections. As isometry group there are 10 more automorphisms; they are conjugates by isometries outside the group, rotating the mirrors 18° with respect to the inner automorphisms. As abstract group there are in addition to these 10 inner and 10 outer automorphisms, 20 more outer automorphisms; e.g., multiplying rotations by 3.
Compare the values 6 and 4 for Euler's totient function, the multiplicative group of integers modulo n for n = 9 and 10, respectively. This triples and doubles the number of automorphisms compared with the two automorphisms as isometries (keeping the order of the rotations the same or reversing the order).
The only values of n for which φ(n) = 2 are 3, 4, and 6, and consequently, there are only three dihedral groups that are isomorphic to their own automorphism groups, namely D3 (order 6), D4 (order 8), and D6 (order 12).[4][5][6]
Inner automorphism group[edit]
The inner automorphism group of Dn is isomorphic to:[7]

Dn if n is odd;
Trivial if n = 2;
Dn / Z2 if n is even and n > 2.

Generalizations[edit]
There are several important generalizations of the dihedral groups:

The infinite dihedral group is an infinite group with algebraic structure similar to the finite dihedral groups. It can be viewed as the group of symmetries of the integers.
The orthogonal group O(2), i.e. the symmetry group of the circle, also has similar properties to the dihedral groups.
The family of generalized dihedral groups includes both of the examples above, as well as many other groups.
The quasidihedral groups are family of finite groups with similar properties to the dihedral groups.

The symmetry group of a snowflake is D6, a dihedral symmetry, the same as for a regular hexagon.


In mathematics, a dihedral group is the group of symmetries of a regular polygon,[1][2] which includes rotations and reflections. Dihedral groups are among the simplest examples of finite groups, and they play an important role in group theory, geometry, and chemistry.
The notation for the dihedral group of order n differs in geometry and abstract algebra. In geometry, Dn or Dihn refers to the symmetries of the n-gon, a group of order 2n. In abstract algebra, Dn refers to the dihedral group of order n.[3] The geometric convention is used in this article.

The six axes of reflection of a regular hexagon


A regular polygon with 



n


{\displaystyle n}

 sides has

n


{\displaystyle 2n}

 different symmetries: 



n


{\displaystyle n}

 rotational symmetries and 



n


{\displaystyle n}

 reflection symmetries. Usually, we take 



n


{\displaystyle n}

≥3 here.The associated rotations and reflections make up the dihedral group 




D

n




{\displaystyle D_{n}}

 . If 



n


{\displaystyle n}

 is odd, each axis of symmetry connects the midpoint of one side to the opposite vertex. If 



n


{\displaystyle n}

 is even, there are n/2 axes of symmetry connecting the midpoints of opposite sides and 



n

/

2


{\displaystyle n/2}

 axes of symmetry connecting opposite vertices. In either case, there are 



n


{\displaystyle n}

 axes of symmetry and 



2
n


{\displaystyle 2n}

 elements in the symmetry group. Reflecting in one axis of symmetry followed by reflecting in another axis of symmetry produces a rotation through twice the angle between the axes.
The following picture shows the effect of the sixteen elements of 




D

{\displaystyle D_{8}}

 on a stop sign:

The first row shows the effect of the eight rotations, and the second row shows the effect of the eight reflections, in each case acting on the stop sign with the orientation as shown at the top left.
Group structure[edit]
As with any geometric object, the composition of two symmetries of a regular polygon is again a symmetry of this object. With composition of symmetries to produce another as the binary operation, this gives the symmetries of a polygon the algebraic structure of a finite group.











The composition of these two reflections is a rotation.


The following Cayley table shows the effect of composition in the group D3 (the symmetries of an equilateral triangle). r0 denotes the identity; r1 and r2 denote counterclockwise rotations by 120° and 240° respectively, and s0, s1 and s2 denote reflections across the three lines shown in the adjacent picture.

For example, s2s1 = r1, because the reflection s1 followed by the reflection s2 results in a rotation of 120°. The order of elements denoting the composition is right to left, reflecting the convention that the element acts on the expression to its right. The composition operation is not commutative.
In general, the group Dn has elements r0, …, rn−1 and s0, …, sn−1, with composition given by the following formulae:

In all cases, addition and subtraction of subscripts are to be performed using modular arithmetic with modulus n.
Matrix representation[edit]




The symmetries of this pentagon are linear transformations of the plane as a vector space.


If we center the regular polygon at the origin, then elements of the dihedral group act as linear transformations of the plane. This lets us represent elements of Dn as matrices, with composition being matrix multiplication. This is an example of a (2-dimensional) group representation.
For example, the elements of the group D4 can be represented by the following eight matrices:

rk is a rotation matrix, expressing a counterclockwise rotation through an angle of 2πk/n. sk is a reflection across a line that makes an angle of πk/n with the x-axis.

From the second presentation follows that Dn belongs to the class of Coxeter groups.
The semidirect product of cyclic groups Zn and Z2, with Z2 acting on Zn by inversion (thus, Dn always has a normal subgroup isomorphic to the group Zn). Zn ⋊φ Z2 is isomorphic to Dn if φ(0) is the identity and φ(1) is inversion.


Small dihedral groups[edit]




Example subgroups from a hexagonal dihedral symmetry


D1 is isomorphic to Z2, the cyclic group of order 2.
D2 is isomorphic to K4, the Klein four-group.
D1 and D2 are exceptional in that:

D1 and D2 are the only abelian dihedral groups. Otherwise, Dn is non-abelian.
Dn is a subgroup of the symmetric group Sn for n ≥ 3. Since 2n > n! for n = 1 or n = 2, for these values, Dn is too large to be a subgroup.
The inner automorphism group of D2 is trivial, whereas for other even values of n, this is Dn / Z2.

The cycle graphs of dihedral groups consist of an n-element cycle and n 2-element cycles. The dark vertex in the cycle graphs below of various dihedral groups represents the identity element, and the other vertices are the other elements of the group. A cycle consists of successive powers of either of the elements connected to the identity element.

The dihedral group as symmetry group in 2D and rotation group in 3D[edit]
An example of abstract group Dn, and a common way to visualize it, is the group of Euclidean plane isometries which keep the origin fixed. These groups form one of the two series of discrete point groups in two dimensions. Dn consists of n rotations of multiples of 360°/n about the origin, and reflections across n lines through the origin, making angles of multiples of 180°/n with each other. This is the symmetry group of a regular polygon with n sides (for n ≥ 3; this extends to the cases n = 1 and n = 2 where we have a plane with respectively a point offset from the "center" of the "1-gon" and a "2-gon" or line segment).
Dn is generated by a rotation r of order n and a reflection s of order 2 such that

(Compare coordinate rotations and reflections.)
The dihedral group D2 is generated by the rotation r of 180 degrees, and the reflection s across the x-axis. The elements of D2 can then be represented as {e, r, s, rs}, where e is the identity or null transformation and rs is the reflection across the y-axis.




The four elements of D2 (x-axis is vertical here)


D2 is isomorphic to the Klein four-group.
For n>2 the operations of rotation and reflection in general do not commute and Dn is not abelian; for example, in D4, a rotation of 90 degrees followed by a reflection yields a different result from a reflection followed by a rotation of 90 degrees.




D4 is nonabelian (x-axis is vertical here).


Thus, beyond their obvious application to problems of symmetry in the plane, these groups are among the simplest examples of non-abelian groups, and as such arise frequently as easy counterexamples to theorems which are restricted to abelian groups.
The 2n elements of Dn can be written as e, r, r2, … , rn−1, s, r s, r2s, … , rn−1s. The first n listed elements are rotations and the remaining n elements are axis-reflections (all of which have order 2). The product of two rotations or two reflections is a rotation; the product of a rotation and a reflection is a reflection.
So far, we have considered Dn to be a subgroup of O(2), i.e. the group of rotations (about the origin) and reflections (across axes through the origin) of the plane. However, notation Dn is also used for a subgroup of SO(3) which is also of abstract group type Dn: the proper symmetry group of a regular polygon embedded in three-dimensional space (if n ≥ 3). Such a figure may be considered as a degenerate regular solid with its face counted twice. Therefore, it is also called a dihedron (Greek: solid with two faces), which explains the name dihedral group (in analogy to tetrahedral, octahedral and icosahedral group, referring to the proper symmetry groups of a regular tetrahedron, octahedron, and icosahedron respectively).
Examples of 2D dihedral symmetry[edit]

2D D24 symmetry – Ashoka Chakra, as depicted on the National flag of the Republic of India.




Properties[edit]
The properties of the dihedral groups Dn with n ≥ 3 depend on whether n is even or odd. For example, the center of Dn consists only of the identity if n is odd, but if n is even the center has two elements, namely the identity and the element rn/2 (with Dn as a subgroup of O(2), this is inversion; since it is scalar multiplication by −1, it is clear that it commutes with any linear transformation).
In the case of 2D isometries, this corresponds to adding inversion, giving rotations and mirrors in between the existing ones.
For n twice an odd number, the abstract group Dn is isomorphic with the direct product of Dn / 2 and Z2. Generally, if m divides n, then Dn has n/m subgroups of type Dm, and one subgroup ℤm. Therefore, the total number of subgroups of Dn (n ≥ 1), is equal to d(n) + σ(n), where d(n) is the number of positive divisors of n and σ(n) is the sum of the positive divisors of n. See list of small groups for the cases n ≤ 8.
The dihedral group of order 8 (D4) is the smallest example of a group that is not a T-group. Any of its two Klein four-group subgroups (which are normal in D4) has as normal subgroup order-2 subgroups generated by a reflection (flip) in D4, but these subgroups are not normal in D4.
Conjugacy classes of reflections[edit]
All the reflections are conjugate to each other in case n is odd, but they fall into two conjugacy classes if n is even. If we think of the isometries of a regular n-gon: for odd n there are rotations in the group between every pair of mirrors, while for even n only half of the mirrors can be reached from one by these rotations. Geometrically, in an odd polygon every axis of symmetry passes through a vertex and a side, while in an even polygon there are two sets of axes, each corresponding to a conjugacy class: those that pass through two vertices and those that pass through two sides.
Algebraically, this is an instance of the conjugate Sylow theorem (for n odd): for n odd, each reflection, together with the identity, form a subgroup of order 2, which is a Sylow 2-subgroup (2 = 21 is the maximum power of 2 dividing 2n = 2[2k + 1]), while for n even, these order 2 subgroups are not Sylow subgroups because 4 (a higher power of 2) divides the order of the group.
For n even there is instead an outer automorphism interchanging the two types of reflections (properly, a class of outer automorphisms, which are all conjugate by an inner automorphism).
Automorphism group[edit]
The automorphism group of Dn is isomorphic to the holomorph of ℤ/nℤ, i.e., to Hol(ℤ/nℤ) = {ax + b | (a, n) = 1} and has order nϕ(n), where ϕ is Euler's totient function, the number of k in 1, …, n − 1 coprime to n.
It can be understood in terms of the generators of a reflection and an elementary rotation (rotation by k(2π/n), for k coprime to n); which automorphisms are inner and outer depends on the parity of n.

For n odd, the dihedral group is centerless, so any element defines a non-trivial inner automorphism; for n even, the rotation by 180° (reflection through the origin) is the non-trivial element of the center.
Thus for n odd, the inner automorphism group has order 2n, and for n even (other than n = 2) the inner automorphism group has order n.
For n odd, all reflections are conjugate; for n even, they fall into two classes (those through two vertices and those through two faces), related by an outer automorphism, which can be represented by rotation by π/n (half the minimal rotation).
The rotations are a normal subgroup; conjugation by a reflection changes the sign (direction) of the rotation, but otherwise leaves them unchanged. Thus automorphisms that multiply angles by k (coprime to n) are outer unless k = ±1.

Examples of automorphism groups[edit]
D9 has 18 inner automorphisms. As 2D isometry group D9, the group has mirrors at 20° intervals. The 18 inner automorphisms provide rotation of the mirrors by multiples of 20°, and reflections. As isometry group these are all automorphisms. As abstract group there are in addition to these, 36 outer automorphisms; e.g., multiplying angles of rotation by 2.
D10 has 10 inner automorphisms. As 2D isometry group D10, the group has mirrors at 18° intervals. The 10 inner automorphisms provide rotation of the mirrors by multiples of 36°, and reflections. As isometry group there are 10 more automorphisms; they are conjugates by isometries outside the group, rotating the mirrors 18° with respect to the inner automorphisms. As abstract group there are in addition to these 10 inner and 10 outer automorphisms, 20 more outer automorphisms; e.g., multiplying rotations by 3.
Compare the values 6 and 4 for Euler's totient function, the multiplicative group of integers modulo n for n = 9 and 10, respectively. This triples and doubles the number of automorphisms compared with the two automorphisms as isometries (keeping the order of the rotations the same or reversing the order).
The only values of n for which φ(n) = 2 are 3, 4, and 6, and consequently, there are only three dihedral groups that are isomorphic to their own automorphism groups, namely D3 (order 6), D4 (order 8), and D6 (order 12).[4][5][6]
Inner automorphism group[edit]
The inner automorphism group of Dn is isomorphic to:[7]

Dn if n is odd;
Trivial if n = 2;
Dn / Z2 if n is even and n > 2.

Generalizations[edit]
There are several important generalizations of the dihedral groups:

The infinite dihedral group is an infinite group with algebraic structure similar to the finite dihedral groups. It can be viewed as the group of symmetries of the integers.
The orthogonal group O(2), i.e. the symmetry group of the circle, also has similar properties to the dihedral groups.
The family of generalized dihedral groups includes both of the examples above, as well as many other groups.
The quasidihedral groups are family of finite groups with similar properties to the dihedral groups.

The symmetry group of a snowflake is D6, a dihedral symmetry, the same as for a regular hexagon.


In mathematics, a dihedral group is the group of symmetries of a regular polygon,[1][2] which includes rotations and reflections. Dihedral groups are among the simplest examples of finite groups, and they play an important role in group theory, geometry, and chemistry.
The notation for the dihedral group of order n differs in geometry and abstract algebra. In geometry, Dn or Dihn refers to the symmetries of the n-gon, a group of order 2n. In abstract algebra, Dn refers to the dihedral group of order n.[3] The geometric convention is used in this article.

The six axes of reflection of a regular hexagon


A regular polygon with 



n


{\displaystyle n}

 sides has 



2
n


{\displaystyle 2n}

 different symmetries: 



n


{\displaystyle n}

 rotational symmetries and 



n


{\displaystyle n}

 reflection symmetries. Usually, we take 



n


{\displaystyle n}

≥3 here.The associated rotations and reflections make up the dihedral group 




D

n




{\displaystyle D_{n}}

 . If 



n


{\displaystyle n}

 is odd, each axis of symmetry connects the midpoint of one side to the opposite vertex. If 



n


{\displaystyle n}

 is even, there are n/2 axes of symmetry connecting the midpoints of opposite sides and 



n

/

2


{\displaystyle n/2}

 axes of symmetry connecting opposite vertices. In either case, there are 



n


{\displaystyle n}

 axes of symmetry and 



2
n


{\displaystyle 2n}

 elements in the symmetry group. Reflecting in one axis of symmetry followed by reflecting in another axis of symmetry produces a rotation through twice the angle between the axes.
The following picture shows the effect of the sixteen elements of 




D

{\displaystyle D_{8}}

 on a stop sign:

The first row shows the effect of the eight rotations, and the second row shows the effect of the eight reflections, in each case acting on the stop sign with the orientation as shown at the top left.
Group structure[edit]
As with any geometric object, the composition of two symmetries of a regular polygon is again a symmetry of this object. With composition of symmetries to produce another as the binary operation, this gives the symmetries of a polygon the algebraic structure of a finite group.











The composition of these two reflections is a rotation.


The following Cayley table shows the effect of composition in the group D3 (the symmetries of an equilateral triangle). r0 denotes the identity; r1 and r2 denote counterclockwise rotations by 120° and 240° respectively, and s0, s1 and s2 denote reflections across the three lines shown in the adjacent picture.

For example, s2s1 = r1, because the reflection s1 followed by the reflection s2 results in a rotation of 120°. The order of elements denoting the composition is right to left, reflecting the convention that the element acts on the expression to its right. The composition operation is not commutative.
In general, the group Dn has elements r0, …, rn−1 and s0, …, sn−1, with composition given by the following formulae:

In all cases, addition and subtraction of subscripts are to be performed using modular arithmetic with modulus n.
Matrix representation[edit]




The symmetries of this pentagon are linear transformations of the plane as a vector space.


If we center the regular polygon at the origin, then elements of the dihedral group act as linear transformations of the plane. This lets us represent elements of Dn as matrices, with composition being matrix multiplication. This is an example of a (2-dimensional) group representation.
For example, the elements of the group D4 can be represented by the following eight matrices:

rk is a rotation matrix, expressing a counterclockwise rotation through an angle of 2πk/n. sk is a reflection across a line that makes an angle of πk/n with the x-axis.

From the second presentation follows that Dn belongs to the class of Coxeter groups.
The semidirect product of cyclic groups Zn and Z2, with Z2 acting on Zn by inversion (thus, Dn always has a normal subgroup isomorphic to the group Zn). Zn ⋊φ Z2 is isomorphic to Dn if φ(0) is the identity and φ(1) is inversion.


Small dihedral groups[edit]




Example subgroups from a hexagonal dihedral symmetry


D1 is isomorphic to Z2, the cyclic group of order 2.
D2 is isomorphic to K4, the Klein four-group.
D1 and D2 are exceptional in that:

D1 and D2 are the only abelian dihedral groups. Otherwise, Dn is non-abelian.
Dn is a subgroup of the symmetric group Sn for n ≥ 3. Since 2n > n! for n = 1 or n = 2, for these values, Dn is too large to be a subgroup.
The inner automorphism group of D2 is trivial, whereas for other even values of n, this is Dn / Z2.

The cycle graphs of dihedral groups consist of an n-element cycle and n 2-element cycles. The dark vertex in the cycle graphs below of various dihedral groups represents the identity element, and the other vertices are the other elements of the group. A cycle consists of successive powers of either of the elements connected to the identity element.

The dihedral group as symmetry group in 2D and rotation group in 3D[edit]
An example of abstract group Dn, and a common way to visualize it, is the group of Euclidean plane isometries which keep the origin fixed. These groups form one of the two series of discrete point groups in two dimensions. Dn consists of n rotations of multiples of 360°/n about the origin, and reflections across n lines through the origin, making angles of multiples of 180°/n with each other. This is the symmetry group of a regular polygon with n sides (for n ≥ 3; this extends to the cases n = 1 and n = 2 where we have a plane with respectively a point offset from the "center" of the "1-gon" and a "2-gon" or line segment).
Dn is generated by a rotation r of order n and a reflection s of order 2 such that

(Compare coordinate rotations and reflections.)
The dihedral group D2 is generated by the rotation r of 180 degrees, and the reflection s across the x-axis. The elements of D2 can then be represented as {e, r, s, rs}, where e is the identity or null transformation and rs is the reflection across the y-axis.




The four elements of D2 (x-axis is vertical here)


D2 is isomorphic to the Klein four-group.
For n>2 the operations of rotation and reflection in general do not commute and Dn is not abelian; for example, in D4, a rotation of 90 degrees followed by a reflection yields a different result from a reflection followed by a rotation of 90 degrees.




D4 is nonabelian (x-axis is vertical here).


Thus, beyond their obvious application to problems of symmetry in the plane, these groups are among the simplest examples of non-abelian groups, and as such arise frequently as easy counterexamples to theorems which are restricted to abelian groups.
The 2n elements of Dn can be written as e, r, r2, … , rn−1, s, r s, r2s, … , rn−1s. The first n listed elements are rotations and the remaining n elements are axis-reflections (all of which have order 2). The product of two rotations or two reflections is a rotation; the product of a rotation and a reflection is a reflection.
So far, we have considered Dn to be a subgroup of O(2), i.e. the group of rotations (about the origin) and reflections (across axes through the origin) of the plane. However, notation Dn is also used for a subgroup of SO(3) which is also of abstract group type Dn: the proper symmetry group of a regular polygon embedded in three-dimensional space (if n ≥ 3). Such a figure may be considered as a degenerate regular solid with its face counted twice. Therefore, it is also called a dihedron (Greek: solid with two faces), which explains the name dihedral group (in analogy to tetrahedral, octahedral and icosahedral group, referring to the proper symmetry groups of a regular tetrahedron, octahedron, and icosahedron respectively).
Examples of 2D dihedral symmetry[edit]

2D D24 symmetry – Ashoka Chakra, as depicted on the National flag of the Republic of India.




Properties[edit]
The properties of the dihedral groups Dn with n ≥ 3 depend on whether n is even or odd. For example, the center of Dn consists only of the identity if n is odd, but if n is even the center has two elements, namely the identity and the element rn/2 (with Dn as a subgroup of O(2), this is inversion; since it is scalar multiplication by −1, it is clear that it commutes with any linear transformation).
In the case of 2D isometries, this corresponds to adding inversion, giving rotations and mirrors in between the existing ones.
For n twice an odd number, the abstract group Dn is isomorphic with the direct product of Dn / 2 and Z2. Generally, if m divides n, then Dn has n/m subgroups of type Dm, and one subgroup ℤm. Therefore, the total number of subgroups of Dn (n ≥ 1), is equal to d(n) + σ(n), where d(n) is the number of positive divisors of n and σ(n) is the sum of the positive divisors of n. See list of small groups for the cases n ≤ 8.
The dihedral group of order 8 (D4) is the smallest example of a group that is not a T-group. Any of its two Klein four-group subgroups (which are normal in D4) has as normal subgroup order-2 subgroups generated by a reflection (flip) in D4, but these subgroups are not normal in D4.
Conjugacy classes of reflections[edit]
All the reflections are conjugate to each other in case n is odd, but they fall into two conjugacy classes if n is even. If we think of the isometries of a regular n-gon: for odd n there are rotations in the group between every pair of mirrors, while for even n only half of the mirrors can be reached from one by these rotations. Geometrically, in an odd polygon every axis of symmetry passes through a vertex and a side, while in an even polygon there are two sets of axes, each corresponding to a conjugacy class: those that pass through two vertices and those that pass through two sides.
Algebraically, this is an instance of the conjugate Sylow theorem (for n odd): for n odd, each reflection, together with the identity, form a subgroup of order 2, which is a Sylow 2-subgroup (2 = 21 is the maximum power of 2 dividing 2n = 2[2k + 1]), while for n even, these order 2 subgroups are not Sylow subgroups because 4 (a higher power of 2) divides the order of the group.
For n even there is instead an outer automorphism interchanging the two types of reflections (properly, a class of outer automorphisms, which are all conjugate by an inner automorphism).
Automorphism group[edit]
The automorphism group of Dn is isomorphic to the holomorph of ℤ/nℤ, i.e., to Hol(ℤ/nℤ) = {ax + b | (a, n) = 1} and has order nϕ(n), where ϕ is Euler's totient function, the number of k in 1, …, n − 1 coprime to n.
It can be understood in terms of the generators of a reflection and an elementary rotation (rotation by k(2π/n), for k coprime to n); which automorphisms are inner and outer depends on the parity of n.

For n odd, the dihedral group is centerless, so any element defines a non-trivial inner automorphism; for n even, the rotation by 180° (reflection through the origin) is the non-trivial element of the center.
Thus for n odd, the inner automorphism group has order 2n, and for n even (other than n = 2) the inner automorphism group has order n.
For n odd, all reflections are conjugate; for n even, they fall into two classes (those through two vertices and those through two faces), related by an outer automorphism, which can be represented by rotation by π/n (half the minimal rotation).
The rotations are a normal subgroup; conjugation by a reflection changes the sign (direction) of the rotation, but otherwise leaves them unchanged. Thus automorphisms that multiply angles by k (coprime to n) are outer unless k = ±1.

Examples of automorphism groups[edit]
D9 has 18 inner automorphisms. As 2D isometry group D9, the group has mirrors at 20° intervals. The 18 inner automorphisms provide rotation of the mirrors by multiples of 20°, and reflections. As isometry group these are all automorphisms. As abstract group there are in addition to these, 36 outer automorphisms; e.g., multiplying angles of rotation by 2.
D10 has 10 inner automorphisms. As 2D isometry group D10, the group has mirrors at 18° intervals. The 10 inner automorphisms provide rotation of the mirrors by multiples of 36°, and reflections. As isometry group there are 10 more automorphisms; they are conjugates by isometries outside the group, rotating the mirrors 18° with respect to the inner automorphisms. As abstract group there are in addition to these 10 inner and 10 outer automorphisms, 20 more outer automorphisms; e.g., multiplying rotations by 3.
Compare the values 6 and 4 for Euler's totient function, the multiplicative group of integers modulo n for n = 9 and 10, respectively. This triples and doubles the number of automorphisms compared with the two automorphisms as isometries (keeping the order of the rotations the same or reversing the order).
The only values of n for which φ(n) = 2 are 3, 4, and 6, and consequently, there are only three dihedral groups that are isomorphic to their own automorphism groups, namely D3 (order 6), D4 (order 8), and D6 (order 12).[4][5][6]
Inner automorphism group[edit]
The inner automorphism group of Dn is isomorphic to:[7]

Dn if n is odd;
Trivial if n = 2;
Dn / Z2 if n is even and n > 2.

Generalizations[edit]
There are several important generalizations of the dihedral groups:

The infinite dihedral group is an infinite group with algebraic structure similar to the finite dihedral groups. It can be viewed as the group of symmetries of the integers.
The orthogonal group O(2), i.e. the symmetry group of the circle, also has similar properties to the dihedral groups.
The family of generalized dihedral groups includes both of the examples above, as well as many other groups.
The quasidihedral groups are family of finite groups with similar properties to the dihedral groups.

The symmetry group of a snowflake is D6, a dihedral symmetry, the same as for a regular hexagon.


In mathematics, a dihedral group is the group of symmetries of a regular polygon,[1][2] which includes rotations and reflections. Dihedral groups are among the simplest examples of finite groups, and they play an important role in group theory, geometry, and chemistry.
The notation for the dihedral group of order n differs in geometry and abstract algebra. In geometry, Dn or Dihn refers to the symmetries of the n-gon, a group of order 2n. In abstract algebra, Dn refers to the dihedral group of order n.[3] The geometric convention is used in this article.

The six axes of reflection of a regular hexagon


A regular polygon with 



n


{\displaystyle n}

 sides has 



2
n


{\displaystyle 2n}

 different symmetries: 



n


{\displaystyle n}

 rotational symmetries and 



n


{\displaystyle n}

 reflection symmetries. Usually, we take 



n


{\displaystyle n}

≥3 here.The associated rotations and reflections make up the dihedral group 




D

n




{\displaystyle D_{n}}

 . If 



n


{\displaystyle n}

 is odd, each axis of symmetry connects the midpoint of one side to the opposite vertex. If 



n


{\displaystyle n}

 is even, there are n/2 axes of symmetry connecting the midpoints of opposite sides and 



n

/

2


{\displaystyle n/2}

 axes of symmetry connecting opposite vertices. In either case, there are 



n


{\displaystyle n}

 axes of symmetry and 



2
n


{\displaystyle 2n}

 elements in the symmetry group. Reflecting in one axis of symmetry followed by reflecting in another axis of symmetry produces a rotation through twice the angle between the axes.
The following picture shows the effect of the sixteen elements of 




D

{\displaystyle D_{8}}

 on a stop sign:

The first row shows the effect of the eight rotations, and the second row shows the effect of the eight reflections, in each case acting on the stop sign with the orientation as shown at the top left.
Group structure[edit]
As with any geometric object, the composition of two symmetries of a regular polygon is again a symmetry of this object. With composition of symmetries to produce another as the binary operation, this gives the symmetries of a polygon the algebraic structure of a finite group.











The composition of these two reflections is a rotation.


The following Cayley table shows the effect of composition in the group D3 (the symmetries of an equilateral triangle). r0 denotes the identity; r1 and r2 denote counterclockwise rotations by 120° and 240° respectively, and s0, s1 and s2 denote reflections across the three lines shown in the adjacent picture.

For example, s2s1 = r1, because the reflection s1 followed by the reflection s2 results in a rotation of 120°. The order of elements denoting the composition is right to left, reflecting the convention that the element acts on the expression to its right. The composition operation is not commutative.
In general, the group Dn has elements r0, …, rn−1 and s0, …, sn−1, with composition given by the following formulae:

In all cases, addition and subtraction of subscripts are to be performed using modular arithmetic with modulus n.
Matrix representation[edit]




The symmetries of this pentagon are linear transformations of the plane as a vector space.


If we center the regular polygon at the origin, then elements of the dihedral group act as linear transformations of the plane. This lets us represent elements of Dn as matrices, with composition being matrix multiplication. This is an example of a (2-dimensional) group representation.
For example, the elements of the group D4 can be represented by the following eight matrices:

rk is a rotation matrix, expressing a counterclockwise rotation through an angle of 2πk/n. sk is a reflection across a line that makes an angle of πk/n with the x-axis.

The automorphism group of the graph consisting only of a cycle with n vertices (if n ≥ 3).

From the second presentation follows that Dn belongs to the class of Coxeter groups.
The semidirect product of cyclic groups Zn and Z2, with Z2 acting on Zn by inversion (thus, Dn always has a normal subgroup isomorphic to the group Zn). Zn ⋊φ Z2 is isomorphic to Dn if φ(0) is the identity and φ(1) is inversion.


Small dihedral groups[edit]




Example subgroups from a hexagonal dihedral symmetry


D1 is isomorphic to Z2, the cyclic group of order 2.
D2 is isomorphic to K4, the Klein four-group.
D1 and D2 are exceptional in that:

D1 and D2 are the only abelian dihedral groups. Otherwise, Dn is non-abelian.
Dn is a subgroup of the symmetric group Sn for n ≥ 3. Since 2n > n! for n = 1 or n = 2, for these values, Dn is too large to be a subgroup.
The inner automorphism group of D2 is trivial, whereas for other even values of n, this is Dn / Z2.

The cycle graphs of dihedral groups consist of an n-element cycle and n 2-element cycles. The dark vertex in the cycle graphs below of various dihedral groups represents the identity element, and the other vertices are the other elements of the group. A cycle consists of successive powers of either of the elements connected to the identity element.

The dihedral group as symmetry group in 2D and rotation group in 3D[edit]
An example of abstract group Dn, and a common way to visualize it, is the group of Euclidean plane isometries which keep the origin fixed. These groups form one of the two series of discrete point groups in two dimensions. Dn consists of n rotations of multiples of 360°/n about the origin, and reflections across n lines through the origin, making angles of multiples of 180°/n with each other. This is the symmetry group of a regular polygon with n sides (for n ≥ 3; this extends to the cases n = 1 and n = 2 where we have a plane with respectively a point offset from the "center" of the "1-gon" and a "2-gon" or line segment).
Dn is generated by a rotation r of order n and a reflection s of order 2 such that

(Compare coordinate rotations and reflections.)
The dihedral group D2 is generated by the rotation r of 180 degrees, and the reflection s across the x-axis. The elements of D2 can then be represented as {e, r, s, rs}, where e is the identity or null transformation and rs is the reflection across the y-axis.




The four elements of D2 (x-axis is vertical here)


D2 is isomorphic to the Klein four-group.
For n>2 the operations of rotation and reflection in general do not commute and Dn is not abelian; for example, in D4, a rotation of 90 degrees followed by a reflection yields a different result from a reflection followed by a rotation of 90 degrees.




D4 is nonabelian (x-axis is vertical here).


Thus, beyond their obvious application to problems of symmetry in the plane, these groups are among the simplest examples of non-abelian groups, and as such arise frequently as easy counterexamples to theorems which are restricted to abelian groups.
The 2n elements of Dn can be written as e, r, r2, … , rn−1, s, r s, r2s, … , rn−1s. The first n listed elements are rotations and the remaining n elements are axis-reflections (all of which have order 2). The product of two rotations or two reflections is a rotation; the product of a rotation and a reflection is a reflection.
So far, we have considered Dn to be a subgroup of O(2), i.e. the group of rotations (about the origin) and reflections (across axes through the origin) of the plane. However, notation Dn is also used for a subgroup of SO(3) which is also of abstract group type Dn: the proper symmetry group of a regular polygon embedded in three-dimensional space (if n ≥ 3). Such a figure may be considered as a degenerate regular solid with its face counted twice. Therefore, it is also called a dihedron (Greek: solid with two faces), which explains the name dihedral group (in analogy to tetrahedral, octahedral and icosahedral group, referring to the proper symmetry groups of a regular tetrahedron, octahedron, and icosahedron respectively).
Examples of 2D dihedral symmetry[edit]

2D D24 symmetry – Ashoka Chakra, as depicted on the National flag of the Republic of India.




Properties[edit]
The properties of the dihedral groups Dn with n ≥ 3 depend on whether n is even or odd. For example, the center of Dn consists only of the identity if n is odd, but if n is even the center has two elements, namely the identity and the element rn/2 (with Dn as a subgroup of O(2), this is inversion; since it is scalar multiplication by −1, it is clear that it commutes with any linear transformation).
In the case of 2D isometries, this corresponds to adding inversion, giving rotations and mirrors in between the existing ones.
For n twice an odd number, the abstract group Dn is isomorphic with the direct product of Dn / 2 and Z2. Generally, if m divides n, then Dn has n/m subgroups of type Dm, and one subgroup ℤm. Therefore, the total number of subgroups of Dn (n ≥ 1), is equal to d(n) + σ(n), where d(n) is the number of positive divisors of n and σ(n) is the sum of the positive divisors of n. See list of small groups for the cases n ≤ 8.
The dihedral group of order 8 (D4) is the smallest example of a group that is not a T-group. Any of its two Klein four-group subgroups (which are normal in D4) has as normal subgroup order-2 subgroups generated by a reflection (flip) in D4, but these subgroups are not normal in D4.
Conjugacy classes of reflections[edit]
All the reflections are conjugate to each other in case n is odd, but they fall into two conjugacy classes if n is even. If we think of the isometries of a regular n-gon: for odd n there are rotations in the group between every pair of mirrors, while for even n only half of the mirrors can be reached from one by these rotations. Geometrically, in an odd polygon every axis of symmetry passes through a vertex and a side, while in an even polygon there are two sets of axes, each corresponding to a conjugacy class: those that pass through two vertices and those that pass through two sides.
Algebraically, this is an instance of the conjugate Sylow theorem (for n odd): for n odd, each reflection, together with the identity, form a subgroup of order 2, which is a Sylow 2-subgroup (2 = 21 is the maximum power of 2 dividing 2n = 2[2k + 1]), while for n even, these order 2 subgroups are not Sylow subgroups because 4 (a higher power of 2) divides the order of the group.
For n even there is instead an outer automorphism interchanging the two types of reflections (properly, a class of outer automorphisms, which are all conjugate by an inner automorphism).
Automorphism group[edit]
The automorphism group of Dn is isomorphic to the holomorph of ℤ/nℤ, i.e., to Hol(ℤ/nℤ) = {ax + b | (a, n) = 1} and has order nϕ(n), where ϕ is Euler's totient function, the number of k in 1, …, n − 1 coprime to n.
It can be understood in terms of the generators of a reflection and an elementary rotation (rotation by k(2π/n), for k coprime to n); which automorphisms are inner and outer depends on the parity of n.

For n odd, the dihedral group is centerless, so any element defines a non-trivial inner automorphism; for n even, the rotation by 180° (reflection through the origin) is the non-trivial element of the center.
Thus for n odd, the inner automorphism group has order 2n, and for n even (other than n = 2) the inner automorphism group has order n.
For n odd, all reflections are conjugate; for n even, they fall into two classes (those through two vertices and those through two faces), related by an outer automorphism, which can be represented by rotation by π/n (half the minimal rotation).
The rotations are a normal subgroup; conjugation by a reflection changes the sign (direction) of the rotation, but otherwise leaves them unchanged. Thus automorphisms that multiply angles by k (coprime to n) are outer unless k = ±1.

Examples of automorphism groups[edit]
D9 has 18 inner automorphisms. As 2D isometry group D9, the group has mirrors at 20° intervals. The 18 inner automorphisms provide rotation of the mirrors by multiples of 20°, and reflections. As isometry group these are all automorphisms. As abstract group there are in addition to these, 36 outer automorphisms; e.g., multiplying angles of rotation by 2.
D10 has 10 inner automorphisms. As 2D isometry group D10, the group has mirrors at 18° intervals. The 10 inner automorphisms provide rotation of the mirrors by multiples of 36°, and reflections. As isometry group there are 10 more automorphisms; they are conjugates by isometries outside the group, rotating the mirrors 18° with respect to the inner automorphisms. As abstract group there are in addition to these 10 inner and 10 outer automorphisms, 20 more outer automorphisms; e.g., multiplying rotations by 3.
Compare the values 6 and 4 for Euler's totient function, the multiplicative group of integers modulo n for n = 9 and 10, respectively. This triples and doubles the number of automorphisms compared with the two automorphisms as isometries (keeping the order of the rotations the same or reversing the order).
The only values of n for which φ(n) = 2 are 3, 4, and 6, and consequently, there are only three dihedral groups that are isomorphic to their own automorphism groups, namely D3 (order 6), D4 (order 8), and D6 (order 12).[4][5][6]
Inner automorphism group[edit]
The inner automorphism group of Dn is isomorphic to:[7]

Dn if n is odd;
Trivial if n = 2;
Dn / Z2 if n is even and n > 2.

Generalizations[edit]
There are several important generalizations of the dihedral groups:

The infinite dihedral group is an infinite group with algebraic structure similar to the finite dihedral groups. It can be viewed as the group of symmetries of the integers.
The orthogonal group O(2), i.e. the symmetry group of the circle, also has similar properties to the dihedral groups.
The family of generalized dihedral groups includes both of the examples above, as well as many other groups.
The quasidihedral groups are family of finite groups with similar properties to the dihedral groups.

Numerical information on counts of subgroups by isomorphism type
 FACTS TO CHECK AGAINST FOR SUBGROUP STRUCTURE: (group of prime power order)Lagrange's theorem (order of subgroup times index of subgroup equals order of whole group, so all subgroups have prime power orders)|order of quotient group divides order of group (and equals index of corresponding normal subgroup, so all quotients have prime power orders)prime power order implies not centerless | prime power order implies nilpotent | prime power order implies center is normality-large size of conjugacy class of subgroups divides index of centercongruence condition on number of subgroups of given prime power order: The total number of subgroups of any fixed prime power order is congruent to 1 mod the prime.

Number of normal subgroups per isomorphism type
The number in each column is the number of normal subgroups in the given group of that isomorphism type.
Note that for groups in the same Hall-Senior genus, the total number of normal subgroups is equal, and in fact, the number of subgroups of each order, and even of each Hall-Senior family within an order, is equal. However, the number of subgroups of each specific isomorphism type may not be equal.

Numerical information on counts of subgroups by order
Number of subgroups per order

 Due to congruence condition on number of subgroups of given prime power order, all the counts of subgroups, as well as of normal subgroups, are odd. 

 Since index two implies normal, we have, in all cases, that the number of subgroups of order 8 = number of normal subgroups of order 8. See also equivalence of definitions of maximal subgroup of group of prime power order.

 Formula for number of maximal subgroups of group of prime power order: The subgroups of order 8 (all of which are normal) correspond to the maximal subgroups of the Frattini quotient, which is an elementary abelian group of order . The number of such subgroups is , and hence must be one of the numbers 1,3,7,15.

 Formula for number of minimal normal subgroups of group of prime power order: The normal subgroups of order 2 correspond precisely to the subgroups of order 2 in the socle, which is an elementary abelian subgroup defined as  of the center. If the socle has order , the number of normal subgroups of order 2 is . Thus, it must be 1, 3, 7, or 15. Moroever, for a non-abelian group, the socle can have order either 2 or 4 (cannot have order 8 or 16) so the number of normal subgroups is either 1 or 3.

 For groups of the same Hall-Senior genus, the number of normal subgroups of a given order are equal. Thus, groups with Hall-Senior symbols  and  have the same number of normal subgroups of order 4, for instance.

 For an abelian group, the number of subgroups of a given order equals the number of normal subgroups. Moreover, because subgroup lattice and quotient lattice of finite abelian group are isomorphic, we get that (number of subgroups of order 2) = (number of normal subgroups of order 2) = (number of subgroups of order 8) = (number of normal subgroups of order 8), and separately, (number of subgroups of order 4) = (number of normal subgroups of order 4).

Subgroups of order 2
The table below provides information on the counts of subgroups of order 2. Note the following:



 General assertion 
 Implication for the counts in this case


 congruence condition on number of subgroups of given prime power order 
 The number of subgroups of order 2 is odd.The number of normal subgroups of order 2 is odd.The number of p-core-automorphism-invariant subgroups (which in this case means the number of subgroups invariant under automorphisms in the 2-core of the automorphism group) is odd.


 formula for number of minimal normal subgroups of group of prime power order (follows from minimal normal implies contained in Omega-1 of center for nilpotent p-group, which in turn follows from minimal normal implies central in nilpotent, which in turn follows from nilpotent implies center is normality-large). The number of normal subgroups of prime order is thus , where . For a non-abelian group, . 
 In our case, the number of normal subgroups of order 2 is , which must be one of the numbers 1,3,7,15. For a non-abelian group, the socle cannot have order 16 or 32, so the number of normal subgroups of order 2 is one of the numbers 1 or 3.

Central series
We have nilpotency class and order determine group up to commutator map-equivalence for up to prime-fourth order. Further/in particular, the nilpotency class and order determines the equivalence class up to isoclinism.
In particular, the isomorphism classes of the successive quotients for the lower central series as well as the isomorphism classes for the successive quotients for the upper central series are determined by the nilpotency class.
With the exception of the whole group, the isomorphism classes of the lower central series members and upper central series members are determined by the Hall-Senior genus.
Below are some of the details that are determined via the Hall-Senior family and genus about the lower and upper central series. Note the following special thing about the order 16 (and more generally, order  where  is prime and ) -- that the nilpotency class determines the equivalence class up to isoclinism.

Abelian groups
We first consider the abelian groups, i.e., the groups of nilpotency class exactly one. There are five such groups: cyclic group:Z16 (ID: (16,1)), direct product of Z4 and Z4 (ID: (16,2)), direct product of Z8 and Z2 (ID: (16,5)), direct product of Z4 and V4 (ID: (16,10)), and elementary abelian group:E16 (ID: (16,14)). In all these cases, the derived subgroup is trivial (so the lower central series reaches the trivial subgroup in its second step) and the center is the whole group (so the upper central series reaches the whole group at once). Thus, the abelianization is the whole group and the inner automorphism group is trivial.

Groups of class two
These all form a single Hall-Senior family . Note that the third member of the lower central series is trivial, and so is the second member of the upper central series. See below:

They all form a single Hall-Senior family  and a single Hall-Senior genus . The groups are dihedral group:D16 (ID: (16,7)), semidihedral group:SD16 (ID: (16,8)), generalized quaternion group:Q16 (ID: (16,9)).
All the groups of order 16 and class three are UL-equivalent groups, i.e., the lower and upper central series coincide. In other words, the center is the third member of the lower central series, and the derived subgroup is the second member of the upper central series.

Counts of abelian subgroups and abelian normal subgroups
Below is a table with information on the counts of abelian subgroups and abelian normal subgroups in groups of order 16.


 Congruence condition on number of subgroups of given prime power order tells us that for any fixed order, the number of subgroups is congruent to 1 mod 2 (i.e., it is odd). Since the non-normal subgroups occur in conjugacy classes whose size is a nontrivial power of 2, the number of normal subgroups is congruent to 1 mod 2. In particular, for orders 2 and 4, since every subgroup of that order is abelian anyway, the congruence condition tells us that the number of abelian subgroups is congruent to 1 mod 2, and so is the number of abelian normal subgroups.

 Congruence condition on number of abelian subgroups of prime-cube order and existence of abelian normal subgroups of small prime power order: This gives us that the number of abelian subgroups of order 8 is congruent to 1 mod 2 (i.e., it is odd). Hence, the number of abelian normal subgroups of order 8 is also congruent to 1 mod 2 (i.e., it is odd). 


The upshot is that all counts in the table below are odd.


 Index two implies normal, so all the abelian subgroups of order 8 are normal. Thus the count for abelian subgroups of order 8 is the same as the count for abelian normal subgroups of order 8.

 For the abelian groups: note that abelian implies every subgroup is normal and also that subgroup lattice and quotient lattice of finite abelian group are isomorphic. Thus, when the whole group is abelian, we have: number of abelian subgroups of order 2 = number of abelian normal subgroups of order 2 = number of abelian subgroups of order 8 = number of abelian normal subgroups of order 8. Separately, we have number of abelian subgroups of order 4 = number of abelian normal subgroups of order 4.

 The "number of abelian normal subgroups" columns depend only on the Hall-Senior genus, i.e., two groups with the same Hall-Senior genus have the same "number of abelian normal subgroups" of each order. The Hall-Senior genus is the part of the Hall-Senior symbol excluding the very final subscript, so for instance  and  both belong to the Hall-Senior genus .

CitationsCitations8ReferencesReferences0Proof. This formula was noticed in [21] as a direct consequence of Dijksma-Koornwinder product formula for Jacobi polynomials. Here, we would like to emphasize that its origin lies in a quadratic transformation satisfied by the Gauss hypergeometric function 2 F 1 . Generalized Bessel function associated with $\mathcal{D}_2(8)$ and radial Dunkl processes in a wedge of angle $\pi/4[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: In this paper, we express the generalized Bessel function associated with the dihedral group $\mathcal{D}_2(8)$ as a product of two modified Bessel functions. The proof of this result is based on a quadratic transformation for the Gauss hypergeometric function together with the product formula for modified Bessel functions. As an application, we derive an integral representation for the density of the first hitting time of the boundary of a wedge of angle $\pi/4$ by the radial Dunkl process. In the course of doing, we use Weber second exponential integral to prove an analogue of Erdelyi multiplication Theorem for the $B_2$-type root system. The end of the paper is devoted to some remarks on the first exit time from a dihedral wedge by a planar Brownian motion.Article · Jul 2016 · Journal of Computational and Applied MathematicsNizar DemniReadfor (u, v) ∈] − 1, 1[ 2 , which specializes for p = 2 to 1 2 j≡0[4] (j + γ)I j+γ (ρr)C γ/2 j/2 (z 2φ,2θ (u, v)). Using the identity noticed by Y. Xu ([13]): Radon Transform on spheres and generalized Bessel function associated
with dihedral groups[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: Motivated by Dunkl operators theory, we consider a generating series
involving a modified Bessel function and a Gegenbauer polynomial, that
generalizes a known series already considered by L. Gegenbauer. We actually use
inversion formulas for Fourier and Radon transforms to derive a closed formula
for this series when the parameter of the Gegenbauer polynomial is a strictly
positive integer. As a by-product, we get a relatively simple integral
representation for the generalized Bessel function associated with even
dihedral groups when both multiplicities sum to an integer. In particular, we
recover a previous result obtained for the square symmetries-preserving group
and we give a special interest to the hexagon. The paper is closed with
adapting our method to odd dihedral groups thereby exhausting the list of Weyl
dihedral groups.Article · Sep 2010 · Journal of Computational and Applied MathematicsNizar DemniReadby Gauss duplication's formula. Now, recall the product formula for Jacobi polynomials ([6] 3 , [17] p.424 4 ) Product formula for Jacobi polynomials, spherical harmonics and generalized Bessel function of dihedral type[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: We work out the expression of the generalized Bessel function of type B in the two-rank case. This is done using Dijskma and Koornwinder's product formula for Jacobi polynomials and the obtained expression is given by multiple integrals involving only a normalized modified Bessel function and two symmetric Beta distributions. We think of that expression as the major step toward the explicit expression of the Dunkl's intertwining V operator reflections-invariant functions. Finally, we give in the same setting an explicit formula for the action of V on a product of a power of the norm and a spherical harmonic. The obtained formula extends to all dihedral systems and it improves the one derived by Y.Xu. Comment: this paper is accepted for publication in Int. Trans. Spec. FunctArticle · May 2009 Nizar DemniReadAn explicit integral was found for the group S 3 (symmetric group on 3 objects) in [4]. Xu [10] found an intertwining transform for B 2 under restrictive conditions on degree and κ 1 , κ 2 . We will use a criterion, valid for any finite reflection group, for an operator to be equal to V which was proven in that paper. An Intertwining Operator for the Group B2[Show abstract] [Hide abstract] ABSTRACT: There is a commutative algebra of differential-difference operators, acting on polynomials on R-2, associated with the reflection group B-2. This paper presents an integral transform which intertwines this algebra, allowing one free parameter, with the algebra of partial derivatives. The method of proof depends on properties of a certain class of balanced terminating hypergeometric series of F-4(3)-type. These properties are in the form of recurrence and contiguity relations and are proved herein.Article · Jul 2006 Charles DunklReadProblem 6.
