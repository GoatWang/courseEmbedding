      of relapse to opioid dependence, following opioid detoxification; the 
      expansion of our commercial product portfolio and capabilities; and the

 BURLINGTON, Mass., Sept. 14, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Flexion Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq:FLXN) announced today the appointment of Mark Stejbach, Senior Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer at Alkermes plc, to its Board of Directors as the company prepares for commercialization of its drug candidate Zilretta™ (also known as FX006), a potential treatment for patients with moderate to severe knee osteoarthritis (OA) pain. Flexion plans to submit a new drug application (NDA) in the fourth quarter of 2016 to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Michael Clayman, MD, President and Chief Executive Officer of Flexion, stated, "We are delighted to be bringing Mark's considerable commercial experience and know-how to our Board of Directors. We are confident that his strategic expertise and his deep and current knowledge of sales and marketing will complement the backgrounds of the existing Board members and will contribute insight and perspective to our recently expanded internal commercial capabilities. All of this is vitally important as we prepare Zilretta for potential approval and commercial launch, which we anticipate to happen in 2017." Mr. Stejbach has more than 25 years of leadership experience in biotech and commercial marketing, sales, managed care, and finance. As Chief Commercial Officer at Alkermes, Mr. Stejbach is responsible for marketing, sales, managed care and trade channels, commercial analytics, patient services, new product planning and commercial strategy. Previously, he served at Tengion, Inc. from 2008 to 2012, most recently as Chief Commercial Officer. He previously held senior positions at Merck & Co. and Biogen Idec. Mr. Stejbach received his MBA from the University of Pennsylvania and a Bachelor of Science in mathematics from Virginia Tech. "I'm honored to join the Flexion Therapeutics Board of Directors as the company prepares to submit an NDA for its drug candidate, Zilretta, to the FDA," said Mr. Stejbach. "If approved for commercialization, Zilretta would be an important drug in the armamentarium of physicians who treat patients with pain associated with knee OA."

Mark Stejbach, Merck

Pharmaceutical Executive





Mark Stejbach


VP, Managed Care Marketing, Merck
DOUBLE DUTY: Is helping build Merck's new healthcare model
OF NOTE: First non-finance person to run Merck's investor relations 






On payers:


 Mark Stejbach
For many years, the success of the industry was at least in part driven by the inefficiency of the economic model of healthcare. In the short term, there's always more to be eked out from the current model—and I think some companies are going to run with that as hard and as long as they can. But in the long term, companies have to understand that the market is going to be increasingly influenced by the people who pay the bills—payers and consumers. In that way, pharma will start to become more like most other industries.
