Neuberger Berman bolsters China capabilities with new team


By

                20 Jul, 2017
            











Neuberger Berman has hired a new portfolio manager for its China equities team, the company has announced.
Bin Yu joins the firm from investment manager CloudRidge, where he had been CIO of the firm since June 2014. Yu brings with him a team of four analysts from the company, which specialises in Greater China equities.
Located in Hong Kong and Beijing, the team will continue to manage its current fund as a private strategy with the possibility to expand based on Neuberger’s clients’ needs.
Prior to his role at CloudRidge, Yu spent more than five years with China Investment Corporation, where he was head of the $10 billion global equity team and a senior portfolio manager, co-managing three multi-billion portfolios.
Commenting on the hire, Neuberger’s president and CIO for equities, Joseph Amato, said: 'We are excited about extending our investment capabilities in China—a large and increasingly important equity market.
‘Yu’s long-term, high-conviction, value-oriented investment approach is grounded in fundamental research and we expect him to be a great fit in the Neuberger Berman culture.’

Summary







 


Overall Rating

3 out of 5 Stars

Morningstar has awarded this fund 3 stars based on its risk-adjusted performance compared to the 1091 funds within its Morningstar Category.



How is it determined?


The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics, which are based on risk-adjusted returns, as of the date stated.

What does it mean?


A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.











 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Below Average


This fund scores Below Average because it delivered returns that were in the bottom 22.5% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Expenses


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Below Average


This fund's expenses are rated as Below Average because they fall between the 20th and 40th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category





How is it calculated?


This Morningstar data point compares the fund's net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its Morningstar Category grouping.





What does it mean?


Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Fund Overview




Objective



The investment seeks total return emphasizing both current income and capital appreciation.




Strategy



The fund invests mainly in income-oriented equity securities that pay dividends, which may include real estate investment trusts ("REITs"), convertible securities and common stocks. It seeks to generate a current yield that is greater than the average current yield for stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500 Composite Stock Index. The fund may emphasize the real estate and utilities sectors of the market at any given time and may invest up to 40% of its total assets in each of these sectors.


Risk



Value stocks can perform differently than other types of stocks and can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time. Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, economic or other developments. These risks may be magnified in foreign markets. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.

Risk


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Low


This fund scores Low because Morningstar has rated its risk below the 20th percentile when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.




How is it calculated?


Risk is calculated using the Sharpe ratio, which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to U.S. Treasury bonds, relative to the fund's overall volatility. For this measure, Morningstar has compared the Sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in it's Morningstar Category.




What does it mean?


A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.










 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Below Average


This fund scores Below Average because it delivered returns that were in the bottom 22.5% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. (Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.) It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of  funds in each fund category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.

The "Mutual Funds" area at the top of each page allows access to mutual fund holdings with individual and joint Fidelity non-retirement accounts. Individual stock positions, ETFs and 529 funds are not available through this view. For the full list of your holdings visit Portfolio Summary.Mutual Funds are priced as of the previous business day's market close when the market is open. Mutual fund positions are priced as of the official market close (typically 4p.m.) and prices are generally available between 5 p.m. and 6p.m.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. Transaction Fee:A transaction fee is similar to a  brokerage fee or commission which you pay when you buy or sell a stock. For some funds available through Fidelity you are required to pay a transaction fee. However, you will not pay a sales load on Transaction Fee (TF) funds. You will only be charged a transaction fee when you buy a FundsNetwork TF fund, not when you sell one. All other fees and expenses described in a fund's prospectus still apply. You can choose to buy or sell shares directly from the fund itself or its principal underwriter or distributor without paying a transaction fee to Fidelity.Online Transaction Fees:  $49.95 for most funds.  Certain funds will have a transaction fee of $75. To identify any applicable transaction fees associated with the purchase of a given fund, please refer to the "Fees and Distributions" tab.Fidelity Automated Service Telephone (FAST): 25% off representative-assisted rates, Maximum: $187.50, Minimum:$75Representative-Assisted: 0.75% of principal, Maximum: $250, Minimum: $100Automatic Investment: $5 per transaction, after the initial investment.Sales load:A sales charge added to the price of the fund.  Funds have different sales charge structures, including front-end loads, back-end loads (deferred), and no loads. Sales loads can either be charged when a fund is purchased, commonly known as a front-end load, or when a fund is sold, known as a deferred load. Not  all funds charge a load. Refer to the Loads, Expense and Minimums section of the fund's prospectus for details on these amounts. Although no load funds do not have a front-end or deferred load, they may incur other fees, such as a 12b-1 fee.
2. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated.  Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.
3. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
4. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
5. Initial minimum investments into group retirement accounts such as Fidelity Simplified Employee Pension-IRA, Keogh, Self-Employed 401(k), and Non-Fidelity Prototype Retirement accounts are $500 or higher. Additional investments into Regular, IRA, and Group accounts are $250 or higher.
6. A standard yield calculation developed by the Securities and Exchange Commission for bond funds. The yield is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share earned during the 30-day period by the maximum offering price per share on the last day of the period. The yield figure reflects the dividends and interest earned during the 30-day period, after the deduction of the fund's expenses. It is sometimes referred to as "SEC 30-Day Yield" or "standardized yield".
7. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time. They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments. Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different. Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment options reports its holdings.  Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section.  Some report them in this section as an to the equity, bond and other allocation shown.  Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown.  If the allocation without the foreign component (or round to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
8. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
9. StyleMap� depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's equity holdings over two dimensions: market capitalization and valuation. The percentage of fund assets represented by these holdings is indicated beside each StyleMap. Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's equity holdings (e.g., domestic stocks, foreign stocks, and American Depositary Receipts), are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.
10. Please note Regional Diversification information is based on the equity components only.


Generally, data on Fidelity mutual funds is provided by FMR, LLC, Morningstar ratings and data on non-Fidelity mutual funds is provided by Morningstar, Inc. and data on non-mutual fund products is provided by the product's investment manager, trustee or issuer or the plan sponsor whose plan is offering the product to  participants.  Although Fidelity believes the data gathered from these third-party sources is reliable, it does not review such information and cannot warrant it to be accurate, complete or timely.  Fidelity is not responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this third-party information.

Overview[edit]
Founded in 1939,[3] Neuberger Berman is a privately held asset management firm, which is 100%[4][5] owned by its employees. It serves pension plans, charitable organizations, sovereign wealth funds and other institutions, as well as high-net-worth individuals and mutual fund investors, both directly and through financial intermediaries and other partners. The firm has a broad range of investment capabilities, which have enabled it to win numerous public strategic partnership mandates, most notably from Teacher Retirement System of Texas and the National Social Security Fund of China.[6] For its private clients, Neuberger Berman also provides financial planning, fiduciary services, and trust services. Known as a firm of investors, the firm has maintained a 97% retention rate among its senior investment teams since 2009,[7] and has been recognized for its distinctive firm culture.[8][9]
History[edit]
Neuberger Berman was founded as "Neuberger & Berman" in 1939, by Roy R. Neuberger and Robert Berman.
In the decades that followed its founding, the firm's growth mirrored that of the asset-management industry as a whole. Its success in managing separate accounts, led it to establish the Guardian Fund, in 1950, one of the first no-load mutual funds in the United States. Today, the firm’s complex of open and closed-end mutual funds, includes other well-known funds, including Century Fund (renamed Large Cap Disciplined Growth Fund) and Genesis Fund. In the 1960s, the firm expanded into the management of pension plans and assets of other institutions.




Pre-Lehman bankruptcy logo


After 60 years as a private firm, in October 1999, Neuberger Berman conducted an initial public offering of its shares and commenced trading on the New York Stock Exchange, under the ticker symbol "NEU". With the firm's IPO, Larry Zicklin, who had joined the firm in 1969, retired as Chairman of its executive committee. He was succeeded as Chief Executive Officer by Jeffrey B. Lane.
Lehman Brothers acquisition and bankruptcy[edit]
In July 2003, shortly after the retired Mr. Neuberger's 100th birthday, the company announced that it was in merger discussions with Lehman Brothers. These discussions ultimately resulted in the firm's acquisition by Lehman on October 31, 2003, for approximately $2.63 billion in cash and securities, or approximately 26 times earnings.[10] That transaction closed in October 2003 and from that time, until 2008, Neuberger Berman served as one of the asset management arms of Lehman Brothers’ Investment Management Division. In that same year, Lehman acquired fixed income manager Lincoln Capital Fixed Income Management and private equity manager Crossroads Group.[11]
Management Buyout[edit]
On September 15, 2008, virtually unprecedented volatility in global securities markets resulted in Lehman Brothers’ collapse and bankruptcy filing. Neuberger Berman continued to operate, notwithstanding Lehman’s bankruptcy and sought opportunities to spin itself off from its parent. On September 29, 2008, Lehman agreed to sell its asset management businesses, including Neuberger Berman, to a pair of private-equity firms, Bain Capital Partners and Hellman & Friedman. The transaction was expected to close in early 2009;[12] however, a competing bid was entered by the firm's management, who ultimately prevailed in a bankruptcy auction held on December 3, topping the deal with Bain and Hellman.[13] The firm spun itself off in May 2009, in a transaction recognized by Fund Industry Intelligence as Deal of the Year.[14] Lehman Brothers' creditors initially retained a 49% common equity interest in the firm and a $875 million preferred equity stake.[13] with a coupon that climbed to 12% over three years. The preferred equity position was fully repaid in 2012.[15][16] The new entity, including Neuberger, Lincoln Capital, and Crossroads, was named Neuberger Berman Group LLC.[17] Under employee control, Larry Zicklin rejoined the firm as a member of the Board of Directors. Lehman Brothers creditors have received over $1.5 billion from the employees of Neuberger Berman, dwarfing the proceeds paid by Barclays and Nomura for businesses representing 90% of Lehman Brothers employees.[18]
Independence and Expansion[edit]
Since its reemergence as an independent firm, Neuberger Berman has enjoyed a period of sustained growth. The firm increased its assets under management 14% per year from 2010 to 2014,[19] reaching $250 billion,[20] which placed the firm at the top of its peer group by asset growth.[19] The firm currently employs approximately 2,000 people,[20] and has expanded beyond its traditional equity focus into the growing areas of emerging markets debt,[21] high-yield bonds,[22] liquid alternatives and private equity,[23][24] among other strategies. During this period the firm expanded its global presence, adding coverage offices in key Asia-Pacific markets and elsewhere to be closer to a growing overseas client base.[25]
The end of 2014 marked Neuberger Berman’s return to full employee ownership, highlighting the firm’s independence and clearing the path for future growth.[26][27] Employee ownership has been recognized by industry leaders as a key factor in the success of asset management firms, and Neuberger Berman’s position as an employee-owned firm is cited as a reason for its high talent retention rate.[28] In recognition of its culture, Neuberger Berman won the top rank in its category on Pensions & Investments' 2016 Best Places to Work in Money Management survey,[2] and had been named to the Best Places list in 2013, 2014, and 2015.[29][30][31]
Offices[edit]




1290 Avenue of the Americas, New York City.


In October 2016, the firm moved its global headquarters to 1290 Avenue of the Americas in midtown Manhattan.[32][33]
In addition, the firm has approximately 28 other offices in key countries around the world. Regional headquarters are in Hong Kong, London and Tokyo, and has additional primary portfolio management centers in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Milan, The Hague and Singapore.[34][33]
Former headquarters in New York City include 605 Third Avenue,[32] 522 Fifth Avenue and, originally, The Biltmore Hotel.[35]
Philanthropy[edit]
Collectively, Neuberger Berman’s philanthropic efforts are called NB Impacts. NB Impacts includes both employee community service and the grant-making actions of the Neuberger Berman Foundation.[36] The Neuberger Berman Foundation offers grants focusing on at-risk children, youth educational programs, and economic sustainability.[37][38][39][40]
Neuberger Berman conducts an annual week-long program in the spring called “Celebration with Service,” which holds community service events in the cities where the firm has offices.[36][41][42] For its 75th anniversary year in 2014, the firm’s “Celebration with Service” supported 75 volunteer projects worldwide.[36] Since 2012, NB Impacts has deployed more than 4,500 volunteers to work with over 5,000 youth and 800 senior citizens, and also includes approximately 2,000 volunteer hours spent on improving parks and community spaces.[36][43] Through the years, some of the programs Neuberger Berman has been involved in are: The Y,[44] Homes for Heroes,[45] Per Scholas,[46] C-CAP,[47] New York City Service,[48][49] and Habitat for Humanity.[50]
Corporate art collection[edit]
Contemporary art in the workplace has been part of Neuberger Berman’s corporate culture since 1939, when renowned collector Roy Neuberger co-founded the investment firm.[51] In 1990 the firm began developing its own art collection.[52][53] The firm's corporate art collection was absorbed into the Lehman Brothers collection but Neuberger Berman repurchased many of them when the collection was sold at auction in 2010.[54] Today, the Neuberger Berman Collection supports the work of contemporary artists, prominently displaying their work in the firm’s hallways, reception areas and meeting rooms.[51] The collection creates a stimulating and enriching environment for both employees and visitors.

In addition, the firm has approximately 28 other offices in key countries around the world. Regional headquarters are in Hong Kong, London and Tokyo, and has additional primary portfolio management centers in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Milan, The Hague and Singapore.[34][33]
Former headquarters in New York City include 605 Third Avenue,[32] 522 Fifth Avenue and, originally, The Biltmore Hotel.[35]
Philanthropy[edit]
Collectively, Neuberger Berman’s philanthropic efforts are called NB Impacts. NB Impacts includes both employee community service and the grant-making actions of the Neuberger Berman Foundation.[36] The Neuberger Berman Foundation offers grants focusing on at-risk children, youth educational programs, and economic sustainability.[37][38][39][40]
Neuberger Berman conducts an annual week-long program in the spring called “Celebration with Service,” which holds community service events in the cities where the firm has offices.[36][41][42] For its 75th anniversary year in 2014, the firm’s “Celebration with Service” supported 75 volunteer projects worldwide.[36] Since 2012, NB Impacts has deployed more than 4,500 volunteers to work with over 5,000 youth and 800 senior citizens, and also includes approximately 2,000 volunteer hours spent on improving parks and community spaces.[36][43] Through the years, some of the programs Neuberger Berman has been involved in are: The Y,[44] Homes for Heroes,[45] Per Scholas,[46] C-CAP,[47] New York City Service,[48][49] and Habitat for Humanity.[50]
Corporate art collection[edit]
Contemporary art in the workplace has been part of Neuberger Berman’s corporate culture since 1939, when renowned collector Roy Neuberger co-founded the investment firm.[51] In 1990 the firm began developing its own art collection.[52][53] The firm's corporate art collection was absorbed into the Lehman Brothers collection but Neuberger Berman repurchased many of them when the collection was sold at auction in 2010.[54] Today, the Neuberger Berman Collection supports the work of contemporary artists, prominently displaying their work in the firm’s hallways, reception areas and meeting rooms.[51] The collection creates a stimulating and enriching environment for both employees and visitors.

Overview[edit]
Founded in 1939,[3] Neuberger Berman is a privately held asset management firm, which is 100%[4][5] owned by its employees. It serves pension plans, charitable organizations, sovereign wealth funds and other institutions, as well as high-net-worth individuals and mutual fund investors, both directly and through financial intermediaries and other partners. The firm has a broad range of investment capabilities, which have enabled it to win numerous public strategic partnership mandates, most notably from Teacher Retirement System of Texas and the National Social Security Fund of China.[6] For its private clients, Neuberger Berman also provides financial planning, fiduciary services, and trust services. Known as a firm of investors, the firm has maintained a 97% retention rate among its senior investment teams since 2009,[7] and has been recognized for its distinctive firm culture.[8][9]
History[edit]
Neuberger Berman was founded as "Neuberger & Berman" in 1939, by Roy R. Neuberger and Robert Berman.
In the decades that followed its founding, the firm's growth mirrored that of the asset-management industry as a whole. Its success in managing separate accounts, led it to establish the Guardian Fund, in 1950, one of the first no-load mutual funds in the United States. Today, the firm’s complex of open and closed-end mutual funds, includes other well-known funds, including Century Fund (renamed Large Cap Disciplined Growth Fund) and Genesis Fund. In the 1960s, the firm expanded into the management of pension plans and assets of other institutions.




Pre-Lehman bankruptcy logo


After 60 years as a private firm, in October 1999, Neuberger Berman conducted an initial public offering of its shares and commenced trading on the New York Stock Exchange, under the ticker symbol "NEU". With the firm's IPO, Larry Zicklin, who had joined the firm in 1969, retired as Chairman of its executive committee. He was succeeded as Chief Executive Officer by Jeffrey B. Lane.
Lehman Brothers acquisition and bankruptcy[edit]
In July 2003, shortly after the retired Mr. Neuberger's 100th birthday, the company announced that it was in merger discussions with Lehman Brothers. These discussions ultimately resulted in the firm's acquisition by Lehman on October 31, 2003, for approximately $2.63 billion in cash and securities, or approximately 26 times earnings.[10] That transaction closed in October 2003 and from that time, until 2008, Neuberger Berman served as one of the asset management arms of Lehman Brothers’ Investment Management Division. In that same year, Lehman acquired fixed income manager Lincoln Capital Fixed Income Management and private equity manager Crossroads Group.[11]
Management Buyout[edit]
On September 15, 2008, virtually unprecedented volatility in global securities markets resulted in Lehman Brothers’ collapse and bankruptcy filing. Neuberger Berman continued to operate, notwithstanding Lehman’s bankruptcy and sought opportunities to spin itself off from its parent. On September 29, 2008, Lehman agreed to sell its asset management businesses, including Neuberger Berman, to a pair of private-equity firms, Bain Capital Partners and Hellman & Friedman. The transaction was expected to close in early 2009;[12] however, a competing bid was entered by the firm's management, who ultimately prevailed in a bankruptcy auction held on December 3, topping the deal with Bain and Hellman.[13] The firm spun itself off in May 2009, in a transaction recognized by Fund Industry Intelligence as Deal of the Year.[14] Lehman Brothers' creditors initially retained a 49% common equity interest in the firm and a $875 million preferred equity stake.[13] with a coupon that climbed to 12% over three years. The preferred equity position was fully repaid in 2012.[15][16] The new entity, including Neuberger, Lincoln Capital, and Crossroads, was named Neuberger Berman Group LLC.[17] Under employee control, Larry Zicklin rejoined the firm as a member of the Board of Directors. Lehman Brothers creditors have received over $1.5 billion from the employees of Neuberger Berman, dwarfing the proceeds paid by Barclays and Nomura for businesses representing 90% of Lehman Brothers employees.[18]
Independence and Expansion[edit]
Since its reemergence as an independent firm, Neuberger Berman has enjoyed a period of sustained growth. The firm increased its assets under management 14% per year from 2010 to 2014,[19] reaching $250 billion,[20] which placed the firm at the top of its peer group by asset growth.[19] The firm currently employs approximately 2,000 people,[20] and has expanded beyond its traditional equity focus into the growing areas of emerging markets debt,[21] high-yield bonds,[22] liquid alternatives and private equity,[23][24] among other strategies. During this period the firm expanded its global presence, adding coverage offices in key Asia-Pacific markets and elsewhere to be closer to a growing overseas client base.[25]
The end of 2014 marked Neuberger Berman’s return to full employee ownership, highlighting the firm’s independence and clearing the path for future growth.[26][27] Employee ownership has been recognized by industry leaders as a key factor in the success of asset management firms, and Neuberger Berman’s position as an employee-owned firm is cited as a reason for its high talent retention rate.[28] In recognition of its culture, Neuberger Berman won the top rank in its category on Pensions & Investments' 2016 Best Places to Work in Money Management survey,[2] and had been named to the Best Places list in 2013, 2014, and 2015.[29][30][31]

In addition, the firm has approximately 28 other offices in key countries around the world. Regional headquarters are in Hong Kong, London and Tokyo, and has additional primary portfolio management centers in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Milan, The Hague and Singapore.[34][33]
Former headquarters in New York City include 605 Third Avenue,[32] 522 Fifth Avenue and, originally, The Biltmore Hotel.[35]
Philanthropy[edit]
Collectively, Neuberger Berman’s philanthropic efforts are called NB Impacts. NB Impacts includes both employee community service and the grant-making actions of the Neuberger Berman Foundation.[36] The Neuberger Berman Foundation offers grants focusing on at-risk children, youth educational programs, and economic sustainability.[37][38][39][40]
Neuberger Berman conducts an annual week-long program in the spring called “Celebration with Service,” which holds community service events in the cities where the firm has offices.[36][41][42] For its 75th anniversary year in 2014, the firm’s “Celebration with Service” supported 75 volunteer projects worldwide.[36] Since 2012, NB Impacts has deployed more than 4,500 volunteers to work with over 5,000 youth and 800 senior citizens, and also includes approximately 2,000 volunteer hours spent on improving parks and community spaces.[36][43] Through the years, some of the programs Neuberger Berman has been involved in are: The Y,[44] Homes for Heroes,[45] Per Scholas,[46] C-CAP,[47] New York City Service,[48][49] and Habitat for Humanity.[50]
Corporate art collection[edit]
Contemporary art in the workplace has been part of Neuberger Berman’s corporate culture since 1939, when renowned collector Roy Neuberger co-founded the investment firm.[51] In 1990 the firm began developing its own art collection.[52][53] The firm's corporate art collection was absorbed into the Lehman Brothers collection but Neuberger Berman repurchased many of them when the collection was sold at auction in 2010.[54] Today, the Neuberger Berman Collection supports the work of contemporary artists, prominently displaying their work in the firm’s hallways, reception areas and meeting rooms.[51] The collection creates a stimulating and enriching environment for both employees and visitors.

Overview[edit]
Founded in 1939,[3] Neuberger Berman is a privately held asset management firm, which is 100%[4][5] owned by its employees. It serves pension plans, charitable organizations, sovereign wealth funds and other institutions, as well as high-net-worth individuals and mutual fund investors, both directly and through financial intermediaries and other partners. The firm has a broad range of investment capabilities, which have enabled it to win numerous public strategic partnership mandates, most notably from Teacher Retirement System of Texas and the National Social Security Fund of China.[6] For its private clients, Neuberger Berman also provides financial planning, fiduciary services, and trust services. Known as a firm of investors, the firm has maintained a 97% retention rate among its senior investment teams since 2009,[7] and has been recognized for its distinctive firm culture.[8][9]
History[edit]
Neuberger Berman was founded as "Neuberger & Berman" in 1939, by Roy R. Neuberger and Robert Berman.
In the decades that followed its founding, the firm's growth mirrored that of the asset-management industry as a whole. Its success in managing separate accounts, led it to establish the Guardian Fund, in 1950, one of the first no-load mutual funds in the United States. Today, the firm’s complex of open and closed-end mutual funds, includes other well-known funds, including Century Fund (renamed Large Cap Disciplined Growth Fund) and Genesis Fund. In the 1960s, the firm expanded into the management of pension plans and assets of other institutions.




Pre-Lehman bankruptcy logo


After 60 years as a private firm, in October 1999, Neuberger Berman conducted an initial public offering of its shares and commenced trading on the New York Stock Exchange, under the ticker symbol "NEU". With the firm's IPO, Larry Zicklin, who had joined the firm in 1969, retired as Chairman of its executive committee. He was succeeded as Chief Executive Officer by Jeffrey B. Lane.
Lehman Brothers acquisition and bankruptcy[edit]
In July 2003, shortly after the retired Mr. Neuberger's 100th birthday, the company announced that it was in merger discussions with Lehman Brothers. These discussions ultimately resulted in the firm's acquisition by Lehman on October 31, 2003, for approximately $2.63 billion in cash and securities, or approximately 26 times earnings.[10] That transaction closed in October 2003 and from that time, until 2008, Neuberger Berman served as one of the asset management arms of Lehman Brothers’ Investment Management Division. In that same year, Lehman acquired fixed income manager Lincoln Capital Fixed Income Management and private equity manager Crossroads Group.[11]
Management Buyout[edit]
On September 15, 2008, virtually unprecedented volatility in global securities markets resulted in Lehman Brothers’ collapse and bankruptcy filing. Neuberger Berman continued to operate, notwithstanding Lehman’s bankruptcy and sought opportunities to spin itself off from its parent. On September 29, 2008, Lehman agreed to sell its asset management businesses, including Neuberger Berman, to a pair of private-equity firms, Bain Capital Partners and Hellman & Friedman. The transaction was expected to close in early 2009;[12] however, a competing bid was entered by the firm's management, who ultimately prevailed in a bankruptcy auction held on December 3, topping the deal with Bain and Hellman.[13] The firm spun itself off in May 2009, in a transaction recognized by Fund Industry Intelligence as Deal of the Year.[14] Lehman Brothers' creditors initially retained a 49% common equity interest in the firm and a $875 million preferred equity stake.[13] with a coupon that climbed to 12% over three years. The preferred equity position was fully repaid in 2012.[15][16] The new entity, including Neuberger, Lincoln Capital, and Crossroads, was named Neuberger Berman Group LLC.[17] Under employee control, Larry Zicklin rejoined the firm as a member of the Board of Directors. Lehman Brothers creditors have received over $1.5 billion from the employees of Neuberger Berman, dwarfing the proceeds paid by Barclays and Nomura for businesses representing 90% of Lehman Brothers employees.[18]
Independence and Expansion[edit]
Since its reemergence as an independent firm, Neuberger Berman has enjoyed a period of sustained growth. The firm increased its assets under management 14% per year from 2010 to 2014,[19] reaching $250 billion,[20] which placed the firm at the top of its peer group by asset growth.[19] The firm currently employs approximately 2,000 people,[20] and has expanded beyond its traditional equity focus into the growing areas of emerging markets debt,[21] high-yield bonds,[22] liquid alternatives and private equity,[23][24] among other strategies. During this period the firm expanded its global presence, adding coverage offices in key Asia-Pacific markets and elsewhere to be closer to a growing overseas client base.[25]
The end of 2014 marked Neuberger Berman’s return to full employee ownership, highlighting the firm’s independence and clearing the path for future growth.[26][27] Employee ownership has been recognized by industry leaders as a key factor in the success of asset management firms, and Neuberger Berman’s position as an employee-owned firm is cited as a reason for its high talent retention rate.[28] In recognition of its culture, Neuberger Berman won the top rank in its category on Pensions & Investments' 2016 Best Places to Work in Money Management survey,[2] and had been named to the Best Places list in 2013, 2014, and 2015.[29][30][31]

In addition, the firm has approximately 28 other offices in key countries around the world. Regional headquarters are in Hong Kong, London and Tokyo, and has additional primary portfolio management centers in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Milan, The Hague and Singapore.[34][33]
Former headquarters in New York City include 605 Third Avenue,[32] 522 Fifth Avenue and, originally, The Biltmore Hotel.[35]
Philanthropy[edit]
Collectively, Neuberger Berman’s philanthropic efforts are called NB Impacts. NB Impacts includes both employee community service and the grant-making actions of the Neuberger Berman Foundation.[36] The Neuberger Berman Foundation offers grants focusing on at-risk children, youth educational programs, and economic sustainability.[37][38][39][40]
Neuberger Berman conducts an annual week-long program in the spring called “Celebration with Service,” which holds community service events in the cities where the firm has offices.[36][41][42] For its 75th anniversary year in 2014, the firm’s “Celebration with Service” supported 75 volunteer projects worldwide.[36] Since 2012, NB Impacts has deployed more than 4,500 volunteers to work with over 5,000 youth and 800 senior citizens, and also includes approximately 2,000 volunteer hours spent on improving parks and community spaces.[36][43] Through the years, some of the programs Neuberger Berman has been involved in are: The Y,[44] Homes for Heroes,[45] Per Scholas,[46] C-CAP,[47] New York City Service,[48][49] and Habitat for Humanity.[50]
Corporate art collection[edit]
Contemporary art in the workplace has been part of Neuberger Berman’s corporate culture since 1939, when renowned collector Roy Neuberger co-founded the investment firm.[51] In 1990 the firm began developing its own art collection.[52][53] The firm's corporate art collection was absorbed into the Lehman Brothers collection but Neuberger Berman repurchased many of them when the collection was sold at auction in 2010.[54] Today, the Neuberger Berman Collection supports the work of contemporary artists, prominently displaying their work in the firm’s hallways, reception areas and meeting rooms.[51] The collection creates a stimulating and enriching environment for both employees and visitors.
