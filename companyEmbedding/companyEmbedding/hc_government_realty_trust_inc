SARASOTA, Fla., July  25, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HC Government Realty Trust Inc.

The quarterly dividend was payable on July 14, 2017, to stockholders of record at the close of business on July 11, 2017. “On behalf of our Board, we are pleased to declare our 3rd consecutive quarterly dividend since the creation of HC Government Realty Trust. During the quarter, we continued to execute against our business plan highlighted by the closing our initial escrow and expanding our investor base as we capitalize on the steady and predictable cash flows generated by Government Services Administration-leased properties, all of which are backed by the full credit of the United States. Through the acquisition of additional properties, such as the two acquired in the first half of the year, the Company remains committed to further building its business, portfolio of assets, and delivering what we believe is superior risk-adjusted income to our investors,” said Edwin M. Stanton, Chief Executive Officer and Director of HC Government Realty Trust Inc. The quarterly dividend payment is in-line with the Company’s communicated intent to provide investors with a $0.55 per share annual dividend and the Company is in position to continue with such payments. The next quarterly dividend will be in October 2017.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Property located at 3381 Atlanta Highway in Montgomery, Alabama
HC Government Realty Trust





SARASOTA, Fla., June  20, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HC Government Realty Trust Inc. (“HCGRT” or “the Company”), today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire its latest U.S General Services Administration (“GSA”)-leased commercial property. The new property, the first acquired by the Company in the State of Alabama, is a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (CIS) field office located in Montgomery. The tenant currently occupies 16,036 sq. ft. out of the total 21,116 sq. ft. available in the single-story property. It is anticipated the tenant will take occupancy of the remaining 5,080 sq. ft. in the next 12-18 months. It is located at 3381 Atlanta Highway, Montgomery, Alabama, and was purchased from Cushman & Wakefield. The property is 100% leased to the United States of America through December 2031. The CIS Montgomery office currently serves as the USCIS headquarters for the entire State of Alabama. The aggregate purchase price of the property is approximately $4.8 million and closing of the transaction is scheduled on or about July 30, 2017. As with all GSA properties, the lease is backed by the full faith and credit obligation of the United States of America. “CIS Montgomery, the first in the State of Alabama, is the latest example of the many GSA properties that we have identified that fits the requirements of our asset acquisition program. Serving as the HQ for the entire State of Alabama and having recently been renovated and secured under a new 15-year lease, CIS Montgomery has all the elements which make it an attractive and valuable addition to our growing portfolio,” said Edwin M. Stanton, Chief Executive Officer and Director of HC Government Realty Trust Inc. A photo accompanying this announcement is available at http://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/1f648610-4527-4901-a4e8-168ea55df271 In connection with the sale of approximately $4 million of common stock since May 22, 2017 under the Company’s Regulation A+ Offering Statement under Title IV of the JOBS Act, the ownership interests in seven GSA properties owned by affiliate and sponsor Holmwood Capital, LLC., were contributed to the Company’s real estate portfolio. The contributed properties have aggregate Rentable Square Feet (RSF) in excess of 104,000 and currently house GSA tenants including the CIS, FBI, Social Security Administration, and Customs and Border Protection, among others, and bring the total number of properties in the HCGRT portfolio to 12, comprising over 210,000 RSF (approximately 230,000 RSF with the inclusion of CIS Montgomery). The Company’s strategy is to acquire and operate GSA properties that fulfill mission-critical or direct citizen service functions primarily located across secondary or smaller markets. HCGRT has identified more than 1,300 potential acquisition targets which fall within size ranges of 5,000-50,000 rentable square feet, and within their first term after construction or retrofitted to post-9/11 standards. As of Fiscal Year 2014, the six largest customers of GSA-leased inventory were the Department of Justice, Department of Homeland Security, Social Security Administration, Department of the Treasury, Department of Health & Human Services, and the Department of Defense. Robert R. Kaplan, Jr., President of HC Government Realty Trust Inc., added, “Our business plan is built around the unique investment opportunity of GSA-leased properties and their potential to generate superior risk-adjusted returns. The addition of CIS Montgomery and the seven newly contributed GSA properties are important milestones, ones that we believe will significantly increase the value and cashflow of our portfolio. With these new proprieties, and others in our pipeline, we are committed to further building our REIT and generating value for our growing base of shareholders.” About HC Government Realty Trust, Inc.HC Government Realty Trust, Inc. was formed in 2016 with the purpose of acquiring and operating GSA properties, which are full-faith credit obligations of the U.S. Government.

VIA Folio - HC Government Realty Trust, Inc.








 HC Government Realty Trust, Inc. 







Company
HC Government Realty Trust, Inc. ("HCGR"), acquires, owns, and operates single-tenant, built/improved-to-suit properties leased by the United States of America, primarily through the U.S. General Services Administration ("GSA"). HCGR intends to qualify to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ("REIT"). We are offering up to $30 million in common stock to fund the acquisition of federally-leased properties providing mission-critical and/or citizen service functions, as well as general working capital needs. HCGR intends to target an initial annual dividend of 5.5%, which may be funded in part from offering proceeds. The offering is being conducted pursuant to Tier 2 of Regulation A.
Investment Offering 
Strong Built-in Cash Flow with the United States as Tenant: Leases associated with target assets are full faith and credit obligations of the United States and are not subject to the risk of annual appropriations. Federal government, single tenant lease renewal rates are high at 95% for first generation, single-tenant, built-to-suit properties. Average duration of occupancy is 25 years.
Highly Fragmented Market Leads to Attractive Risk-Adjusted Returns: Target assets are owned predominately by small, regional owners and developers, making that sector of this market highly fragmented. GSA-leased properties currently trade at an average cap rate of 7.25% compared to 4.5% to 5.5% for investment grade, single-tenant, triple net leased properties, and a 10-year U.S. Treasury bond yield of less than 2%.
Large Inventory of Targeted Assets: Over 1,300 GSA-leased properties in our targeted size throughout U.S. HCGR looks to mitigate lease renewal risk by owning specialized, mission-critical and customer service functioned properties, as well as portfolio diversification by agency, location and staggered lease expirations.
Experienced and Aligned Senior Management Team: HCGR's management experience in sourcing, developing, financing, owning, managing, and leasing government properties, including federal government-leased properties, aggregates over 110 years and $3 billion, with relationships to owners, developers, brokers and lenders, allowing for off-market or limited-competitive acquisition opportunities at attractive cap rates. Management also has a significant equity stake and much of compensation is paid in equity, rather than cash.
Public Company Discipline: HCGR will be governed by a majority independent Board of Directors, including the former CEO’s of Miller/Coors and Walmart Stores, and the CFO of First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc. HCGR intends to apply for quotation of its common stock on OTCQX Marketplace once the offering is closed.
Existing, High Quality Portfolio of Government Leased Assets: HCGR owns, or will own as of the initial closing of the offering, a portfolio of ten single-tenant, 100% federal government-leased properties, totaling approximately 155,000 rentable square feet and an annual combined base rent of $4.7 million.
