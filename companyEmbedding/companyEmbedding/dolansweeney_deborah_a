Cablevision Systems CEO James Dolan announced a realignment of its senior leadership Tuesday and is keeping it mostly in the family, elevating his wife and long-time executive Kristin Dolan to president of Optimum Services and his brother-in-law and MSO veteran Brian Sweeney to senior executive vice president, strategy.
The moves, Cablevision said, are part of an effort to accelerate its transformation into a more customer-focused organization and streamline the day-to-day management decision-making processes. All of the executives will report to James Dolan.
Kristin Dolan, who most recently headed up the Bethpage, N.Y.-based MSOs new marketing and rebranding campaigns as senior executive vice president, product management, marketing and development, will head up Optimum Services. According to the company, in the expanded role she will be responsible for the entire Optimum customer experience as well as the Optimum brand positioning.  In addition to leading all product development and marketing efforts, she now will also oversee the company’s sales initiatives related to Cablevision’s Optimum TV digital cable, Optimum Online high-speed Internet and Optimum Voice products. 
Sweeney, a Cablevision director since 2005 and senior vice president of eMedia at the MSO since 2000, will oversee the corporate strategy function, including the long-term planning process, as well as the company’s key strategic growth initiatives centered on customer retention and acquisition as part of his newly created position. Sweeney, who is  married to James Dolan's sister Deborah Dolan-Sweeney, also will serve as Chief of Staff to the CEO, working closely with the entire executive leadership team.
Long-time Cablevision technology guru Wilt Hildenbrand will become senior advisor – customer care, technology and networks. In this role, he will continue to lead Cablevision’s technology strategy and evolving network architecture, including the development of next-generation consumer systems and technologies.  He will also oversee Cablevision’s customer service and field service organizations, working to develop and implement strategies to ensure a superior customer experience.
“Each of these executives brings more than two decades of experience to these new roles and they have provided exemplary leadership to Cablevision throughout their careers,” James Dolan said in a statement. “As president of Optimum Services, Kristin will draw on her proven leadership capabilities to oversee the day-to-day management of all aspects of our customer acquisition and retention initiatives, while continuing to serve as the Optimum brand steward.   With his sharp operational focus and holistic perspective, I am confident that Brian will drive greater alignment across the company on strengthening our relationship with our customers.  Wilt’s technical expertise and industry knowledge are second to none, and he will be instrumental in ensuring that Cablevision is best equipped to provide our customers with the products they want and service they deserve. 
“Working together, Kristin, Brian, Wilt and the rest of our executive leadership team will help Cablevision to drive further innovation and efficiency across our product portfolio and move us closer to our vision of delivering the highest quality experience to our customers each time they use our products or services.”
The moves come more than a year after Cablevision experienced an executive drain after the abrupt departure of former chief operating officer Tom Rutledge. Shortly after Rutledge resigned in December 2011, several top Cablevision executives left the company, including former marketing EVP Jonathan Hargis, EVP of corporate technology and engineering Jim Blackley and EVP of customer operations Kathleen Mayo.

Deborah Dolen's Lawsuit: Deborah R. Dolen aka Mabel White Fails in Attempted Lawsuit Scam










































                    Deborah Dolen's Lawsuit Scam:

					How and Why Deborah R. Dolen aka "Author" Mabel White 
					Targeted My Family 
                    

					in a
					Calculated Nonsensical, and Overly Ambitious Pro se 
					(DIY) Lawsuit Scam, and the Ugly 
                    Truth About Her  
                    


					Malicious 
					Intent, Bullying Tactics, Bogus Claims and 

 
Vexatious 
					Abuse of the Judicial System.



by 
                    Joanne Kidd, Jacksonville, FL





                    Our courts are intended to be used by actual victims 
                    seeking justice, and not for scamming, greedy individuals who are 
                    willing to abuse the legal process set up by our courts by 
					intentionally making malicious, meritless, and patently false 
					claims in an attempt to reap financial gain through monetary 
					demands of "settlement" in a game of lawsuit lottery.

					You may have even heard a [worn out] tale from this woman about 
					how she "had to sue two women"... how she had "proof".... 
					and how she was some sort of a victim. Did it sound illogical and, 
					well.... maybe even delusional-crazy? Oh, it was, but despite her 
					calculated lies and theories that were a complete deviation 
					from any recognition of sanity, Deborah Dolen 
					deliberately, and intentionally targeted my family and fabricated the entire 
					"lawsuit" charade in what was just another one of her 
					attempted scams, apparently thinking that she could publicly 
					vilify and bully us with  
					frivolous claims until we agreed to pay her to go away. This time, however, her 					plans of an easy money heist didn't 
					turn out quite as she had 
					expected...

                    The Federal Court's FINAL Judgment




                    in FAVOR of the Defendants and AGAINST Deborah Dolen.


                    There had been absolutely no provocation, no reason, and no 
					prior knowledge of who this woman was. In fact, wed never heard of this individual who called herself "Deborah R. Dolen aka 
					Mabel White" before she barged 
					straight into 
					our lives with 
                    her concocted and irrational claims in a
					vexatious pro se (DIY) lawsuit scam. 
					It didnt take long, however, after finding out that we'd 
					been targeted in her scam, to realize that 
					we were dealing with someone who was not only completely out 
					of touch with reality and not in her right mind, 
					but someone who was selfish, cruel, calculating, unprincipled, and malicious, as well. 
					(Not to mention that she was someone who was desperately 
					seeking attention.) I don't know if she is at risk for 
					delusions, or just evil, but it was more than a little concerning 
					that this person had latched on to us with her hysterical 
					claims and threats of a Federal lawsuit. With minimal research, we found that Deborah Dolen was a
 
seasoned scammer and convicted 
					felon - and she was now apparently intent on 
					targeting my family in a new scam involving a pro se 
					(representing herself) Federal lawsuit in order 
					to set up (as she boastfully named it) her "retirement fund." 
					Her problem: Even though she threatened and 
					tried her best to smear our reputations in her calculated 
					plan to attempt to extort money from us through litigation 
					for a bogus lawsuit, because we knew she could never back up 
					any of her false claims or complaints, and there would 
					eventually be a time of "put up or shut up." We 
					stood our ground and stood up to her, her threats, her 
					bullying, and her attempted lawsuit scam, and we now 
					hold a judgment against her for her "vexatious" 
					behavior" (as defined by the Federal Court). 

More Details on What Happened:



Deborah R. Dolen
                    made
                    claims that she was a victim of cyber bullying. She also claimed she 
                    was a victim of "stalking" and that she had become a new advocate against it. She promoted 
                    many false 
                    nonsensical victimization claims, loss of income claims, 
					claims of dental and health 

					deterioration (allegedly due to us), and even her 


                    inability to fit in socially - but every calculated claim 
					was a complete 
					pretense and conjured up as a part of 
                    her plan to scam, scheme, and 
                    game the legal system (pro se) while disparaging, libeling, and 
                    labeling us as her 
                    "defendants," and her "tormentors." Why? Simply 
					because we had become her latest scamming endeavor, in which 
					she was trying to force 
                    us into to paying her to go away. 


					Needing a platform for her rhetoric, being willing to consume the leniency of the 
					court, and well-knowing that no actual attorney would 
					ever involve themselves with this sort of frivolous and irresponsible 
					behavior, on a borrowed dime Dolen simply marched into court and filed her 
					nonsensical complaint as pro se.
                    She 
                    then
                    openly held it over our heads that she would ruin our 
					reputations with her lies as she continued with her [pro se] 
					lawsuit against us if we did not pay her to go away. 



                    In 
                    the end, Deborah  Dolen obviously could not and did not 
					(according to the Federal Judge) provide a scintilla of 
					proof or evidence to substantiate ANY 
                    of her outrageous claims. The only evidence this 

                    lying
                    scammer
                    provided was that 
                    it was her own conduct that fell under the definition 
					of being a stalker and a bully - and in reality, just like a 
                    textbook case of false victimization, 
                    everything she falsely claimed we were doing to her was exactly 
                    what she was doing to us. Here's the ugly truth about her 
                    attempted strong-arming game via a pro se lawsuit, her fictional 
                    claims, her delusions, her lies, and her motive.



January 
                    2009:


 
                    In late 2008, on a Topix forum where 
                    Deborah Dolen had been boasting and self proclaiming herself 
                    to be a "famous 
                    author," forum participants Googled her name and discovered her 
                    criminal history. They then ousted her on that forum as 
                    being a former prostitute and 
                    convicted felon. They posted links to newspaper articles 
                    written about 
                    her, and from there, things apparently got ugly because 
                    Dolen began denying her documented history. One of these posters, 
                    (Arden_1) had 
                    an 
                    IP location  as being in the same [very large] city 
                    where my family and I live. At some point in time, Deborah Dolen 
                    and my husband's disturbed ex

                    had made contact and became friends. This was most likely because they 
                    had both been listed on a website that featured scammers. The 
                    revenge-seeking ex  convinced    lawsuit-eager Dolen that my 
					mother, my husband, and I were the Topix posters, and she 
                    provided Dolen with our names and personal information. She 
                    baited and manipulated Dolen into doing her dirty work of

                    by portraying to Deborah Dolen that we had lots of money. 
                     
                    


                    Prior to anyone in my family even knowing that Deborah Dolen existed, but after Dolen had 
                    briefly researched (stalked) us and our assets (as she has admitted 
                    doing),  she and 
                    Ledcke devised 
                    a plan to have my husband and me named in a bogus lawsuit--simply 
                    to try and harass us and to force us into a monetary settlement. For an added act of malice, Angela 
Ledcke

 Niehoff
                    Bohrer 

					also provided 
                    Dolen with my elderly mother's name, and convinced her to 

 


                    include my elderly mother in 
                    the  lawsuit.  According to later 
                    statements made by Angela Schubart 

Ledcke

 Niehoff
                    Bohrer 

					(my husband's ex, and Dolen's 
                    partner in this endeavor), Dolen promised Ledcke that she 
                    would "get them" (us) for her. *The 
					ex 
                    had lost custody of a 17 1/2 year old daughter to my husband 
                    a few years prior and was even denied any visitation (which clearly speaks for 
                    itself). She had been obsessed with trying to "get even" with us and 
                    constantly attempted to interject herself into our lives 
					for the purpose of causing 
                    problems. This "lawsuit" endeavor must've seemed perfect for her 
                    ultimate revenge to try and tarnish our names as well as 
					"punish" us 
					financially. After all, neither of these women had anything 
					(including their reputations) and they had nothing to lose. 




Wonder what was going on?  Okay, Ill tell you in a 
                    little more detail.



In this time of a down-turned economy, 
                    many businesses are suffering. Sales are down, people aren't 
                    spending like they had been, and small businesses are taking 
                    a hit--especially home-based businesses, I would 
                    imagine. One home-based business owner was attempting a new 
                    way to supplement her income. It seems she decided to sue 
                    unsuspecting people and play a pro se lawsuit lottery game 
                    within our legal system. To most, this type of lawsuit abuse 
                    would not be an option. To one individual who had vast 
                    experience in the court because of her own experiences and 
                    felony record, the plan was to pick our pockets through the 
                    Federal court by gaming the  system and 
                    filing an unfounded pro se lawsuit while 
                    simultaneously filing for bankruptcy and naming us as creditors. 


                    When convicted felon / paralegal / pro se 
                    plaintiff 
                    Deborah R. Dolen called my [then] 84 year-old mother on the 
                    phone 



                    in mid January of 2009, 
                    she introduced herself and began to explain to my 
                    mother how people were picking on her in some online forum and 
                    calling her ugly names. 
                    She went on to say how she was a famous author (Mabel White) 
                    and how she didn't deserve to be treat in that manner. My mother had no clue who 
                    this woman was or what 
                    she was talking about, so when Dolen began to ask my mother personal questions, my 
                    mother told her that she did not know who she was and that 
                    she was not interested. At this point Deborah Dolen began a 
                    verbal assault and rampage, and she 
                    threatened my 85 year old mother by telling her that
                    she
                    had "better be interested" because she was going to be "sued 
                    in Federal Court, lose everything she owned, and be thrown out in the streets." 


                    Soon thereafter, Deborah R. Dolen aka Mabel White did file 
					her patently false and 
                    baseless lawsuit 

against my mother, 
 

                    my husband, and me, pro se in Federal Court. 
 
					Her complaint and 
					"Federal lawsuit" was nothing more than an narration 
					deficient of any support, that was based solely on her own 
					delusions. In fact, 
 
                    despite the fact that my mother had no internet access, 
					computer, means or ability to access the internet, 

 
                    this bogus and fantasy lawsuit named my elderly mother as a "Jane Doe Cyberstalker" and accused 
					her of cyberstalking, internet 
                    fraud, conspiracy, and even trademark infringement. For 
                    shock value and leverage for what would become a three-year continued 
                    attempt at extorting money from us, Deborah Dolen was also demanding a 
                    five year prison sentence for all of us - including my 
                    elderly mother! (Being pro se, Dolen obviously did not know 
                    that she couldn't make criminal claims against us.) In  this game of lawsuit 
                    lottery, Dolen named all of us as "known cyberstalkers" and 
                    was demanding hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages - 
                    falsely identifying us as the posters on Topix and making 
                    all sort of bizarre and irrational claims against us. Her 
					actions, her claims, and her theories - and even trying to 
					identify us as these online posters were so ridiculously 
					insane that they defied any boundaries of sanity! Any!

Although  
                      
                    none of us had never heard of Deborah Dolen or her "author" alias of Mabel 
                    White prior to being targeted and harassed, and 
                    although plaintiff / debtor, Deborah R. Dolen  admitted that she has had no 
                    prior business or other dealings with any of us, 
                    obviously thinking she was being cunning, after filing a 
                     
                    nonsensical pro se lawsuit against us where she was demanding close to a 
                    million dollars in damages, and prior to having us 
                    served, Dolen filed for bankruptcy (writing off close to a 
                    million dollars in unsecured bad debt) and listed each of us individually 
                    as creditors (for the amount of $1.00 each). Then, after 
                    she filed for bankruptcy, she served us with the Federal 
                    complaint. Why?  
                    Because, as she boasted, she thought she could sue us and we 
					would be unable to file an 
                    answer or counter-sue her for her devious actions against us 
                    because she would  be under the "protection" of the 
                    bankruptcy court "stay." If we (the 
                    defendants) didn't answer the lawsuit because of being named 
                    creditors, the plaintiff could potentially receive a default 
                    judgment. If we, the defendants, did answer the Federal 
                    complaint, her attempted intent was  to 
                    slap sanctions on us in bankruptcy court for violating the 
					bankruptcy "stay" of protection against creditors - even 
					though were we NOT creditors at that time. Two courts - 
                    same game, and a lot of fraud. 



 
                    After 
                    filing her Federal lawsuit, her first demand for money was 
                    immediate, and she said that if we paid her $10,000 she 
                    would drop the lawsuit against us. We refused.


 
                    At one point Dolen tried to bargain with us, and said she 
					would not file for sanctions against us IF we were to pay her 
					a few thousand dollars. (She actually 
                    made many demands of monetary "solutions" for 
                    dismissing us from her bogus lawsuit.) Her 
                    monetary demands ranged from $2,000 each to $10,000, and 
                    ended up escalating to claimed "damages" of a 
					whopping $7,000,000. 



Dolen, in 
 




her own 2009 bankruptcy affidavit, 
                    swore under penalty of perjury in Bankruptcy court that she only 
                    made (on the average) in the three consecutive years prior 
					to this latest bankruptcy, $11,000 annually in income from her 
                    claimed "fame." 
                    This filing also reflected that her annual income actually 
                    increased from $10,000 to $13,000, and yet at the 
                    same time she was swearing (under penalty of perjury) in her 
                    complaint against us in Federal Court 
                    that we caused her over $75,000 in lost income from the past 
                    year. (That amount of a $75,000 loss is the ticket to be 
                    able to file a complaint in "Federal" court.) A bold lie from 
                    Dolen? Absolutely! She banks on the court's right hand 
                    never knowing what the left hand is doing. (And 
                    surprisingly, is doesn't!)  She was confident that she could exploit the flaws in 
                    our system. (And she did!)



                    We answered with
                    counterclaims, and 
                    Dolen immediately threatened 
                    to have us sanctioned, claiming that she was under the 
                    protection of her Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and because of that, 
					we were not allowed to answer. Not answering, however, 
					would have guaranteed her a default judgment against us. 
					(That was just one of her orchestrated games with the 
					Court.) Eventually, the 
                    bankruptcy Judge informed her that from the date she filed 
                    her bankruptcy she was  
not protected from 
					her actions 
                    against us, but would be liable for those actions. After 
                    reading the case, he further cautioned her against proceeding 
                    with her  claims against us, and clearly stated that 
                    the purpose of his court was not to "protect" her from 
                    her actions or the liability resulting from them. What did debtor  Dolen hear him say? Well, 
					somehow, she interpreted and boasted 
                    in many delusional statements and additional filings that 'she won, we lost 
                    and that the Judge had "barred" our 
					counterclaims. (Go figure.) 



 
                    Deborah  Dolen went on to make her claims against us public. 
                    She posted false and libelous commentary about us on 
                    websites, in forums, and 
                    self-published press releases. She named us individually as "known cyberstalkers"  
                    and claimed we wanted to 
                    obtain notoriety and some sort of "power" by associating 
                    ourselves  with her. As a self-proclaimed maverick, she fabricated claims that we  
                     
                    
 
                    had "stalked" her, 
					and that we had other victims, as well. She fabricated allegations 
					and accusations that we had committed all sorts of internet 
					fraud, trademark infringement, criminal acts against her - 
					and more. At one point, she even published online a 
					self-written fake court order against us so that the 
					public would conclude that her stories were real.    
                     
                    

There was even one incident where 
					Deborah Dolen, in typical bully modus-operandi, emailed (harassingly) to threaten and 
					attempt to scare-tactic 
					us by claiming that the police would be "knocking down" our 
					doors at 2:00 a.m. in a raid in order to collect our 
					computers as evidence. It seemed that 
					whatever had happen to her in her miscreant past, she wished upon us, 
					and was convinced it was going to happen. (Including jail 
					time.)



					Every claim, every allegation, and in fact, the entire 
					"Federal lawsuit" 

 was a wild display of   
                     
                    
 
                    reckless irresponsibility, 

 
                    grandiose and 
                     
                    

                    persecutory 
                    delusions, intentional lies, and a vexatious attempt to 
					libel and disparage us, whereby she could then demand 
                    money from us to stop. 




So, why did Deborah Dolen 
                    target us for her lawsuit?
                    From what I learned about and read from this plaintiff since January of 2009,
                    I think this came about because of some sort of grandiose/hero complex 
                    she may have. According to my husband's ex,





 



Angela 
                    Schubart Ledcke, 
                     
                    as mentioned previously, Dolen had contacted and befriended her because they were 
                    both featured on the same online scammer site. Ledcke dangled my 
                    family like a carrot in front of someone who was greedy 
                    enough to forget logic and reasoning, and set her sights on 
                    rolling the dice and 
                    playing a game of pro se lawsuit lottery. There was no 
                    other way on earth for Deborah Dolen to know who we were, know our names, 
					our emails, and/or 
                    our personal information without the rants of her new friend 
                    and my husbands 
                    longtime bothersome ex, Angela Schubart 

Ledcke

 Niehoff
                    Bohrer. Although Ledcke 
                    eventually confessed to supplying this pro se plaintiff with our names, Dolen's 
                    original claim was that our attorney had dimed us out and 
                    that he supplied her with our names and information. The only 
                    little 
					logistical
                    problem with that was that 
                    Dolen and Ledcke were 
                    trashing us on an that Topix forum days prior to us knowing 
                    anything about Dolen and even before our we had contact him 
					as our attorney. At that time he had never heard of us.





                    Deborah Dolen's bullying wasn't exclusive to us. She threatened our 
                    attorney with a bar complaint if he did not do what she 
                    demanded! She took it to the next level and 
                    actually filed a delusion and fantasy-filled Texas Bar Complaint against 
                    him, stating 
                    under oath that he was the one who initiated her claims 
                    against us by prodding her to sue us. Her next step was to post her  "testimony" and this bar complaint on the same website as 
                    the fake court order against us, and then trash-talk, lie 
                    about, and libel our attorney 
                    continuously in public forums - eventually to 
                    the point to where our attorney was forced to file his own

                    More about this pro se plaintiff:
                    Although it has been defined as "stalking" by this 
                    deluded plaintiff, I discovered while trying to figure out 
                    just who this deranged-acting nut was who had targeted and 
                    was suing, harassing, threatening and disparaging my family, that Deborah R. Dolen (aka Deborah Ruth Harvey, 
                    Deborah R. Graves, Deborah R. Avramidis, Deborah Ruth Avamidis), 
                    has an extensive arrest, criminal, and felony 
                    record!  According to her

                    one of several defendants in a consumer fraud action filed

                    more info). 
                    

As Deborah Harvey, she was once even 
                    captured as a fugitive, tried and convicted  of racketeering in a 
                    childrens
                    

                    Spina Bifida charity scam,
                    and sentenced to a seven year prison term. It appears that 
                    while In prison, this pro se plaintiff obtained a paralegal 
                    certificate (via correspondence classes) and this may be 
                    where her illusions of being an actual attorney began.  
                    (I think this may also be where she learned and practiced 
                    the language she uses to attempt to intimidate others with 
                    her threats and legal-bully-talk, which I personally refer 
                    to as monkey-mouth-cell-gangster talk.  
                    This pro se litigant, as Deborah R. Harvey, had once been 
                    previously determined incompetent to represent herself pro 
                    se in Florida court during an appeals trial after being 
                    found guilty of felony charges.


In one instance, I discovered that 
                    she had tried this bullying 'Im going to sue you' 
                    tactic before by claiming she had the exclusive trademark 
                    for the term "soy wax." In that instance, she went so far as to pretend 
                    in a letter to be 
                    legal counsel (as D. R. Dolen) for Mabel White and another 
					inexistent "partner" (aka alias) in order to threaten and intimidate candle makers. She 
                    claimed she would haul "violators"  into Federal Court 
                    in Tampa if they used the term "soywax," but she offered to sell them 
                    permission to use the term. Now THAT, in my opinion, 
                    is just not normal!  Anyway, being a convicted felon, no 
                    wonder she changed her name to Mabel White.  
                    Sounds pure and clean, doesnt it?  



                    It seems that even "Mabel White" could not live up to honest 
                    standards, and although Dolen claims the name to be good, 
                    Mabel White Home Living has received numerous complaints 
                    over the years through the Better Business Bureau and has been the subject of 
                    several online scammer sites, reports, and consumer forums, 
                    and the defendant in at least one small claims lawsuit from 
                    Fed Ex. These 
                    complaints and concerns date back throughout the past half a 
                    dozen years, but Dolen has now claimed that  even the 
                    complaints that are from 2002 through 2007 for Mabel White 
                    Home Living (MWHL) have come from me and my family--regardless of the basic fact that we would have had no 
                    motive, had no prior business dealings with her, and didnt 
                    even know (or care) that she existed until January of 2009 when she began 
                    to harass us! Dolen, 
                    AS "Mabel White" has even posted 
                    rebuttals to many of these aged complaints against her 
                    business of Mabel White Home Living, and although they are 
                    years old she has publicly named and accused  my husband, 
                     
                    my 85-year-old mother (who doesnt own or know how to 
                    use a computer), and me for submitting them.  On the site RipOffReport.com, 
                    only moments after she emailed our attorney stating that 
                    whatever is posted on that site never comes down, as a 
                    rebuttal to a complaint from 2007, using her "trade name" of 
                    "Mabel White," Dolen posted all of our names along 
                    with her delusional accusations about us. 




                    Of course 
                    its just my opinion, but I would never do business with 
                    someone who demonstrates such unprofessional, unbalanced, and disturbing behavior. But then again, 
                    I have no interest in homemade lotions, potions, perfumes, 
					candy or coffee flavor oils - and 



                    would never purchased 


					from a business that was not 
                    licensed, reputable, and/or have FDA approval on their 
                    products. After all, these bathroom-chemist type 
                    businesses can too easily substitute canola oil as cheap 
                    fillers for essential oils, for example.




Why am I being so tacky and 
                    blogging about this?




                    No, it isnt like me, but because my family and I have been 
                    inconvenienced for several years by having our names  associated with this convicted felon, I am personally sick of 
                    Deborah Dolen's 
                     
                    lies, threats, dogmatic delusional pro se legal attacks, 
                    constant attempts to libel and disparage us, and demands of 
                    money from us. In my opinion, this woman has obviously 
                    caused her own problems because of the poor and dishonest 
                    choices she has made and continues to make in life, and 
                    neither I nor any member of my family has had anything to do 
                    with her, her history, her problems, her scams, or anything 
                    else she may dream up, claim, and sue us for.  As 
                    famous as she may think she is, she was (as is) 
                    inconsequential to us, as we had never even heard of 
                    her or her claimed trade name of Mabel White (an alias 
                    name she has 
                    used freely and directly  to libel and harass us) prior 
                    to her unwarranted attack on us.



                    What was a clear and undisputable fact in our world was that this plaintiff, prior to anyone in my 
                    family having any 
                    idea that she  existed, was conspiring against us, 
                    researching our assets, posting libelous content about us 
                    online, and had already gathered our names, address, phone 
                    numbers, personal emails, work emails, and other personal 
                    information, and yet her claim is that we had been "stalking" her!  
                    Deborah Dolen has since continued to harass my family by publishing 
                    our names and address online, posting distasteful and 
                    delusional online comments and outbursts, complete lies, 
                    libel, libel per se, and has even published a self-authored 
                    fake and unsigned court order against us. Again, go 
                    figure. 



                    I am confident that plaintiff 
"Deborah R. Dolen aka 
                    author Mabel 
                    White" 
                    must've realized at some point that her fictional claims against us 
                    had no merit whatsoever and were solely based from the 
                    unsupported claims and gossip of her only source, my husband's ex, 
                    Angela Ledcke (who has personally published online that she is 
                    a diagnosed schizophrenic). Whatever delusional 
                    entitlement this person may think she has to be able to pick 
                    someone out of thin air to sue, trash, and harass, and 
                    attempt to extort money from, she needs 
                    to face reality and realize that she made a poor decision 
                    when she attacked my family with her lawsuit lottery game. She 
					has never know anything about us, and I daresay that if she 
					had, she would be 
                    surprised to discover just who she choose to target. 


                    I am also  convinced that 
                    pride, arrogance, mean-spirited gaming and greed outweighs her ability to recognize reality 
                    and ever admit that she was completely and totally 
                    wrong in the fantasy-filled conclusions, assumptions, and allegations she made against my 
                    family, and in naming us in her ridiculous  nonsensical Federal lawsuit.  
                    







                    Follow-up.... 




July 5, 
                    2010:


Since writing about my experience in the above content on my blog, 
                    bogus 
                    lawsuit filer/pro se plaintiff Deborah R. Dolen aka author 
                    "Mabel White"  motioned the Federal Court in the middle 
                    district of Florida for injunctive relief to shut down my 
                    entire blog, and she continued to demand money from us. Although that motion was filled with more lies, complete delusions, and whatever 
                    fantasies filled her head at the time of filing, the motion 
                    was denied.  After the Court ordered her to amend her 
                    Federal complaint, she made a few more attempts at making 
                    demands from us, and even though we ignored her, she 
                    eventually dropped my family from her newest amended bogus 
                    Federal complaint. We stood up to this vexatious 
					lawsuit bully, and with any luck, 
                    plaintiff Deborah R. 
                    Dolen aka author "Mabel White" will not be able to victimize others with her 
                    vexatious pro se litigation games in the future. Aside 
                    from the fact that she often portrays herself as one of the "rich 
                    and famous," sadly, this person, as we have found through 
                    our personal experience, demonstrates a total lack of 
                    connection with reality, and in our opinion is nothing more than 
                    a bully, 
                    a nut, and a delusional wanna-be seeking attention.  
                    




October 21, 2010 - Here We Go 
                    Again...


I am always shocked that there are people who simply do not 
                    recognize the consequences of their own actions.  Dolen targeting my family in a 
                    vexatious lawsuit brought with it 
                    the consequence of me starting this blog. Because she 
                    brought my name online in order to try and trash and damage me in some way, I 
                    felt I had the right to defend my name from her 
                    delusional rants. In reality, my blog never would've 
                    existed, or at least she never would've been mentioned, 
					because after all, without the actions she took in targeting 
					us, 
                    I never would have known who she was! (She's not as "famous" in reality as she 
                    seems to be in her own mind.) It's just that simple, yet something 
                    this person does not seem to understand. Instead, she has 
					continued to blame others for her own actions, and threw a fit in Federal court because I blogged about our experience 
					of being the target of her latest scam attempt.


To continue the 
					craziness, this pro se 
                    plaintiff (Deborah Dolen) 


                    then petitioned the court to amend her lawsuit for 
                    the third time to once again add us back into her 
					"Federal complaint" of concocted allegations - simply as a 
					temper fit and to try and restrict me from using her name(s) 
					and journaling on my blog what she has done to us. She 
					seemed to think that I had no right to use the very names 
					that she so freely used in her attempts to publicly mock, 
                    disparage, bully, cyberstalk, cyber smear, harass, 
                    threaten, libel, and sue us with in bad 
                    faith. As has been her usual pattern, 
                    she added new completely crazy and concocted theories and fantasy allegations 
                    to her motion to amend. This time, she claimed and
                    


 



                    submitted an exhibit  



                    in the case that someone known as 
                    "the water filer lady" would sign a "formal 
					declaration" against us because this "water filter lady" 
					person received an 
					email from someone. (As 
					you can see from the PDF of this "email" the unknown 
					sender's name and information had been redacted from this 
					so-called "exhibit," so anyone could've sent it - 
					including our plaintiff.)  


                    In our world, we 
                    have never come across someone that could act so outrageously 
                    irrational and crazy, but I have to admit, Deborah Dolen, as "Mabel White, 
                    CEO" did  email us (during the phase of her harassment 
                    campaign where she was emailing us threats via our employers) 
					to warn us that she 
                    "can DO crazy!"

 




Excerpt from one of her harassing emails to us.



                    Even after being removed from Dolen's Federal complaint in 
					June of 2010, in 
					her attempt to further harass us, in early 2011 Dolen published several 
					online "articles" that intentionally and falsely stated that 
					we were still defendants in this case and "going to trial" 
					as "cyberstalkers." She was also publicly gloating because of having associated 
					our names with those damaging labels.
                    



                    With the 
                    exception of one [let's say] "less-than-credible" source, a website owned 
					by June Maxam, 

NorthCountryGazette.org, all other site owners, after 
                    simply reading the irrational and ridiculous article(s),  immediately, responsibly, and 
                    respectfully 
                    removed Dolen's bullying libel game from their online 
					publications. Apparently June Maxam is known for the same 
					sort of nonsensicality and for imagining herself 
					to be a "news" correspondent of some sort. When 
					asked to remove the articles she had published, Maxam, 
					ignorantly referenced Dolen's 
obsolete 
 
					complaint that the court had 


 
					previously 
 
					dismissed (removing us from as defendants from the case), 
					and insisted that I did "go to 
					trial" as a defendant! She simply responded that I was "wrong" in 
					stating that I had not been a defendant at the trail. (Some "reporter" - huh?) (I've discovered that ethics, principles, 
					and rationality all seem 
					to run scarce in the world of felons and fruitcakes.) June Maxam, through her webhost, challenged me to sue, 
					but suing 
					the insolvent seems like a senseless waste of time.





An Extra Helping of Insanity!





I personally witnessed more insane 
                    conduct in this one 
                    bogus and vexatious lawsuit filed by pro se plaintiff 
                    Deborah R. Dolen than I think I've seen collective from 
                    anyone in my lifetime. Maybe 
                    that's because by choice, I've never had any association 
                    with this type of unscrupulous person before. Some of the 
                    tactics this plaintiff has used has been beyond what anyone with 
                    an ounce of honesty and/or credibility would attempt. 
                    Although she omitted my family from her 2nd amended 
                    complaint and threatened that if we continued with our 
                    counterclaims that she would motion to add us back in, she 
                    actually seemed to believe that she could simply invent claims 
                    against us and act as though we were still included in her 
                    bogus lawsuit. In some crazy attempt to try and intimidate 
                    me, Dolen listed my ex husband on her new witness list and 
                    stated that he would testify "against my character." When 
                    asked about this, my ex said he had never even heard of 
                    Deborah R. Dolen and that he had no intention of making any 
                    statement or testimony against me. Somehow, in her own 
                    little world, she must've theorized that because he was an 
					"ex" that he would have 
                    something negative to say about me. Dolen actually included 
                    this rambling and delusional theory in one of her pleadings and even 
                    intimated that he'd left me in our marriage. As with all of 
                    her assumptions and claims, It doesn't seem to matter to her 
                    that she has absolutely no idea what she's talking about 
                    because she doesn't know anything about us.


Dolen claimed 
                    throughout the years that this case spanned that we "confused" the Federal 
                    court Judge in Texas, which resulted in the orders and decisions 
                    made in our favor in this case; that we prejudiced the mediator (and 
                    experienced criminal attorney) against her; that we 
                    "tampered" with the [imaginary] potential jury pool; that I, 
                    personally, "witness tampered" because of my blog; and 
					even that we "tainted" the Federal Court Magistrate 
                    Judge in Tampa. (All that, and yet I can't even get the 
                    postman to stop walking on my lawn!) 
                    







                    Federal Court Orders and Case Decisions in Dolen v. Ryals, 
                    et al: 



February 24, 2011 - Deborah Dolen's Lawsuit and 
                    ALL Claims 
                    Against Us Are Dismissed

For the first day in over two years my family and I are no 
                    longer 
                    being sued and harassed in Federal court by pro se plaintiff 
                    Deborah R. Dolen aka "author" Mabel White in a targeted, 
                    nonsensical, and 
                    fictitious lawsuit lottery game. The Federal court ruled on the  

pleadings 
                    and ALL of Deborah Dolen's delusional and bogus claims against my family and me were 
                    DISMISSED with prejudice today in our favor and she is now barred from ever making those 
                    claims against us again.
                    (Predictably, she somehow thought and immediately boasted in 
                    an email to our attorney that this 
                    decision was in her favor.) As the Federal Court order stated about 
                    claim-thrower Deborah R. Dolen's "tortuous action," "enough is enough."  







                    Order of Dismissal  


                    Our counterclaims were dismissed in that case, but were 
                    dismissed without prejudice, allowing us to reassert them in 
                    a separate action when and where we choose. There wouldn't 
					be much use for this, however, because Dolen is what the 
					courts commonly refer to as a 
"insolvent defendant." Simply put, she 
					has nothing.





                    Deborah Dolen's Lawsuit is DISMISSED at Trial by Federal 
                    Judge:
                    April 21, 2011 - Julie Ryals Receives a Judgment AGAINST Deborah 
                    R. Dolen 
                    and ALL of Dolen's Claims  Are DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE!




                    Deborah Dolen's  vexatious and nonsensical lawsuit against Julie Ryals came 
                    to trial before the Federal Court in Tampa, Florida, on April 18, 2011. The issues were 
                    set before a jury. On the third day of the trial, after 
                    Deborah Dolen completed her performance as ringmaster for 
                    her own dog and pony show, in response to a verbal motion by Julie 
                    Ryals' attorney, the 
                    Federal Judge made a decision based on the case presented 
                    and immediately dismissed all of Deborah Dolen's 
                    claims against Julie Ryals WITH PREJUDICE. (Meaning 
                    that Dolen cannot bring those claims again.)



                    The Federal Judge in Tampa told Dolen that she [quote] did not show even the most minuscule 
                    ounce of proof to her claims. Dolen had said in 
                    published media interviews she had created by interviewing
                    herself that she would not "fall into the sand trap" 
                    of having to provide proof of her unsupported allegations, but would instead 
                    bring in her own witnesses to simply testify "the old 
                    fashioned way." Because Dolen HAD no proof, but had 
                    been bulldozing through this case with only threats, 
                    bullying, and 
                    meritless and unsupported accusations, it was no surprise that this desperate plan was actually put into 
                    play. Dolen introduced the 
                    testimonies of Annette Bartowsheski (aka Annette Lahr), 
					from Minnesota, and Sheryl 
                     
                    Farley (aka Sherry Lynn Farley) of Bradenton, FL - two 
                    anonymous and scripted "witnesses" that Dolen brought in off 
					the streets, who were willing to lie and perjure themselves in Federal Court 
					for her cause. (I have to wonder if they realized while 
					"testifying" under oath and the penalty of perjury, that the 
					scripting they received from Dolen was overheard, and that 
					Dolen had also confided in a "friend" who shared their 
					plan.) In addition to the scripted "testimony" agenda, 
                    Annette Bartowsheski (Annette Lahr) seemed to think it 
					worthy to point out to the Federal Judge that she didn't 
					think it was fair that I hadn't published a negative (ugly) comment 
					that she submitted to my blog. (Her comment, 
					by the way, was the ONLY negative/ugly comment I have ever 
					received, and it was one that fell into the "irrational nutcase" category.) Bartowsheski 
					(Lahr) also, via her affidavit and testimony, stated 
                    and complained to the Federal Court that my blog was 
                    "too long." I suppose I was unaware that this was a Federal 
                    Court-worthy issue or offense, but like I said, "irrational 
					nutcase."  

					"Witness" Sherry Farley, clearly not in her right 
					mind, was even less rational, and in addition 
                    to her testimony being completely off-the-wall crazy, she told the court that her 
                    deceased mother had spoken to her (by way of a tree falling on her 
                    house), and told her to "help Deborah Dolen." 




                    Despite these witnesses' and ridiculous testimonial scripts and transparent attempts to 
                    manufacture the necessary evidence by inventing it on the stand (aka perjury), 
                    the Federal Judge dismissed their foolery and disciplined Dolen,  stating 
                    that she had an "infinitesimal-infinity chance of prevailing in this case." 
                    (Direct quote) When Dolen uttered 
                    a confused "a-wha?" the Federal Judge 

                    clarified by saying that Dolen had a snowballs chance in 
                    Hell of prevailing on ANY claims made against Mrs. Ryals. 
                    (Another direct quote)
                    He further instructed pro se plaintiff Deborah R. Dolen aka 
                    Mabel White that she is forbidden from 
                    ever bringing any claims she made or could have made against 
                    Julie Ryals in this case in the future in ANY court, 
                    therefore, dismissing ALL claims against Julie Ryals by Deborah Dolen WITH 
                    PREJUDICE! 

Pending was Julie 
                    Ryals' counterclaim of cybersquatting for the domain 
                    julieryals.com, which Dolen had originally purchased at the 
                    onset of this "lawsuit" endeavor 
                    to use 
                    as a tool for libeling, name-calling, and attempting to 
                    extort a cash settlement in the case. Dolen had kept this domain 
                    for 26 months, until eventually abandoning the domain 
                    and letting it expire - at which time  

 


                    julieryals.com was recovered by 
                    Julie Ryals. Because this ($12.00) counter claim was at this 
                    point moot, 
                    it was also dismissed.




                    The Federal Court's Final Decision in Deborah Dolen's 
                    Vexatious Lawsuit:


"IT 
                    IS 











ORDERED AND  



 ADJUDGED that 
                    Judgment is entered

                    FOR Julie Ryals on ALL 
                    Deborah R. Dolens claims." 



                    Despite Deborah Dolen's continued delusions of the outcome 
                    of her fictional lawsuit, the orders of the court speak for 
                    themselves.

                    Dolen in this email was referencing her [calculated]

                    Court Finds that Pro se Litigant Deborah Dolen Engaged in 
                    Vexatious Conduct



                    [Vexatious conduct, as defined by the court, is 
                    conduct that is an 

                    abuse of the judicial process
and serves merely to harass or maliciously 
                    injure another party to the civil action.]



                    "...the Plaintiff makes several baseless arguments, cites to 
                    inapplicable case law, and most importantly, does not refute 
                    the Defendants allegations concerning her alleged vexatious 
                    litigation tactics. After a review of the procedural history 
                    of this case, it is clear that the Plaintiff engaged in 
                    vexatious and unreasonable conduct that multiplied the 
                    proceedings."

                    Deborah Dolen Files Affidavit of Indigency to Proceed in 
                    Appeals Court  




                    Even after all of her claims had been dismissed and 
                    unproven, Dolen continues to make her same unsupported 
                    delusions about us in an application to proceed to the 
                    appeals court and have the fees waived. This Affidavit 
                    for Indigency included a 



 





                    statement that Dolen owed her witness #2, Sheryl 
                    Farley of Bradenton close to $2,000 for "trial expenses." 
                    Was this a payment for Farley's manufactured testimony? 
                    (When Sheryl Farley wasn't paid this amount Dolen promised, 
                    she placed a lien against the title of Deborah Dolen's 
                    vehicle.)


 





                    The Final Judgment For Fees 

                    AGAINST 
                    Plaintiff, Deborah R. Dolen 

                     March 23, 2012


                    Although it probably goes without saying, the simple fact that 
                    Deborah Dolen remained pro se throughout the history 
                    of this extortion attempt case is another indication of how 
                    baseless and unfounded her claims were and are. If her 
                    claims had held any merit or truth, contingency attorneys 
                    wouldve been lined up to jump on the case. Instead, they 
                    continued to warn her of her liability in pursuing  as did 
                    the various judges involved. 


                    I have to wonder if the plan to "get" us, coaxed by Dolen's 
                    abettor, Angela Schubart Ledcke, was worth it for her. She 
                    has built up such massive hatred toward us because we 
                    refused to be bullied, that I doubt if she has yet to 
                    realize how she was played by Ledcke and/or the [permanent] 
                    impact this entire endeavor has had and will have on her. 
                    I'd be willing to expect that she will never allow herself 
                    to digest the actual reality of her ruin or why we now hold 
                    a 
 





                    judgment lien against 


her.

                    So, Who Was Arden_1?
                    (Post-Final Judgment Posting)
                    

                    Topix poster Arden_1 was actually Suzanne Rossignol, a young 
                    woman from Lake City, Florida. I found this out 
                    
early in 
                    the case in 2009 through a 
                    simple method of Googling her Topix screen name that 
					included her email via her Topix profile, and then doing a search on Facebook using that email. This 
                    was something so simple, and something pro se plaintiff Dolen could have and 
                    should have easily done before suing me in Federal court 
					because of her lamebrain assumption that I was this Topix poster. Its called due diligence! This is 
                    one more reason why the attack on my family was calculated, 
					and nothing short of an act of revenge 
                    instigated by my husbands ex, and carried out by her greedy, scamming, convicted 
                    felon friend who had nothing to lose, and what she thought 
                    would be everything to gain. 

                    After discovering who Arden_1 actually 
                    was, I called Suzanne to suggest that she stop acting in such a 
                    reckless and irresponsible manner online, and told her that if I was able to 
                    find her real identity and contact information so easily, 
                    that anyone could. At first she was frightened by my call, 
                    but I 
                    told her that it was Dolens responsibility to discover who 
                    she was and assured her that I would not personally 
                    volunteer her identity during the case. Her response was 
                    something that I still find to be astounding. She told me 
                    that she comes from a good family and that her 
                    actions on Topix would affect that good familys good 
                    standing if they were to find out how she had been behaving. 
                    (Apparently, my family was somehow perceived to be inferior, 
                    I suppose, so it was okay for me to take the blame for her 
					words and behavior.) Although Dolen did 
                    eventually discover Arden_1s true identity during the case, 
                    she was too far into it (and her extortion attempts) to 
                    admit it. Arden_1 being someone else wasnt part of Dolen 
                    and Ledckes plan. Suzanne never came forward, and she let me 
                    take the full consequences and backlash for
                    her actions. Thankfully, my family's good name 
					was outstanding enough to bear up.

A NEW Theory!
					Yes, in 2012, Deborah Dolen came up with another new theory and 
					hysterically claimed "proof" of who was behind the online nonsense, 
					claiming that we were in cahoots with her ex boyfriend (the 
					one who paid her $30,000 to get out of his life). Apparently, 
					Deborah Dolen and this man's latest ex had become buds and this ex, 
					Jennifer Coppock-Beauseigle personally emailed me with a "bait" 
					question, inquiring if I had any diabetic recipes. (Huh? I'm 
					not diabetic...) My 
					response to her was clear and concise in saying that I found it less of a coincidence 
					that she had contacted me, as I recognized her last name as 
					being the name on my caller ID when Dolen was using their 
					ex's cell phone to call and harass us (It's a rare last 
					name, and one that I remembered.) and I asked her what her 
					intent was behind the email. My reply was apparently 
					shared with Dolen by this woman and they 
					whirl-winded a new theory that this ex of theirs had paid my family 
					and me to go after Dolen. (I never realized how many 
					lunatics were lurking out there.)

If nothing else had convinced us 
					that this Deborah Dolen woman was completely unhinged and a 
					delusional nutcase, this did the 
					trick! She can pretend all she wants online that she is "famous" 
					and "important" and even that she is now "saved" and a 
					"Christian." In real life, we've seen nothing but evil exuding from this 
					woman in every way, and we've experienced the truth. In my opinion, a 
					genuinely "saved" person would have humbled themselves 
					without hesitation and admitted that their intent, abuse, 
					and actions against us were wrong, and a "saved" person 
					would have, without question, made some effort to 
					reconcile their wrong-doing and devil-spirited intentions against us. Instead, Deborah Dolen has continued to 
					lie about her intent, ignore 
					our judgment against her, bash our names, and has 
					even gone on to sue others in her quest for monetary 
					settlement(s).
