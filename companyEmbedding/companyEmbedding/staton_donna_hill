23May. ’15



Dr. Charlene Dukes removed from MSDE by Governor Larry Hogan




In our opinion, We aver and therefore believe Maryland State Board of Education President Dr. Charlene Dukes (shown here) has demonstrated a culture of corrupt leadership style and continues “an integrated pattern of pay to play,” High suspension rates, violation of due process rights, manipulation inter alia during her tenure as President for Maryland State Board of Education.
The Maryland State Board of Education welcomed two new members on May 19th, 2015. Chester E. Finn, Jr., Ed.D. of Montgomery County and Andy Smarick of Queen Anne’s County were appointed by Governor Larry Hogan to fill two seats on the 12-member board vacated by the departures of Charlene M. Dukes, Ed.D. and Donna Hill Staton, Esq., whose terms ended in 2014 but had been staying on illegally.
During the tenures of Dr. Dukes and Ms. Hill Staton, the State Board established a record of cover up and corruption in the state level that negatively impacted students in a variety of ways and staff. Dr. Dukes was appointed in April 2007 to serve out the remainder of a previous board member’s term and was reappointed in July 2010 under unclear circumstances.  She served for three years as vice president of the Board and was elected Board President in July 2012 in a suspicious manner and again in 2013 and 2014.
Ms. Staton was appointed in April 2009 to serve out the remainder of a previous board member’s term and was reappointed in July 2010. Ms. Staton was in many ways a voice of reason and she will be missed.
On another note, during the tenure of Dr. Dukes, the State Board of Education experienced a variety of long-term student suspensions and expulsions, and only revised its school disciplinary regulations to focus on keeping students in schools and connected to learning after pressure from activists. Her product is very clear in the streets of Baltimore where riots were experienced recently.
In short, Dr. Dukes was racist and discriminatory during her tenure with the Board and supported institutionalized racism. She will never be missed by many who know her illegal activities. Above all, Dr. Dukes continues a culture of corruption involving public funds meant for Prince George’s County Public Schools (PGCPS). She has been manipulative in a variety of ways and an embarrassment to Prince George’s County. It is her illegal actions and shenanigans which will cost the county schools close to more than a $100 million and possible tax hikes fronted by County Executive Rushern Baker III.

Donna Hill Staton | Closure for Donna Hill Staton Howard's first black judge: Job with attorney general lets her continue in public sector. - tribunedigital-baltimoresun






 


Home→Collections→Attorney GeneralClosure for Donna Hill Staton Howard's first black judge: Job with attorney general lets her continue in public sector.January 29, 1997A SWEET ENDING to a bitter chapter in Howard County's legal and political history occurred this month when former Judge Donna Hill Staton was appointed to a high-level post in the Maryland attorney general's office. Although critical issues about the county's judiciary remain unresolved, questions surrounding Ms. Hill Staton's future have been answered.Ms. Hill Staton, the first African American judge in Howard before being defeated at the polls last fall, becomes one of Attorney General J. Joseph Curran's two deputies. Her year on the bench demonstrated why citizens are fortunate to have her continue in the public sector.Her new job should have enough challenges to test her legal mettle, minus the political nonsense she encountered after being selected for the Circuit Court in 1995. This time last year, Ms. Hill Staton and her running mate, Judge Diane O. Leasure, were reeling from propaganda attacks on their competence and character. Male judges in the county, even with a controversial verdict or two under their belts, don't endure the fierce challenges these two did.Through it all, both women maintained their dignity. After Ms. Hill Staton lost her bid to retain her seat in the election, she was disappointed but displayed class and grace.She says she entertained "a universe of job offers" from private firms and considered applying for the two recent vacancies on Howard's District Court, one of which has not been filled. She instead accepted a job that probably pays less than many other options, about $82,000 a year. She earned more as a partner at the prestigious Baltimore law firm of Piper & Marbury, where she worked before her appointment to the bench.In her new job, Ms. Hill Staton will advise state agencies, perform some litigation work and help train staff attorneys. The job also broadens her options for the future, which could include a return to the judiciary. Among those who have served as deputy attorneys general are Howard Circuit Judge Dennis M. Sweeney and U.S. Attorney Lynne A. Battaglia.Her year on the circuit bench should serve her well as a deputy attorney general. She will use her legal skills to work for the citizens of Howard County and Maryland, albeit without the robe.Pub Date: 1/29/97

About Peer Rating
Martindale-Hubbell® Peer Review Ratings™ are the gold standard in attorney ratings, and have been for more than a century. These ratings indicate attorneys who are widely respected by their peers for their ethical standards and legal expertise in a specific area of practice.


The Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings process is the gold standard due to its objectivity and comprehensiveness. Lawyers solicited for peer reviews include both those selected by the attorney being reviewed and lawyers independently selected by Martindale-Hubbell. All reviewers are verified as attorneys through Martindale-Hubbell's extensive attorney database. Only attorneys practicing at least three years and receiving a sufficient number of reviews from non-affiliated attorneys are eligible to receive a Rating.
What are the different Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings?
AV Preeminent®: The highest peer rating standard. This rating signifies that a large number of the lawyer's peers rank him or her at the highest level of professional excellence for their legal knowledge, communication skills and ethical standards.
Distinguished: An excellent rating for a lawyer with some experience. This rating indicates the attorney is widely respected by their peers for high professional achievement and ethical standards.
Notable: This rating indicates that the lawyer has been recognized by a large number of their peers for strong ethical standards.
Lawyers who have received peer reviews after 2009 will display more detailed information, including practice areas, summary ratings, detailed numeric ratings and written feedback (if available). Details for individual reviews received before 2009 are not displayed.
Attorneys that receive reviews from their peers, but not a sufficient number to establish a Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Rating, will have those reviews display on our websites.

About Client Rating
The Martindale-Hubbell® Client Review Ratings™ display reviews submitted by clients of lawyers and law firms.


The Client Review Rating score is determined through aggregation of validated responses. People who submit reviews are clients of law firms who hired a lawyer within the last year, whose matter is not pending and who want to share their experience of that lawyer or law firm with other potential clients. Reviewers can be anyone who hires a lawyer including in-house counsel, corporate executives, small business owners and private individuals.
Martindale-Hubbell validates that the reviewer is a person with a valid email address. As part of the review process, respondents must affirm that they have been a client of the lawyer or law firm identified within the past year, although Martindale-Hubbell cannot confirm the lawyer/client relationship as it is often confidential. The content of the responses are entirely from client reviewers.
Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome and Martindale-Hubbell accepts no responsibility for the content or accuracy of any review.

Donna Hill Staton MSA SC 3520-12376

(Biographical Series)

Donna Hill Staton
MSA SC 3520-12376
Extended Biography:
Donna Hill Staton wanted to be a lawyer since age 12.1
Not only did she succeed in this goal, but in 1995 she made history by
becoming the first African-American judge in Howard County,  winning
appointment to the Howard County Circuit Court.  Although her appointment
was much celebrated, her judicial tenure ended in controversy as she lost
her position the next year in an election in which many alleged racism
was a factor.2 African-American advocates were somewhat mollified
the following year  when Alice Pollard Clark was appointed to the
District Court for Howard County.  Staton also rebounded from the
1995 defeat, quickly obtaining a high-profile job in the Maryland Attorney
General's office, thus continuing her successful career.
Staton was born in Chester, Pennsylvania, on December 5, 1957. 
Her family moved to Howard County, Maryland in 1969, and she attended Wilde
Lake High School, playing for the school's basketball team and running
track.  She went on to earn her bachelor's degree in English from
Princeton University in 1979 and her law degree from the National Law Center
at George Washington University in 1982.  That same year she was admitted
to the Maryland bar.
After gaining practical experience as a law clerk to Judge Joseph
C. Howard, U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, Staton was
hired as an associate and later a litigation partner with Piper & Marbury. 
There she handled mostly commercial cases, representing Fortune 500 companies
as well as small businesses.  In addition, Staton represented abused
and neglected children on a pro bono basis.  She became the first
African-American woman at the firm to be promoted from associate to partner.3
During these years, Staton became actively involved with a number
of professional and community organizations.  She continued to serve
on the board of directors for the Howard County Sexual Assault Center and
was elected vice-president and then president of the Alliance of Black
Women Attorneys.  Later she served on the board of governors and committee
on laws for the Maryland State Bar Association, and was a member of the
Attorney Grievance Commission and the Advisory Committee to the U.S. District
Court for Maryland.  Staton has also given back to the community,
serving on the Business Advisory Council for the College of Notre Dame
of Maryland, on the Board of Trustees for the McDonough School, and on
the board of directors for Leadership Howard County, and as a member of
the William T. Walters Association and the Beyond Bars Community Advisory
Committee for the Girl Scouts.  She has also participated in Goucher
College's Mentor Program.4
All of Staton's contributions made her a logical choice for the Howard
County Circuit Court.  She was appointed to the bench in 1995, becoming
the county's first black judge.  Her stay there was brief, however,
as she was ousted from office in the 1996 election.  Voters dismissed
Staton, electing in her place Lenore Gelfman, a popular District Court
judge.  Although Gelfman denied it, Staton's supporters claimed the
winning judge's campaign was tinged with racism.  Governor Parris
Glendening had created a special commission to increase diversity in Maryland's
judiciary, and Staton's opponents alleged that her appointment was based
on politics (and race) rather than qualifications.5
Although Staton lost the election and her seat on the bench, many
recognized that she was an exceptional lawyer.  In another "first,"
she was offered and accepted a job as deputy attorney general for Maryland,
making her the first African-American woman to hold that position. 
The job also allowed Staton to fulfill her desire to stay in public service. 
Attorney General J. Joseph Curran Jr. expressed his satisfaction with Staton's
decision:  "We're just delighted to have a superior legal talent." 
As deputy attorney general, Staton is responsible for managing over 100
lawyers in about 25 areas of state government, including the Maryland Stadium
Authority and the Transportation Department.6
Staton continues to enjoy success in professionally and personally. 
In 2000 she was recognized by The Daily Record as one of Maryland's
Top 100 Women.  She is happily married and has two daughters. 
She remains a vital member of the legal community and will always have
the honor of having been the first African-American judge in Howard County.
