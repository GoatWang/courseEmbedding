Gabriel Collaboration Suite
Our Gabriel Collaboration Suite is an integrated set of real-time communication and collaboration applications built on top of the Gabriel Security Platform. The applications are accessible to the user through a single Graphical User Interface (GUI), offering a uniform user experience across all devices and operating systems.  The collaboration applications can run effectively as a single application and perform multiple functions simultaneously.  The real-time collaboration integrates multiple communications services, which include:

Secure Messaging with file sending and screen sharing (platform permitting),
Secure Group Messaging,
Secure Voice/Video Chat, and
Secure Mail

Additionally, Gabriel offers the following integrated set of secure network services:

Security Policy Management,
Secure File Share,
Secure File Backup and Sync, and
Secure Gateway Services for securing third-party network services (e.g. web, home monitoring and security, Windows Samba file share, remote desktop, etc.)

The Security Policy Management enables the user and/or domain administrator to customize access policies on a per-peer, per-service and per-file directory basis.  Both peers, as well as the peer domain can be specified to limit access to whom a user can securely chat, email, and share files. File sharing directories can be specified as read-only or read/write for specific peers and/or peer domains.  Peers not given access will not see the presence of un-shared directories.
In addition to providing secure communication and network services, Gabriel can be installed and configured on network server and gateway devices.  Using this capability, Gabriel supports Secure Gateway Services, thereby enabling secure, authenticated access to virtually any third-party server application and/or device on the private network. This is achieved by allowing the user to specify a communication port, which forwards data packets to third-party ports and IP addresses on the private network.  These Secure Gateway Services allow home users and organizations private authenticated access to any number of private network services from anywhere on the Internet/intranet.
Gabriel provides a unified interface across all devices and platforms, by offering a common user experience among the user’s mobile and non-mobile devices. For more information or to register and install Gabriel, please visit our website at gabrielsecure.com.

GABRIEL SECURITY PLATFORM 

Gabriel Security Platform
Gabriel Security Platform is a cross-platform security infrastructure that has been created using VirnetX’s Gabriel Connect Technology.
This platform allows for creation of dynamic, on-demand secure, virtual private enclaves or Safe Neighborhoods within the Internet/intranet of authenticated devices which can now securely communicate with each other securely with end-to-end encryption.

Gabriel Enables Dynamic Secure Enclaves / Safe Neighborhoods
The Gabriel Security Platform provides the networking and cryptographic infrastructure that enables the following services:

User defined security policy,
Seamless VPN initiation,
Secure Domain Name Service (SDNS) address request lookup feature:

Automatic VPN initiation,
Remote peer secure address resolution, and
Certified peer IP reverse address lookup


Cryptographic peer authentication,
Network Address Translation (NAT) firewall discovery and relay services when needed, and
Secure peer presence discovery

Gabriel Security Platform Services
The Gabriel Security Platform implements both Registry Services and Registrar Services to register user devices, provide network presence services, and SDNS for Gabriel devices throughout the Internet/intranet, as shown in Figure below;

Gabriel Registry serves as system root CA to authenticate, register and issue signed certificates (and revoke) to Gabriel Secure Domain Registrars. Allows the registrars to locate Gabriel peer devices for cross-registrar connection services
Gabriel Registrars register Secure Domain Names as well as locate authenticated peer devices, perform multiple security and connection services through Gabriel Connect Servers and Relay Servers.

Gabriel Connect Server perform account signup and renewal, device activation and certificate signing, as well as data base services which store and retrieve account configuration data. Manages devices, register presence, on-line status of peers, perform Secure Domain Name address resolution and initiate secure peer-to-peer VPN connections
Gabriel Relay Server performs peer-to-peer connection setup, where both peers are behind NAT firewalls, session traversal utilities for NAT (STUN) firewall traversal discovery, VPN channel relay, when direct channels are not supported by local firewalls, and out of band, periodic key exchange


Gabriel Secured Device Services run as services on the individual devices, which are secured by Gabriel Connection Technology™. These services are available as

Gabriel Secured Device Services for Desktop, available on OS X, Windows and Linux platforms, uses internal packet router and IP stack of the operating system, by intercepting DNS requests before they leave the device and using a virtual VPN network adapter for intercepting all packets associated with a VPN channel. This allows any application running on the device to use Gabriel VPN security without requiring any modification.
Gabriel Secured Mobile Services, available on Android and iOS platforms, have been adapted to address the system level access limitations to platform’s IP stack and DNS messaging imposed by mobile operating systems. Each application must integrate VirnetX’s Gabriel Connection Technology™ to utilize Gabriel security when present on the device. Simple and easy to use Application Programming Interface (API) has been provided by VirnetX to assist with this integration.




Gabriel Security Platform services
The Gabriel Security Platform is available on all major operating systems and supports seamless interoperation across Windows, OS X, iOS, Android, and Linux devices.
Gabriel Secure Mobile Services API
Mobile application developers can utilize Gabriel Secure Mobile Services API to integrate Gabriel security into their applications for mobile devices. This API includes a built-in IP stack that allows seamlessly, end-to-end secure communications all mobile and desktop devices that have Gabriel Security Platform support installed.

Gabriel Secure Mobile Services and Gabriel Secure Mobile Services API
The API allows applications to use the Instant Secure Connect capability for intercepting a name resolution request, determine if a secure connection is requested, automatically establish it, if requested, and return the corresponding secure IP address for further communications.
Industry standard cryptographic software libraries and processes, including Secure Socket Layers (SSL-3), and AES (advance encryption standard), used to negotiate connections and for encapsulating and encrypting application data packets. Gabriel Secure Mobile Services API can also be integrated into corporate applications, in need of this security, deployed on Windows devices which use restrictive third-party anti-virus/firewall programs for corporate compliance.

White Paper

“Take back your digital life.”

Introduction



OUTLINE
• INTRODUCTION
• GABRIEL TECHNOLOGY
• GABRIEL SECURITY PLATFORM
• GABRIEL COLLABORATION SUITE
• SUMMARY



The Internet has become an integral part of people’s lives today with wide spread use for xcommerce, business, news and information dissemination, as well as daily social networking. This wide spread use and dependence upon the Internet has brought major challenges to maintaining privacy and security for both individuals and companies. The use of mobile computing with centralized cloud storage has only exacerbated these challenges by providing hackers with information rich targets to extract sensitive data for large numbers of individuals and companies, which can be used for a wide range of nefarious purposes (e.g. identity theft, credit card fraud, corporate espionage, personal data mining, etc.). This white paper presents both a network security technology, designed for current and future demands and an application suite built upon this technology that enables both individuals and organizations to take back control of their personal and sensitive data, thereby protecting themselves from these attacks.
VirnetX Holding Corporation (VirnetX) has released a real-time secure communications product called Gabriel, which provides end-to-end encrypted communication between any two devices on the Internet and intranet. Gabriel is based upon patented technology, which enables instant private and secure connections for ANYONE, ANYTIME, and ANYWHERE across the Internet/intranet. This allows users the ability to privately chat, talk, and share information regardless of where the users are located or the devices being used. Included are smart phone, tablet, laptop, desktop, appliance, or server devices. End-to-end encrypted security is available to devices whether on private wired, Wi-Fi, public Wi-Fi or cellular networks. These end-to-end private connections are mutually authenticated and access-controlled by connection policies defined by the user. Gabriel is available and communicates seamlessly between all major operating systems and vender devices; which include:

Apple iPhones, iPads, and Macintosh computers,
Android smart phones and tablets,
Windows 7, 8, & 10 tablets, laptops, desktops and servers,
Linux laptops, desktops and servers

This white paper covers the features and benefits of the patented Gabriel technology and the application suite. The Gabriel technology brings robust real-time privacy and security to both individuals and organizations as they use the Internet or Intranet in their personal and professional lives.

Real-time prices are provided by Bats Exchange on individual U.S. equities quote pages. During market hours, the real-time Bats price displays and new trade updates are updated on the page (as indicated by a "flash"). Volume always reflects consolidated markets. If the symbol has pre-market or post-market trades, that information will also be reflected along with the last (closing) price from the symbol's exchange. Real-time prices are available during market hours (9:30 AM to 4:00 PM EST).  Note: The Bats Exchange currently accounts for approximately 11-12% of all U.S. equity trading each day. As a result, the real-time prices displayed may have minor discrepancies when comparing the information with other sites offering real-time data, or with brokerage firms. If you require comprehensive real-time bids/asks/quotes, we offer a no-risk trial to one of our real-time products. Summary Quoteboard The Summary Quoteboard displays snapshot quote data. When available, Bid and Ask information from the Bats exchange is updated as new data is received. Volume is also updated but is the delayed consolidated Volume from the symbol's exchange. Quoteboard data fields include:  Day High / Low: The highest and lowest trade price for the current trading session. Open: The opening price for the current trading session is plotted on the day's High/Low histogram. Previous Close: The closing price from the previous trading session. Bid: The last bid price and bid size. Ask: The last ask price and ask size. Volume: The total number of shares or contracts traded in the current trading session. Average Volume: The average number of shares traded over the last 20 days. Weighted Alpha: A measure of how much a stock or commodity has risen or fallen over a one-year period. Barchart takes this Alpha and weights this, assigning more weight to recent activity, and less (0.5 factor) to activity at the beginning of the period. Thus, Weighted Alpha is a measure of one-year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity.  Chart Snapshot A thumbnail of a daily chart is provided, with a link to open and customize a full-sized chart.Barchart Technical Opinion The Barchart Technical Opinion widget shows you today's overally Barchart Opinion with general information on how to interpret the short and longer term signals. Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. A symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:  Strong Buy (greater than "66% Buy") Buy (greater than or equal to "33% Buy" and less than or equal to "66% Buy") Weak Buy ("0% Buy" through "33% Buy") Hold Strong Sell (greater than "66% Sell") Sell (greater than or equal to "33% Sell" and less than or equal to "66% Sell") Weak Sell ("0% Sell" through "33% Sell")  The current reading of the 14-Day Stochastic indicator is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:   If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 90 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is in highly overbought territory. Beware of a trend reversal." If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 80 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is approaching overbought territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 10 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is in highly oversold territory. Beware of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 20 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is approaching oversold territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal." Business Summary Provides a general description of the business conducted by this company. Price Performance This section shows the Highs and Lows over the past 1, 3 and 12-Month periods. Click the "See More" link to see the full Performance Report page with expanded historical information.Fundamentals For US Stocks, the Overview page includes key statistics on the stock's fundamentals, with a link to see more. Most Recent Earnings figures are based on Non-GAAP income from continuing operations. Market Cap: capitalization or market value of a stock is simply the market value of all outstanding shares. It is computed by multiplying the market price by the number of outstanding shares. For example, a publicly held company with 10 million shares outstanding that trade at $10 each would have a market capitalization of $100 million. Shares Outstanding: Common shares outstanding as reported by the company on the 10-Q or 10-K. P/E Ratio: Latest closing price divided by the earnings-per-share based on the Latest 12-Month EPS Change (LTM) of earnings. Companies with negative earnings receive an "NE." EPS: The basic annual EPS from total operations is the bottom line income after all expenses, divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. For example, if a company has $10 million in net income and 10 million in outstanding shares, then its EPS is $1. Beta: 36 Month Beta: Coefficient that measures the volatility of a stock's returns relative to the market (S&P 500). It is based on a 36-month historical regression of the return on the stock onto the return on the S&P 500. Earnings: The amount of latest Earnings Per Share (EPS) paid out to shareholders. Dividend Yield: A portion of a company's profit paid to shareholders, quoted as the dollar amount each share receives (dividends per share). Yield is the amount of dividends paid per share, divided by the closing price. Sectors: Links to the Industry Groups and/or SIC codes in which the stock is found.Support and Resistance This section shows a snapshot view of the Trader's Cheat Sheet with the Last Price, and four separate pivot points (2 Support Levels, and 2 Resistance Points). The Last Price shown is the last trade price at the time the quote page was displayed, and will not update every 10 seconds (as the Last Price at the top of the Quote page does). The Last Price will update only when the page is refreshed. Pivot points are used to identify intraday support, resistance and target levels. The pivot point and its support and resistance pairs are defined as follows, where H, L, C are the current day's high, low and close, respectively. Support and Resistance points are based on end-of-day prices and are intended for the current trading session if the market is open, or the next trading session if the market is closed.   Pivot Point: (P) = (H + L + C) / 3 First Resistance Level: (R1) = (2 * P) - L First Support Level: (S1) = (2 * P) - H Second Resistance Level: (R2) = P + (R1 - S1) Second Support Level: (S2) = P - (R1 - S1) Related Stocks For comparison purposes, find information on other symbols contained in the same sector.Most Recent Stories View the latest top stories from the Associated Press or Canadian Press (based on your Market selection).

Rich Product Portfolios from VirnetX Holding and Alcatel Lucent in High Demand  Paragon Report Provides Equity Research on VirnetX Holding & Alcatel-Lucent     NEW YORK, NY, Oct 03, 2011 (MARKETWIRE via COMTEX) -- As the shift from 2G networks to 3G and 4G accelerates, communications equipment makers find themselves at a transition point. While many companies in the industry are finding new growth opportunities, they have had to sacrifice traditional revenue drivers. The Paragon Report examines the outlook for the Technology Sector and provides equity research on VirnetX Holding Corporation /quotes/zigman/1510105/quotes/nls/vhc VHC -2.74% and Alcatel-Lucent /quotes/zigman/163221/quotes/nls/alu ALU -7.07% /quotes/zigman/163047 FR:ALU -8.38% . Access to the full company reports can be found at:    www.paragonreport.com/VHC    www.paragonreport.com/ALU    The communications equipment industry has shown significant growth this year. Businesses are looking for faster options and equipment makers that offer these options have the opportunity to bolster their top lines. As corporations become more mobile, connection solutions allowing employees to connect directly with the corporate server are growing in appeal.    Despite high unemployment and mediocre consumer confidence, North American smartphone and tablet sales continue to skyrocket. At the moment there is massive demand for mobile internet and telecom customers are typically looking for smooth transitions to 3G or 4G networks.    The Paragon Report provides investors with an excellent first step in their due diligence by providing daily trading ideas, and consolidating the public information available on them. For more investment research on the Technology Sector register with us free at www.paragonreport.com and get exclusive access to our numerous stock reports and industry newsletters.    Alcatel-Lucent is engaged in mobile, fixed, Internet Protocol (IP) and optics technologies, applications and services. Recently Taiwan's largest telco, Chunghwa Telecom turned to Alcatel-Lucent for a network upgrade that will tackle an exploding demand for high-bandwidth mobile services in that Asian nation. Alcatel-Lucent says that deal will "improve performance and help support the future evolution of Chunghwa Telecom's mobile network. It supports the carrier's 2G and 3G networks, and the eventual move to 4G LTE. The two companies have already conducted a successful 4G LTE field trial."    VirnetX is engaged in developing and commercializing software and technology solutions for securing real-time communications over the Internet. The company holds a patent for technology that has the ability to secure an entire mobile device, meaning phone-makers will likely have to pay major royalties to the company moving forward.

	ITEM 1.01.



	ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.










	Stock Purchase Agreement






	On May 31, 2017, VirnetX Holding Corporation (the “Company”) entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Public Intelligence Technology Associates (“Investor”), kk (Japanese Corporation), pursuant to which the Company will issue and sell to Investor 5,494,505 shares of Common Stock (the “Shares”) as promptly as practicable following the satisfaction or waiver of certain closing conditions, but in any case no later than June 19, 2017, in a private placement pursuant to an exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Act”) for a total purchase price of approximately $20,000,000, or $3.64 per share.  The Purchase Agreement contained customary representations and warranties by the parties.  The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the private placement primarily for general corporate purposes.


	 




	During the


	eighteen (18) month period following the date of the Purchase Agreement


	(the “Lockup Period”)


	, the

	Company has an irrevocable and exclusive option to repurchase any and all of the Shares acquired by Investor that have not

	otherwise been surrendered


	in the manner described below, at prices set forth in a schedule set forth


	in the Purchase Agreement.



	 



	In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the Company will make quarterly payments to

	Investor of a percentage of the revenues


	described in the Purchase Agreement


	recognized from cash or cash equivalents received


	by Network Research Corporation Japan Ltd., the Company’s Japanese subsidiary


	,


	from a Japanese company


	that is incorporated


	or otherwise created under the laws of Japan and is headquartered in Japan (a “Japanese Company”)


	that is directly attributable

	to (i) patent license fees or royalties for licenses granted under the Company’s Japanese patents with respect to the products and

	services of a Japanese


	Company


	sold in Japan, (ii) licensing of the Gabriel Collaboration Suite to a Japanese


	Company


	for end use in Japan, or (iii) provision of other commercial services by the Company to a Japanese


	Company


	in Japan, such as the Company’s Secure Domain Name services (the “Company Japan Revenues,” and each


	such payment, the “


	Priority


	Quarterly Revenue Share Payment”). Upon each


	Priority


	Quarterly Revenue Share Payment made by


	the Company to Investor, the Shares purchased by Investor pursuant to the Purchase Agreement will be


	automatically


	surrendered


	for no consideration in accordance with


	a


	schedule


	set forth in


	the Purchase Agreement. The


	Priority


	Quarterly

	Revenue Share Payments shall be made until the earliest to occur of (i) when Investor no longer holds or owns any Shares

	acquired pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, (ii) when the Company has made aggregate


	Priority Quarterly Revenue


	Share Payments


	equal to $20,000,000 pursuant to the Purchase Agreement or (iii) the end of the


	Lockup Period (the


	“Priority Revenue Sharing Period”). The aggregate Priority Quarterly Revenue Share Payments made


	during the


	Priority Revenue Sharing

	Period shall not exceed $20,000,000. After the Priority Revenue Sharing Period, the Company will continue to make quarterly payments to Investor pursuant to the terms of the Revenue Sharing Agreement described below.


	 



	Upon the issuance and sale of the Shares, the Company and Investor will enter into a Stockholders Agreement (the “Stockholders Agreement”). The Stockholders Agreement will contain specific obligations and agreements of Investor as owner of the Shares, including (a) customary standstill restrictions, including restrictions on the acquisition of additional securities of the Company, through the date that is sixty (60) months after the date of the Stockholders Agreement (unless earlier terminated)

	,

	(b) restrictions on transferring the Shares during the Lockup Period without the consent of the Company, subject to customary exceptions, (c) after the Lockup Period, restrictions on transferring the Shares to (i) any holder of more than 5% of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock (after such transfer), (ii) any competitor of the Company or an officer, employee, director or more than 10% holder of a competitor or (iii) specified entities listed in the Stockholders Agreement, (d) the grant by Investor of an irrevocable proxy to the Company whereby Investor appoints the designated proxy holder as proxy and attorney-in-fact, to vote and act on behalf of Investor as such proxy holder deems advisable and in all cases in accordance with the recommendations of the Company’s board of directors on any matters submitted to the Company’s stockholders and (e) for so long as Investor owns more than one percent (1%) of the outstanding stock of the Company, Investor shall not directly or indirectly lend, offer, pledge, sell, contract to sell, sell any option or contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant any option, right, or warrant to purchase, or otherwise transfer or dispose of any shares of the Company’s common stock for period not to exceed 120 days following the completion of any underwritten public offering or private placement of the Company’s equity securities, provided however that all directors and Section 16 officers shall be subject to the same restrictions.



	 



	Revenue Sharing Agreement






	Concurrently with the Purchase Agreement, the Company and Investor also entered into a Revenue Sharing Agreement

	(the “Revenue Sharing Agreement”). Under the Revenue Sharing Agreement,


	after the Priority Revenue Sharing Period


	(i)


	Investor shall make quarterly payments to the Company equal to a percentage


	set forth in the Revenue Sharing Agreement


	of the

	worldwide revenues of Investor and its affiliates, including without limitation the amounts received from the licensing or sale of any products, services or intellectual property rights or received in rent, returns and other distributions from real estate and real

	estate investment trusts; and (ii) the Company shall make quarterly payments to Investors of a percentage


	set forth in the


	Revenue Sharing Agreement


	of the Company Japan Revenues, such percentage payable under the Revenue Sharing Agreement is lower than the percentage payable during the Priority Revenue Sharing Period under the Purchase Agreement. The Company’s payment obligations under the Revenue Sharing

	Agreement shall start only after the end of its obligations to pay Priority Quarterly Revenue Share Payments under the Purchase Agreement.






	Gabriel License Agreement






	Concurrently with the Purchase Agreement, the Company and Investor also entered into a Gabriel License Agreement (the “Gabriel License Agreement”) for the marketing and promotion of the Company’s products and services by Investor in Japan. Investor’s sole compensation for the services provided under the Gabriel License Agreement are the payments made to Investor under the Revenue Sharing Agreement.

VirnetX (NYSE MKT: VHC) is a company founded by former engineers and executives from Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) which developed security technology for the Department of Homeland Security and other federal agencies. These resulted in patentable technologies which secure LTE communications. Some call VirnetX a patent troll[1][2] because they expanded their Patent Portfolio beyond the original four Internet Security Patents to include more than 100 related patents, thus securing their position as a leader in mobile security technology, and based on the fact that the majority of their employees are lawyers and they have yet to commercialize any of their patents in commercial products. The company has over 80 Internet security patents worldwide, and 100 patents pending.[3]

Patents[edit]
The Company's patent portfolio includes U.S. and international patents in areas such as DNS and network communication. Since 2010, VirnetX has been in litigation with companies including Apple, Cisco, and Microsoft.[4] Separately, in December 2014, Microsoft and VirnetX settled patent disputes over Skype technology for $23 million.[5] In their Apple case, VirnetX worked together with SAIC,[6] and was awarded $368 million in damages for FaceTime infringement.[7] That ruling was partially vacated on 8/19/2014, but two patents were confirmed to be infringed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.[8] In December 2014, VirnetX opened access to their Gabriel platform, which builds upon their patents, and is implemented as small to medium-sized business enterprise collaboration software.[9]
Emails from Apple's engineering staff indicated that they knew they were violating various patents. Apple has appealed rulings against it in state and federal courts and demanded a jury trial for the VirtnetX case. In February 2016 an East Texas jury unanimously ruled in federal court that Apple had willfully violated 13 VirnetX patents. The jury said Apple must pay VirnetX $625.6 million for infringing four of the patents, and the court was considering ongoing royalty rates and punitive damages. [10] At Apple's request, the ruling was vacated in August 2016 and the case sent back to be retried separating the patents into two groups. VirnetX has filed an injunction to block sales of Facetime and iMessage, claiming that its own platforms are suffering. The first retrial, conducted Sept 26-Sept 30, 2016 resulted in another unanimous jury verdict for VirnetX. [11] The verdict re-affirmed patent violations enabling Facetime and iMessage and awarded $302 million to VirnetX. The remaining 2 patents will be tried separately

VirnetX (NYSE MKT: VHC) is a company founded by former engineers and executives from Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) which developed security technology for the Department of Homeland Security and other federal agencies. These resulted in patentable technologies which secure LTE communications. Some call VirnetX a patent troll[1][2] because they expanded their Patent Portfolio beyond the original four Internet Security Patents to include more than 100 related patents, thus securing their position as a leader in mobile security technology, and based on the fact that the majority of their employees are lawyers and they have yet to commercialize any of their patents in commercial products. The company has over 80 Internet security patents worldwide, and 100 patents pending.[3]

Patents[edit]
The Company's patent portfolio includes U.S. and international patents in areas such as DNS and network communication. Since 2010, VirnetX has been in litigation with companies including Apple, Cisco, and Microsoft.[4] Separately, in December 2014, Microsoft and VirnetX settled patent disputes over Skype technology for $23 million.[5] In their Apple case, VirnetX worked together with SAIC,[6] and was awarded $368 million in damages for FaceTime infringement.[7] That ruling was partially vacated on 8/19/2014, but two patents were confirmed to be infringed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.[8] In December 2014, VirnetX opened access to their Gabriel platform, which builds upon their patents, and is implemented as small to medium-sized business enterprise collaboration software.[9]
Emails from Apple's engineering staff indicated that they knew they were violating various patents. Apple has appealed rulings against it in state and federal courts and demanded a jury trial for the VirtnetX case. In February 2016 an East Texas jury unanimously ruled in federal court that Apple had willfully violated 13 VirnetX patents. The jury said Apple must pay VirnetX $625.6 million for infringing four of the patents, and the court was considering ongoing royalty rates and punitive damages. [10] At Apple's request, the ruling was vacated in August 2016 and the case sent back to be retried separating the patents into two groups. VirnetX has filed an injunction to block sales of Facetime and iMessage, claiming that its own platforms are suffering. The first retrial, conducted Sept 26-Sept 30, 2016 resulted in another unanimous jury verdict for VirnetX. [11] The verdict re-affirmed patent violations enabling Facetime and iMessage and awarded $302 million to VirnetX. The remaining 2 patents will be tried separately
