So When Will Religious Organizations Choose Not to Discriminate?



Leading church-state scholar Marci A. Hamilton comments on a recent decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in which it held that a female principal of a Catholic school has no legal recourse when a priest engages in gender discrimination that would be actionable in any other setting.

DCI Banks star Caroline Catz: 'Juggling work and family life is difficult'
SHE hates watching herself on screen, but loves throwing herself into character. Simon Button meets Caroline Catz, star of DCI Banks and Doc Martin

WENNDCI Banks actress Caroline Catz on Doc Martin and playing a chief inspectorWith her long dark hair and striking features, Manchester-born actress Caroline Catz attracts as much attention in reality as on screen – not that she likes seeing herself act. “I find it hard to watch when we’re filming and even when we have to add extra bits of sound here and there. I’m a bit squeamish about all of those things,” she says.However, when it comes to the rest of the finished product, she’s only too happy to immerse herself in the story. Whether it’s the minutiae of police procedure in DCI Banks or swatting up about school teaching for Doc Martin, Caroline always throws herself into character. For DCI Banks, questions about real police work are thrashed out with on-set advisers and some of the supporting cast who are former police officers.“There are constant conversations about what would really happen and sometimes we’re filming in real police environments,” she reveals, “so it’s interesting seeing how everything works.”The fourth series of DCI Banks starts next month and while filming was taking place on Ilkley Moor, Caroline chatted to an extra who had worked on the Yorkshire Ripper case. 



            Obviously there are elements of yourself you bring to roles        
Caroline Catz


“It was interesting to learn how it affected them at the time, how terrifying and baffling it was,” she says.Having been born and raised close to the Ripper’s hunting grounds in Yorkshire and Manchester herself, Caroline says, “Growing up, I remember hearing all about the Yorkshire Ripper attacks on the news and how scary it was. Then you imagine working in that environment every day, where the clock is ticking, and as the weeks go by you feel you’re failing as more and more people are becoming victims.“That’s what’s great about DCI Banks because it focuses on that ticking clock really well and the way the tensions build through the episodes. The consequences of not getting to the bottom of a case and the effect that has on the team and how they cope with the stress is really what the show is about.”Caroline is a fan of her own show and its gritty qualities. “It’s not far-fetched in any way and it’s not hi-tech with glamorous offices and the latest technology,” she says. “It’s none of that. It’s based in this incredible Yorkshire landscape, with these beautiful moors and industrial power stations and cities, and it’s about all the secrets that lie within that landscape and trying to get to the root of all the dark things that go on. I was thrilled to come back.”She’s also returning to Doc Martin, but with filming on the new series under way, she admits she could no more imagine being a real head teacher than she could a police detective inspector.WENNThe new series of DCI Banks will be shown on Wednesdays at 9pm on ITV from March 4“But that’s what’s brilliant about this job,” she beams. “You get to dip into other people’s lives, doing other things, researching, finding things out, and it becomes all-consuming as you try to immerse yourself into the mind-set of another person. That’s really brilliant. You almost get the best of both worlds.”Like so many chameleon-like actors, it’s easy to be taken aback at how different she is in reality from the characters she plays. From tough-talking Helen Morton in DCI Banks to feisty Louisa Glasson in Doc Martin, it’s understandable to think Caroline will be equally frosty. In reality, she is softly spoken and very different from the characters she plays – and she loves them all the more for that. “Obviously there are elements of yourself you bring to roles, but Louisa and Helen are both so different and that’s what I enjoy – playing roles that are diverse,” says Caroline. “You immerse yourself in a new character and I’m not sure which bits of myself go in and which don’t.”That, she suggests, is for others to decide. Caroline, 44, admits Helen probably isn’t the easiest person to live with.“And when the new series starts, she’s had some big, big problems with her husband, so it’s going to be interesting…” “Louisa is a fantastic character because she’s so direct and she doesn’t care what people think about her. There’s a great liberation in playing a character who is very forthright and speaks her mind. She’s clumsy and blunt, while at the same time she’s just trying to get to the bottom of things,” Caroline says. “She’s quite practical and it’s not like she’s being unkind – she’s just trying to sort through what she says and all the irrelevancies and get right down to the nub of the matter. I find that very entertaining.”The seeds of a career in acting were planted early for Caroline, whose parents took her to see shows at Manchester venues such as the acclaimed Royal Exchange Theatre and the Opera House. “I was so lucky to have that exposure to stuff and to be taken by my folks to see these amazing productions,” she says. “Going to the theatre was the thing that did it for me and especially going to the Royal Exchange where, incidentally, I’ve never worked, but I’d like to one day.”When, or if, she treads the boards in her hometown’s most prestigious venue, it won’t be under her real name. She was born Caroline Caplan and when she started working assumed it was cool to keep the moniker. Then someone urged her to give Equity a call and she was told the name was already taken. “And I was like, ‘What?’” she says.As Caroline is Jewish, she wanted a Jewish surname, and decided Catz had a nice ring to it. Studying at RADA in the days before mobile phones, she popped into a phone box. “Someone had drawn little cats everywhere, so that was my final decision on the matter,” she laughs. “You’d think you’d spend days, months or years agonising over a new name, but I didn’t even have anything in reserve. It wasn’t thought out – it took about three seconds.”So the name Catz wasn’t in homage to Katz Delicatessen in New York – where Meg Ryan famously faked an orgasm in the movie When Harry Met Sally? Caroline yelps at the idea! “No, but funnily enough we were in New York recently. We didn’t eat at Katz, but we took some photos. I loved New York. It was my first proper visit and I was absolutely blown away by it.”

She was similarly blown away by her first acting job in Michael Winterbottom’s 1992 film Under The Sun. It’s the story of two girls (Catz and Kate Hardie) who plan a round-the-world trip but get only as far as Spain.“So that’s the end of their world tour,” Caroline laughs. “But it was brilliant. My first job and there I am in Spain, working with Michael Winterbottom, rehearsing and improvising. It was so exciting. I just thought, ‘This is absolutely wild! What a fantastic job to be doing.’ So that was a very nice start. I didn’t know what I’d do next but when you’re in your early twenties, you don’t think that way. You just think, ‘This is great.’”Caroline met her husband, 53-year-old fellow actor Michael Higgs, on the set of The Bill in the late 90s. They have two children, Sonny, 13, and Honor, eight, and Caroline is refreshingly relaxed about talking about family life, unlike many well-known TV celebrities.  “Yes, juggling work and family life is difficult. But any parent – mother or father – has to consider their family, don’t they?”As a household name and now very familiar face on TV, Caroline also finds time to stay in shape for the cameras and watches what she eats. “It’s always a challenge, all of that stuff,” she says. “As you get older, you have to start thinking about all that. Well, I need to! I like to keep a balance of having good days and chilling out a couple of days a week, having a banana and a salad some days and enjoying myself on the others. I couldn’t do one of those crash diet things. I’m not interested in those, but it’s good not to eat too much, isn’t it?”Over the last 20 years, Caroline has never been far away from TV screens with stints as policewomen of various ranks in The Bill, The Vice and Murder In Suburbia, and guest slots on shows such as Agatha Christie’s Marple and Hotel Babylon.Then there’s Doc Martin, which keeps calling her back to Port Isaac (the show’s Portwenn) in Cornwall and which kept viewers wondering if Martin Clunes’ gruff GP would make things legal with the lovely Louisa. They eventually tied the knot in 2013.“And people were very pleased,” Caroline recalls. “But when the first marriage attempt went wrong, they were not pleased about it at all. People came up to me and said, ‘Why? It’s ridiculous. I’m really upset about it.’ You just have to say, ‘It’s not real. It’s fine and who knows? There may be another series and something else might happen…’”This series is rumoured to be the last, which should tie up the storyline nicely. But whether things work out as well for Helen in DCI Banks remains to be seen. “People seem to really enjoy Banks,” Caroline says. “It was great it did so well and brilliant it’s coming back.” The new series of DCI Banks will be shown on Wednesdays at 9pm on ITV from March 4.
