The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.

You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

The Democratsâ Better Way: Positive Messaging or Pandering to Trump Voters Who Are Never Coming Back?



George Washington law professor and economist praises Democrats for coming up with a message that preserves the partyâs commitment to social justice issues, rather than attempting to woo Trump voters by appealing to what Trump appealed to.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

FAQS - So Good









































Toggle navigation













    FAQS  



If you’ve got questions about soy and So Good products, we’ve got answers.


What are the nutritional advantages of So Good fortified soy beverages versus dairy milk?
Soy protein has lots positive advantages:
So Good contains 6 to 7 grams of protein in just one 250 ml serving. Each cup also contains similar amounts of calcium, vitamin D2, B12, riboflavin as milk—but contains no cholesterol, no lactose, no animal protein or animal fat. Plus, So Good is lower in saturated fat than regular dairy milk.
Is So Good made from genetically modified or GMO soybeans?
No!
So Good is made from exclusively non-genetically modified soy protein by Identity Preservation. This means that a monitoring system has been put in place which controls each step of the manufacturing process—from seed selection to planting and harvesting, transportation and processing—to ensure no genetically modified soybeans enter the supply stream at any time.
Does So Good fortified soy beverage contain calcium?
Yes!
Each serving of So Good (250mL / 1 cup) contains 308 mg of calcium — almost 1/3 of your daily requirement (based on a 1100mg daily requirement). The calcium is added in the form of a natural mineral salt called tricalcium phosphate.
Be careful when you shop: Some soy beverages have no added calcium at all.
Is So Good lactose free?
Yes!
So Good is 100% lactose free and a perfect alternative to milk. Lactose is the natural sugar found in dairy milk and lactase is the enzyme required to break down the lactose. Some people have little or no lactase in their body which means dairy milk and dairy milk products cannot be digested. The common symptoms of lactose intolerance are stomach pains, bloating, gas, diarrhea and nausea.
Is So Good cholesterol free?
Yes!
So Good is 100% free of cholesterol. Even better, it’s low in saturated fat. Vegetable oil is added to Original and Flavour varieties of So Good to provide appropriate fat levels for satisfying mouth feel and beverage smoothness (100% cholesterol free polyunsaturated non-gmo Sunflower oil or CanolaDoes So Good contain animal products?
Does So Good contain animal products?
No!
So Good is 100% free of animal products and suitable for both vegetarian and vegan diets.
Does So Good contain gluten?
No!
So Good products are 100% gluten-free and suitable for people with Celiac Disease.
Is So Good suitable for children?
Yes!
Choose one of the fortified products for your child or teenager. These are appropriate for children aged 2 years of age and older, because they contain specific vitamins (A, D, B12, and riboflavin) and minerals (calcium and zinc) that are important for growth and vibrant good health. However, we don’t recommend that it be given to infants or children under 2 years of age. During the first two years of life, breast milk is your best choice, or alternatively an iron fortified infant formula. Both of these are high in healthful fats needed by growing infants and soy beverages are not a suitable replacement.
For parents wanting to give fortified So Good to your infant between one and two years of age, we recommend that you consult with a health practitioner. Generally it is considered that fortified soy beverage can be a nutritional replacement for cow’s milk providing that parents provide sufficient fat in the child’s diet.
Can I cook with So Good fortified soy beverages?
Yes!
So Good can be used in any of your favourite dishes where milk is called for (with the exception of instant pudding).
Can I freeze So Good fortified soy beverages?
We do not recommend freezing So Good beverages. After freezing the product may separate when thawed. It will be fine for cooking or baking after it has been frozen but it may have a peculiar texture for drinking.
Why does So Good fortified soy beverage curdle in coffee/tea?
It is believed that the tannins found in coffee and tea react with the protein in So Good which causes curdling. Always stir well when adding So Good to reduce the curdling.
Do I have to use So Good fortified soy beverage within 7-10 days?
Fresh So Good should be treated the same way you would milk, always kept refrigerated and should be consumed within the recommended 7-10 days. However, if the product is unopened both So Good Fresh in the gable carton and Shelf Stable in tetra pak cartons will last until the best before date as stated on the top of the cartons. Shelf Stable product can be stored on the shelf until the best before date, but should be refrigerated after opening and consumed within the 7-10 days (same as you would store and use the gable carton).
Are So Good fortified soy beverages produced in a facility that also produces tree nuts?    Yes, our So Good beverages are produced in a facility that also produces tree nuts. As has been the case since the launch of almond-based beverages (SoFresh), our plants have followed a strict regimen of cleaning and testing for nut allergens. If any trace of nut proteins were to be detected, the products would not be released for purchase. As accredited facilities under the internationally regulated GFSI program, our plants undergo regular audits to ensure all food safety protocols are being fully adhered to at all times.

The Earth’s Own Story
Earth’s Own Food Company is a pioneering healthy food & beverage company dedicated to nutritional innovation and sustainability in order to actively improve people’s lives and wellbeing.









Who is Earth’s Own?
Founded in 1998 as Soyaworld, we set out to transform an industry.
Learn more









With a passion for health and wellness and a desire to give Canadians new healthy beverage choices, we brought previously niche soy beverage products to a wider audience with the introduction of soy beverages in a fresh format.
Soyaworld woke the mainstream Canadian consumer to the benefits of soy and turned the public perception of soy beverages on its head. In 1998, the company made So Good soy beverage a mainstream product, available in grocery stores Canada-wide, right next to milk.

In the ensuing years, Soyaworld grew to include additional brands: So Nice Organic, Ryza and Almond Fresh. In 2011, to better reflect a growing line-up of healthy products, and to better communicate our commitment to health, nutrition, sustainability and community, Soyaworld changed its name to Earth’s Own Food Company Inc.
Today, our recipe for success is fostering well-being in everything we do and making great tasting, healthy products that are good for consumers, their families, their communities and the planet. Earth’s Own Food Company has 126 employees who are passionate and committed to the company’s vision and continued growth. Learn more about what we do at www.earthsown.com.












How We Make a Difference
At Earth’s Own Food Company, we are always looking for ways to reduce our footprint.
Learn more









One of the most impactful changes we have made is to establish production facilities in both Eastern and Western Canada. This minimizes the impact shipping has on the environment and ensures that you receive the freshest product available.
Making our plants efficient as possible is another way we strive to be environmentally responsible. We currently employ a system by which the solid waste from our extraction process is returned to the earth as compost or fertilizer used in agriculture. We also participate in BC Hydro’s Power Smart Partners Industrial Program at our British Columbia facility, which enables us to maximize our energy use reduction.
In early 2010 we audited our facilities for greenhouse gas emissions. Upon completion of the audit we implemented specific reduction strategies and employee education programs which resulted in becoming a Climate Smart certified company.

We have taken considerable steps to seek out packaging partners who share our commitment to the environment. Tetra Pak, the maker of our shelf stable packaging, has introduced initiatives that have resulted in an 18% reduction in paperboard weight and a significant reduction of plastic in the inner layer of the package.Our chilled beverage packaging supplier, Evergreen Packaging, uses only paper and paperboard that  is made with renewable materials, trees from forests where responsible forestry practices are used.
Our Commitment to sustainability also extends to the ingredients we use. Though we could save money by sourcing ingredients from outside North America, we believe in using only the best wholesome North American grown ingredients wherever possible. Again the environmental impact of shipping over long distances is reduced and we all benefit from the support we provide to those that adhere to safer farming practices.

A Complete Non GMO Soy Protein
Soy is a nutrient-dense plant protein that contains all nine essential amino acids your body can’t produce. This makes it unique to other plant protein sources.

Learn More










These amino acids are the building blocks of protein, and you can’t metabolize the protein without all the 9 essential amino acids being present. That’s why soy beverages like So Good are an effective source of protein to support growing bodies.
Soy is a complete protein and is an ideal substitute for those who choose to not consume dairy.

So Good is proud to exclusively use North American grown, non-GMO soy. An extensive monitoring system, Identity Preservation, has been put in place to control each step of the manufacturing process. From seed selection to planting and harvesting, transportation and processing, no genetically-modified soybeans ever enter the supply chain.












Heart Health
A 250 mL glass of So Good fortified soy beverage supplies 25% of the daily amount of soy protein shown to help lower cholesterol.

Learn More










This means 4 servings of soy protein, such as So Good, can help you lower your cholesterol and reduce your risk of developing heart disease. So Good itself contains no cholesterol and is low in saturated fats so you can achieve a healthy balance.
With the added benefit of being a great source of protein it makes the perfect, healthy alternative to milk.
 


Foods that are high in potassium and low in sodium may reduce the risk of high blood pressure — a risk factor for stroke and heart disease.
Adequate calcium and vitamin D, when combined with regular physical activity, help to achieve strong bones and may reduce the risk of heart disease.
Minimizing intake of saturated and trans fats may also reduce the risk of heart disease

Soy Myths Dispelled
It’s no myth that soy is a superfood, rich in proteins, nutrients, vitamins, minerals, fibre, omega-3 fats — you get the picture.

Learn More










With all the information out there, it’s not always easy to know what’s always accurate. Take a look at the research below and find out for yourself.




Myth:
Soy and soy isoflavones may increase the risk for breast cancer.



Facts:
Studies from the American Institute for Cancer Research show that soy consumption has either no effect or a slightly defensive effect against breast cancer risk. (1) Plus, according to the American Cancer Society, breast cancer patients can safely consume up to three servings of natural soy daily (1 serving = 1 cup of soy beverage). However, condensed sources of soy isoflavones, like supplements, are not advised.



Myth:
Soy isoflavones exert estrogen-like effects in men.



Facts:
Unfortunately, the media recently popularized just one study where a male consumed unrealistically excessive amounts of soy and experienced unwanted effects. However, more recent studies show that soy food consumption does not affect testosterone or circulating estrogen levels, and does not influence male fertility or sperm count. (2)



Myth:
Eating soy can cause goiter and hypothyroidism.



Facts:
Studies show that in people with normal iodine levels, consuming soy does not appear to have adverse effect on thyroid function. (3) If individuals with existing hypothyroid substantially increase or decrease their soy intake, thyroid function should be reassessed by their physician and thyroid medication may need to be slightly increased. (4)(5) 



Myth:
Soy infant formula can lead to abnormal development in children.



Facts:
In the 60’s — before soy infant formula was fortified with iodine — there were a few early cases of iodine deficiencies in infants. However, since soy formula fortification became common practice, no problems have been identified, and experts agree there is little concern. (6) Research also shows infants fed soy formula experienced no hormone-related abnormalities and no effects on their reproductive organs. (7)



Myth:
All soybeans are Genetically-Modified Organisms (GMOs)



Facts:
Although approximately 80% of global soybean crops are genetically modified, the majority of it is used for farm animal feed and soybean oil. There are many GMO-free soy foods available in your local grocery store, such as soymilk, tofu, tempeh and edamame beans. The soybeans used in So Good soy beverages are always GMO-free, using Identity Preservation: a monitoring system that ensures no genetically modified soybeans enter the supply stream at any time.
