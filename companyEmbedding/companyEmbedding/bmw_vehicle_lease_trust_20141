Amazing Customer Service

Outstanding customer service!
After receiving the runaround and otherwise lackluster customer service at other dealerships, I was ready to throw in the towel.
I called BMW of SF and received the best service from Nyomi.
She actually listened to what I had to say and ensured my buying experience exceeded my expectations.
Even the Finance Manager Raquel went above and beyond to find me an outstanding interest rate (much lower than the same bank quoted me), I don't typically write reviews, but wanted to pass on my recommendation for BMW of SF and Nyomi B.!

In late Feb 2007 (Feb 26), I became aware of BMW's March 01 price increases.  As I wanted to do European delivery in May, I decided to email local BMW dealers for a price quote immediately, rather than wait until late March.  My email listed the 335i E90 car specs and desired ED date.   Later that day, the internet manager at BMW SF was the first to reply, with an offer that met my target price.  So on Feb 27, I accepted the deal with BMW SF, and faxed my lease application.  A week or so later, I rec'd a production number and confirmed ED date.   My prior CA (client advisor in BMW-speak) at another Bay Area BMW dealer replied after 4 days, thus locking me into the price increase.  Plus, his offer was way over my target price.  Other dealers wouldn't state a price, and wanted me to come into the dealership.   In early May (about 2-3 weeks prior to the ED date), I finally met my new CA when I went in to sign the purchase order and lease paperwork.  The car was picked up in Munich on May 22.  After a nearly two week vacation in the Italian lake district and the south of France (during the Cannes film festival and Monaco GP), the car was dropped off in Paris on June 1.  Car was redelivered on July 23.

      Fitch Rates BMW Vehicle Lease Trust 2014-1
    





April 16, 2014 02:06 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has assigned the following ratings and Rating Outlooks to 
      the notes issued by BMW Vehicle Lease Trust 2014-1:
    

      --Class A-1 asset-backed notes 'F1+sf';
    

      --Class A-2 asset-backed notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-3 asset-backed notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-4 asset-backed notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      Key Rating Drivers
    

      Stable Collateral Quality: The pool is consistent with that of the 
      2013-1 transaction, with a strong WA FICO score of 765 and seasoning of 
      10 months. While the securitized residual has increased to 71.11%, model 
      concentrations have decreased with the top model making up 28.3% of the 
      pool.
    

      Adequate CE Structure: Initial CE has decreased by 0.50% from 2013-1 and 
      will be 16.75%, growing to 19.00% of the initial securitization value. 
      Initial excess spread is 4.82%. Loss coverage remains adequate to 
      support Fitch's 'AAAsf' stressed assumptions.
    

      Strong Credit and Normalizing Residual Performance: Credit losses on BMW 
      Financial Services' (BMW FS) portfolio have decreased from the elevated 
      levels seen in 2008 and 2009 due to strong obligor credit quality. In 
      addition, the portfolio is displaying a decrease in residual gains from 
      prior years due to the stabilization in the wholesale used vehicle 
      market which has lowered residual realizations. Fitch's base case credit 
      net loss proxy is 0.90%, and adjusted residual value loss proxy is 
      14.40%.
    

      Evolving Wholesale Market: The U.S. wholesale vehicle market has 
      remained strong in recent years. However, increasing off-lease vehicle 
      supply and pressure from increased production levels could lead to 
      decreased residual realization during the life of the transaction.
    

      Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should 
      provide that a bankruptcy of BMW FS would not impair the timeliness of 
      payments on the securities.
    

      Stable Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: BMW FS demonstrates adequate 
      abilities as originator, underwriter, and servicer, as evidenced by 
      historical portfolio delinquency and loss experience and securitization 
      performance.
    

      Rating Sensitivity
    

      Unanticipated decreases in the value of returned vehicles and/or 
      increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted 
      receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case and 
      would likely result in declines of credit enhancement and loss coverage 
      levels available to the notes. Hence, Fitch conducts sensitivity 
      analyses by increasing the transaction's initial base case RV and credit 
      loss assumptions and examining the rating implications on all classes of 
      issued notes. The increases to the base case losses are applied such 
      that they represent moderate (1.5x) and severe (2.5X) stresses, 
      respectively, and are intended to provide an indication of the rating 
      sensitivity of notes to unexpected deterioration of a trust's 
      performance.

For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Fitch Affirms BMW Vehicle Lease Trust 2014-1 | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Affirms BMW Vehicle Lease Trust 2014-1
    





March 08, 2016 10:54 AM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings for two classes of BMW Vehicle 
      Lease Trust 2014-1. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of 
      this release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The ratings affirmations of the Class A notes reflect loss coverage 
      levels consistent with their current ratings. Hard credit enhancement 
      (CE) has grown since close, credit losses have been within Fitch's 
      initial expectations, and residual performance has produced cumulative 
      gains. The Stable Outlooks reflect Fitch's expectation that the notes 
      will remain sufficiently enhanced to cover stressed credit and residual 
      loss levels consistent with an 'AAAsf' rating.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults or deterioration in 
      vehicle values could produce loss levels higher than the current 
      expectations and impact available loss coverage. Lower loss coverage 
      could impact ratings and Rating Outlooks, depending on the extent of the 
      decline in coverage.
    

      To date, the transaction has exhibited strong credit and residual 
      performance, inside Fitch's initial expectations with rising loss 
      coverage. Due to the growing CE levels and increased loss coverage 
      afforded to the notes, a substantial deterioration in used vehicle 
      values would have to occur to have a negative impact on the updated 
      ratings.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      No third-party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action.
    

      Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:
    

      BMW Vehicle Lease Trust 2014-1
    

      --Class A-3 notes at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-4 notes at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.

While the securitized residual has increased to 71.26%, model concentrations have decreased with the top model making up 28.3% of the pool.Adequate credit enhancement Structure: Initial credit enhancement has decreased by 0.50% from 2013-1 and will be 16.75%, growing to 19% of the initial securitization value. Initial excess spread is expected to be 4.79%, in line with 2013-1. Loss coverage remains adequate to support Fitch's 'AAAsf' stressed assumptions.Strong Credit and Normalizing Residual Performance: Credit losses on BMW Financial Services' (FS) portfolio have decreased from elevated levels seen in 2008 and 2009 due to strong obligor credit quality. In addition, the portfolio is displaying a decrease in residual gains from prior years due to the stabilization in the wholesale used vehicle market which has lowered residual realizations. Fitch's base case credit net loss proxy is 0.90%, and adjusted residual value loss proxy is 14.40%.Evolving Wholesale Market: The U.S. wholesale vehicle market has remained strong in recent years. However, increasing off-lease vehicle supply and pressure from increased production levels could lead to decreased residual realization during the life of the transaction.Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should provide that a bankruptcy of BMW FS would not impair the timeliness of payments on the securities.Stable Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: BMW FS demonstrates adequate abilities as originator, underwriter, and servicer, as evidenced by historical portfolio delinquency and loss experience and securitization performance.RATING SENSITIVITIESUnanticipated decreases in the value of returned vehicles and/or increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case. This in turn would likely result in declines of credit enhancement and loss coverage levels available to the notes. Hence, Fitch conducts sensitivity analyses by increasing the transaction's initial base case RV and credit loss assumptions and examining the rating implications on all classes of issued notes. The increases to the base case losses are applied such that they represent moderate (1.5x) and severe (2.5x) stresses, respectively. They are also intended to provide an indication of the rating sensitivity of notes to unexpected deterioration of a trust's performance.The presale report is available at 'www.fitchratings.com' or by clicking on the below link.Link to Fitch Ratings' Report: BMW Vehicle Lease Trust 2014-1 (US ABS)http://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/reports/report_frame.cfm?rpt_id=744998ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextA Senate vote to repeal Obamacare could rattle marketsYahoo FinanceEngineer Finds Pattern; Makes Millions in StocksMoney MorningSponsoredPhil Mickelson trash-talked Jordan Spieth at the Open Championship — and Phil is going to have to eat his wordsBusiness InsiderWhy everybody should be happy that Flash is finally dyingYahoo FinanceAdvanced Micro Devices Could Gain Another 17% Within Hours: ChartThe StreetA Penny-Crypto Miracle Making Some Americans RichAgora FinancialSponsoredPrescription for drama as Republicans try to agree on health planYahoo Finance VideoTop economists debate the state of the U.S. labor marketYahoo FinanceFord falls despite beat, AMD eyes fresh high, Scripps takeover talk ramps upYahoo FinanceDiscover it: 4.8 out of 5 avg. by 24K+ customersDiscover CardSponsoredFix My Finances: I borrowed from my 401(k)Yahoo FinanceTODAY'S CHARTS: Why Facebook earnings could show a big surprise to the upsideYahoo FinanceU.S. Steel: Not Broken?barrons.comStart Earning Miles With The Best Travel CardWise BreadSponsoredWhat the Fed will say today and what it'll mean for marketsYahoo Finance VideoStocks jump to new all-time highs as Boeing earnings boost DowYahoo FinanceGeorge Takei Offers Blistering Takedown Of Trump's Trans Military BanBryan: So an old gay out of work actor thinks his opinion matters?Join the Conversation1 / 51.6k

Amazing Customer Service

Outstanding customer service!
After receiving the runaround and otherwise lackluster customer service at other dealerships, I was ready to throw in the towel.
I called BMW of SF and received the best service from Nyomi.
She actually listened to what I had to say and ensured my buying experience exceeded my expectations.
Even the Finance Manager Raquel went above and beyond to find me an outstanding interest rate (much lower than the same bank quoted me), I don't typically write reviews, but wanted to pass on my recommendation for BMW of SF and Nyomi B.!

In late Feb 2007 (Feb 26), I became aware of BMW's March 01 price increases.  As I wanted to do European delivery in May, I decided to email local BMW dealers for a price quote immediately, rather than wait until late March.  My email listed the 335i E90 car specs and desired ED date.   Later that day, the internet manager at BMW SF was the first to reply, with an offer that met my target price.  So on Feb 27, I accepted the deal with BMW SF, and faxed my lease application.  A week or so later, I rec'd a production number and confirmed ED date.   My prior CA (client advisor in BMW-speak) at another Bay Area BMW dealer replied after 4 days, thus locking me into the price increase.  Plus, his offer was way over my target price.  Other dealers wouldn't state a price, and wanted me to come into the dealership.   In early May (about 2-3 weeks prior to the ED date), I finally met my new CA when I went in to sign the purchase order and lease paperwork.  The car was picked up in Munich on May 22.  After a nearly two week vacation in the Italian lake district and the south of France (during the Cannes film festival and Monaco GP), the car was dropped off in Paris on June 1.  Car was redelivered on July 23.

BMW is an acronym  for Bayerische Motoren Werke AG --  or, in English, Bavarian Motor Works. Whatever you call it, the German-based  company is one of the world's most respected automakers, renowned for crafting  luxury cars and SUVs that offer superior levels of driving enjoyment. 
Founded  in Munich, the company began in the early 1910s as an aircraft manufacturer.  BMW's current logo, designed to represent white propeller blades against a blue  sky, reflects these origins; its blue-and-white color scheme also references  Bavaria's blue-and-white checkered flag. 
It  wasn't until 1928 that production began on the first BMW automobile, the Dixi. The  car proved tremendously popular, and its success helped the manufacturer  weather the Depression. BMW's best-known pre-World War II vehicle was the Type  328 roadster, a supple two-seater that racked up more than 120 victories on the  motorsport circuit between 1936 and 1940. Postwar BMW cars maintained this  tradition, with several racing, rallying and hill climb victories.
The  early 1950s saw the launch of the BMW 501, a roomy, voluptuous sedan that was  resplendent with all of the hopefulness of that era. It was soon followed by  the 502, which was powered by the world's first light-alloy V8, foreshadowing  BMW's ongoing commitment to developing new technology. The best-selling BMW of that  decade was the Isetta, a petite two-seat "microcar" typically powered  by a 12- or 13-horsepower engine. The mid-'50s also saw the debut of the limited  production and breathtakingly beautiful 507 sports car, which had an alloy body  and used the 502's V8 for propulsion. In the 1960s, BMW sales strengthened  significantly, thanks in part to the immense popularity of the 1500, a sporty  family sedan.
By  the 1970s, BMW was establishing itself as a full-fledged car company. It was a pioneer  for many emerging technologies, including turbocharging and advanced vehicle  electronics. BMW of North America was established at that time, and consumers  who coveted both sports and luxury cars became loyal "Bimmer" owners.  The '70s also saw the birth of BMW's three-tier sport sedan range consisting of  the compact 3 Series, midsize 5 Series and large 7 Series cars and the creation  of its performance M division. Though the 3 Series could be had with four-cylinder  power, it was the company's inline-6 engines that developed BMW's reputation  for spirited, yet highly refined performance. At decade's end, the limited  production, short-lived M1 supercar debuted.
Throughout  the 1980s, BMW became the unofficial poster car of yuppies, as the brand  ostensibly signified one's financial success as well as a passion for driving.  The elegant 6 Series coupe debuted, and the latter part of the decade saw the  high-performance M division working its magic on various production models.
In the  early 1990s, BMW replaced the 6 Series with the powerful (V12-powered at first)  but heavy 8 Series grand touring coupe. A bit later, BMW introduced its popular  Z3 roadster. The company also opened its first U.S. manufacturing plant in the  latter half of the 1990s.
The  2000s brought a midsize SUV (the X5) as well as a compact SUV (the X3) as BMW joined  the hot-selling segment. Since then, BMW has replaced the Z3 with the Z4,  introduced the compact 1 Series, produced hybrid versions of a few models and  debuted the X6 fastback crossover. The company has also expanded its empire to  include Mini and Rolls-Royce and continues to build motorcycles, something it  has done since the 1920s.
BMW's  famous advertising slogan describes each of its vehicles as "the ultimate  driving machine," and it's not mere hyperbole. Over the past couple of  decades, BMWs have become the standard for performance and luxury in most of  the "over $30,000" segments. With family-friendly wagons, crisp  sedans, distinctive coupes, nimble sports cars and spacious SUVs offered, BMW's  model roster is diverse. But its vehicles all share a common characteristic:  the ability to make drivers feel gloriously connected to the road.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
