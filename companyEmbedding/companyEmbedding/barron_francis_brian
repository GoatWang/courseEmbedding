 Career History



Secretary, Senior Vice President & General Counsel

                                    2013 - Current                


Cimarex Energy Co.


                  Cimarex Energy, Co. (NYSE, XEC) is a Denver-based independent oil and gas exploration and production company with principal operations in the Mid-Continent and Permian Basin areas of the U.S. Our business approach is centered on increasing shareholder value through consistent profitable growth in proved reserves and production through our drilling program and optimizing production rates. Year-end 2011 proved reserves totaled 2.05 trillion cubic feet equivalent (59% natural gas and 82% developed).

Our approach is focused on drill-bit driven growth in production and reserves utilizing risked rate of return economics to evaluate projects. We rely heavily on our organization of geoscientists to generate our drilling prospects. We have decentralized exploration teams who are experts in their regions. A cornerstone to our approach is detailed evaluation of each drilling decision based on its risk-adjusted discounted cash flow rate of return on investment. Our analysis includes estimates and assessments of potential reserve size, geologic and mechanical risks, expected costs and future production profiles.

We also believe it is important to maintain a strong financial position and conservative capital structure in order to maintain drilling activity through all price cycles. We believe that this approach will create shareholder value through growth in per-share earnings, cash flow, reserves and production                




Chief Financial Officer

Families Sanctifying the World: An Interview with Bishop Barron

by Brandon VogtSeptember 21, 20151 Comments















 




 
 
Tomorrow, Bishop Robert Barron will deliver the opening keynote talk for the World Meeting of Families. I recently sat down with him to discuss his talk, Pope Francis, and challenges facing the family today.
Brandon Vogt: What do you appreciate about Pope Francis' teaching on the family? What do you think he gets right?
Bishop Robert Barron: I've been very impressed by his reiteration of Humanae Vitae, which is very important. Some people are wavering a bit, wondering, "Does Humanae Vitae have a future? Is it right or wrong?" This pope clearly reaffirmed the great intuitions of Humanae Vitae, which I've always seen as the Church's call to radical holiness. The Church is not in the business of spiritual mediocrity or settling for second best. It's in the business of making saints. We call people to a radical holiness, and that's what Humanae Vitae is all about, how to live your married life in a radically holy way. The pope is right in re-emphasizing the importance of Humanae Vitae.
Brandon: What issues do you hope Pope Francis highlights at the World Meeting of Families?
Bishop Robert Barron: My greatest hope is that he encourages families. We can get bogged down sometimes in the hot-button issues, the back and forth on particular matters. And that's fine, we should do some of that. But I would hope he really encourages families, who often feel beleaguered, who don't have a clear sense of direction.
I'd like Pope Francis to come as a good papa, a good father, and encourage families to be what they're supposed to be, which is an ecclesiola, a little church. St. John Paul II had the right language here. The family is a "domestic church" where missions are cultivated, where people learn the virtues and how to love, which is what the Trinity is all about. I hope the pope will encourage families and give them a sense of the spiritual mission that is inherent in being a family.
Brandon: Before being names Auxiliary Bishop of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, you were the rector of Mundelein Seminary, where you were responsible for training hundreds of young men. Most of those future-priests will directly minister to families. What needs will they respond to?
Bishop Robert Barron: The two most important needs are for purpose and encouragement. Families today need a keen religious and spiritual sensibility about the family. The family is not just a political, economic, or psychological reality; it's a spiritual reality. It mirrors the Trinity. God's covenant is expressed through families. God has created a kind of family in the Church, the mystical body.
I also emphasized to my seminarians that the spiritual father's job is to help families understand the spiritual dimension and purpose of family life.
Once you get that clear, everything else readily falls into place. Recovering the spiritual heart of the family—that's the need that has to be addressed.
Brandon: What do you think the media get wrong in covering questions about the family?
Bishop Robert Barron: The media are always waiting for the Church to change its mind. They suggest questions like, do we have the votes or survey results to overturn Church teaching? Is the new pope going to change things around? But that's precisely the wrong way to think about it.
The Church is always interested in responding better to pastoral needs, so it does adjust to changing cultural situations. But it's not like we're just caught in mutability. The Church is not like a political party or political institution that changes its policies every eight or ten years.
The media get that wrong, and therefore always try to read the Church in a sort of adversarial, confrontational way, with winners, losers, and a constant tug-of-war. They see the church politically, rather than as a sacred institution. And that's the problem.
Brandon: The most recent synod focused on the family and the one preceding it was on the New Evangelization. Do you think this was intentional? Is there a connection here?
Bishop Robert Barron: Absolutely. What's the vehicle for evangelization? The real bearer of evangelization is the family. Families are called, like Christ, to be priests, prophets, and kings. They are priests when they sacrifice and usher each other to God. They are prophets when they teach what Christianity is about and put it on display. They are kings when they guide their families and relationships into right order. All of these expressions are deeply evangelistic. So I think there's a huge connection between families and the New Evangelization.
Brandon: Tell us a little bit about your opening keynote talk at the World Meeting of Families, titled "Living as the Image of God: Created for Joy and Love".
Bishop Robert Barron: The talk will center around the imago Dei, the fact that we're made in the image of God and thus made for joy. Instead of focusing on the hot-button issues concerning the family, the organizers asked me to explore the broader sense of the image of God and how families reflect it.
I plan to use the rubric I hinted at earlier, that of priest, prophet, and king. To be made in the image of God means that we participate in these three missions: to sanctify, to teach, and to govern. That's true throughout salvation history, it's true of us as individuals, and it's especially true of families. Families are the bearer of these three tasks, now and down through the ages.
So the talk begins with a biblical background to the imago Dei—what it is, how it was lost, and how it is restored through the Church. Then I show how the family especially bears that power into the world.
Brandon: You've affirmed the need for families to be encouraged. Suppose in Philadelphia Pope Francis hands you the microphone and says, "I'll give you one sentence to encourage families around the world." What do you say?
Bishop Robert Barron: Your family is a means by which God wants to sanctify the world.

One can "feel" it - God's Life, Grace and Mercy are descending upon the whole world like a refreshing springtime rain for all men.  Those who are disposed - those men of good will, will stand refreshed in it, able to give their "fiat" to God, through Christ Jesus with our Heavenly Mother.  Bishop Barron is, has been, and will be a powerful and pleasing rain cloud of Living Water.  Thank you Bishop Barron for your perennial "Fiat" to The Holy Trinity, in Christ, in order to reach the whole world that has been in drought for so long - to the point of withering and shriveling away without hope.

The Pope, The Congress, and a Trappist Monk
by Bishop Robert BarronSeptember 30, 20158 Comments











 
 
I had the extraordinary privilege last week of following the Pope’s pilgrimage at very close quarters. I had this access both as a bishop and as a commentator for NBC News. It was thrilling indeed to witness just how rapturously the American people received the Pope and how affected the Holy Father was by this reception. Many images stay vividly in my mind: the Pope kissing the forehead of the ten year old boy with cerebral palsy, the rabbi and imam praying together at the September 11th memorial, a little boy from a New York Catholic school showing the Pope how to maneuver his way around a Smart Board. But what stays most powerfully with me is the Pope speaking to a joint meeting of the United States Congress in Washington, D.C. 
My first assignment for NBC last week was the Today Show’s coverage of the Pope’s arrival on the south lawn of the White House. As I sat on the platform with Matt Lauer and Maria Shriver, I looked across at the stately obelisk of the Washington Monument, and I remembered an extraordinary event from the mid- nineteenth century. Along with many other world leaders, Pope Pius IX had sent a block for the construction of the monument to the Father of our country, but an angry mob of anti-Catholic bigots took that piece of marble and threw it into the Potomac. This of course was not an isolated or purely egregious act of vandalism; rather, it partook of a widespread and deeply-rooted hatred of Catholicism that lasted in this country in fairly virulent form up to the election of John F. Kennedy in 1960. That the Pope of Rome would be graciously received at the White House and welcomed to speak before the entire Congress of the United States would have struck most Americans, for much of our history, as simply unthinkable. And this is why (and I’ll confess it openly) my eyes filled with tears as I saw the Pope standing at the rostrum in the House of Representatives, the cheers of the gathered lawmakers washing over him. 
And as I listened to the Pope’s words that day, I was even more astonished. As is his wont, Francis didn’t trade in abstractions. Instead, he focused his remarks on four outstanding figures from American history—Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther King, Jr., Dorothy Day, and Thomas Merton—each of whom spoke of some dimension of authentic freedom. Anyone familiar with my work over the years would know that all four of these people are heroes of mine. I have a photo of Lincoln over the desk in my office; I have written extensively on King and have done a number of videos on his life and legacy; Dorothy Day is featured prominently in my documentary CATHOLICISM (see Episode 2); and Thomas Merton is, quite simply, one of the major reasons that I entered the priesthood, and a photo of him is in eyeshot as I type these words. 
I would love to explore the Pope’s analysis of each of these giants, but given the limited scope of this article, I will focus on the one I consider the most important, namely Merton. What Merton signaled for the Pope was the openness to dialogue with other religions to be sure, but also and more significantly, the contemplative openness to the reality of God, to a dimension that goes beyond the empirical world and the achievements of the individual ego. This is of supreme importance, for when a sense of God evanesces—as it has increasingly in our secularized Western world—all we have left for understanding human affairs are psychological and political categories. Armed only with these, we fall into the customary patterns of left and right, liberal and conservative, open to change and suspicious of change, etc. And this, furthermore, makes Catholic social teaching so confounding to the pundits and politicos. How can the Catholic Church simultaneously advocate against abortion and assisted suicide but for immigration reform and attention to the poor? How can it stand against the abuse of the environment and for the free market, against the death penalty, and for the family? With God out of the picture, it is indeed hard to make sense of such an array of opinions, but with God at the heart of things, the various positions of the Church fall into harmony, much like the medallions in a rose window. If God exists, then every individual person that he has created is a subject of rights, freedom, and dignity. If God exists, then no one is expendable and everyone is equally worthy of respect. It is none other than the contemplative attitude exemplified by Thomas Merton that reveals this deep consistency.  
How wonderful and strange that a Pope would be addressing Congress at all, but how surpassing wonderful and strange it was that he should use the occasion to hold up before the lawmakers of the most powerful nation on earth the example of a Trappist monk who gave his life to the contemplation of God.

Thank you for writing this post...a needed voice in the wilderness of the face of our Catholic social teaching and moral stances in the midst of confused political system.  How I hope more of our catholic and Christian brothers and sisters will come to see that it is not republican or democrat that we should side with, but rather, Christs viewpoints on humanity.  Having visits Gethsemane and Mertons library at Bellarmine U, his writings are among the most influential in my short life.  Thank you again for your leadership and courage!

Hi Bishop Baron, and welcome to LA. My two mites: “How can (the Church) stand against the abuse of the environment and for the free market(?)” By pointing out as often as necessary how free market economies have overall better environmental records than centrally planned economies like China and the USSR. When environmental protection becomes valuable to the people, businesses will sell it to them. “…against the death penalty, and for the family(?)” Interesting juxtaposition. It’s probably why my Pro-Life, Pro-Family position compels me to also be Pro-Death Penalty.

I remember Fr. Barron saying once that Thomas Merton was "probably not a saint" (at least I think they were the words), but with all respect, I wonder now, thinking of the immensity of his influence, the strength of his teachings, and yes, his utter commitment regardless of his faults (we are all sinners, even the saints), I now wonder whether he may indeed be a saint.  It's not a bad thing for the Pope to be mentioning you in your centennial year in such a memorable way and in such an important speech.  God Bless you Bishop Barron for introducing me to Thomas Merton, and your own evangelical ways.

I thought of you immediately when the Pope mentioned Thomas Merton.  I took you seriously on your choice of the five (5) most important books for you in forming your viewpoint about Catholicism.   Merton's "Seven Story Mountain" was one of them.   I read this book's journey to faith from Merton's childhood to that of becoming the Trappist Monk.  The trappist who started as anything but a serious Christian to one who devoutly believed.  My wife and I went to DC and NY to see the Pope and I felt so at home in being one of the thousands to admire the Pope for his journey through the streets of the US.  I guess I now feel how important Merton's books and his life are one of those pillars of faith to help us on our journey of faith.  /I also believe , maybe predict, that one day you will move through the streets of the US as the first Catholic American Pope.  You have already established yourself as a voice of the Church to millions using social media.   You are on your own St. Paul like journey and many will take shots at you as appear on Youtube but you make brilliantly clear the many reason to better understand Faith, Hope and Love and all the roads that lead there.  God bless us all!
