Our Business
Our Business

Perpetual's business plan is based upon an entrepreneurial approach to value creation through finding, developing, producing, and marketing oil and gas based energy. The Company is focused on growing production, reserves, cash flow and value through exploration and development, the application of innovative technologies and acquisitions. The Company actively manages its strong and diversified portfolio of assets to crystallize value, capitalize on opportunities and manage risks through commodity price cycles.
In recent years through its purposeful transition from a shallow-gas focused distributing energy trust to a diversified, growth-oriented, exploration and production corporation, the foundations of Perpetual's strategy have been refined. Four pillars define Perpetual's strategy as the organization is built to grow, prosper and last.
1)	Build a diversified portfolio of material, repeatable high return, resource-style assets for short-term and long-term growth and value:
capture material positions in potential growth strategies through grass roots exploration and acquisitions and evaluate through risk-managed investment;
exploit and expand profitable, proven assets with prudent investment; and
maintain a diversified asset and opportunity portfolio by commodity, geography, risk-profile and development timeline.
 
2)	Establish excellence in chosen priorities:
safety is job one;
value technical, operational, execution and leadership excellence;
maximize profits through a low-cost culture; and
be accountable for results.
 
3)	Maintain a healthy balance sheet:
disciplined spending while balancing priorities;
maintain levers for optionality;
pursue dispositions to actively manage the portfolio to optimize value; and
position to be robust through commodity cycles.
 
4)	Manage risk and capitalize on commodity price cycles:
assess technical, operational, execution and transactional risks and invest appropriately to balance risk and reward;
employ and actively manage market-based commodity price risk management strategies; and
capture counter-cyclical opportunities.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Our story




Gu-ru / ‘goroō /
Noun:
1. A mentor, a teacher, one who helps you move forward.
2. A source of inspiration and good energy.


GURU
A Story of Organic Growth
Ever since the early days, GURU has always been driven by this idea of crafting the best natural energy drink out there. Founded in Montreal during the summer of 1999 by four college friends, the company marketed the world's first all-natural energy drink.
More than 15 years later, this vision is not only fulfilled but is also thriving and expanding worldwide. GURU has become the #1 Organic Energy Drink in Canada and the US in the Health Channel thanks to a strong network of distribution partnerships and a passionate sales team. 
With research & development at the forefront of our expansion, GURU now tackles a new market and adventure with the recent introduction of our Energy Waters. This new line of product arrives just in time to satisfy a growing demand for organic sugar and calorie-free energy beverages.
In short, GURU has and will always believe that energy should not come at the expense of health. That is what has brought our company a steady and organic growth.
Our Philosophy
Through its corporate philosophy and its beverages, GURU gives good energy for people to make great things, reminding that, with the right dose of will, inspiration and energy, achieving great results is within everyone's reach. 
People today define themselves less by what they have and more by what they do and contribute to the world. Resourcefulness, imagination, inventiveness is today’s new currency. Whether using technology, natural ingredients or just plain common sense, people who Make it Good are the ones who seek to make everything better. We call them Makers.
They are pioneers that never settle. Makers, not followers. Crafters not manufacturers. Some may call them obsessed, exceptional or extraordinary people. But these are men and women who are true innovators, thought leaders and doers in their respective communities. They make the impossible possible.

Luc Martin-Privat
Our Brew Master
Meet Luc our Brew Master. He is the brains behind GURU.  In fact, while he could have become your friendly neighborhood pharmacist, Luc had other dreams…
From the functional herbs he started playing with in his dad’s lab to his PhD in Pharmacology, Luc has mastered the art of blending botanicals, an art he is now applying to our beloved GURU.
Always on the lookout for smart organics from around the world, Luc is looking into the GURU recipe “Organically” to make it perfect everytime! And when he is not looking at new ways to craft our GURU, Luc is dreaming about new products!
