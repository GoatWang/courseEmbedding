OverviewA Message From Anchin's Managing PartnerAnchin At A GlanceBKR International 



 


OverviewAnchin's Mission Statement
Our mission is to be the premier accounting and advisory firm passionately delivering expert solutions to privately held businesses, investment funds and high net worth families.
About Anchin
Founded in 1923 in New York City, Anchin, Block & Anchin LLP (Anchin) is the largest single-office public accounting firm in North America and is recognized as a top-tier firm nationwide in terms of its quality, management, scope of services and work environment. Anchin has a staff of approximately 375 with highly specialized industry and service teams. The Firm provides privately-held businesses and high net worth individuals with a wide range of traditional and non-traditional advisory services. Services include accounting and audit; tax planning and compliance; tax credits and incentives; management and succession advisory; and litigation support, forensic accounting and valuation.
Our size and culture allows us to provide this full range of services while offering personalized attention to the diverse needs of our clients. By offering superior service and a quality work product, Anchin has enjoyed long-term relationships with our clients – some for over 50 years. Our industry expertise and our commitment to client service have also earned us a stellar reputation in the business, financial and legal communities.
This reputation did not happen by coincidence or luck. Anchin’s professionals have always been dedicated to delivering the highest level of technical expertise combined with the personal attention that our clients need and deserve.
We are particularly proud that the majority of our partner and senior positions have been filled by promotions within the Firm. Our goal is to chart a career development track for our most talented professionals and to develop them into well-rounded industry experts with accounting, consulting, and tax experience. We invest heavily in our people, providing significant opportunities for specialized industry training. This enables us to retain our people and significantly reduce our employee turnover, maintaining one of the lowest rates in the profession.
Anchin has been rewarded with the distinctions of being named one of the “best of the best” accounting firms in the nation (Inside Public Accounting); one of the top ten large companies to work for in New York State (Society for Human Resource Management); one of the best accounting firms in the nation to work for (Accounting Today); a Best Place to Work in New York City (Crain’s New York Business); a Best Accounting Firm in North America (Hedgeweek Magazine); and U.S. Overall Accountancy Firm of the Year (Acquisition International Magazine).
Membership
Anchin is an independent member of BKR International, a leading global association of independent accounting and business advisory firms representing the expertise of more than 150 member firms with over 300 offices in over 70 countries around the world.
The Firm is a member of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ Division for CPA Firms and its Private Companies Practice Section and Center for Public Company Audit Firms. Anchin has always had a strong commitment to quality and service. We regularly undergo peer review examinations to insure that our internal accounting and auditing procedures meet the highest quality standards of our profession.A Message From Anchin's Managing PartnerYour browser does not support HTML5 video tag.Welcome to our website.
We invite you to get to know us better by exploring the valuable information throughout our site, including our whitepapers, alerts and events. There are many accounting and consulting firms to choose from in the marketplace. You may be wondering, what makes Anchin different?
We are one of the fastest growing firms in the New York metropolitan area and we have not merged, consolidated or sold over the last 2 decades. We are consistently honored by key business organizations such as Crain’s New York Business as “One of the Best Places to Work in New York City.” We are the largest single office firm in the country. All decisions and strategies are developed right here at 1375 Broadway in midtown Manhattan. What does all of this mean to you?
It means we are true business advisors who understand your industry. We are tax professionals who add value and strategy. Our partners spend more time providing the highest level of service and value for you and your business. And we have consistent leadership and low turnover at the partner and staff levels, yielding quality and timely service.
We would love the opportunity to work with you. For more thought leadership from Anchin, please follow us on LinkedIn, Facebook, or on Twitter @anchincpa. We look forward to being Your Expert Partner!

Wells Fargo


                                            I find it quite disturbing to see 24 one star, the lowest, ratings on the first page of Wallet Hub's most recent reviews of Wells Fargo. Somehow, in its overall summary, Wallet Hub still gives the impression Wells Fargo is a good banking option. What's going on here?

In the long run they will charge you plenty and the support is virtually non-existent. They don't even have a working answering system. They are disorganized  and a nightmare to work with.

Making simple transfers or even looking at accounts is harder and more confusing. bring back the old version.
