Ex-husband, son of Illinois convicted killer Paula Sims die in crash 








Jeremy Paschall, AP
Paula Sims, convicted in the deaths of her two baby daughters in 1990, is led away from a Madison County courtroom in Edwardsville, Ill., on March 10, 1999.

Tribune wire reportsContact Reporter




The ex-husband and son of an Illinois woman convicted in the deaths of her two baby daughters 25 years ago were killed Saturday when their Jeep flipped over the railing of an Interstate 55 overpass.Jackson police spokeswoman Colundula Green identified 63-year-old Robert Sims and 27-year-old Randall Sims, both of Edwardsville. Multiple media outlets report the pair had been rear-ended by an alleged drunken driver, forcing their Jeep off the overpass.Green said 47-year-old Yolanda McNeely was arrested on charges of drunken driving and fleeing an accident scene.Paula Sims' trial made national news in 1990 when she had claimed that the same masked killer stole her 2-week-old daughter Loralei from their home in Brighton in 1986 and 6-week-old daughter Heather from their home in Alton in 1989. Paula Sims was convicted of first-degree murder in Heather's death on Jan. 30, 1990. Three months later, Sims pleaded guilty to concealment of a homicidal death in the death of her first daughter, Loralei. Sims was sentenced to life in prison for the murder of Heather Sims.

The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that Robert Sims, who was never charged in the deaths, had testified on his wife's behalf at trial but divorced her months later. He had taken custody of their one surviving child, Randall.Illinois state Sen. Bill Haine, who was Madison County's prosecutor when Paula Sims was convicted, expressed sorrow Sunday night about the deaths of her ex-husband and son.

A jury did not believe a mother`s story that a masked gunman kidnapped and killed her 6-week-old daughter last year, and it convicted her Tuesday of the murder. 

Looking wan and drained, Paula Sims, 30, of Alton, Ill., sat staring straight ahead as the verdict was read, shook her head slightly,...

LEGAL TERMS

(more...)An agreement to do something or to allow something to happen, made with complete knowledge of all relevant facts, such as the risks involved or any available alternatives. For example, a patient may give informed consent to medical treatment only after the healthcare professional has disclosed all possible risks involved in accepting or rejecting the treatment. A healthcare provider or facility may be held responsible for an injury caused by an undisclosed risk. In another context, a person accused of committing a crime cannot give up his constitutional rights--for example, to remain silent or to talk with an attorney--unless and until he has been informed of those rights, usually via the well-known Miranda warnings.

EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGEThe privilege that allows the president and other high officials of the executive branch to keep certain communications private if disclosing those communicatio... (more...)The privilege that allows the president and other high officials of the executive branch to keep certain communications private if disclosing those communications would disrupt the functions or decisionmaking processes of the executive branch. As demonstrated by the Watergate hearings, this privilege does not extend to information germane to a criminal investigation.

BATTERYA crime consisting of physical contact that is intended to harm someone. Unintentional harmful contact is not battery, no mater how careless the behavior or how... (more...)A crime consisting of physical contact that is intended to harm someone. Unintentional harmful contact is not battery, no mater how careless the behavior or how severe the injury. A fist fight is a common battery; being hit by a wild pitch in a baseball game is not.

(more...)Listening to conversations or observing conduct which is meant to be private, typically by using devices that amplify sound or light, such as stethoscopes or binoculars. The term comes from the common law offense of listening to private conversations by crouching under the windows or eaves of a house. Nowadays, eavesdropping includes using electronic equipment to intercept telephone or other wire communications, or radio equipment to intercept broadcast communications. Generally, the term 'eavesdropping' is used when the activity is not legally authorized by a search warrant or court order; and the term 'surveillance' is used when the activity is permitted by law. Compare electronic surveillance.

BAIL BONDThe money posted by a 'bondsman' for a defendant who cannot afford his bail. The defendant pays a certain portion, usually 10%. If the defendant fails to appear... (more...)The money posted by a 'bondsman' for a defendant who cannot afford his bail. The defendant pays a certain portion, usually 10%. If the defendant fails to appear for a court hearing, the judge can issue a warrant for his arrest and threaten to 'forfeit,' or keep, the money if the defendant doesn't appear soon. Usually, the bondsman will look for the defendant and bring him back, forcefully if necessary, in order to avoid losing the bail money.

SEARCH WARRANTAn order signed by a judge that directs owners of private property to allow the police to enter and search for items named in the warrant. The judge won't issue... (more...)An order signed by a judge that directs owners of private property to allow the police to enter and search for items named in the warrant. The judge won't issue the warrant unless she has been convinced that there is probable cause for the search -- that reliable evidence shows that it's more likely than not that a crime has occurred and that the items sought by the police are connected with it and will be found at the location named in the warrant. In limited situations the police may search without a warrant, but they cannot use what they find at trial if the defense can show that there was no probable cause for the search.

MISDEMEANORA crime, less serious than a felony, punishable by no more than one year in jail. Petty theft (of articles worth less than a certain amount), first-time drunk d... (more...)A crime, less serious than a felony, punishable by no more than one year in jail. Petty theft (of articles worth less than a certain amount), first-time drunk driving and leaving the scene of an accident are all common misdemeanors.

PROSECUTORA lawyer who works for the local, state or federal government to bring and litigate criminal cases.

MISTRIALA trial that ends prematurely and without a judgment, due either to a mistake that jeopardizes a party's right to a fair trial or to a jury that can't agree on ... (more...)A trial that ends prematurely and without a judgment, due either to a mistake that jeopardizes a party's right to a fair trial or to a jury that can't agree on a verdict (a hung jury) If a judge declares a mistrial in a civil case, he or she will direct that the case be set for a new trial at a future date. Mistrials in criminal cases can result in a retrial, a plea bargain or a dismissal of the charges.
