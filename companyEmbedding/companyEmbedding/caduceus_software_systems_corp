Caduceus Software
24 X 7 Software Systems










 








About 

Caduceus Software Systems is an innovation company. It provides technology consultancy and is also developing cloud based products.
Now
Today we are focussing on cloud innovation and collaboration networking systems. We have advanced experience in Amazon AWS products to scale our client projects to an enterprise level. Additionally we support more traditional scaling such as in-house or self-hosted VMWare ESXi platforms.
Team
Our team consists of the President,Richard Tang who is also the Chief Technical Officer. Erwin Valhsing is our Filing agent and our finance consultant and estimator. We have consultants from Washington, Rhode Island,  Canada and India to help on larger projects.
Our humble beginnings
The Company started out making a medical software shelf product called Caduceus MMS. It was an electroni  health records (EHR) system heared towards small medical clinics. It also had advanced capabilities such as pulling data from the state and provincial medical services database conforming to the ICD 9 protocol. The software is capable of storing medical imagery in raw format in encrypted datastores that conform to the patient data protection law requirements. The software was trialed and sold to some clinics up until 2014. We have discontinued the software because the medical EHR regulations and the software product was traditional and we felt it would eventually be allowed to “Cloudify” the product. Depending on client demands and potential intereat , we will revisit the idea and possibly refactor the software from being a shelf product to a cloud product.

Amazon AWS services – Caduceus Software


































Skip to content





Caduceus Software
24 X 7 Software Systems










 








Amazon AWS services 

Amazon AWS is a cloud infrastructure that small and enterprise companies use for web hosting and advanced networking services.
Amazon AWS has products:

Our Company primarily focuses on the Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Simple Storage Service (S3). and the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) products for our clients. We have expertise in provisioning and converting your conventional servers to be “cloud ready” and port them to EC2 instances.
Today there is heightened security over public networks. Private LAN networks that have some Internet access via a tunnel to/from the outside world already have exposure to the public Internet. AWS services allows you to create LANs and VPC with the same rigid rules that you need to keep your network safe, even though it is not physically in your server room.   The extra added benefit to using AWS over conventional means is that your compute power can be regulated (lowered or increased infinitesimally) using AWS, whereas if you attempted this on hardware baremetal you would need to spend money and expertise on scaling your physical network (physical space, power, cooling, CPU, IOPS, RAM, and redundancy).
We think that this age of compute is truly dedicated towards CPU and IOPS with less emphasis on the hardware. Network engineering is now performed on a higher OSI layer which is friendlier and more efficient for the team as a whole because provisioning is quicker via not needing to deal with physical hardware constraints.
We, at Caduceus Software Corp. are very interested in cloud computing and will offer our services to provision through Amazon AWS.
We will also offer newsletters and blog entries on AWS products as we explore and learn as we go. Please evolve with us and collaborate.
Growth is expanding on what we know now, and wealth is built on expanding into the unknown. Hop on board. 🙂

Data Analysis & Database Management
Healthcare facilities usually do not have the software, dedicated staff, training, or procedures required to properly maintain data elements that would optimize the effectiveness of their materials management information systems (MMIS). While this has a dramatic effect on the cost and efficiency of the facility's purchasing department, it negatively affects other system functions such as accounts payable and supplier fill rates.Read More

Reducing Your Inefficiencies & Saving You Money
Unparalleled in its design and scope, the Caduceus Materials Management Information System (MMIS) is an advanced "end-to-end" hospital supply chain software solution utilizing scanning and a wireless infrastructure to manage materials, costs, and charges from requisitioning to the point of care.
Caduceus Systems delivers an effective way for forward-thinking hospitals and other healthcare facilities to integrate the best-of-breed hospital supply chain management solutions that have proven so effective in reducing costs throughout American industry without requiring wholesale change in existing systems.
This challenge was first articulated in a major analysis of inefficiencies in the healthcare industry, the Efficient Healthcare Consumer Response Report (EHCR, 1996). The report identified $11.6 billion of cost saving opportunities in the American healthcare system directly due to inefficient product movement and ineffective inventory control and materials management. Nearly ten years later, this situation has only grown worse. As materials cost has increased, this is inefficiency our overburdened health system cannot afford.

By assessing your facility's materials management and in-place processes, and implementing best practice recommendations, the Caduceus MMIS can have a huge financial impact. For every hospital or system we've analyzed, the up-front investment can be returned by operational savings within six to 18 months. Then those recurring savings and cost controls continue on, year after year.
Additionally, our materials management solution is the ideal tool for distribution of pharmaceutical and medical supplies, as required by the planning for emergency preparedness and the Strategic National Stockpile.

Our Vision
The challenges for today's healthcare facilities are assuring efficient and timely access to supplies while reducing the investment in inventory, improving cash flow and delivering the highest quality of patient care. Until now, these challenges have only been partially addressed using software solutions available to the healthcare industry.
Drawing on substantial evidence to validate its findings, Caduceus Systems LLC can show that a robust approach to automating the inventory and materials management functions within a hospital can provide significant improvements in each of these critical areas. This is opposed to the historical approach of addressing a subset of these objectives, to the exclusion of others.
Our Dedication to Superior Materials Management Information Systems
Caduceus Systems is dedicated to providing the healthcare industry with a best-of-breed Materials Management Information System software product and top-quality services as a solution to the challenges of managing inventory, tracking its location, attributing the use of supplies to the respective patient, department or caregiver and optimizing the reorder and replenishment process.
Today the business relationships and economic conventions that govern the healthcare supply chain are driven by a "push," or order-based approach to inventory management. This is far different than a "pull" or demand/utilization-based concept for the ordering and replenishment of supplies. This pull-based approach has been successfully adopted by other industries and resulted in savings being measured in the billions. As a viable means to improving cash flow without degradation in supply availability, a materials management system deployment should anticipate this probable scenario and position the healthcare facility to act as a catalyst in this evolution.
As collaborative relationships evolve between hospitals, suppliers and trading partners, enhanced communication capabilities will assist in furthering cost reductions and efficiency improvements through technology like EDI and Internet-based e-procurement. However, Caduceus Systems believes that a thorough and systematic approach to automate the internal processes associated with materials management within a hospital is both a tactical requirement and a strategic prerequisite for the successful use of e-procurement. Materials Management personnel, clinicians and caregivers must have visibility and confidence in knowing what supplies they have, precisely where they are located, and have continuous access to the correct supplies when and where they are needed.
We at Caduceus Systems are confident that our software solutions offer the healthcare industry an unequaled answer for meeting today's challenges and offer a building block approach to exploit other contemporary yet proven technologies as bi-products of our company's commitment to on-going research, development and continual enhancements to the Caduceus MMIS.
The future relationships between healthcare facilities and suppliers will undoubtedly include a shift in some of the costs and responsibilities associated with the inventory management and procurement functions. The products and services offered by Caduceus Systems will strategically position each of our customers to fully realize the benefits of reapportionment of the risks and costs as well as assimilate new ways of doing business and new technologies.

Caduceus Software Systems Corp. Announces Extensive Feature Set Of Its Flagship Product






Business Wire




Nov 14, 2011 6:00 AM EST













 


















































  Caduceus Software Systems Corp. (OTCBB: CSOC) - (The Company) has received numerous calls from its shareholders requesting more insight and information regarding its Healthcare Information Systems Software and the scope of the potential market for its software, for this reason this press release will address some of these questions.  Firstly, our software system is part of a lucrative transaction between the Company and Sygnit Corporation, where the Company has obtained an exclusive license to further develop, market, and distribute the software suite and its many planned add-ons, modules and upgrades to strategically sell into planned global markets. The software is not at the Beta stages; it has been tested and is ready to be sold to our current target markets of the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada.  The Caduceus MMS Software represents a new breed of Electronic Health Record (EHR) and Electronic Medical Billing (EMB) software that provides the medical community with a diverse arsenal of professional-grade data management systems, while ensuring that ease-of-implementation and cost of ownership do not daunt our clients. Unlike the average stable of EHR software systems currently offered to the medical industry, Caduceus MMS starts right at the gate with both billing (remittance and transactional support) and appointment scheduling capabilities. This is its uncompromising hallmark.  This revolutionary system, which was developed by a professional software team with over 2,500+ hours of programming time and more than 2 years of R&D, makes for a complete package with more to offer in its most basic deployment than several of its competitors. Some of the key features of the Caduceus MMS software are as follows:   The software has an enormous library of every known illness, condition, medication and possible diagnoses, Caduceus’ intelligence makes adapting it to any of the 44 recognized specialties elementary.   Maintains a database of tens of thousands of ICD9 and ICD10 Fee-for-Service (treatment), diagnostic, facility and other vital codes and delivers them in an easy-to-understand categorical manner.   Allows for the addition of virtually unlimited insurance and remittance grantors.   Makes billing and patient information retrieval simple by obtaining patient details directly from government systems.   Respects patient-data by securing all transactions with minimum 128-bit encryption.   Can be installed on virtually any computer running Windows without requiring the added overhead of upgrading hardware.   Tracks time-sensitive events such as appointments, accounts, and follow-ups and notifies staff with friendly reminders.   Is built to fit the budget, staff size, hardware architecture, medical specialty, and business specifics of any clinical practice. Specific, task-oriented modules may be added where required.    Additionally, benefits to the clinician include:   Caduceus MMS’s modular structure, simple technology environment requirements, and fundamental lifecycle upgrade policy means the owner’s initial and projected total-cost-of-ownership remain extremely low.   Its innovative and easy-to-use interface results in a shallower staff learning curve than its competition.    “The Company is very proud to further clarify our Software’s features to the general public. These features represent our dedication to providing rich and fulfilling functionality that all doctors and healthcare assistants want. We have a very clear roadmap for our development and from this we will know how to target sales and marketing,” says Derrick Gidden, President of The Company.

                 Welcome to Caduceus Software Systems Corp. (OTC: CSOC) http://caduceussoftware.net/    			       New Share Structure             Caduceus Software Systems Corp is an innovation company. It develops software, software design assets and technical expertise to its clients.  			The term, Caduceus, is an ancient symbol of good business/commerce. The company is focused on innovation with search as a primary project, and has lots of experience in IT in harsh environments, and it has a passion for music and the ability for music searchability improvements. It has assets and intellectual property that has accumulated for the past 5 years and will be applied to its projects 			          			    Caduceus Software is focussed on providing 24 x 7 systems for its clients. We are a consulting company as well as a products company. We are a cloud services consultant and provider. Richard Tang, President of Caduceus Software Corp., heads the implementation and execution of the daily operations of the Company. The daily operations of the Company are primarily cloud based, and we consult and provide expert install and maintenance on Amazon AWS services (EC2, S3, Route 53 and cloud front), as well as VMware ESXI.  			      Amazon AWS Services      Amazon AWS is a cloud infrastructure that small and enterprise companies use for web hosting and advanced networking services.   			  Our Company primarily focuses on the Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Simple Storage Service (S3). and the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) products for our clients. We have expertise in provisioning and converting your conventional servers to be “cloud ready” and port them to EC2 instances.        Today there is heightened security over public networks. Private LAN networks that have some Internet access via a tunnel to/from the outside world already have exposure to the public Internet. AWS services allows you to create LANs and VPC with the same rigid rules that you need to keep your network safe, even though it is not physically in your server room.   The extra added benefit to using AWS over conventional means is that your compute power can be regulated (lowered or increased infinitesimally) using AWS, whereas if you attempted this on hardware baremetal you would need to spend money and expertise on scaling your physical network (physical space, power, cooling, CPU, IOPS, RAM, and redundancy). We think that this age of compute is truly dedicated towards CPU and IOPS with less emphasis on the hardware. Network engineering is now performed on a higher OSI layer which is friendlier and more efficient for the team as a whole because provisioning is quicker via not needing to deal with physical hardware constraints. We, at Caduceus Software Corp. are very interested in cloud computing and will offer our services to provision through Amazon AWS. We will also offer newsletters and blog entries on AWS products as we explore and learn as we go. Please evolve with us and collaborate. Growth is expanding on what we know now, and wealth is built on expanding into the unknown. Hop on board.        VMWare Services 			      			  			Caduceus Software Systems Corp has a technical team that is skilled in VMWare ESXi installation. configuration, and advanced networking for virtual machines.  The technical team, individually, has done many configurations with Nimble Storage, EMC, Dell powerVault SAN storage, iSCSI attached arrays for redundancy, and fault-tolerance. We understand the complexity of your physical stack, and know the intricacies and how to avoid pitfalls when configuring your hardware. We provide VMWare support and advice on a consultancy basis, via webEx or Skype and Email or remote-hands via HP iLO or RDP, GotoMeeting, or VPN access to VNC into your network. In the spirit of open information and sharing knowledge, we will have a blog dedicated to tips and tricks of VMware ESXi configuration and performance tuning. Please feel free to contact us for any inquiries and for quotation for your troubleshooting or installation needs. Thank you.       Partners  We are proud technology partners with:      We are a proud partner reseller for VMware as of November 2016      We have a innovation Joint Venture agreement with Icon Media holdings and its subsidiary Spectrum Velocity:     Have any questions?

Caduceus Software
24 X 7 Software Systems










 








About 

Caduceus Software Systems is an innovation company. It provides technology consultancy and is also developing cloud based products.
Now
Today we are focussing on cloud innovation and collaboration networking systems. We have advanced experience in Amazon AWS products to scale our client projects to an enterprise level. Additionally we support more traditional scaling such as in-house or self-hosted VMWare ESXi platforms.
Team
Our team consists of the President,Richard Tang who is also the Chief Technical Officer. Erwin Valhsing is our Filing agent and our finance consultant and estimator. We have consultants from Washington, Rhode Island,  Canada and India to help on larger projects.
Our humble beginnings
The Company started out making a medical software shelf product called Caduceus MMS. It was an electroni  health records (EHR) system heared towards small medical clinics. It also had advanced capabilities such as pulling data from the state and provincial medical services database conforming to the ICD 9 protocol. The software is capable of storing medical imagery in raw format in encrypted datastores that conform to the patient data protection law requirements. The software was trialed and sold to some clinics up until 2014. We have discontinued the software because the medical EHR regulations and the software product was traditional and we felt it would eventually be allowed to “Cloudify” the product. Depending on client demands and potential intereat , we will revisit the idea and possibly refactor the software from being a shelf product to a cloud product.
