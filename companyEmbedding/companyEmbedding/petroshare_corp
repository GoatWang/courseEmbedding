	PROSPECTUS SUMMARY






	        



	This summary highlights selected information contained elsewhere in this prospectus. This summary is not complete and
	does not contain all of the information that you should consider before deciding to invest in our common stock. You should read this entire prospectus carefully, especially the "Risk Factors" section
	beginning on page 19 and our financial statements and notes thereto contained in this prospectus, before making an investment decision. This prospectus includes certain terms commonly used in
	the oil and natural gas industry, which are defined in the "GLOSSARY OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS TERMS" in Appendix A beginning on page A-1.













	BUSINESS OVERVIEW






	        We are an independent oil and natural gas company focused on the acquisition and development of crude oil and natural gas properties and have
	assembled approximately 9,900 net acres, including mineral rights only acreage, most of which is located in the Denver-Julesburg Basin, or the DJ Basin, in northeast Colorado. Our current operating
	focus is within the Wattenberg Field of the DJ Basin, which is located primarily in Adams and Weld Counties, Colorado. We have concentrated our efforts in areas where we believe the geo-mechanical
	characteristics of the underlying formations offer the potential for greater returns on capital. Our evaluation metrics include reservoir thickness, rock quality and resistivity of each formation,
	each of which affect the number of wells we plan to drill per drilling spacing unit.




	        We
	have placed particular emphasis on acquiring acreage in an area of the southern Wattenberg Field in Adams County and southwest Weld County, Colorado, along with an area southeast of
	the field, which areas we refer to collectively as the Southern Core, where we have assembled approximately 8,900 net acres. We selected our Southern Core acreage due to the quality of the hydrocarbon
	bearing rock, the production performance from other nearby wells, and the liquids-weighted nature of the production. We believe that all of these factors make development of much of our Southern Core
	acreage economic in the prevailing commodity price environment. We also have recently completed acquisitions in an area in the northern portion of the Wattenberg Field that previously has yielded
	hydrocarbon production from both vertical and horizontal wells.




	        We
	have identified over 250 gross potential horizontal drilling locations, which could result in over 90 net standard-range lateral wells (approximately 5,000 lateral feet), in areas of
	the Wattenberg Field that are prospective for oil and liquids-rich natural gas in the Niobrara and Codell formations. However, our strategy is to drill and participate in as many mid-range
	(approximately 7,500 lateral feet) and extended-range lateral (approximately 10,000 lateral feet) wells as feasible, which could result in fewer net wells in our inventory. Industry results and our
	own technical analysis have suggested that mid and extended-range lateral wells are the most efficient method to develop acreage in the Wattenberg Field.
	Ultimately the number of mid and extended-range lateral wells we are able to drill or participate in will be determined by several factors including the nature and size of our interest in the acreage,
	nearby development, geology, drilling spacing units, permitting, surface access, and pad location. Over 100 of these locations are either permitted, or in the process of being permitted, and are
	comprised of standard, mid and extended-range lateral wells.

	        Our
	strategy is to continue to leverage our management team's extensive technical, land, financial, and industry operating experience to direct the majority of our capital expenditure
	program through June 30, 2018 toward drilling operated Niobrara and Codell horizontal wells and acquire additional leaseholds in the DJ Basin, which we believe will enhance our strategic value.
	Since entering the DJ Basin in 2015, we have grown our position through acquisitions and organic leasing activities. Consistent with our track record, we plan to continue to selectively and
	opportunistically pursue strategic acquisitions in and around our core areas in Adams and Weld Counties.




	        We
	have an interest in 80 gross (26.4 net) productive wells and 33,151 gross (9,929 net, including 410 net minerals only) acres of oil and gas properties. With the exception of 17 gross
	(2.9 net) horizontal
	wells in which we are participating as a non-operator, all of these wells are vertical wellbores. Over the first quarter of 2017, we produced hydrocarbons at an average rate of approximately 440
	BOE/D. At the end of April 2017, our average production exceeded 1,300 BOE/D, or approximately three times the average first quarter rate. At December 31, 2016, we had estimated proved
	developed reserves of 740 MBOE and proved undeveloped reserves of 5,568 MBOE, with a standardized measure of approximately $42.8 million and a PV-10 value of approximately $48.6 million
	based on SEC pricing of $42.75 per Bbl and $2.481 per MMBtu. For an explanation of the PV-10 value and a reconciliation to the standardized measure, see "Summary Historical Reserve Data."

	SOUTHERN CORE OVERVIEW






	        We have subdivided our Southern Core focus area into the Todd Creek Farms, South Brighton, and Runway prospects. The Southern Core covers areas
	in the southern Wattenberg Field as well as outlying areas to the southeast of the field, all of which is a part of the DJ Basin. Discovered in 1970, and historically a gas field, the Wattenberg Field
	now produces both crude oil and natural gas primarily from the Niobrara and Codell formations. The DJ Basin generally extends from the Denver metropolitan area throughout northeast Colorado into parts
	of Wyoming, Nebraska, and Kansas. The majority of the Wattenberg Field lies in Weld County but reaches into Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Broomfield, Denver, and Larimer Counties, all in Colorado.




	        Our
	primary targets in the Southern Core are the multiple benches in the Niobrara formation, including the A, B, and C benches, and the Codell formation. The outlying portions of our
	Southern Core acreage, including our Runway prospect, is prospective for the D and J Sands.




	        The
	Niobrara formation is a calcareous chalk, shale, and limestone rock formation varying from approximately 200 to 1,500 feet in thickness and extending from Canada to New Mexico, but
	the vast majority of the oil and natural gas concentration is in Colorado and Wyoming. The formation generally slopes downward from east to west, from Kansas to western Colorado, from hydrocarbon
	producing depths of approximately 1,000 feet to 12,000 feet below the surface. The Codell formation is an oil and natural gas producing tight sandstone formation generally found at depths of
	approximately 7,000 to
	8,000 feet below the surface and located at the base of the NiobraraFort Hays limestone member.




	        The
	D and J Sands are present throughout the Wattenberg Field and contain hydrocarbons at depths ranging from 4,000 feet to 10,000 feet in the center of the DJ Basin. The D Sand is
	generally economically productive for both oil and gas in vertical wells when such wells encounter higher quality sandstones. The J Sand is the principal formation in the Wattenberg Field and produces
	gas and associated condensate from tight sand reservoirs. We have access to 3D seismic data in the area of our Runway prospect which may help us determine the best way to ultimately develop our
	acreage.




	        The
	Southern Core covers areas in Adams County and southwest Weld County. The Southern Core area saw significant development through vertical drilling in the preceding decades, but
	modern horizontal drilling is relatively new for the area. The "northern core Wattenberg," located south of Greeley, Colorado in west-central Weld County, has been the primary focus of oil and gas
	producers for the past seven years. However, activity in the Southern Core has picked up significantly over the past two years and, according to the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission
	("COGCC") records, active operators in the Southern Core, including PDC Energy, Inc. ("PDC"), Great Western Oil & Gas Co. ("Great Western"), Ward Petroleum Co. ("Ward"),
	and Kerr-McGee Corporation

	Table of Contents












	("Kerr-McGee"),
	are increasing their permitting, spacing and drilling programs. We believe the Southern Core provides us compelling economics in the current price environment.




	        We
	currently possess a total inventory of over 220 gross potential horizontal drilling locations (up to 84 net wells) on our Todd Creek Farms and South Brighton prospects in the
	Southern Core, including 100 locations that are fully permitted or in the final permitting stages. This horizontal well inventory assumes 12 to 16 wells per 640-acre drilling spacing unit with
	multi-zone potential in the Codell and Niobrara A, B, and C formations. This multi-zone potential has been successfully tested by other operators and we are currently participating as a non-operator
	in active development programs with three different established area operators. Our participation is comprised of multiple horizontal wells targeting the Codell and all three benches of the Niobrara
	formation.




	        Through
	the period ending June 30, 2018, we plan on spending $53.2 million on development of our properties, lease acquisitions, and working capital. Our plan is to drill
	approximately 24 gross (10.2 net) operated wells and participate in an additional 12 gross (1.3 net) non-operated wells in the Southern Core. We plan to fund these activities using the net
	proceeds from this offering, cash on hand, cash flow generated from operations, including our non-operated wells, and additional equity or debt financings as necessary.






	Southern Core: Todd Creek Farms





	        Within the Southern Core, our primary prospect is Todd Creek Farms, which is located in northwest Adams County, Colorado. We have assembled a
	4,512 gross (1,526 net) acre position in Todd Creek Farms. Through our geologic analysis, as well as the results from wells in which we have participated as a non-operator, we identified the
	Todd Creek Farms prospect as being highly prospective for multi-bench horizontal well development in the Niobrara A, B, C, and Codell formations.







	Todd Creek FarmsOperated Activity






	        We have obtained permits for 22 operated wells on our Todd Creek Farms acreage. After setting surface casing in April 2017, we began horizontal
	lateral drilling operations of all 14 Shook pad wells in May 2017, on which we have permitted 6 Codell wells and 8 wells targeting all three benches of the Niobrara. Our working interest in the Shook
	pad wells averages approximately 45%. Our second operated pad is expected to be the Corcillius pad, on which we have permitted 8 wells targeting the Codell and Niobrara formations. However, we do not
	expect to begin any drilling operations on the Corcillius pad until early 2018.




	        Under
	our operated capital plan through June 30, 2018, we plan to drill and complete 14 gross (6.3 net) operated horizontal wells on our Shook pad and 7 gross (3.1 net) operated
	horizontal wells on our Corcillius pad, for a total capital expenditure of approximately $34 million.







	Todd Creek FarmsNon-Operated Activity






	        During 2016 and the first quarter of 2017, we participated in the drilling and completion of 17 gross (2.9 net) horizontal wells in Todd Creek
	Farms. All of these wells are operated by companies with an established track record in the Wattenberg Field, including PDC, Great Western, and Ward. In addition to the aforementioned wells, we have
	been informed that Great Western and Ward plan to collectively drill up to 12 additional gross wells on pads in Todd Creek Farms over the next 12 to 14 months. While as a non-operator we are
	unable to control whether and when these additional wells will be drilled and completed, we have allocated a total capital cost of $5.8 million for an additional 1.3 wells net to our interest.

	Table of Contents












	        The
	PDC Jacobucci pad, where we have working interests ranging from 8% to 27%, is currently on production and flowing back into the sales pipeline. The Jacobucci pad is comprised of 14
	mid-range horizontal wells, including 6 Codell wells, 3 Niobrara B wells, and 5 Niobrara C wells. In the same area, we participated in 2 extended-range lateral wells that are operated by Great Western
	on its Marcus pad, targeting the two separate benches in the Niobrara, with an approximately 15% working interest in each well. The Marcus pad wells had 120-day average daily production rates of 639
	and 645 gross BOE/D per well, respectively. We also participated in one standard-range lateral Codell well with an approximately 11% working interest operated by Ward on its Riverdale pad, which had a
	90-day average daily production rate of 542 gross BOE/D.






	Southern Core: South Brighton





	        Our South Brighton prospect is east of our Todd Creek Farms prospect and sits in northern Adams County and southern Weld County, Colorado. We
	acquired the majority of this acreage in our transaction with Crimson Exploration Operating, Inc. ("Crimson") during 2016. We have leaseholds encompassing 5,015 gross (2,030 net) acres in South
	Brighton. We believe South Brighton is prospective for multi-bench horizontal well development in the Niobrara and Codell formations.







	South BrightonOperated Activity






	        We anticipate that our first operated drilling program at South Brighton will be the Brighton Lakes pad on which we have an application pending
	for 8 extended-range lateral wells. We expect the pad to consist of up to 3 Codell wells and 5 Niobrara wells. Our working interest in the proposed Brighton Lakes pad wells averages approximately 26%.
	We expect to begin drilling operations on the Brighton Lakes pad by the first quarter of 2018. Under our operated capital plan through June 30, 2018, we plan to drill and complete 3 gross (0.8
	net) operated horizontal wells on our Brighton Lakes pad, for a total capital expenditure of $4.4 million.







	South BrightonNon-Operated Activity






	        We have not participated in any non-operated wells in South Brighton; however, industry activity has picked up and we expect to receive notice
	to participate in wells from operators on our acreage over the next 12 months. Each of Great Western, Edge Petroleum Corp. ("Edge Petroleum"), Ward, and HRM Resources has acreage offsetting our
	South Brighton acreage. Edge Petroleum has permitted 10 standard-range lateral wells in South Brighton in which we have a 25% working interest; however, Edge Petroleum has not submitted an
	authorization for expenditure on these wells and they may or may not be drilled by June 30, 2018.






	Southern Core: Runway





	        Our Runway prospect is east of our Todd Creek Farms and South Brighton prospects and lies within Adams County, Colorado east of the Denver
	International Airport. With the closing of the Morning Gun acquisition on April 3, 2017 (as discussed further below), we now have leaseholds encompassing 16,473 gross (5,359 net) acres in the
	Runway prospect. Most of this acreage is held by production from vertical wells, giving us control of the pace of the development of this area. Nearby operator activity has shown this acreage to be
	prospective for D and J Sands and able to be developed using both vertical and horizontal wells.




	        A
	number of public and private company operators are developing acreage near our position and we plan to monitor these operators' results. We believe this area to have extensive
	hydrocarbon saturation in tight sand reservoirs. At this time, we do not plan on allocating any capital to this area over the next 12 months; however, we will monitor nearby activity and may
	increase allocated capital to our Runway prospect if we feel the risk-adjusted returns on capital meet internal return targets.

	OTHER PROPERTIES








	Northern Wattenberg Field





	        In addition to our Southern Core acreage, we also have assembled 1,796 gross (642 net) acres in the northern area of the Wattenberg Field. A
	preliminary evaluation indicates that there are 34 potential gross horizontal drilling locations, which could result in up to 12 net wells on this acreage, based on 12 wells per each 640-acre drilling
	spacing unit. We are the operator on the majority of this acreage, giving us control of the pace of the development of this area. Nearby operator activity has shown this acreage to be prospective for
	multiple benches and zones, including both the Niobrara and Codell formations. A number of operators, including Noble Energy, Inc., Extraction Oil & Gas, Inc., and Synergy
	Resources Corporation, dba SRC Energy Inc., are actively developing acreage in the northern Wattenberg Field. At this time, we plan on directing little to no drilling and completion capital to
	this area over the next 12 months; however, we will monitor nearby activity from these other operators and may increase allocated capital to this area if we feel the risk-adjusted returns on
	capital meet internal return targets.






	Buck Peak





	        In 2014, we drilled and completed our initial two-well program at our Buck Peak prospect in northwest Colorado, targeting the Niobrara
	formation. Those two wells resulted in nominal production and accordingly, we are not actively pursuing development in this area. We will, however, monitor activity in the area and continue to
	evaluate additional opportunities for our 5,276 gross (352 net) acres.












	CAPITAL PLAN THROUGH JUNE 30, 2018






	        We plan to use the net proceeds from this offering, along with cash on hand and cash flow from operations, including from our non-operated
	wells, and equity and debt financings as necessary, to embark on an aggressive drilling program to convert our undeveloped leasehold position to production, cash flow and reserves. Through
	June 30, 2018, we plan to spend approximately $38.7 million to drill 10.2 net operated horizontal wells and approximately $5.8 million to participate in the drilling of 1.3 net
	non-operated wells in the Southern Core. We also have budgeted approximately $4.6 million for additional completion costs relating to the recently completed 14 gross (2.5 net) Jacobucci pad
	wells in which we are participating as a non-operator and $4.1 million for additional leasehold acquisitions and working capital.

	BUSINESS STRATEGIES






	        Our primary business objective is to increase shareholder value by increasing reserves, production, and revenue at attractive rates of return on
	invested capital. We are focused on exploiting long-lived, unconventional oil, NGL and natural gas reserves from the Wattenberg Field. We plan to accomplish our objectives through the execution of the
	following strategies:






	






	Balanced operated and non-operated capital
	program.




	  Our management team elected initially to develop our properties in the Southern Core by participating in non-operated pads with
	established operators such as PDC, Ward and Great Western. The individuals on our management team have extensive experience operating in the DJ Basin, which combined with knowledge gained from our
	recent non-operated well participation and observing offset operator activity, gives us a strong understanding of the underlying formations and optimal drilling and completion techniques in our area.
	Based on this information and the continued de-risking and delineation of our position by nearby operators, we commenced our operated drilling activities on our Shook pad in April 2017. We expect
	operational control of our properties will enable us to capture operating efficiencies and allow us to control the pace of development and capital outlay.








	






	Aggressively develop our Southern Core
	acreage.




	  We intend to aggressively and selectively drill and develop our Southern Core acreage position to maximize the value of our resource
	potential. On our remaining undeveloped acreage, we believe that we can drill between 12 and 16 horizontal wells per drilling spacing unit depending on the geologic and economic viability of the
	various








	7











	Table of Contents














	Niobrara
	and Codell targets. Utilizing these assumptions, we have identified potential drilling locations that could result in up to 84 net wells in our Todd Creek Farms and South Brighton prospects.
	We plan to drill 10.2 net operated and participate in 1.3 net non-operated wells through June 30, 2018.






	






	Pursue strategic acquisitions and increase our leasehold in the Wattenberg
	Field.




	  We intend to continue to leverage our management team's extensive relationships to opportunistically increase our acreage holdings at
	attractive valuations. We also intend to pursue organic leasing opportunities, corporate mergers or asset acquisitions, and farm-in related opportunities. We have a successful track record of closing
	oil and natural gas asset acquisitions, including the recent acquisitions of well interests and net acres from PDC, Crimson and Morning Gun Exploration LLC ("Morning Gun"). Since entering the
	DJ Basin without any acreage in 2015, we have rapidly grown our footprint to approximately 9,600 net acres. See "RECENT DEVELOPMENTS" on page 9 for more detail on our acquisitions.














	OUR COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS






	        We believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on current conditions in the oil and natural gas industry as a result of the following
	competitive strengths:






	






	Multi-year drilling inventory in the Todd Creek Farms and South Brighton prospects
	targeting the Niobrara and Codell formations.




	  We believe nearby operator horizontal drilling activity and well results in and around our acreage
	have significantly mitigated the geologic risk in our drilling program. Our Todd Creek Farms and South Brighton prospects are located in an area where drilling results and the liquids-weighted nature
	of the assets allow for generating accretive returns even in a low commodity price environment. We have identified over 220 gross horizontal drilling locations (up to 84 net wells) on our Todd Creek
	Farms and South Brighton prospects. As of December 31, 2016, a majority of these locations have been designated proved undeveloped reserves by our third-party reserve engineer. We believe we
	can identify and develop additional locations in these prospects. We believe our multi-year drilling portfolio provides the potential for near-term growth in our production and reserves and highlights
	the long-term resource potential across our asset base.








	






	Experienced and aligned management team with proven financial, technical and operational
	expertise.




	  Our Chief Executive Officer, Stephen Foley, has over 15 years of experience as a real estate developer in Colorado, with an
	extensive background in surface development in the areas in which we have acquired acreage. Our President, Frederick Witsell, and Chief Operating Officer, William Lloyd, bring a long history in
	Colorado and depth of experience in the industry to our company. Mr. Witsell has over 36 years of experience in several facets of the oil and gas industry, including prospect
	development, conventional and horizontal drilling and completion operations, project management, gathering and compression systems and marketing and risk management. Mr. Lloyd also has over
	36 years of experience in the industry, serving in engineering, management and senior leadership capacities. Prior to this offering, our directors, executive officers and employees owned,
	including all options and warrants, approximately 42.2% of our company which provides a meaningful incentive to increase the value of our business for the benefit of all stockholders.








	






	Our strategic partnerships.




	  In
	May 2015, we entered into a participation agreement (the "Participation Agreement") with Providence Energy Operators, LLC ("Providence"). We believe our relationship with Providence is
	instrumental to our success. In addition to helping to fund our acquisition and development strategy through a $5 million line of credit we established with Providence in May 2015 (the "initial
	line of credit"), the relationship provides us access to Providence's industry expertise. We believe our relationship with Providence is strong, as







	8











	Table of Contents














	evidenced
	by its participation in all of our Southern Core acquisitions, our borrowing arrangement, and Providence's holdings in our common stock. The relationship with Providence and its affiliates
	has led to the acquisition of much of the acreage that we currently hold. In addition to our Providence relationship, our executive officers have developed relationships and formalized agreements with
	business partners that have, and we believe will continue to, contribute significantly to our growth. Through a services agreement executed in 2015 with Kingdom Resources, LLC ("Kingdom"), we
	have gained access to a portfolio of oil and gas leases in an attractive portion of the Wattenberg Field. Our relationship with Kingdom has also provided surface access for drilling operations and
	water for drilling and production operations on our leasehold interests.






	






	Liquids-weighted reserves.




	  Our
	net proved reserves at December 31, 2016 were comprised of approximately 70% oil and NGLs (collectively, liquids). Given the current commodity price environment and resulting disparity between
	oil and natural gas prices on a BOE basis, we believe our high percentage of liquid reserves and drilling program focused on oil-weighted projects, compared to our overall reserve base, is a key
	strength.








	






	Meaningful growth
	opportunities.




	  Our relative footprint and size provides us the ability to significantly increase our scale by piecing together acreage blocks
	that may be considered less attractive to larger operators within our focus area. These blocks have meaningful impact on our position as evidenced by the recent PDC, Crimson, and Morning Gun asset
	acquisitions and we expect to continue our track record of making these types of acquisitions as we grow our position. See "RECENT DEVELOPMENTS" below for more detail on our acquisitions.














	RECENT DEVELOPMENTS






	        During 2016 and early 2017, we took important steps to improve our business by making several lease acquisitions, participating as a
	non-operator in the drilling of 17 gross (2.9 net) horizontal wells in the Wattenberg Field, and completing the permitting process of our first planned operated wells in the Southern Core. Our leasing
	activities have been focused on areas in Adams County and southwest Weld County, Colorado in the Southern Core.






	Supplemental Line of Credit





	        On October 13, 2016, we entered into a revolving line of credit facility (the "supplemental line of credit") with Providence Energy
	Partners III, LP ("PEP III"). The supplemental line of credit permitted us to borrow up to $10 million to pay costs associated with our acquisition and development of oil and gas
	properties. We have used draws on the supplemental line of credit to pay for certain of our acquisitions, including the Crimson acquisition discussed below, as well as to pay costs associated with our
	operated and non-operated drilling programs.




	        As
	required by an amendment to the supplemental line of credit, we repaid approximately $3.5 million in outstanding principal on April 12, 2017 and agreed not to borrow
	additional funds in exchange for PEP III extending the maturity date of the supplemental line of credit. We have approximately $3.6 million plus accrued interest of approximately $237,000
	outstanding against the supplemental line of credit, all of which is due on June 13, 2017.






	PDC Assets Acquisition





	        On June 30, 2016, we completed the acquisition of oil and gas assets, or the PDC assets, from PDC. The PDC assets include leases covering
	approximately 3,652 gross (1,411 net) acres located in Adams County, Colorado and PDC's interest in 32 gross (13.0 net) productive wells and 8 horizontal well locations that are permitted. Providence
	exercised its option pursuant to the Participation Agreement and acquired 50% of the PDC assets. Much of the acreage we acquired from PDC is within





	9











	Table of Contents












	our
	Todd Creek Farms prospect and held by production, while the remainder of the acreage is located in outlying areas of the Southern Core and is prospective for formations other than the Niobrara and
	Codell formations. The net purchase price to our interest for the PDC assets was approximately $2.3 million following allowances, post-closing adjustments and Providence's acquisition from us
	of its 50% interest in the PDC assets.






	Crimson Assets Acquisition





	        On December 22, 2016, we completed the acquisition of the Crimson assets. Simultaneous with the closing of the acquisition, Providence
	acquired 50% of our interest in the Crimson assets. The Crimson assets include oil and gas leases located in Adams, Arapahoe, Elbert, and Weld Counties, Colorado, covering approximately 14,874 gross
	(5,385 net) acres and an interest in 33 gross (10.4 net) productive wells. The net purchase price to our interest for the Crimson assets was approximately $2.5 million following allowances,
	post-closing adjustments and Providence's acquisition from us of its 50% interest in the Crimson assets.






	Morning Gun Assets Acquisition





	        On April 3, 2017, we completed the acquisition of the Morning Gun assets. Simultaneous with the closing of the acquisition, Providence
	acquired 50% of our interest in the Morning Gun assets. The Morning Gun assets include oil and gas leases covering approximately 5,874 gross (1,482 net) acres located in Adams and Weld Counties,
	Colorado. Morning Gun reserved to itself all rights that exist below 50 feet above the top of the uppermost J Sand formation for any leases or lands located in Township 7 North, Range 63 West in Weld
	County, Colorado. The net purchase price
	to our interest for the Morning Gun assets was approximately $1.3 million, which we paid using a combination of cash and common stock.












	REVERSE STOCK SPLIT AND NYSE MKT LISTING






	        In connection with this offering, we intend to apply for listing of our common stock on the NYSE MKT. In order to qualify for listing, we have
	to meet certain listing criteria, including a minimum share price. In order to ensure we can meet such listing criteria, we intend to seek approval from our shareholders to grant our Board of
	Directors discretionary authority to implement a reverse split in a range from 1-for-10 to 4-for-5 (the "reverse split"). In the event a reverse split is implemented, we do not intend to reduce the
	amount of our authorized common stock. Because we do not know if a reverse split will be implemented, or the ratio at which the shares would be consolidated, all information in this prospectus is
	presented on a pre-reverse split basis.












	STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIPPROVIDENCE ENERGY OPERATORS






	        In May 2015, we entered into the Participation Agreement with Providence. Providence is an affiliate of Providence Energy Corp., a
	privately-held multi-million dollar acquirer of oil and gas properties throughout the United States, which currently owns and/or manages over two million net acres in 37 states with royalty or working
	interests in over 10,000 wells. As discussed elsewhere in this prospectus, Providence is also our primary lender through which we currently maintain the initial line of credit and is the beneficial
	owner of 13.3% of our common stock. Providence also was instrumental in our obtaining the supplemental line of credit through its affiliation with PEP III.




	        The
	Participation Agreement gives Providence the option to acquire up to a 50% interest and participate in any oil and gas development on acreage we obtain through our services agreement
	with Kingdom and any other leases we acquire within an area of mutual interest ("AMI"). The AMI covers an area in Adams County, Colorado containing all of Township 1 South, Range 67 West, consisting
	of approximately 23,100 gross acres, with an additional one-mile border around the defined AMI area,





	10











	Table of Contents












	plus
	any other mutually agreeable areas. The Participation Agreement also grants to Providence the option to participate in any well drilled on the AMI on a pro rata basis. To date, Providence has
	exercised its option under the Participation Agreement or otherwise has participated in all of our acreage acquisitions in the Wattenberg Field, the result of which is we retain a 50% or less interest
	in all of our DJ Basin properties.












	RECENT PRIVATE PLACEMENT






	        During December 2016 and January 2017, we completed a private placement of units consisting of convertible promissory notes and warrants to
	purchase our common stock. We received net proceeds of approximately $9.0 million from the private placement, after placement agent fees and other associated expenses.




	        Each
	unit sold in the private placement is comprised of a 10% unsecured convertible promissory note in the face amount of $50,000 and 33,333 common stock purchase warrants. Each note is
	one of a series of similar notes designated the "10% Unsecured Convertible Promissory Notes" with the series totaling $10.0 million. The notes bear interest at the rate of 10% per year and are
	due and payable on December 31, 2018. Interest is payable semi-annually beginning June 30, 2017 and until the notes are paid in full. At any time after issuance, the principal amount of
	the notes and any accrued but unpaid interest are convertible into shares of our common stock at the option of the holder at the rate of $1.50 per share. The conversion price will be proportionately
	adjusted in the event of any stock splits, stock dividends or a capital reorganization.




	        Each
	warrant issued in the private placement allows the holder to purchase one share of our common stock at a price of $3.00 per share at any time on or before December 31, 2019.
	The exercise price of the warrants, as well as the shares issuable upon the exercise of the warrants, is subject to adjustment in the event of any stock splits, stock dividends or a capital
	reorganization.




	        In
	connection with the private placement, we paid the placement agent and participating broker-dealers a total commission of $1.0 million. As additional compensation to the agent,
	we issued a placement
	agent warrant to purchase a total of 666,600 shares of our common stock exercisable at a price of $1.50 per share. The placement agent warrant expires on December 31, 2021.




	        The
	notes and the warrants contained forced conversion or redemption provisions, respectively. See "MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
	OPERATIONSLiquidity and Capital Resources" beginning on page 72 for more information.




	        In
	connection with the private placement, we granted to the holders of the notes, warrants, and placement agent warrants the right to include the common stock issuable upon exercise or
	conversion of those securities in any registration statement we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). The underwriters have informed us that, in their opinion, the inclusion of
	the shares underlying the securities in the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part would adversely affect their ability to market this offering. Accordingly, we plan to
	file a new registration statement upon completion of this offering to register the underlying common stock.












	CORPORATE INFORMATION






	        We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Colorado on September 4, 2012. Our executive and administrative office is currently
	located at 9635 Maroon Circle, Suite 400, Englewood, Colorado 80112. Our telephone number is (303) 500-1160. We maintain a website at

	IMPLICATION OF BEING AN EMERGING GROWTH COMPANY






	        We qualify as an "emerging growth company" as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As an emerging growth
	company, we intend to take advantage of specified reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions
	include:






	




	Allowance to provide only two years of audited financial statements in addition to any required unaudited interim financial statements with
	correspondingly reduced "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation" disclosure;








	




	Reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements;








	




	No requirement for non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements; and








	




	Exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting.






	        We
	may take advantage of these provisions for up to five years or such earlier time that we are no longer an emerging growth company. We would cease to be an emerging growth company on
	the date that is the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more; (ii) the last day of our fiscal year
	following the fifth anniversary of the date of the completion of our initial public offering; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during
	the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC. We have taken advantage of
	reduced reporting requirements in this prospectus. Accordingly, the information contained herein may be different than the information you might receive from other public companies in which you have a
	beneficial ownership.














	SELECTED RISK FACTORS






	        This offering involves a high degree of risk, as discussed more fully in the section entitled "Risk Factors." Risks discussed in the "Risk
	Factors" section should be carefully considered before investing in our common stock. In particular, the following risks, among others, may have an adverse effect on our business, which could cause
	the trading price of our common stock to decline and result in a partial or total loss of your investment:






	Risks Relating to Our Company







	




	As described in the notes to our unaudited interim financial statements, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going
	concern;








	




	We are dependent on additional financing to repay our obligations and fund continued development and implementation of our business plan, and
	our failure to obtain this capital may cause the partial or total loss of your investment;








	




	Our use of debt financing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and any default by us may cause us to forfeit all or
	a portion of our properties;








	




	We have historically incurred losses and may not achieve profitability;








	




	Our DJ Basin assets may be less valuable to us than expected;








	




	Competition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense and many of our competitors have resources that are substantially greater than ours;








	13











	Table of Contents














	




	Our substantial investment in a limited number of prospects and lack of geographic diversification increases the risk to investors that we may
	not be profitable;








	




	We have granted Providence the option to participate in certain of our acreage acquisitions, which has reduced ownership of the majority of our
	assets and which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations;








	




	We may have difficulty managing our growth and our results of operation may suffer as a result; and








	




	We have limited control over properties that we do not operate.








	Risks Relating to the Energy Production and/or Distribution Industry







	




	Oil and natural gas exploration and development are affected by fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices, and low prices could have a
	material adverse effect on the future of our business;








	




	Our operations are subject to health, safety and environmental laws and regulations which may expose us to significant costs and liabilities
	and which may not be covered by insurance; and








	




	Federal, state, and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to oil and gas production, including hydraulic fracturing, as well as
	government reviews of such activities, could result in increased costs, additional operating restrictions or delays, and adversely affect our production and/or ability to book future reserves.








	Risks Related to the Offering and Our Common Stock







	




	The price of our common stock may be volatile or may decline and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the offering price; and








	




	Investors in this offering will experience immediate substantial dilution of their investment.






	Prospective
	investors in our common stock should be aware of these and other risk factors discussed in this prospectus.

	SUMMARY HISTORICAL RESERVE DATA






	        The following table presents estimated net proved oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves attributable to our properties and the standardized measure
	amounts associated with the estimated proved reserves attributable to our properties as of December 31, 2016. We did not have material reserves as of December 31, 2015. To estimate
	economically recoverable proved reserves and related future net cash flows, our independent reserve engineer, Cawley Gillespie & Associates, Inc. ("Cawley Gillespie") considered many
	factors and assumptions, including the use of reservoir parameters derived from geological and engineering data which cannot be measured directly, economic criteria based on current costs and the SEC
	pricing requirements and forecasts of future production rates. The data below is based on our reserve report prepared by Cawley Gillespie. The standardized measure and PV-10

	Our
	estimated net proved reserves and related standardized measure were determined using index prices for crude oil and natural gas held constant throughout the life
	of our properties. The prices are based on the average oil and gas prices during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered, determined as the unweighted arithmetic average of
	the prices in effect on the first day of the month for each month within such period, unless prices were defined by contractual arrangements, and are adjusted by lease for quality, transportation
	fees, geographical differentials, marketing bonuses or deductions and other factors affecting the price realized at the wellhead.

	        The
	data in the table above represent estimates only. Oil, NGLs and natural gas reserve engineering is inherently a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil,
	natural gas and NGLs that cannot be measured exactly. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and engineering and geological interpretation and judgment.
	Accordingly, reserve estimates may vary from the quantities of oil, natural gas and NGLs that are ultimately recovered.




	        Future
	prices realized for production and costs may vary, perhaps significantly, from the prices and costs assumed for purposes of these estimates. The standardized measure amounts shown
	above should not be construed as the current market value of our estimated oil, NGLs and natural gas reserves. The 10% discount factor used to calculate standardized measure, which is required by
	Financial Accounting Standards Board pronouncements, is not necessarily the most appropriate discount rate. The present value, no matter what discount rate is used, is materially affected by
	assumptions as to timing of future production, which may prove to be inaccurate.

	RISK FACTORS






	        



	An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described
	below together with all of the other information included in this prospectus before making an investment decision. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or
	results of operation could materially suffer. In that case, you may lose all or part of your investment. If we are unable to prevent events that have a negative effect from occurring, then our
	business may suffer.







	Risks Relating To Our Company








	Since we are a new business with a limited operating history, investors have no basis to evaluate our ability
	to operate profitability.






	        We were incorporated in September 2012 and our activities to date have been limited to organizational efforts, raising capital, developing our
	business plan, assembling an initial lease inventory, participating as a non-operator in several drilling programs and limited drilling efforts. We face all of the risks commonly encountered by other
	new businesses, including the lack of an established operating history, need for additional capital and personnel, and competition. Our business may not be successful or we may never operate
	profitably. We may not be able to effectively manage the demands required of a new business in our industry, such that we may be unable to successfully implement our business plan or achieve
	profitability.







	As described in the notes to our unaudited interim financial statements, there is substantial doubt about our
	ability to continue as a going concern.






	        As described in the notes to our unaudited interim financial statements, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going
	concern. This uncertainty is based on our substantial near-term liabilities, limited revenue and negative working capital, among other things which existed as of March 31, 2017. We are
	dependent on obtaining funding from operations and the sale of debt or equity to continue as a going concern. Our plan of operations, as set forth in this prospectus, is subject to our obtaining
	adequate working capital, of which there can be no assurance.




	        At
	March 31, 2017, we had a cash balance of approximately $4.9 million and other current assets of approximately $3.2 million. Subsequent to March 31, 2017,
	our cash balance has decreased significantly as we have paid certain acquisition and development costs, including costs previously accrued, and general and administrative expenses. In June 2017, we
	are obligated to repay approximately $3.6 million in principal and approximately $250,000 in accrued interest to satisfy the terms of our supplemental line of credit, an approximately $500,000
	accrued interest payment on our initial line of credit, and an approximately $500,000 accrued interest payment on our outstanding convertible promissory notes. We also will incur additional expenses
	related to our recently commenced operated drilling program on our Shook pad during the second and third quarters of this year. We had net losses of approximately
	$2.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and $4.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016.




	        Our
	ability to continue as a going concern depends on the success of our current drilling efforts, future exploration and development efforts, and our ability to generate revenue
	sufficient to cover our costs and expenses. In the event we are unable to obtain adequate funding from our ongoing drilling efforts, both operated and non-operated, and through the sale of debt or
	equity securities, we may have to delay, reduce or eliminate certain of our planned operations, reduce overall overhead expense, or divest assets. This in turn may have an adverse effect on our
	ability to realize the value of our assets. If we are unable to continue as a going concern, you may lose all or part of your investment.

	Table of Contents








	We are dependent on additional financing to repay our obligations and fund the continued development and
	implementation of our business plan, and our failure to obtain this capital may cause the partial or total loss of your investment.






	        We do not anticipate that our cash flow from future operations will be sufficient to pay all of our obligations and capital requirements and
	accordingly, we anticipate that additional financing will be required. Significant amounts of capital are required for companies to participate in the business of exploration for and development of
	oil and natural gas resources. We also require capital to acquire additional acreage as well as repay our debt and pay our administrative expenses, including salary and rent. Adverse developments in
	our business or general economic conditions may require us to raise additional financing at prices or on terms that are disadvantageous to existing shareholders. We may not be able to obtain
	additional capital at all and may be forced to curtail or cease our operations. We will continue to rely on equity or debt financing and the sale of working interests to finance operations until such
	time, if ever, that we generate sufficient cash flow. The inability to obtain necessary financing may adversely impact our ability to develop our properties, force us to curtail our business plan and
	result in a default under our debt obligations.







	Our use of debt financing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and any default by
	us may cause us to forfeit all or a portion of our properties.






	        We have fully-drawn our lines of credit and we have outstanding debt of approximately $18.55 million plus accrued interest. Of the total
	debt outstanding, approximately
	$8.55 million is secured by liens on our property. If we are unable to repay any of this debt on a timely basis, we may be forced to forfeit all or a portion of our properties. Our ability to
	repay our lines of credit is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient revenue from operations or obtain cash from other sources. If we are unable to repay the short term indebtedness or
	otherwise default under either of our lines of credit or our other indebtedness, the lender may foreclose on our assets.




	        We
	are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required principal and interest payments and the
	long-term risk that we will be unable to refinance our existing indebtedness, or that the terms of such refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness. If our debt cannot
	be paid, refinanced or extended, we may be required to divest our assets or file for bankruptcy. Further, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of a refinancing result in higher
	interest rates or other restrictive financial covenants upon the refinancing, then such refinancing would adversely affect our cash flow and funds available for operation and development of our assets
	and properties.




	        The
	agreements governing our lines of credit require us to comply with certain financial and operating covenants so long as the loans are outstanding. These covenants generally prohibit
	us without the lenders' consent from, among other things, incurring additional indebtedness or making loans to any third party, other than trade debt incurred in the ordinary course of business and
	selling, leasing, or otherwise disposing of any material assets in excess of $100,000 in any calendar year. Our continued compliance with these covenants depends on many factors and could be impacted
	by current or future economic conditions. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default which, if we were unable to obtain a waiver from our lenders, could accelerate our repayment
	obligations under the lines of credit and thereby have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, financial condition, and ability to remain in business.







	We have historically incurred losses and may not achieve profitability in the future.






	        We have incurred losses from operations during our history in the oil and natural gas business. We had an accumulated deficit of approximately
	$12.0 million as of March 31, 2017. Our ability to be profitable in the future will depend on successfully addressing our near-term capital needs and




	20











	Table of Contents





	implementing
	our acquisition, development and production activities, all of which are subject to many risks beyond our control. Even if we become profitable on an annual basis, our profitability may
	not be sustainable or increase on a periodic basis.







	Our estimates of oil and gas reserves involve inherent uncertainty, which could materially affect the
	quantity and value of our reported reserves and our financial condition.






	        There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and cash flows attributable to such reserves,
	including factors beyond our reserve engineers' control. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner.
	The accuracy of an estimate of quantities of reserves, or of cash flows attributable to such reserves, is a function of the available data, assumptions regarding future oil and gas prices,
	expenditures for future development and exploration activities, engineering and geological interpretations and judgment. In addition, accurately estimating reserves in shale formations, such as the
	Niobrara and Codell formations, can be even more difficult than estimating reserves in more traditional hydrocarbon-bearing formations given the complexities of the projected decline curves and
	economics of shale wells. Additionally, "probable" and "possible" reserve estimates are estimates of unproved reserves and may be misunderstood or seen as misleading to investors that are not experts
	in the oil or natural gas industry.




	        As
	such, investors should not place undue reliance on these estimates. Reserves and future cash flows may be subject to material downward or upward revisions, based upon production
	history, development and exploration activities and prices of oil and gas. In addition, different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same available
	data. Due to our smaller volume of reserves compared to our competitors, revisions in reserve estimate and future cash flows have a greater chance of being material to us.







	Our DJ Basin assets may be less valuable to us than expected.






	        We have made several oil and gas acquisitions in the DJ Basin since January 1, 2016, including the PDC, Crimson and Morning Gun assets.
	Much of the acreage we acquired in 2016 and early 2017 is within the Southern Core. The value of our assets is based in large part on our ability to develop the properties and increase proven and
	probable reserves. This, in turn, requires us to make accurate estimates of our capital needs to implement and continue a development program for those properties, to obtain that capital and to
	successfully drill the wells. We may not be able to obtain the capital necessary to develop these properties or our development efforts may not be successful. If we are unable to obtain the necessary
	capital or successfully develop these properties, the price of our stock may decline and you may lose some or all of your investment.







	We have limited control over activities on properties we do not operate.






	        We are not, or will not be, the operator on some of our properties and, as a result, our ability to exercise influence over the operations of
	these properties or their associated costs is limited. Our dependence on the operators and other working interest owners of these projects and any future projects, our limited ability to influence
	operations and associated costs or control the risks, and our access to required capital could materially and adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital in drilling or
	acquisition activities. The success and timing of our drilling and development activities on properties operated by others therefore depends upon a number of factors,
	including:






	




	timing and amount of capital expenditures;








	




	the operator's expertise and financial resources;








	




	the rate of production of reserves, if any;






	21











	Table of Contents







	




	approval of other participants in drilling wells; and








	




	selection of technology.






	        As
	a result, our ability to exercise influence over the operations of some of our current or future properties is and may be limited.







	The due diligence undertaken in connection with the acquisition of our oil and gas properties may not have
	revealed all relevant considerations or liabilities related to those assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.






	        We have completed several significant asset acquisitions to date, including the PDC, Crimson and Morning Gun assets, through which we have
	acquired oil and gas properties and surface rights and easements. The due diligence undertaken by us in connection with these acquisitions may not have revealed all relevant facts that may be
	necessary to evaluate such acquisitions. The information provided to us in connection with our diligence may have been incomplete or inaccurate. As part of that process, we have also made subjective
	judgments regarding the results of operations and prospects of the assets we have acquired. If the due diligence investigation has failed to correctly identify material issues and liabilities that may
	be present, such as title defects or environmental problems, we may incur substantial impairment charges or other losses in the future. In addition, we may be subject to significant, previously
	undisclosed liabilities that were not identified during the due diligence process and which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.







	The historical and unaudited pro forma financial information reflecting the PDC and Crimson assets included
	in this prospectus may not be representative of our actual results in the future, and accordingly, you have only limited financial information on which to evaluate our company and your investment
	decision.






	        The historical financial information of the PDC assets included in this prospectus represents the operation of those assets for the two years
	ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the six month period ended June 30, 2016. The historical financial information of the Crimson assets included in this prospectus represents the
	operation of those assets for the two years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the nine month period ended September 30, 2016. The unaudited pro forma information reflecting the
	combined operating results of our company and the PDC and Crimson assets as if the acquisitions had been completed January 1, 2016 are presented for informational and illustrative purposes only
	and are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have actually occurred had the acquisition of the PDC and Crimson assets been completed as of that date, nor is it indicative
	of our future operating results. The unaudited pro forma financial information does not reflect future non-recurring charges resulting from the acquisition or future events that may occur, including
	any restructuring activities, and does not consider potential impacts of current market conditions on revenues, expense efficiencies or asset dispositions. The unaudited pro forma financial
	information is based in part on certain assumptions regarding the PDC and Crimson assets that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. However, our assumptions may not prove to be
	accurate over time. As a result, investors should not place undue reliance on the unaudited pro forma financial information included in this prospectus.







	We have granted Providence the option to participate in certain of our acreage acquisitions, which has
	reduced our ownership of the majority of our assets and which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.






	        On May 13, 2015, we entered into the Participation Agreement with Providence. Under the terms of the Participation Agreement, we assigned
	an undivided 50% interest to our right, title and interest in and to our then existing leases in our Todd Creek Farms prospect. Providence agreed to pay its pro rata share of lease acquisition
	expenses and the expenses necessary to maintain the leases in full force




	22











	Table of Contents





	and
	effect. In addition, the Participation Agreement designates an area of mutual interest, or AMI, pursuant to which if either party acquires any lease in the AMI territory on or before
	May 13, 2018, then the non-acquiring party shall have the right to acquire its proportionate 50% interest in and to such AMI leases. The AMI covers an area in Adams County, Colorado containing
	all of Township 1 South, Range 67 West, consisting of approximately 23,100 gross acres, with an additional one-mile border around the defined AMI area, plus any other mutually agreeable
	areas. To date, Providence has exercised its option to participate or otherwise has participated in all of our acreage acquisitions in the DJ Basin, including our recent PDC, Crimson and Morning Gun
	acquisitions.




	        So
	long as the Participation Agreement remains in full force and effect, any future acquisition of AMI leases will require us, upon Providence's exercise of its option, to assign a 50%
	interest in and to the AMI leases. As a result, we may never wholly-own such AMI leases and any earnings we may achieve as a result of such acquisition will have to be shared proportionally with
	Providence. Such division of earnings could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.







	We have limited management and staff and will be dependent upon partnering arrangements and third-party
	service providers.






	        We currently have ten employees, including our Chief Executive Officer, President, and Chief Operating Officer. Our Chief Financial Officer
	serves in his role as an independent contractor. We also leverage the services of other independent consultants and contractors to perform various professional services, including engineering, oil and
	gas well planning and supervision, and land, legal, environmental and tax services. We also pursue alliances with partners in the areas of geological and geophysical services and prospect generation,
	evaluation and prospect leasing. Our dependence on third-party consultants and service providers creates a number of risks, including but not limited to:






	




	the possibility that such third parties may not be available to us as and when needed; and








	




	the risk that we may not be able to properly control the timing and quality of work conducted with respect to our projects.






	        If
	we experience significant delays in obtaining the services of such third parties or they perform poorly, our results of operations and stock price could be materially adversely
	affected.







	Competition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense and many of our competitors have resources that
	are substantially greater than ours.






	        Our industry is intensely competitive, and we compete with other companies that have greater resources. Many of these companies not only explore
	for and produce oil, natural gas and NGLs, but also carry on refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional, national or worldwide basis. These companies may be able to pay
	more for productive properties and exploratory prospects or define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than we can. Our ability to acquire additional
	properties and to discover reserves in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. In
	addition, larger companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods of low commodity prices. Larger competitors
	may also be able to absorb the burden of present and future federal, state, local and other laws and regulations more easily than we can, which could adversely affect our competitive position. These
	factors could adversely affect the success of our operations and our profitability.

	Our substantial investment in a limited number of prospects and lack of geographic diversification increases
	the risk to investors that we may not be profitable.






	        Our investment in the DJ Basin and the capital required to pay our share of drilling and production costs for development of our properties
	increases the risk that the operation of our business may not be profitable, as we will not be able to spread the risk of investment and operation over a number of different assets until we become
	profitable or receive additional investment.




	        Our
	operations are currently concentrated in Colorado, an area that experiences severe weather events, including tornadoes, flooding and storms. Our information systems and
	administrative and management processes could be disrupted if a catastrophic event, such as a tornado, power outage or act of terror, destroyed or severely damaged our facilities. Any such
	catastrophic event could harm our ability to conduct normal operations and could adversely affect our business. In addition, operating in a concentrated area increases the potential impact that many
	of the risks stated herein may have upon our ability to perform. For example, we have greater exposure to regulatory actions impacting Colorado, natural disasters in the geographic area, competition
	for equipment, services and materials available in the area and access to infrastructure and markets. Although Moffatt, Adams and Weld Counties in Colorado have well-established oilfield
	infrastructures, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of delays or interruptions of production from our wells therein caused by transportation capacity constraints, curtailment of
	production, availability of equipment, facilities, personnel or services, significant governmental regulation, natural disasters, adverse weather conditions, plant closures for scheduled maintenance
	or interruption of transportation of oil or natural gas produced from the wells in this area. In addition, the effect of fluctuations on supply and demand may become more pronounced within specific
	geographic oil and gas producing areas such as the DJ Basin, which may cause these conditions to occur with greater frequency or magnify the effect of these conditions. Due to the concentrated nature
	of our portfolio of properties, a number of our properties could experience any of the same conditions at the same time, resulting in a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they
	might have on other companies that have a more diversified portfolio of properties. Such delays or interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of
	operations.







	If our Todd Creek Farms and South Brighton prospects are not commercially productive of oil or natural gas,
	any funds spent on exploration and production may be lost.






	        A significant portion of our current capital investment is tied up in our Todd Creek Farms and South Brighton prospects. If these properties are
	not economic, all of the funds that we have invested or will invest in the future will be lost. Our planned drilling programs in these prospects involve multiple horizontal wells, which are expensive
	to drill. Our business plan is dependent on, among other things, developing sufficient reserves to generate cash flow and provide a return on investment. If we are not successful in producing
	economically viable amounts of oil and/or gas from our properties, our business may suffer and you may lose all or part of your investment. In addition, the failure to produce commercially may make it
	more difficult for us to raise additional funds in the form of additional sale of our equity securities or working interests in other property in which we may acquire an interest.







	We may have difficulty managing our growth and our results of operation may suffer as a result.






	        We have amassed a large number of leases, are beginning our second drilling program, are participating in several non-operated drilling
	programs, and have added a number of producing wells to our inventory since the beginning of 2016 compared to our interest in 2015. As a result, we may have difficulty managing those assets as we
	continue to grow our company. The integration of operations from the PDC assets and the Crimson assets and management of our non-operated properties will require the dedication of significant
	management resources, which may temporarily distract their attention from the day-to-day business of our company. The process of integrating those assets with our




	24











	Table of Contents





	existing
	assets may cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, our business and could have an adverse effect on our operating results for an indeterminate period of time. We may also need to
	hire and train additional personnel to help manage our assets, which will require additional financial resources and management attention. The failure to successfully integrate any such acquisitions
	or participation, to identify and retain key personnel, and to successfully manage the challenges presented by the integration process may adversely affect our business.







	Our ability to sell any production and/or receive market prices for our production may be adversely affected
	by a lack of transportation, capacity constraints and interruptions.






	        The marketability of any production from any of our properties depends in part upon the availability, proximity and capacity of third-party
	refineries, oil and natural gas gathering systems and processing facilities. We expect to deliver much of the oil and natural gas produced from our properties through trucking services and pipelines
	that we do not own. The availability of delivery capacity in these pipelines is in part dependent on the market price for oil and natural gas, as higher prices will attract additional production,
	which in turn will take up capacity in these systems. The lack of availability or capacity of these systems and facilities could reduce the price offered for any production or result in the shut-in of
	producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties.







	Our business is substantially dependent on our senior executive officers and the loss of service of any of
	these individuals would adversely affect our business.






	        Stephen Foley is our Chief Executive Officer and is responsible for overseeing our business, developing our business plan and the strategic
	vision of our company. Frederick Witsell is our President and is responsible for identifying and valuing acquisition opportunities as well as managing our integrated business operations. Paul
	Maniscalco is our Chief Financial Officer and is responsible for the oversight of our day-to-day accounting operations as well as our periodic financial reporting. William Lloyd is our Chief Operating
	Officer and is responsible for the management of engineering and operating activities including coordination of permitting, drilling and completion activities. Each of these individuals is critical to
	the perceived success of our business. The loss of service of any of these individuals would adversely affect our business, as we have very limited personnel and expect to rely on contractors for a
	majority of services that we require. We may not be able to replace any of such individuals, or if so, on terms that were acceptable to our company. We have no key man life insurance on any of these
	individuals.







	We are an "emerging growth company" and as a result of the reduced disclosure and governance requirements
	applicable to emerging growth companies, our common stock may be less attractive to investors.






	        As an "emerging growth company," as defined in the JOBS Act, we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting
	requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to the following:






	




	reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements; and








	




	exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and from holding a vote for stockholder
	approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.






	        Investors
	could find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less
	active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.

	Our financial statements may not be comparable to other public companies.






	        We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b) of the
	JOBS Act. This election allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to
	private companies. As a result of this election, if the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board adopts new or revised accounting standards and we decide to delay adoption of such changes, our
	financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates and the price of our common stock may be adversely affected.







	We are not required to obtain an opinion from our independent registered public accounting firm on the
	effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting under Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 until we are no longer an emerging growth company.






	        For so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that
	are applicable to public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to obtain the auditor attestation of our assessment of our internal
	controls. Once we are no longer an emerging growth company or, if prior to such date, we opt to no longer take advantage of the applicable exemption, we will be required to include an opinion from our
	independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. We will remain an "emerging growth company" until the earliest to occur of
	(1) the last day of the fiscal year during which our total annual revenues equal or exceed $1 billion (subject to adjustment for inflation), (2) the last day of the fiscal year
	during which occurs the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering, (3) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in
	non-convertible debt, or (4) the date on which we are deemed a "large accelerated filer" under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. Once we are no longer an
	emerging growth company, compliance with Section 404(b) will be costly.







	We will incur significantly increased costs as a result of and devote substantial management time to
	operating as a newly-listed company on the NYSE MKT.






	        If we are approved for listing on the NYSE MKT, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur before when
	trading on the OTCQB Marketplace. For example, we will be subject to the rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the NYSE MKT, including changes in corporate governance practices. We will
	also be required to register our common stock under the Exchange Act, which will, among other things, require us to comply with the proxy solicitation rules. These requirements will increase our legal
	and financial compliance costs and will render some activities more time-consuming and costly. In addition, our management and other personnel will need to divert attention from operational and other
	business matters to devote substantial time to these listing requirements.







	If we are unable to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future,
	investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock may decline.






	        As a public company, we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such
	internal control. Further, we are required to
	report any changes in internal controls on a quarterly basis. In addition, we are required to furnish a report by management on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting pursuant
	to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
	reporting beginning with our annual




	26











	Table of Contents





	report
	on Form 10-K following the date on which we are no longer an "emerging growth company." If we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, if we are
	unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner or assert that our internal control over financial reporting are effective, or if our independent registered public
	accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting when required, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness
	of our financial reports and the market price of the common stock could be negatively affected, and we could become subject to investigations by the stock exchange on which the securities are listed,
	the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.







	Colorado law and our Articles of Incorporation may protect our directors from certain types of lawsuits at
	the expense of the shareholders.






	        The laws of the State of Colorado provide that directors of a corporation shall not be liable to the corporation or its shareholders for
	monetary damages for all but limited types of conduct. Our Articles of Incorporation permit us to indemnify our directors and officers against all damages incurred in connection with our business to
	the fullest extent provided or allowed by law. The exculpation provisions may have the effect of preventing shareholders from recovering damages against our directors caused by their negligence, poor
	judgment or other circumstances.






	Risks Relating to the Energy Production and/or Distribution Industry








	Oil and natural gas exploration and development are affected by fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices,
	and low prices could have a material adverse effect on the future of our business.






	        If development efforts are successful in identifying economic amounts of oil and natural gas, our future success will depend largely on the
	prices received for any oil or natural gas production. Prices received also will affect the amount of future cash flow available for capital expenditures and may affect the ability to raise additional
	capital. Lower prices affect the amount of oil and natural gas that can be commercially produced from reserves either discovered or acquired and may also make it uneconomical to drill in certain
	areas.




	        The
	prices for oil and natural gas have seen a steep decline since 2014 and may fluctuate widely in the future. The price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) Crude Oil, as quoted on NYMEX,
	has ranged from a high of $54.45 per barrel to a low of $39.51 per barrel in the twelve months ended May 18, 2017, and the price of Henry Hub Natural Gas, as quoted on NYMEX, has ranged from a
	high of $3.93 per MMBtu to a low of $1.96 per MMBtu for the same period. On May 18, 2017, the price of WTI was $49.35 per barrel and Henry Hub Natural gas was $3.18 per MMBtu.




	        Factors
	that can cause price fluctuations include:






	




	the level of consumer product demand;








	




	the domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas;








	




	consumer perception and the availability of alternative energy sources;








	




	refinery capacity;








	




	domestic and foreign governmental regulations;








	




	actions by other producers, including the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC);








	




	political and ethnic conflicts in oil and natural gas producing regions;






	27











	Table of Contents







	




	the price of foreign imports; and








	




	overall economic conditions.









	We may incur significant expenses relating to the inspection and possible abandonment of certain conduits for
	natural gas, oil, condensate, or other liquid or gaseous hydrocarbons.






	        On April 17, 2017, a house in Weld County, Colorado experienced an explosion and fire, the cause of which was determined to be natural
	gas that seeped into the house from a severed flowline from a nearby vertical wellbore owned and operated by an unrelated third party. In response, on May 2, 2017, the COGCC issued a Notice to
	Operators (NTO) requiring all oil and gas
	operators in Colorado to systematically inspect their inventory of pipelines and conduits for natural gas, oil, condensate, or other liquid or gaseous hydrocarbons (flowlines), to verify that any
	pipeline or flowline not in active use is properly abandoned pursuant to COGCC rules. By May 30, 2017, we are required to inspect all pipelines and flowlines that are located within 1,000 feet
	of certain buildings, and provide to the COGCC certain information relating to the well, tank batteries, and flowlines. In addition, we are required to inspect all abandoned pipelines and flowlines,
	without regard to their distance from any building, to verify such pipelines and flowlines were properly abandoned in accordance with COGCC rules. By June 30, 2017, we are required to pressure
	test all flowlines within 1,000 feet of certain building units and ensure and document that these lines have integrity. We also are required to abandon all pipelines and flowlines, regardless of
	distance from buildings, not in active use not later than June 30, 2017. We may incur significant expenses in complying with the NTO, including expenses to hire independent contractors to
	inspect and test our pipelines and flowlines and, if required, to abandon any pipeline or flowline in accordance with COGCC rules.







	The cost of oil and natural gas exploration is extremely volatile and may adversely affect our operations.






	        The costs of oil and natural gas exploration, such as the costs of drilling rigs, casing, cement, and pumps, and the fuel and parts necessary to
	keep the rigs and pumps operating and the costs of the oil field service crews have been volatile over the past few years in direct proportion to the amount of ongoing oil and natural gas exploration.
	As with most other companies involved in resource exploration and development, we may be adversely affected by future increases in the costs of conducting exploration, development and resource
	extraction that may not be fully offset by increases in the price received on sales of oil or natural gas.







	If crude oil and natural gas prices decrease, we may be required to write-down the carrying values of our
	crude oil and natural gas properties.






	        We review our proved oil and natural gas properties for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the
	recoverability of their carrying value may have occurred. Based on specific market factors and circumstances at the time of prospective impairment reviews and the continuing evaluation of development
	plans, production data, economics and other factors, we may be required to write down the carrying value of our crude oil and natural gas properties. A write-down constitutes a non-cash charge to
	earnings. We may incur impairment charges in the future, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to raise capital.







	We identified locations scheduled to be drilled over several years, making them susceptible to uncertainties
	that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling.






	        Our management team has identified drilling locations in our operating areas scheduled over a multi-year period. Our ability to drill and
	develop these locations depends on a number of factors, including the availability of equipment and capital, approval by regulators, seasonal conditions, oil and natural gas prices, assessment of
	risks, costs and drilling results. The final determination on whether to




	28











	Table of Contents





	drill
	any of these locations will be dependent upon the factors described elsewhere in this prospectus as well as, to some degree, the results of our drilling activities with respect to our
	established drilling locations. Due to these uncertainties, we do not know if the drilling locations we have identified will be drilled within our expected timeframe or at all. Our actual drilling
	activities may be materially different from our current expectations, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.







	Financial difficulties encountered by our oil and natural gas purchasers, third party operators or other
	third parties could decrease cash flow from operations and adversely affect exploration and development activities.






	        We expect to derive essentially all our revenue from the sale of our oil and natural gas to unaffiliated third party purchasers, including
	independent marketing companies and mid-stream companies. Any delays in payments from such purchasers caused by financial problems encountered by them would have an immediate negative effect on our
	results of operations and cash flows. Liquidity and cash flow problems encountered by our working interest co-owners or the third party operators of our non-operated properties may prevent or delay
	the drilling of a well or the development of a project. Our working interest co-owners may be unwilling or unable to pay their share of the costs of projects as they become due. In the case of a
	working interest owner, we could be required to pay the working interest owner's share of the project costs. We may not be able to obtain the capital necessary to fund these contingencies.







	We may face difficulties in securing and operating under authorizations and permits to drill, complete or
	operate our wells.






	        The recent growth in oil and gas exploration in the United States has drawn intense scrutiny from environmental and community interest groups,
	regulatory agencies and other governmental entities. As a result, we may face significant opposition to, or increased regulation of, our operations that may make it difficult or impossible to obtain
	permits and other needed authorizations to drill, complete or operate, result in operational delays, or otherwise make oil and gas exploration more costly or difficult than in other countries.







	The unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel and oilfield services could
	adversely affect our ability to execute exploration and development plans within the established budget and on a timely basis.






	        Shortages or the high cost of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel or oilfield services could delay or adversely affect development and
	exploration operations or cause us to incur significant expenditures that are not provided for in our capital budget, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or
	results of operations.







	Development of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves, or PUDs, may take longer than expected and may
	require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate. Therefore, our estimated proved undeveloped reserves may not be ultimately developed or produced.






	        At December 31, 2016, approximately 88% of our total estimated proved reserve volumes were classified as proved undeveloped reserves.
	Recovery of undeveloped reserves requires successful drilling and incurrence of significant capital expenditures. Our approximately 5,568 MBOE of estimated proved undeveloped reserves will require an
	estimated $37.7 million of development capital over the next five years. Development of these undeveloped reserves may take longer and require higher levels of capital expenditures than we
	currently anticipate. Delays in the development of our reserves, increases in costs to drill and develop such reserves, or decreases in commodity prices will reduce the PV-10 value of our estimated
	proved undeveloped reserves and future net revenues estimated for such reserves and may




	29











	Table of Contents





	result
	in some projects becoming uneconomic. In addition, delays in the development of reserves could require us to reclassify our proved undeveloped reserves as unproved reserves.




	        Further,
	our reserve data assumes that we can and will make these expenditures and that these operations will be conducted successfully. These assumptions, however, may not prove
	correct. If we choose not to spend the capital to develop these reserves, or if we are not otherwise able to successfully develop these reserves, we may be required to reduce our reserves. Any such
	reduction of our reserves could reduce our ability to borrow and adversely affect our liquidity and available capital.







	If we do not hedge our exposure to reductions in oil and natural gas prices, we may be subject to significant
	reductions in price. Alternatively, we may use oil and natural gas price hedging contracts, which involve credit risk and may limit future revenues from price increases and result in significant
	fluctuations in our profitability.






	        We may use hedging transactions with respect to a portion of our oil and natural gas production to achieve more predictable cash flow and to
	reduce our exposure to price fluctuations. While the use of hedging transactions limits the downside risk of price declines, their use also may limit future revenues from price increases. Hedging
	transactions also involve the risk that the counterparty may be unable to satisfy its obligations. Alternatively, in the event that we choose not to hedge, our exposure to reductions in oil and
	natural gas prices by purchasing futures and by using other hedging strategies, we may be subject to significant reduction in prices which could have a material negative impact on our profitability.







	Derivatives legislation and regulation could adversely affect our ability to hedge crude oil and natural gas
	prices and increase our costs and adversely affect our profitability.






	        In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act") was enacted into law. The Dodd-Frank Act
	regulates derivative transactions, including commodity hedging swaps, and could have a number of adverse effects on any future hedging strategy we may pursue, including the
	following:






	




	The Dodd-Frank Act may limit our ability to enter into hedging transactions and expose us to additional risks related to commodity price
	volatility; commodity price decreases would then have an increased adverse effect on revenues and operations. Reduced hedging may also impair our ability to have certainty with respect to a portion of
	our cash flows, which could lead to decreases in capital spending and, therefore, decreases in future production and reserves.








	




	If, as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act or its implementing regulations, we are required to post cash collateral in connection with any
	derivative positions, this would likely make it impracticable to implement any hedging strategy.








	




	Any derivatives counterparties are subject to significant requirements imposed as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act. We expect that these
	requirements will increase the cost to hedge because there will be fewer counterparties in the market and increased counterparty costs will be passed on to us.






	        The
	above factors could also affect the pricing of derivatives and make it more difficult for us to enter into hedging transactions on favorable terms. The election of President Trump
	has resulted in uncertainty with respect to the future of the Dodd-Frank Act generally and derivative regulation specifically, and the future impact this may have on us is currently unknown.

	Our operations are subject to health, safety and environmental laws and regulations which may expose us to
	significant costs and liabilities and which may not be covered by insurance.






	        Our oil and natural gas exploration is subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing health and
	safety aspects of our operations, the discharge of materials into the environment and the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations impose on our operations numerous requirements,
	including the obligation to obtain a permit before conducting drilling activities; restrictions on the types, quantities and concentration of materials that may be released into the environment;
	limitations or prohibitions of drilling activities on
	certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas; specific health and safety criteria to protect workers; and the responsibility for cleaning up any pollution resulting from
	operations. Numerous governmental authorities such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or the EPA, and analogous state agencies have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and
	regulations and the permits issued under them, oftentimes requiring difficult and costly actions. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative,
	civil or criminal penalties; the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations; the issuance of injunctions limiting or preventing some or all of our proposed operations; and delays in granting
	permits and cancellation of leases.




	        Under
	certain environmental laws and regulations, we may be liable regardless of whether we were at fault for the full cost of removing or remediating contamination, even when multiple
	parties contributed to the release and the contaminants were released in compliance with all applicable laws. In addition, accidental spills or releases on our properties may expose us to significant
	liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations and which may not be covered by insurance. Aside from government agencies, the owners of
	properties where our wells are located, the operators of facilities where our petroleum hydrocarbons or wastes are expected to be taken for reclamation or disposal and other private parties may be
	able to sue us to enforce compliance with environmental laws and regulations, collect penalties for violations or obtain damages for any related personal injury or property damage. Some sites are
	located near current or former third-party oil and natural gas operations or facilities, and there is a risk that contamination has migrated from those sites to ours. Changes in environmental laws and
	regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent or costly material handling, emission, waste management or cleanup requirements could require us to make significant
	expenditures to attain and maintain compliance or may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our own results of operations, competitive position or financial condition. We may not be able to
	recover some or any of these costs from insurance.







	Federal, state, and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to oil and gas production,
	including hydraulic fracturing, as well as government reviews of such activities, could result in increased costs, additional operating restrictions or delays, and adversely affect our production
	and/or ability to book future reserves.






	        We are affected significantly by a substantial number of governmental regulations that increase costs related to the drilling, completion,
	production, and abandonment of wells, the transportation and processing of oil and natural gas, the management and disposal of waste, and other aspects of our operations. It is possible that the
	number and extent of these regulations, and the costs to comply with them, will increase significantly in the future. In Colorado, for example, significant governmental regulations have been adopted
	in recent years to address well siting, well construction, hydraulic fracturing, water quality, public safety, air emissions, aesthetics, waste management, spill reporting, land reclamation, wildlife
	protection, and data collection. These government regulatory requirements may result in substantial costs that are not possible to pass through to our customers and could impact the profitability of
	our operations.

	        Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand or other proppants, and chemical additives under pressure into a targeted subsurface formation. The
	water and pressure create fractures in the rock formations, which are held open by the proppant, enabling the oil or natural gas to flow to the wellbore. The process is typically regulated by state
	oil and natural gas commissions. In addition, the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, or the COGCC, has adopted (and other states have adopted or are considering adopting) regulations that
	impose more stringent permitting, disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations. Further, on February 23, 2014, Colorado's Air Quality Control Commission
	fully adopted EPA's Standards of Performance for Crude Oil and Natural Gas Production, Transmission, and Distribution; adopted corresponding revisions to its emissions reporting and permitting
	framework; and adopted complimentary oil and gas control measures. These regulations will affect our operations, increase our costs of exploration and production and limit the quantity of oil and
	natural gas that we can economically produce to the extent that we use hydraulic fracturing.




	        Some
	local governments are adopting new requirements and restrictions on hydraulic fracturing and other oil and natural gas operations. Some local governments in Colorado, for instance,
	have amended their land use regulations to impose new requirements on oil and gas development, while other local governments have entered memoranda of agreement with oil and gas producers to
	accomplish the same objective. Beyond that, during the past few years, a total of five Colorado cities have passed voter
	initiatives temporarily or permanently prohibiting hydraulic fracturing. Since that time, local district courts have struck down the ordinances for certain of those Colorado cities, and such decisions
	were upheld by the Colorado Supreme Court in May 2016. Nevertheless, there is a continued risk that cities will adopt local ordinances that seek to regulate the time, place, and manner of hydraulic
	fracturing activities and oil and natural gas operations within their respective jurisdictions.




	        Effective
	March 22, 2016, Adams County adopted new amendments to the county's oil and gas regulatory process. The new regulations include an enhanced administrative review
	process, which may increase our costs or delay our drilling program.




	        In
	the event that additional regulations or legal restrictions at the federal, state or local level are adopted related to oil and gas production, hydraulic fracturing or other
	development activities in the areas in which we currently or in the future plan to operate, we may incur additional costs to comply with such requirements that may be significant in nature, and also
	could become subject to additional permitting and siting requirements and cause us to experience added delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities.
	Furthermore, these additional costs may put us at a competitive disadvantage compared to larger companies in the industry which can spread such additional costs over a greater number of wells and
	larger operating staff.







	Legislative and regulatory initiatives related to global warming and climate change could have an adverse
	effect on our operations and the demand for oil and natural gas.






	        In December 2009, the EPA determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other "greenhouse gases," or GHG, present an endangerment to
	public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the earth's atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on these findings, the
	EPA has begun adopting and implementing regulations to restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the Clean Air Act. The EPA recently adopted two sets of rules regulating
	greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act, one of which requires a reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases from motor vehicles and the other of which regulates emissions of greenhouse
	gases from certain large stationary sources. The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified large greenhouse gas emission sources in the United
	States on an annual basis, including petroleum refineries, as well as certain onshore oil and natural gas production facilities.




	32











	Table of Contents





	        The
	U.S. Congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce GHG emissions and almost one-half of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce GHG
	emissions, primarily through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap and trade programs. Most of these GHG cap and trade programs work by requiring major sources of
	emissions, such as electric power plants, or major producers of fuels, such as refineries and gas processing plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances. The number of allowances available
	for purchase is reduced each year in an effort to achieve the overall GHG emission reduction goal.




	        The
	adoption of legislation or regulatory programs to reduce GHG emissions could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control
	systems, to acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements. Any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby
	reduce demand for, the oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas we produce. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce GHG emissions could have an adverse effect on our business,
	financial condition and results of operations. Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHG in the Earth's atmosphere may produce climate
	changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, and floods and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could have
	an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.







	We may not be able to keep pace with technological developments in the industry.






	        The oil and natural gas industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements and introductions of new products and
	services using new technologies. As others use or develop new technologies, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage or competitive pressures may force us to implement those new technologies at
	substantial costs. In addition, other oil and natural gas companies may have greater financial, technical, and personnel resources that allow them to enjoy technological advantages and may in the
	future allow them to implement new technologies before we are in a position to do so. We may not be able to respond to these competitive pressures and implement new technologies on a timely basis or
	at an acceptable cost. If one or more of the technologies used now or in the future were to become obsolete or if we are unable to use the most advanced commercially available technology, the
	business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.







	We may incur losses as a result of title deficiencies.






	        We own working and revenue interests in oil and natural gas leasehold interests. The existence of a material title deficiency can render a lease
	worthless and can adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Title insurance covering mineral leaseholds is not generally available and, in many instances, we forego the
	expense of retaining lawyers to examine the
	title to the mineral interest to be placed under lease or already placed under lease until the drilling block is assembled and ready to be drilled. As is customary in our industry, we rely upon the
	judgment of oil and natural gas lease brokers, in-house landmen or independent landmen who perform the field work in examining records in the appropriate governmental offices and abstract facilities
	before attempting to acquire or place under lease a specific mineral interest. We do not always perform curative work to correct deficiencies in the marketability of the title to us. In cases
	involving serious title problems, the amount paid for affected oil and natural gas leases can be lost, and the target area can become undrillable. We may be subject to litigation from time to time as
	a result of title issues.

	The oil and natural gas business involves many operating risks that can cause substantial losses.






	        The oil and natural gas business involves a variety of operating risks, including:






	




	fires;








	




	explosions;








	




	blow-outs and surface cratering;








	




	natural disasters;








	




	pipe and cement failures;








	




	casing collapses;








	




	embedded oilfield drilling and service tools;








	




	abnormal pressure formations; and








	




	environmental hazards such as natural gas leaks, oil spills, pipeline ruptures or discharges of toxic gases.






	        If
	any of these events occur, we could incur substantial losses as a result of:






	




	injury or loss of life;








	




	severe damage to and destruction of property, natural resources or equipment;








	




	pollution and other environmental damage;








	




	clean-up responsibilities;








	




	regulatory investigation and penalties;








	




	suspension of our operations; or








	




	repairs necessary to resume operations.






	        If
	we were to experience any of these problems, it could affect well bores, gathering systems and processing facilities, any one of which could adversely affect our ability to conduct
	operations, or subject us to monetary liability. We may be affected by any of these events more than larger companies, since we have limited working capital. We currently have general liability
	insurance with a combined single limit per occurrence of not less than $1.0 million for bodily injury and property damage and a combined occurrence limit of $2.0 million, an excess
	umbrella liability policy for up to $5.0 million, and control of well insurance with limits of $5.0 million for any one occurrence. For other risks, however, we may not obtain insurance
	if we believe the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. If a significant accident
	or other event occurs and is not fully covered by insurance, it could adversely affect operations and/or our financial condition. Moreover, we may not be able to maintain adequate insurance in the
	future at rates considered reasonable.







	Terrorist attacks aimed at energy operations could adversely affect our business.






	        The continued threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other government action have led and may lead to further increased volatility
	in prices for oil and natural gas and could affect these commodity markets or the financial markets used by us. In addition, the U.S. government has issued warnings that energy assets may be a future
	target of terrorist organizations. These developments have subjected oil and natural gas operations to increased risks. Any future terrorist attack on our facilities, customer facilities, the
	infrastructure depended upon for transportation
	of products, and, in some cases, those of other energy companies, could have a material adverse effect on our business.

	Risks Related to the Offering and Our Common Stock








	The price of our common stock may be volatile or may decline and you may not be able to resell your shares at
	or above the offering price.






	        Our common stock currently trades on the OTCQB Marketplace with limited daily trading volume. In connection with this offering, we intend to
	apply to list our common stock on the NYSE MKT. The offering price for our common stock was determined through negotiations between the underwriters and us and may vary from the market price of our
	common stock following this offering. If you purchase shares of our common stock in this offering, you may not be able to resell those shares at or above the offering price. An active or liquid market
	in our common stock might not develop upon the closing of this offering or, if it does develop, it might not be sustainable. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in
	response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:






	




	the limited trading market in our common stock;








	




	commodity prices in general, and the price of oil in particular;








	




	the success of our development efforts;








	




	failure to successfully implement our business plan;








	




	failure to meet our revenue or profit goals or operating budget;








	




	decline in demand for our common stock;








	




	sales of additional amounts of common stock;








	




	downward revisions in securities analysts' estimates or changes in general market conditions;








	




	investor perception of our industry or our prospects; and








	




	general economic trends.






	        In
	addition, stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations and the market prices of securities have been highly volatile. These fluctuations are often unrelated to
	operating performance and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. As a result, investors may be unable to resell their shares at a fair price.







	Investors in this offering will experience immediate substantial dilution of their investment.






	        The public offering price of our common stock offered pursuant to this prospectus is substantially higher than the net tangible book value per
	share of our common stock. Therefore, if you purchase shares of common stock in this offering, you will incur immediate and substantial dilution in the pro forma net tangible book value per share of
	common stock from the price per share that you pay for the common stock. See the section entitled "Dilution" below for a more detailed discussion of the dilution you will incur if you purchase shares
	in this offering. Furthermore, we expect that we will seek to raise additional capital from time to time in the future. Such financings may involve the issuance of equity and/or securities convertible
	into or exercisable or exchangeable for our equity securities. We also expect to continue to utilize equity-based compensation. To the extent the warrants and options are exercised or we issue common
	stock, preferred stock, or securities such as warrants that are convertible into, exercisable or exchangeable for, our common stock or preferred stock in the future, you may experience further
	dilution.




	35











	Table of Contents








	A small number of existing shareholders own a significant amount of our common stock, which could limit your
	ability to influence the outcome of any shareholder vote.






	        Our executive officers, directors, and certain beneficial owners beneficially own approximately 42.2% of our common stock. Under our Articles of
	Incorporation and Colorado law, the vote of a majority of the shares present and voting is generally required to approve most shareholder action. As a result, these individuals will strongly influence
	the outcome of shareholder votes for the foreseeable future, including votes concerning the election of directors, amendments to our Articles of Incorporation or proposed mergers or other significant
	corporate transactions. We have no existing agreements or plans for mergers or other corporate transactions that would require a shareholder vote at this time. However, shareholders should be aware
	that they may have limited ability to influence the outcome of any vote in the future.







	We have broad discretion in the use of the net proceeds from this offering and may not use them effectively.






	        We will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds from this offering and could spend the proceeds in ways that do not improve
	our results of operations or enhance the value of our common stock. We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for continuation of our development and acquisition program; repayment of
	short-term debt; and other capital and operating expenses. We may also use a portion of our net proceeds to acquire oil and gas assets; however, we currently have no agreements or commitments to
	complete any such transaction. We have not allocated these net proceeds for any specific purposes. We might not be able to yield a significant return, if any, on any investment of these net proceeds.
	You will not have the opportunity to influence our management's decisions on how to use the net proceeds from this offering, and our failure to apply these funds effectively could have a material
	adverse effect on our business, delay the development of our product candidates and cause the price of our common stock to decline.







	We intend to seek approval from our shareholders to grant our Board of Directors discretion to implement a
	reverse split of our common stock for the purpose of, among other things, meeting the initial listing requirements of the NYSE MKT. However, any reverse split ultimately may not increase our share
	price.






	        We intend to seek approval from our shareholders to grant our Board of Directors discretion to implement a reverse split of our common stock
	prior to the date of this prospectus if necessary to meet the minimum share price of the initial listing requirements of the NYSE MKT. However, the longer-term effect of any reverse split upon the
	market price of our common stock cannot be predicted with certainty, and the results of reverse splits by companies in similar circumstances are varied. It is possible that the share price of our
	common stock after a reverse split will not remain increased in proportion to the reduction in the number of shares of our common stock outstanding.







	Any reverse split of our common stock will not be accompanied by a reduction in our authorized capital.






	        We do not intend to amend our Articles of Incorporation in connection with a reverse split to reduce the number of authorized shares of common
	stock. Accordingly, any reverse split would have the practical effect of an increased number of authorized shares of common stock being available for issuance. The resulting increase could have a
	number of effects on our shareholders depending on the exact nature and circumstances of any actual issuances of authorized but unissued shares. The practical increase in available authorized shares
	for issuance could have an anti-takeover effect, in that additional shares could be issued (within the limits imposed by applicable law) in one or more transactions that could make a change in control
	or takeover of our company more difficult.
	Similarly, the issuance of additional shares to certain persons allied with our management could have the effect of making it more difficult to remove our current management by diluting the stock
	ownership or voting rights of persons seeking to cause such removal.




	36











	Table of Contents








	The sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to
	decline.






	        We currently have outstanding a significant amount of common stock held by relatively few shareholders. In addition, we are required to
	file a resale registration statement in connection with our recently completed private placement covering a significant number of shares of our common stock. Our common stock is currently
	thinly-traded and it is likely that market sales of large amounts of common stock (or the potential for those sales even if they do not actually occur) could cause the market price of our common stock
	to decline, which may make it difficult to sell our common stock in the future at a time and price which we deem reasonable or appropriate and may also cause you to lose all or a part of your
	investment.







	If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research
	about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.






	        The trading market for our common stock will depend in part upon the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us
	and our business. We do not currently have and may never obtain research coverage by securities and industry analysts. If no analysts commence coverage of our company, the trading price of our common
	stock might be negatively impacted. If we obtain securities or industry analyst coverage and if one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable
	research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage or fails to report about us on a regular basis, demand for our stock could decrease,
	which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.







	Issuance of our stock in the future could dilute existing shareholders and adversely affect the market price
	of our common stock.






	        We have the authority to issue up to 110,000,000 shares of stock, including 100,000,000 shares of common stock and 10,000,000 shares of
	preferred stock, and to issue options and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock. Under rules of the NYSE MKT, we could issue up to 20% of our then outstanding common stock without
	shareholder approval and more with that approval. These future issuances could be at values substantially below the price paid for our common stock by investors in this offering. In addition, we could
	issue large blocks of our stock to fend off unwanted tender offers or hostile takeovers without further shareholder approval. Because the trading volume of our common stock is relatively low, the
	issuance of our stock may have a disproportionately large impact on its price compared to larger companies.







	The issuance of preferred stock in the future could adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common
	stock.






	        An issuance of preferred stock could result in a class of outstanding securities that would have preferences with respect to voting rights and
	dividends and in liquidation over the common stock and could, upon conversion or otherwise, have all of the rights of our common stock. Our Board of Directors' authority to issue preferred stock could
	discourage potential takeover attempts or could delay or prevent a change in control through merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise by making these attempts more difficult or costly to
	achieve.







	We have never paid dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying any in the foreseeable
	future.






	        We have not paid dividends on our common stock to date, and we may not be in a position to pay dividends for the foreseeable future. Our ability
	to pay dividends will depend on our ability to successfully develop our business plan and generate revenue from operations. Further, our initial earnings, if any, will likely be retained to finance
	our operations. Any future dividends will depend upon our earnings, our then-existing financial requirements and other factors, and will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors. See "Dividend
	Policy" on page 41 of this prospectus.

	        We
	intend to use a portion of the net proceeds of this offering to repay approximately $3.6 million in aggregate principal amount, plus accrued interest, of outstanding borrowings
	under the supplemental line of credit. The supplemental line of credit bears interest at the rate equal 8% simple interest per
	year and has a maturity date of June 13, 2017. We entered into and have made draws against the supplemental line of credit in order to pay costs and expenses related to our acquisition and
	development of oil and gas assets in and around the Wattenberg Field, including acquisitions of acreage, working interests, royalty interests, and commercially productive oil and gas wells. See
	"MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES" beginning on page 72 of this prospectus for more information
	regarding the supplemental line of credit.




	        The
	foregoing represents our current intentions based upon our current plans and business condition. Management will have broad discretion in the application of our net proceeds from
	this offering, and the occurrence of unforeseen events or changes in business conditions could result in the application of our net proceeds from this offering in a manner other than as described in
	this prospectus.




	        Pending
	application in accordance with our plan of operation, the proceeds of this offering may be invested in temporary interest-bearing investments such as checking accounts, time
	deposits, certificates of deposit and short-term government obligations. We do not intend to invest the proceeds of this offering in a manner that would subject us to regulation as an investment
	company for purposes of United States securities laws.

	        On
	May 18, 2017, the high and low sales prices of our common stock on the OTCQB Marketplace were $1.94.




	        Because
	our common stock is thinly traded and has not been listed on a national securities exchange, the price for our common stock has been volatile and may bear no relationship to our
	actual financial condition or results of operations. Factors that we discuss in this prospectus, including the many risks associated with our common stock, may have a significant impact on the market
	price of our common stock. The market for our common stock will be affected by the offer and sale of our common stock by existing securities holders. In connection with this offering, we intend to
	apply to list our common stock on the NYSE MKT under the symbol "PRHR."






	Holders of our Common Stock





	        We currently have 22,551,537 shares of common stock outstanding and approximately 94 holders of record of our common stock.






	Penny Stock Rules





	        Prior to this offering, shares of our common stock have traded on the OTCQB Marketplace at a price less than $5.00 per share and, as a result,
	our stock is characterized as a "penny stock" under applicable securities regulations. As a result, we have been subject to rules adopted by the SEC and FINRA regulating broker-dealer practices in
	connection with transactions in penny stocks. The broker or dealer proposing to effect a transaction in a penny stock must furnish the customer with a document containing information prescribed by
	rule and obtain from the customer an executed acknowledgment of receipt of that document. Also, because of the relatively low trading price of our
	common stock, many brokerage firms may have been unwilling to effect transactions in our common stock.




	        The
	broker or dealer must also provide the customer with pricing information regarding the security prior to the transaction and with the written confirmation of the transaction. The
	broker or




	40











	Table of Contents





	dealer
	must also disclose the aggregate amount of any compensation received or receivable by him in connection with such transaction prior to consummating the transaction and with the written
	confirmation of the trade. The broker or dealer must also send an account statement to each customer for which he has executed a transaction in a penny stock each month in which such security is held
	for the customer's account. The existence of these rules may have had an adverse effect on the price of our stock, and the willingness of certain brokers to effect transactions in our stock.




	        In
	connection with this offering, we intend to apply to list our common stock on the NYSE MKT. To the extent that our common stock is listed on the NYSE MKT, and we meet certain minimum
	financial metrics, our common stock will no longer be considered a "penny stock."









	Transfer Agent





	        We have appointed Corporate Stock Transfer, Inc. of Denver, Colorado to be our transfer agent. Its address is 3200 Cherry Creek Drive
	South, #430, Denver, Colorado 80209 and its telephone number is 303-282-4800.









	Dividend Policy





	        We have never declared or paid dividends on our common stock. The convertible promissory notes issued in our recent private placement contain a
	covenant prohibiting us from paying any dividends unless we are current in our obligations under the notes. See "MANAGEMENT'S
	DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS" beginning on page 63 for discussion of the outstanding convertible promissory notes. Payment of future dividends, if
	any, will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors after taking into account various factors, including the terms of any credit arrangements, our financial condition, operating results, current
	and anticipated cash needs and plans for expansion.

	CAPITALIZATION






	        The following table sets forth our cash and cash equivalents and our capitalization as of March 31,
	2017:






	

	$            per share, the repayment of short-term debt, and after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.






	        The
	as-adjusted information below is illustrative only, does not account for changes subsequent to March 31, 2017, and our capitalization following the closing of this offering
	may differ from that shown below based on the public offering price and other terms of this offering determined at pricing. You should read this table together with our financial statements and the
	related notes appearing at the end of this prospectus, the section entitled "MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS" and other financial information

	DILUTION






	        If you invest in our common stock, you will experience dilution to the extent of the difference between the price you pay per share in this
	public offering and the as adjusted net tangible book value of our common stock immediately after this offering. Our net tangible book value as of March 31, 2017 was $6,747,301, or
	approximately $0.30 per share. Net tangible book value per share is determined by dividing our total tangible assets, less total liabilities, by the number of outstanding shares of our common stock.




	        After
	giving effect to the sale of our common stock in this offering, and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and the estimated expenses payable by us, our adjusted
	net tangible book value as of March 31, 2017 would have been $            , or $            per share. This amount represents
	an immediate increase in our net tangible book value of
	$            per share to our existing stockholders and an immediate dilution in our adjusted net tangible book value of approximately
	$            per share to new investors purchasing shares
	of our common stock in this offering. We determine dilution by subtracting the adjusted net tangible book value per share after the offering from the amount of cash that a new investor paid for a
	share of common stock.




	        Dilution
	per share to new investors is determined by subtracting pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share after this offering from the public offering price per share paid
	by new investors. The following table illustrates this dilution:

	UNAUDITED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION






	        The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations has been prepared to show the effect of the PDC and Crimson
	acquisitions. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations should be read together with our audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016 and the
	historical Statements of Revenues and Direct Operating Expenses of the PDC and Crimson assets, respectively, included in this prospectus. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of
	operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 assumes that the PDC and Crimson asset acquisitions occurred on January 1, 2016.




	        The
	acquisition of the PDC and Crimson assets were each treated as a business combination accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting with the identifiable assets recognized
	at fair value on the date of transfer. The PDC assets acquisition was completed on June 30, 2016. We acquired leases covering approximately 3,652 gross (1,411 net) acres in Adams County,
	Colorado and PDC's interest in 32 gross (13.0 net) productive wells. The Crimson assets acquisition was completed on December 22, 2016. We acquired leases covering approximately 14,874 gross
	(5,385 net) acres in Adams, Arapahoe, Elbert and Weld Counties, Colorado and Crimson's interest in 33 gross (10.4 net) productive wells.




	        The
	pro forma adjustments to the unaudited historical condensed combined statement of operations were based on currently available information and certain estimates and assumptions. The
	actual effect of the transactions discussed may differ from the unaudited pro forma adjustments included herein. However, management believes that the assumptions utilized to prepare these adjustments
	provide a reasonable basis for presenting the significant effects of the transactions and that the adjustments are factually supported, give appropriate effect to the impact of the events that are
	directly attributable to the transactions, and reflect those items expected to have a continuing impact on our company.




	        The
	unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations is not necessarily indicative of the results that would have occurred if we had completed the acquisition of the PDC
	and Crimson assets on the dates indicated or which could be achieved in the future because they necessarily exclude various operating expenses.

	BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES








	Our History and Organization





	        We are an independent oil and natural gas company focused on the acquisition and development of crude oil and natural gas properties and have
	assembled approximately 9,900 net acres, including mineral rights only acreage, most of which is located in the Denver-Julesburg Basin, or the DJ Basin, in northeast Colorado. Our current operating
	focus is within the Wattenberg Field of the DJ Basin, which is located primarily in Adams and Weld Counties, Colorado. We have concentrated
	our efforts in areas where we believe the geo-mechanical characteristics of the underlying formations offer the potential for greater returns on capital. Our evaluation metrics include reservoir
	thickness, rock quality and resistivity of each formation, each of which affect the number of wells we plan to drill per drilling spacing unit.




	        We
	have placed particular emphasis on acquiring acreage in an area of the southern Wattenberg Field in Adams County and southwest Weld County, Colorado, along with an area southeast of
	the field, which areas we refer to collectively as the Southern Core, where we have assembled approximately 8,900 net acres. We selected our Southern Core acreage due to the quality of the hydrocarbon
	bearing rock, the production performance from other nearby wells, and the liquids-weighted nature of the production. We believe that all of these factors make development of much of our Southern Core
	acreage economic in the prevailing commodity price environment. We also have recently completed acquisitions in an area in the northern portion of the Wattenberg Field that previously has yielded
	hydrocarbon production from both vertical and horizontal wells.




	        Our
	strategy is to continue to leverage our management team's extensive technical, land, financial, and industry operating experience to direct the majority of our capital expenditure
	program through June 30, 2018 toward drilling operated Niobrara and Codell horizontal wells and acquire additional leaseholds in the DJ Basin, which we believe will enhance our strategic value.
	Since entering the DJ Basin in 2015, we have grown our position through acquisitions and organic leasing activities. Consistent with our track record, we plan to continue to selectively and
	opportunistically pursue strategic acquisitions in and around our core areas in Adams and Weld Counties.




	        We
	have an interest in 80 gross (26.4 net) productive wells and 33,151 gross (9,929 net, including 410 net minerals only) acres of oil and gas properties. With the exception of 17 gross
	(2.9 net) horizontal wells in which we are participating as a non-operator, all of these wells are vertical wellbores. Over the first quarter of 2017, we produced hydrocarbons at an average rate of
	approximately 440 BOE/D. At the end of April 2017, our average production exceeded 1,300 BOE/D, or approximately three times the average first quarter rate. At December 31, 2016, we had
	estimated proved developed reserves of 740 MBOE and proved undeveloped reserves of 5,568 MBOE, with a standardized measure of approximately $42.8 million and a PV-10 value of approximately
	$48.6 million based on SEC pricing of $42.75 per Bbl and $2.481 per MMBtu. For an explanation of the PV-10 value and a reconciliation to the standardized measure, see "Prospectus
	SummarySummary Historical Reserve Data."




	        All
	of the horizontal wells in which we currently have an interest are operated by independent third parties, although we recently began drilling operations on our 14-well Shook pad in
	our Todd Creek Farms prospect. We expect to have less than a 50% interest in any wells as we seek to conserve our capital and diversify risk.




	        Our
	executive and administrative offices are currently located at 9635 Maroon Circle, Suite 400, Englewood, CO 80112 and we maintain a website at www.petrosharecorp.com. We
	became a reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, in February 2015, when a registration statement for our common stock was declared effective. You
	may access and read our public filings through the SEC's, website at www.sec.gov and on our website.

	Table of Contents





	        As
	discussed below, during 2016 and early 2017 we acquired additional oil and gas assets, initiated operations on our own property base and participated as a non-operator with other oil
	and gas companies active in the Wattenberg Field. Our goal is to diversify risk and minimize capital exposure to development, drilling and completion costs. In any drilling, we expect that our
	retained working interest will be determined based upon factors such as well costs and geologic and engineering risk.






	Business Strategies





	        Our primary business objective is to increase shareholder value by increasing reserves, production, and revenue at attractive rates of return on
	invested capital. We are focused on exploiting long-lived, unconventional oil, NGL and natural gas reserves from the DJ Basin. We plan to accomplish our objectives through the execution of the
	following strategies:






	Balanced operated and non-operated capital program





	        Our management team elected initially to develop our properties in the Southern Core by participating in non-operated pads with established
	operators such as PDC, Ward and Great Western. The individuals on our management team have extensive experience operating in the DJ Basin, which combined with knowledge gained from our recent
	non-operated well participation and observing offset operator activity, gives us a strong understanding of the underlying formations and optimal drilling and completion techniques in our area. Based
	on this information and the continued de-risking and delineation of our position by nearby operators, we commenced our operated drilling activities on our Shook pad in April 2017. We expect
	operational control of our properties will enable us to capture operating efficiencies and allow us to control the pace of development and capital outlay.






	Aggressively develop our Southern Core acreage





	        We intend to aggressively and selectively drill and develop our Southern Core acreage position to maximize the value of our resource potential.
	On our remaining undeveloped acreage, we believe that we can drill between 12 and 16 horizontal wells per drilling spacing unit depending on the geologic and economic viability of the various Niobrara
	and Codell targets. Utilizing these assumptions, we have identified potential drilling locations that could result in up to 84 net wells in our Todd Creek Farms and South Brighton prospects. We plan
	to drill 10.2 net operated and participate in 1.3 net non-operated wells through June 30, 2018.






	Pursue strategic acquisitions and increase our leasehold in the Wattenberg Field





	        We intend to continue to leverage our management team's extensive relationships to opportunistically increase our acreage holdings at attractive
	valuations. We also intend to pursue organic leasing opportunities, corporate mergers or asset acquisitions, and farm-in related opportunities. We have a successful track record of closing oil and
	natural gas asset acquisitions, including the recent acquisitions of well interests and net acres from PDC, Crimson and Morning Gun. Since entering the DJ Basin without any acreage in 2015, we have
	rapidly grown our footprint to approximately 9,600 net acres. See "Recent Acquisitions and Developments" below for more detail on our acquisitions.




	48











	Table of Contents







	Our Competitive Strengths





	        We believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on current conditions in the oil and natural gas industry as a result of the following
	competitive strengths:






	Multi-year drilling inventory in the Todd Creek Farms and South Brighton prospects targeting the
	Niobrara and Codell formations





	        We believe nearby operator horizontal drilling activity and well results in and around our acreage have significantly mitigated the geologic
	risk in our drilling program. Our Todd Creek Farms and South Brighton prospects are located in an area where drilling results and the liquids-weighted nature of the assets allow for generating
	accretive returns even in a low commodity price environment. We have identified over 220 gross horizontal drilling locations (up to 84 net wells) on our Todd Creek Farms and South Brighton prospects.
	As of December 31, 2016, a majority of these locations have been designated proved undeveloped reserves by our third-party reserve engineer. We believe we can identify and develop additional
	locations in these prospects. We believe our multi-year drilling portfolio provides the potential for near-term growth in our production and reserves and highlights the long-term resource potential
	across our asset base.






	Experienced and aligned management team with proven financial, technical and operational expertise





	        Our Chief Executive Officer, Stephen Foley, has over 15 years of experience as a real estate developer in Colorado, with an extensive
	background in surface development in the areas in which we have acquired acreage. Our President, Frederick Witsell, and Chief Operating Officer, William Lloyd, bring a long history in Colorado and
	depth of experience in the industry to our company. Mr. Witsell has over 36 years of experience in several facets of the oil and gas industry, including prospect development,
	conventional and horizontal drilling and completion operations, project management, gathering and compression systems and marketing and risk management. Mr. Lloyd also has over 36 years
	of experience in the industry, serving in engineering, management and senior leadership capacities. Prior to this offering, our directors, executive officers and employees owned, including all options
	and warrants, approximately 42.2% of our company which provides a meaningful incentive to increase the value of our business for the benefit of all stockholders.






	Our strategic partnerships





	        In May 2015, we entered into the Participation Agreement with Providence. We believe our relationship with Providence is instrumental to our
	success. In addition to helping to fund our acquisition and development strategy through our $5 million initial line of credit, the relationship provides us access to Providence's industry
	expertise. We believe our relationship with Providence is strong, as evidenced by its participation in all of our Southern Core acquisitions, our borrowing
	arrangement, and Providence's holdings in our common stock. The relationship with Providence and its affiliates has led to the acquisition of much of the acreage that we currently hold. In addition to
	our Providence relationship, our executive officers have developed relationships and formalized agreements with business partners that have, and we believe will continue to, contribute significantly
	to our growth. Through a services agreement executed in 2015 with Kingdom, we have gained access to a portfolio of oil and gas leases in an attractive portion of the Wattenberg Field. Our relationship
	with Kingdom has also provided surface access for drilling operations and water for drilling and production operations on our leasehold interests.






	Liquids-weighted reserves





	        Our net proved reserves at December 31, 2016 were comprised of approximately 70% oil and NGLs (collectively, liquids). Given the current
	commodity price environment and resulting disparity




	49











	Table of Contents





	between
	oil and natural gas prices on a BOE basis, we believe our high percentage of liquid reserves and drilling program focused on oil-weighted projects, compared to our overall reserve base, is a
	key strength.






	Meaningful growth opportunities





	        Our relative footprint and size provides us the ability to significantly increase our scale by piecing together acreage blocks that may be
	considered less attractive to larger operators within our focus area. These blocks have meaningful impact on our position as evidenced by the recent PDC, Crimson, and Morning Gun asset acquisitions
	and we expect to continue our track record of making these types of acquisitions as we grow our position. See "Recent Acquisitions and Developments" below for more detail on our
	acquisitions.






	Oil and Gas Properties







	Southern Core





	        We have subdivided our Southern Core focus area into the Todd Creek Farms, South Brighton, and Runway prospects. The Southern Core covers areas
	in the southern Wattenberg Field as well as outlying areas to the southeast of the field, all of which is a part of the DJ Basin. Discovered in 1970, and historically a gas field, the Wattenberg Field
	now produces both crude oil and natural gas primarily from the Niobrara and Codell formations. The DJ Basin generally extends from the Denver metropolitan area throughout northeast Colorado into parts
	of Wyoming, Nebraska, and Kansas. The majority of the Wattenberg Field lies in Weld County but reaches into Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Broomfield, Denver, and Larimer Counties, all in Colorado.




	        Our
	primary targets in the Southern Core are the multiple benches in the Niobrara formation, including the A, B, and C benches, and the Codell formation. The outlying portions of our
	Southern Core acreage, including our Runway prospect, is prospective for the D and J Sands.




	        The
	Niobrara formation is a calcareous chalk, shale, and limestone rock formation varying from approximately 200 to 1,500 feet in thickness and extending from Canada to New Mexico, but
	the vast majority of the oil and natural gas concentration is in Colorado and Wyoming. The formation generally slopes downward from east to west, from Kansas to western Colorado, from hydrocarbon
	producing depths of approximately 1,000 feet to 12,000 feet below the surface. The Codell formation is an oil and natural gas producing tight sandstone formation generally found at depths of
	approximately 7,000 to 8,000 feet below the surface and located at the base of the NiobraraFort Hays limestone member.




	        The
	D and J Sands are present throughout the Wattenberg Field and contain hydrocarbons at depths ranging from 4,000 feet to 10,000 feet in the center of the DJ Basin. The D Sand is
	generally economically productive for both oil and gas in vertical wells when such wells encounter higher quality sandstones. The J Sand is the principal formation in the Wattenberg Field and produces
	gas and associated condensate from tight sand reservoirs. We have access to 3D seismic data in the area of our Runway prospect which may help us determine the best way to ultimately develop our
	acreage.




	        The
	Southern Core covers areas in Adams County and southwest Weld County. The Southern Core area saw significant development through vertical drilling in the preceding decades, but
	modern horizontal drilling is relatively new for the area. The "northern core Wattenberg," located south of Greeley, Colorado in west-central Weld County, has been the primary focus of oil and gas
	producers for the past seven years. However, activity in the Southern Core has picked up significantly over the past two years and, according to the COGCC records, active operators in the Southern
	Core, including PDC, Great Western, Ward, and Kerr-McGee, are increasing their permitting, spacing and drilling programs. We believe the Southern Core provides us compelling economics in the current
	price environment.




	50











	Table of Contents





	        We
	currently possess a total inventory of over 220 gross potential horizontal drilling locations (up to 84 net wells) on our Todd Creek Farms and South Brighton prospects in the Southern
	Core, including 100 locations that are fully permitted or in the final permitting stages. This horizontal well inventory assumes 12 to 16 wells per 640-acre drilling spacing unit with multi-zone
	potential in the Codell and Niobrara A, B, and C formations. This multi-zone potential has been successfully tested by other operators and we are currently participating as a non-operator in active
	development programs with three different established area operators. Our participation is comprised of multiple horizontal wells targeting the Codell and all three benches of the Niobrara formation.

	Todd Creek Farms






	        Within
	the Southern Core, our primary prospect is Todd Creek Farms, which is located in northwest Adams County, Colorado. We have assembled a 4,512 gross (1,526 net)
	acre position in Todd Creek Farms. Through our geologic analysis, as well as the results from wells in which we have participated as a non-operator, we identified the Todd Creek Farms prospect as
	being highly prospective for multi-bench horizontal well development in the Niobrara A, B, C, and Codell formations.











	South Brighton






	        Our
	South Brighton prospect is east of our Todd Creek Farms prospect and sits in northern Adams County and southern Weld County, Colorado. We acquired the majority of
	this acreage in our transaction with Crimson during 2016. We have leaseholds encompassing 5,015 gross (2,030 net) acres in South Brighton. We believe South Brighton is prospective for multi-bench
	horizontal well development in the Niobrara and Codell formations.











	Runway






	        Our
	Runway prospect is east of our Todd Creek Farms and South Brighton prospects and lies within Adams County, Colorado east of the Denver International Airport. With
	the closing of the Morning Gun acquisition on April 3, 2017 (as discussed further below), we now have leaseholds encompassing 16,473 gross (5,359 net) acres in the Runway prospect. Most of this
	acreage is held by production from vertical wells, giving us control of the pace of the development of this area. Nearby operator activity has shown this acreage to be prospective for D and J Sands
	and able to be developed using both vertical and horizontal wells.




	51











	Table of Contents







	Northern Wattenberg Field





	        In addition to our Southern Core acreage, we also have assembled 1,796 gross (642 net) acres in the northern area of the Wattenberg Field. A
	preliminary evaluation indicates that there are 34 potential gross horizontal drilling locations, which could result in up to 12 net wells on this acreage, based on 12 wells per each
	640-acre drilling spacing unit. We are the operator on the majority of this acreage, giving us control of the pace of the development of this area. Nearby operator activity has shown this acreage to
	be prospective for multiple benches and zones, including both the Niobrara and Codell formations. A number of operators, including Noble Energy, Inc., Extraction Oil & Gas, Inc.,
	and Synergy Resources Corporation, dba SRC Energy Inc., are actively developing acreage in the northern Wattenberg Field.






	Buck Peak





	        In 2014, we drilled and completed our initial two-well program at our Buck Peak prospect in northwest Colorado, targeting the Niobrara
	formation. Those two wells resulted in nominal production and accordingly, we are not actively pursuing development in this area. We will, however,
	monitor activity in the area and continue to evaluate additional opportunities for our 5,276 gross (352 net) acres.






	Recent Acquisitions and Developments





	        During 2016 and early 2017, we took important steps to improve our business by making several lease acquisitions, participating as a
	non-operator in the drilling of 17 gross (2.9 net) horizontal wells in the Wattenberg Field, and completing the permitting process of our first planned operated wells in the Southern Core. Our leasing
	activities have been focused on areas in Adams County and southwest Weld County, Colorado in the Southern Core area.






	Supplemental Line of Credit





	        On October 13, 2016, we entered into the supplemental line of credit with PEP III. The supplemental line of credit permitted us to borrow
	up to $10 million to pay costs associated with our acquisition and development of oil and gas properties. We have used draws on the supplemental line of credit to pay for certain of our
	acquisitions, including the Crimson acquisition discussed below, as well as to pay costs associated with our operated and non-operated drilling programs.




	        As
	required by an amendment to the supplemental line of credit, we repaid approximately $3.5 million in outstanding principal on April 12, 2017 and agreed not to borrow
	additional funds in exchange for PEP III extending the maturity date of the supplemental line of credit. We have approximately $3.6 million plus accrued interest of approximately $237,000
	outstanding against the supplemental line of credit, all of which is due on June 13, 2017.






	PDC Assets Acquisition





	        On June 30, 2016, we completed the acquisition of the PDC assets. The PDC assets include leases covering approximately 3,652 gross (1,411
	net) acres located in Adams County, Colorado and PDC's interest in 32 gross (13.0 net) productive vertical wells and 8 horizontal well
	locations that are permitted. Providence exercised its option pursuant to the Participation Agreement and acquired 50% of the PDC assets. Much of the acreage we acquired from PDC is within our Todd
	Creek Farms prospect and held by production, while the remainder of the acreage is located in outlying areas of the Southern Core and is prospective for formations other than the Niobrara and Codell
	formations.

	Table of Contents





	        The
	net purchase price for the PDC assets to our interest was approximately $2.3 million following allowances, post-closing adjustments and Providence's acquisition from us of its
	50% interest in the PDC assets. We paid the purchase price using a draw on our initial line of credit.




	        Following
	the acquisition, we became the substituted operator for all of the wells PDC previously operated. The acquisition allows us spacing to drill up to 30 additional horizontal
	wells, including the 8 currently-approved horizontal well locations on the Corcilius pad. Whether we ultimately drill any wells on the acreage is dependent on many of the factors discussed in this
	prospectus, including receipt of adequate working capital, current and projected prices of oil and gas, identification of compelling drill locations, and obtaining all required permits.






	Crimson Assets Acquisition





	        On December 22, 2016, we completed the acquisition of the Crimson assets. Simultaneous with the closing of the acquisition, Providence
	acquired 50% of our interest in the Crimson assets. The Crimson assets include oil and gas leases located in Adams, Arapahoe, Elbert, and Weld Counties, Colorado, covering approximately 14,874 gross
	(5,385 net) acres and an interest in approximately 33 gross (10.4 net) productive wells.




	        The
	net purchase price to our interest for the Crimson assets was approximately $2.5 million following allowances, post-closing adjustments and Providence's acquisition from us of
	its 50% interest in the Crimson assets. We paid the purchase price for the Crimson assets using a draw on our supplemental line of credit.






	Morning Gun Assets Acquisition





	        On April 3, 2017, we completed the acquisition of the Morning Gun assets. Simultaneous with the closing of the acquisition, Providence
	acquired 50% of our interest in the Morning Gun assets. The Morning Gun assets include oil and gas leases covering approximately 5,874 gross (1,482 net) acres located in Adams and Weld Counties,
	Colorado. Morning Gun reserved to itself all rights that exist below 50 feet above the top of the uppermost J Sand formation for any leases or lands located in Township 7 North, Range 63 West in Weld
	County, Colorado.




	        The
	net purchase price to our interest for the Morning Gun assets was approximately $1.3 million. We paid 20% of our net purchase price, or $258,250, as a deposit at the time of
	executing the purchase agreement. At closing, we paid $810,000 of the purchase price through the issuance to Morning Gun of 450,000 shares of our common stock, valued at $1.80 per share, and the
	remainder of $216,339 in cash.

	Undeveloped
	acreage includes leasehold interests on which wells have not been drilled or completed to the point that would permit the production of commercial
	quantities of oil and natural gas regardless of whether the leasehold interest is classified as containing proved reserves.






	        Following
	industry standards, we generally acquire oil and gas leases without warranty of title, except as to claims made by, through, or under the transferor. Accordingly, we conduct
	due diligence as to title prior to acquiring properties, but we cannot guarantee that there will not be losses resulting from title defects. We believe the title to our properties is good and
	defensible in accordance with industry standards, subject to such exceptions that, in our opinion, are not so material as to detract from the use or value of our properties. Title to our properties
	generally carries encumbrances, such as royalties, overriding royalties, contractual obligations, liens, easements, and other matters that commonly affect real property, all of which are customary in
	the oil and gas industry. We intend to acquire additional leases by lease sale, farm-in, or purchase.




	        A
	majority of our Buck Peak leaseholds are held under "paid-up" fee leases and a majority of our Wattenberg Field leaseholds are held by production. Leases that are held by production
	generally remain in force so long as oil or gas is produced from the well on the particular lease. Leased acres that are not held by production may require annual rental payments to maintain the lease
	until the expiration of the lease or the time oil or gas is produced from one or more wells drilled on the leased acreage. At the time oil or gas is produced from wells drilled on the leased acreage,
	the lease is considered to be held by production. Unless production is established within the area covering our undeveloped acreage, the leases for such acreage eventually will expire. Our leases not
	held by production are scheduled to expire, including potential extensions, from 2017 until 2021. If our leases expire in an area we intend to explore, we or our working interest partners will have to
	negotiate the price and terms of lease renewals with the lessors. The cost to renew such leases may increase significantly and we may not be able to renew the lease on commercially reasonable terms,
	or at all.




	        The
	following table shows the calendar years during which our leases not currently held by production will expire unless a productive oil or gas well is drilled:

	Oil Natural Gas and NGL Data







	Proved Reserves








	Estimation of Proved Reserves





	        Under SEC rules, proved reserves are those quantities of oil, natural gas and NGL, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be
	estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically produciblefrom a given date forward, from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government
	regulationsprior
	to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably

	Table of Contents





	certain,
	regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. If deterministic methods are used, the SEC has defined reasonable certainty for proved reserves as a
	"high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered." All of our proved reserves as of December 31, 2016 (we had no proved reserves as of December 31, 2015) were estimated
	using a deterministic method. The estimation of reserves involves two distinct determinations. The first determination results in the estimation of the quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas
	and the second determination results in the estimation of the uncertainty associated with those estimated quantities in accordance with the definitions established under SEC rules. The process of
	estimating the quantities of recoverable oil, natural gas and NGL reserves relies on the use of certain generally accepted analytical procedures. These analytical procedures fall into four broad
	categories or methods: (1) production performance-based methods; (2) material balance-based methods; (3) volumetric-based methods; and (4) analogy. These methods may be
	used singularly or in combination by the reserve evaluator in the process of estimating the quantities of reserves. Reserves for proved developed producing wells were estimated using production
	performance methods for the vast majority of properties. Certain new producing properties with very little production history were forecast using a combination of production performance and analogy to
	similar production, both of which are considered to provide a relatively high degree of accuracy. Non-producing reserve estimates, for developed and undeveloped properties, were forecast using either
	volumetric or analogy methods, or a combination of both. These methods provide a relatively high degree of accuracy for predicting proved developed non-producing and proved undeveloped reserves for
	our properties, due to the mature nature of the properties targeted for development and an abundance of subsurface control data.




	        To
	estimate economically recoverable proved reserves and related future net cash flows, Cawley Gillespie & Associates, Inc. ("Cawley Gillespie") considered many factors and
	assumptions, including the use of reservoir parameters derived from geological and engineering data which cannot be measured directly, economic criteria based on current costs and the SEC pricing
	requirements and forecasts of future production rates.




	        Under
	SEC rules, reasonable certainty can be established using techniques that have been proven effective by actual production from projects in the same reservoir or an analogous
	reservoir or by other evidence using reliable technology that establishes reasonable certainty. Reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational methods) that has
	been field-tested and has been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. To establish
	reasonable certainty with respect to our estimated proved reserves, the technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our proved reserves have been demonstrated to yield results with
	consistency and repeatability, and include production and well test data, downhole completion information, geologic data, electrical logs, radioactivity logs, core analyses, historical well cost and
	operating expense data.

	        At
	December 31, 2016, we had estimated total proved reserves of 6,307.8 MBOE, consisting of 2,761.2 MBbls of crude oil, 11,492.9 MMcf of natural gas, and 1,631.2 MBbls of natural
	gas liquids. Our proved reserves include only those amounts that we reasonably expect to recover in the future from known oil and gas reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions, at
	current prices and costs, under existing regulatory practices, and with existing technology and anticipated capital resources. Accordingly, any changes in prices, operating and development costs,
	regulations, technology, or other factors could significantly increase or decrease estimates of our proved reserves. Estimates of volumes
	of proved reserves are presented in MBbls for crude oil and MMcf for natural gas at the official temperature and pressure bases of the areas in which the gas reserves are located.






	Proved Undeveloped Reserves





	        At December 31, 2016, we had 5,568 MBOE of proved undeveloped reserves. We have included in our proved undeveloped reserves only those
	locations for which we have established a development plan and believe we can drill and complete within five years of the date of the reserve report considering our existing and anticipated capital
	resources. We also have included certain non-operated properties the operator of which has informed of us of planned development within the next five years and in which we have plans to participate.
	Our approximately 5,568 MBOE of estimated proved undeveloped reserves will require an estimated $37.7 million of development capital over the next five years to convert to proved developed
	reserves.




	        As
	of December 31, 2016, no proved undeveloped reserves had been converted into proved developed reserves. In 2017, we plan to convert approximately 1,888 MBOE of proved
	undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves through our 14-well Shook pad on which we commenced drilling in April 2017 and the completion of the wells on the Jacobucci pad, in which we are
	participating.






	Independent Reserve Engineers





	        Our proved reserves estimate as of December 31, 2016 shown herein has been independently prepared by Cawley Gillespie, which was founded
	in 1961 and performs consulting petroleum engineering services under Texas Board of Professional Engineers Registration No. F-693. Zane Meekins was the technical person within Cawley Gillespie
	primarily responsible for preparing the estimates shown herein. Mr. Meekins has been practicing consulting petroleum engineering at Cawley Gillespie since 1989. Mr. Meekins is a
	Registered Professional Engineer in the State of Texas (License No. 71055) and has approximately 30 years of practical experience in petroleum engineering, with approximately
	28 years in the estimation and evaluation of reserves. He graduated from Texas A&M University in 1987 with a B.S. in Petroleum Engineering. Mr. Meekins meets or exceeds the education,
	training, and experience requirements set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers.






	Internal Controls Over Reserve Estimation Process





	        Our President, Frederick J. Witsell, and our Chief Operating Officer, William B. Lloyd, work closely with our independent reserve engineers to
	ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of data furnished to our independent reserve engineers in their reserves estimation process and are the technical persons within our company primarily
	responsible for overseeing the preparation of our reserves estimates. Each of Mr. Witsell and Mr. Lloyd has over 36 years of industry experience. Both have evaluated numerous
	properties throughout the United States with an emphasis on Colorado oil and natural gas production, as well as conventional and unconventional reservoirs, operations, reservoir development and
	property evaluation. Mr. Witsell holds a B.S. in Geology, an M.B.A. in Energy Management, and is an active member in the Society of Petroleum Engineers, American Association of Petroleum
	Geologists, and the Rocky Mountain Association of Geologists. Mr. Lloyd holds a B.S. in Petroleum Engineering.

	Table of Contents





	        During
	relevant time periods, Mr. Witsell and Mr. Lloyd meet with representatives of our independent reserve engineers to review properties and discuss methods and
	assumptions used in preparation of the proved reserves estimates. We do not have a formal committee specifically designated to review our reserve reporting and our reserves estimation process. A
	preliminary copy of the reserve report was reviewed by Mr. Witsell with representatives of our independent reserve engineers and internal technical staff.






	Regulatory Environment





	        The production and sale of oil and gas is subject to various federal, state, and local governmental regulations, which may be changed from time
	to time in response to economic or political conditions. Matters subject to regulation include discharge permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds, reports concerning operations, the spacing of
	wells, noise, unitization and pooling of properties, setbacks, taxation and environmental protection. Many laws and regulations govern the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells,
	the plugging and abandoning of wells, the restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, temporary storage tank operations, air emissions from flaring, compression, the construction and use
	of access roads, and the disposal of fluids used in connection with operations. From time to time, regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate
	of flow of oil and gas wells below actual production
	capacity in order to conserve supplies of oil and gas. Changes in these regulations could have a material adverse effect on our company.




	        The
	failure to comply with any such laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties. In addition, the effect of all these laws and regulations may limit the amount of oil and
	gas we can produce from our wells and may limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill. Although we believe we are in substantial compliance with current applicable laws and
	regulations relating to our oil and natural gas operations, we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such laws and regulations because such laws and regulations are
	frequently amended or reinterpreted.




	        As
	an oil and gas operator, we are responsible for obtaining all permits and government permission necessary to drill the wells and develop our interests. We must obtain permits for any
	new well sites and wells that are drilled.




	        In
	February 2013, the COGCC passed extensive rule changes providing perhaps the most stringent oil and gas regulations in the country, including statewide requirements, commonly known as
	setbacks, from wells and production facilities, to various structures.




	        In
	February 2014, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment's Air Quality Control Commission, or AQCC, finalized regulations imposing stringent new requirements relating
	to air emissions from oil and gas facilities in Colorado. The new rules impose significantly more stringent control, monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements than those required under
	comparable federal rules. In addition, as part of the rule, the AQCC approved the direct regulation of hydrocarbon (i.e., methane) emissions from the Colorado oil and gas sector.




	        On
	January 25, 2016, the COGCC approved new rules enhancing local government participation in locating and planning for large scale oil and gas operations. The COGCC defined large
	scale facilities as (i) any location that proposes eight new horizontal, directional, or vertical wells, or (ii) cumulative hydrocarbon storage capacity of 4,000 Bbls or more, which are
	located within an urban mitigation area as defined by COGCC rules. The new COGCC rules also include additional notice and consultation requirements for operators when planning such large scale
	facilities. We do not believe that these new large scale facilities regulations impacted us during the year ended December 31, 2016 because our current well sites do not meet the definitions of
	large scale facilities and we did not have more than eight wells or storage capacity of greater than 4,000 Bbls prior to the end of the current fiscal year.

	        In
	March 2017, the Colorado Court of Appeals held that Colorado oil and gas regulations require the COGCC to grant permits for new oil wells on the condition that requisite levels of
	environmental and public safety are met based on a determination by an independent third party. The Court of Appeals' holding invalidates the COGCC's prior balancing inquiry, which weighed interests
	in oil and gas development against environmental and public safety factors. The case has been remanded to the lower court for further findings. It remains unclear what impact this holding will have on
	the oil and gas industry.




	        In
	April 2017, a house in Weld County, Colorado experienced an explosion and fire, killing two occupants. The cause of the explosion was determined to be natural gas that had seeped from
	a severed 1-inch flowline into French drains and a sump pit near the house. The flowline was connected to a nearby vertical wellbore that recently had been placed back in service. In response, on
	May 2, 2017, pursuant to an order by Governor Hickenlooper, the COGCC issued a Notice to Operators (NTO) requiring all oil and gas operators in Colorado to systematically inspect their
	inventory of pipelines and conduits for natural gas, oil, condensate, or other liquid or gaseous hydrocarbons (flowlines), to verify that any pipeline or flowline not in active use is properly
	abandoned pursuant to COGCC rules. By May 30, 2017, we are required to inspect all pipelines and flowlines that are located within 1,000 feet of certain buildings, and provide to the COGCC
	certain information relating to the well, tank batteries, and flowlines. In addition, we are required to inspect all abandoned pipelines and flowlines, without regard to their distance from any
	building, to verify such pipelines and flowlines were abandoned in accordance with COGCC rules. By June 30, 2017, we are required to pressure test all flowlines within 1,000 feet of certain
	building units and ensure and document that these lines have integrity. We also are required to abandon all pipelines and flowlines, regardless of distance from buildings, not in active use not later
	than June 30, 2017.






	Hydraulic Fracturing





	        We operate primarily in the Wattenberg Field of the DJ Basin where the rock formations are typically tight, and it is a common practice to
	utilize hydraulic fracturing to allow for or increase hydrocarbon production. Hydraulic fracturing involves the process of injecting substances such as water, sand and additives (some proprietary)
	under pressure into a targeted subsurface formation to create pores and fractures, thus creating a passageway for the release of oil and gas. Hydraulic fracturing is a technique that we likely will
	employ extensively in future wells that we may drill and complete.




	        We
	expect to outsource all hydraulic fracturing services to service providers with significant experience, and which we deem to be competent and responsible. Our service providers supply
	all personnel, equipment, and materials needed to perform each stimulation, including the chemical mixtures that might be injected into our wells. We require our service companies to carry insurance
	covering incidents that could occur in connection with their activities. In addition to the drilling permit that we are required to obtain and the notice of intent that we provide the appropriate
	regulatory authorities, our service providers are responsible for obtaining any regulatory permits necessary for them to perform their services in the relevant geographic location. We have not had any
	incidents, citations, or
	lawsuits relating to any environmental issues resulting from hydraulic fracturing, and we are not presently aware of any such matters.




	        In
	recent years, environmental opposition to hydraulic fracturing has increased, and various governmental and regulatory authorities have adopted or are considering new requirements for
	this process. To the extent that these requirements increase our costs or restrict our development activities, our business and prospects may be adversely affected.




	        The
	EPA has asserted that the Safe Drinking Water Act ("SDWA") applies to hydraulic fracturing involving diesel fuel, and in February 2014, it issued final guidance on this subject. The
	guidance defines the term "diesel fuel," describes the permitting requirements that apply under SDWA for the




	59











	Table of Contents





	underground
	injection of diesel fuel in hydraulic fracturing, and makes recommendations for permit writers. Although the guidance applies only in those states, excluding Colorado, where the EPA
	directly implements the Underground Injection Control Class II program, it could encourage state regulatory authorities to adopt permitting and other requirements for hydraulic fracturing. In
	addition, from time to time, Congress has considered legislation that would provide for broader federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA. If such legislation were enacted, hydraulic
	fracturing operations could be required to meet additional federal permitting and financial assurance requirements, adhere to certain construction specifications, fulfill monitoring, reporting, and
	recordkeeping obligations, and provide for additional public disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process.




	        The
	EPA is also conducting a nationwide study into the effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water. In June 2015, the EPA released a draft assessment of the potential impacts to
	drinking water resources from hydraulic fracturing for public comment and peer review. The assessment concluded that while there are mechanisms by which hydraulic fracturing can impact drinking water
	resources, there was no evidence that these mechanisms have led to widespread, systemic impacts on drinking water resources in the United States. The EPA's science advisory board subsequently
	questioned several elements and conclusions in the EPA's draft assessment. In December 2016, the EPA released the final report on impacts from hydraulic fracturing activities on drinking water,
	concluding that hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources under some circumstances and identified some factors that could influence these impacts.




	        Federal
	agencies have also adopted or are considering additional regulation of hydraulic fracturing. On March 26, 2016, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration
	("OSHA") issued a final rule, with effective dates of 2018 and 2021 for the hydraulic fracturing industry, which imposes stricter standards for worker exposure to silica, including worker exposure to
	sand in hydraulic fracturing. In May 2014, the EPA issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking under the Toxic Substances
	Control Act ("TSCA") to obtain data on chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing. In March 2015, the Bureau of Land Management ("BLM") issued a new rule regulating hydraulic
	fracturing activities involving federal and tribal lands and minerals, including requirements for chemical disclosure, wellbore integrity and handling of flowback and produced water.




	        In
	Colorado, the primary regulator is the COGCC, which has adopted regulations regarding chemical disclosure, pressure monitoring, prior agency notice, emission reduction practices, and
	offset well setbacks with respect to hydraulic fracturing operations and may in the future adopt additional requirements for this purpose. As part of these requirements, operators must report all
	chemicals used in hydraulically fracturing a well to a publicly searchable registry website developed and maintained by the Ground Water Protection Council and the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact
	Commission.




	        Apart
	from these ongoing federal and state initiatives, local governments are adopting new requirements and restrictions on hydraulic fracturing and other oil and gas operations. Some
	local governments in Colorado, for instance, have amended their land use regulations to impose new requirements on oil and gas development, while other local governments have entered memoranda of
	agreement with oil and gas producers to accomplish the same objective. Beyond that, during the past few years, a total of five Colorado cities have passed voter initiatives temporarily or permanently
	prohibiting hydraulic fracturing. Since that time, however, local district courts have struck down the ordinances for certain of those Colorado cities, and such decisions were upheld by the Colorado
	Supreme Court in May 2016. Nevertheless, there is a continued risk that cities will adopt local ordinances that seek to regulate the time, place, and manner of hydraulic fracturing activities and oil
	and gas operations within their respective jurisdictions.




	        During
	2014, opponents of hydraulic fracturing also sought statewide ballot initiatives that would have restricted oil and gas development in Colorado by, among other things,
	significantly increasing the setback between oil and natural gas wells and occupied buildings. These initiatives were withdrawn




	60











	Table of Contents





	from
	the November 2014 ballot in return for the creation of a task force to craft recommendations for minimizing land use conflicts over the location of oil and natural gas facilities.




	        During
	2016, opponents of hydraulic fracturing again advanced various options for ballot initiatives restricting oil and gas development in Colorado. Proponents of two such initiatives
	attempted to qualify the initiatives to appear on the ballot for the November 2016 election. One would have amended the Colorado constitution to impose a minimum distance of 2,500 feet between wells
	and any occupied structures or "areas of special concern." If implemented, this proposal would have made the vast
	majority of the surface area of the state ineligible for drilling, including substantially all of our planned future drilling locations. The second proposal would have amended the state constitution
	to give local governmental authorities the ability to regulate, or to ban, oil and gas exploration, development, and production activities within their boundaries notwithstanding state rules and
	approvals to the contrary. If implemented, this proposal could have resulted in us becoming subject to onerous, and possibly inconsistent, regulations that vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, or
	to outright bans on our activities in various jurisdictions. In August 2016, the Colorado Secretary of State issued a press release and statements of insufficiency of signatures, stating that the
	proponents of the proposals had failed to collect enough valid signatures to have the proposals included on the ballot. However, similar proposals may be made in the future. Because all of our
	operations and reserves are located in Colorado, the risks we face with respect to such future proposals are greater than those of our competitors with more geographically diverse operations. Although
	we cannot predict the outcome of future ballot initiatives, statutes, or regulatory developments, such developments could materially impact our results of operations, production, and reserves.






	Adams County USR Process





	        On March 22, 2016, the Adams County Board of County Commissioners approved amendments to the county's oil and gas regulatory process,
	which ended a temporary drilling moratorium previously imposed. The new regulations include an enhanced administrative review process for operators that share a Memorandum of Understanding, or MOU,
	with Adams County, including a site-specific review of any oil and gas permit application. The regulations also require compliance with the USR approval process for oil and gas facilities governed by
	an MOU between the operator and Adams County. This approval process includes increased notice and submittal requirements. The USR process is designed to consist of a six-week administrative review of
	the application by the county and appropriate agencies. The application can be approved, approved with conditions, denied or referred to the Board of County Commissioners for a public hearing. If
	denied, the applicant can appeal to the Board of County Commissioners.




	        In
	March 2016, we submitted a USR application for our Shook pad to Adams County, which was approved by the county in September 2016. The above newly-enacted regulations in Adams County
	and any additional regulations that may result in the future may delay or prevent our drilling activities and increase our costs of development and production and limit the quantity of oil and gas
	that we can economically produce.






	Joint Operating Agreements





	        We are registered with the COGCC as an operator of oil and natural gas wells and properties in the State of Colorado and have posted the
	appropriate bonds to support our activities. We have entered into operating agreements with our working interest partners that stipulate, among other things, that each partner is responsible for
	paying its proportionate share of costs and expenses in connection with the wells we operate. As operator, we are an independent contractor not subject to the control or direction of our other working
	interest partners except as to the type of operation to be undertaken as provided in the operating agreement. Further, we are responsible for hiring employees or contractors to conduct operations,
	taking custody of funds for the account of all working interest




	61











	Table of Contents





	partners,
	keeping books and records relating to operations, and filing operational notices, reports or applications required to be filed with governmental bodies having jurisdiction over operations.
	Our liability to the other working interest partners for losses sustained or liabilities incurred are limited to losses incurred as a result of our gross negligence or willful misconduct.








	Competition





	        We encounter significant competition from numerous other oil and gas companies in all areas of operations, including drilling and marketing oil
	and natural gas; obtaining desirable oil and natural gas leases; obtaining drilling, pumping and other services; attracting and retaining qualified employees; and obtaining capital. International
	developments may influence other companies to increase their domestic crude oil and natural gas exploration. Competition among companies for favorable prospects can be expected to continue and we
	anticipate that the cost of acquiring properties will increase in the future. Most of our competitors possess larger staffs and greater financial resources than we do, which may enable them to
	identify and acquire desirable producing properties and drilling prospects more economically. Our ability to acquire additional properties and to explore for oil and natural gas prospects in the
	future depends upon our ability to conduct our operations, evaluate and select suitable properties, and consummate transactions in this highly competitive environment.




	        The
	oil and gas industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements and introduction of new products and services using new technologies. If one or more of the
	technologies
	we use now or in the future become obsolete or if we are unable to use the most advanced commercially available technology, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows
	could be materially adversely affected.






	Market for Our Products





	        Currently, all of our produced oil and gas is sold under a variety of month to month contracts with local marketing companies. We have no
	long-term marketing contract commitments at this time. The oil produced from our Wattenberg Field properties, including the PDC and Crimson assets, is sold at spot prices to third-parties, minus a
	discount from the current WTI price.




	        The
	availability of a ready market for our oil and gas depends upon numerous factors beyond our control, including the extent of domestic production and importation of oil and gas, the
	relative status of the domestic and international economies, the proximity of our properties to gas pipeline systems, the capacity of those systems, the marketing of other competitive fuels,
	fluctuations in seasonal demand, and governmental regulation of production, refining, transportation, and pricing of oil, gas, and other fuels.









	Employees





	        We currently have ten employees, including our Chief Executive Officer, President, and Chief Operating Officer. Our Chief Financial Officer
	serves in his role as an independent contractor. We also engage a number of other independent contractors and consultants to supplement the services of our employees, including land services, geologic
	mapping, reservoir and facilities engineers, drilling contractors, attorneys, and accountants.






	Company Facilities





	        Our executive and administrative offices are currently located at 9635 Maroon Circle, Suite 400, Englewood, Colorado 80112, where
	we lease approximately 5,282 square feet at a rate of $10,564 per month.









	Legal Proceedings





	        From time to time, we may become involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of our operations in the normal course of business. No
	legal proceedings, government actions, administrative actions, investigations, or claims are currently pending against us or our officers and directors in which we are adverse.

	MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

	OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS








	Overview





	        The following discussion summarizes our plan of operation for the next 12 months and the related anticipated capital expenditures. It
	also analyzes (i) our financial condition at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 and compares it to December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively and (ii) our results of
	operations for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 and the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with
	the financial statements and related notes included in this prospectus and with the understanding that the actual future results may be materially different from what we currently expect.




	        We
	were organized on September 4, 2012 under the laws of the State of Colorado to investigate, acquire and develop crude oil and natural gas properties in the Rocky Mountain and
	mid-continent region of the United States. Following the acquisition of the PDC, Crimson and Morning Gun assets and our participation in several drilling programs as a non-operator, we have an
	interest in 80 gross (26.4 net) oil and gas wells located in the DJ Basin. After assignment to our working interest partners, we have approximately 352 net acres in our Buck Peak prospect and 9,577
	net acres in the DJ Basin, which we are in the process of developing.




	        As
	an oil and natural gas exploration and production company, our revenue, results of operation, cash flow from operations, reserve values, access to capital and future rate of growth
	are influenced by the prevailing prices of oil and natural gas. Changes in prices can affect, both positively and negatively, our financial condition, liquidity, ability to obtain financing, operating
	results, and the amount of oil and natural gas that we choose to produce. Prevailing prices for such commodities fluctuate in response to changes in supply and demand and a variety of additional
	factors beyond our control, such as global, political and economic conditions. Inherently, the price received for oil and natural gas production is unpredictable, and such volatility is expected. All
	of our production is sold at market prices and, therefore, the amount of revenue that we realize, as well as our estimates of future revenues, is to a large extent determined by factors beyond our
	control. To date we have not entered into hedging arrangements with respect to any of our future production, but we may choose to do so in the future.




	        Under
	the terms of the participation agreements covering our prospects and operating agreements with other third party operators, we are required to pay our proportionate share of the
	costs of any wells in which we participate. In exchange, we are entitled to a proportionate share of the revenue, net of related expenses.




	        We
	cannot fully determine what impact the volatility in crude oil and natural gas prices may have on our ongoing and future operations if such volatility continues into the future. Our
	decision on whether to drill and complete wells is based on both the prevailing commodity prices and the cost to drill such wells. Our ability to acquire financing and/or properties, drill wells,
	identify working interest and/or industry partners may all be negatively impacted by downward fluctuations in the price of oil and gas.






	Revision of Prior Period Financial Statements





	        In connection with the preparation of our condensed financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, we identified an error
	related to the manner in which we accounted for the fair value of convertible promissory notes and warrants issued in our private placement during
	December 2016. On the balance sheet at December 31, 2016, we recorded the face value of convertible notes payable issued in connection with the private placement under liabilities, discounted
	by (i) the value of the original issue discount and (ii) the value of the warrants issued to the placement agent. We did not,




	63











	Table of Contents





	however,
	discount the value of the convertible notes payable by the fair value of the warrants issued to individual investors as part of the units sold in the private placement.

	accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 99, Materiality, and SAB No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying
	Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements, we evaluated the error and determined that the related impact was not material to our results of operations or financial position for any prior
	annual or interim period. Accordingly, we corrected these errors for the year ended December 31, 2016 by revising the condensed financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2017
	and making conforming adjustments to our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016 that are presented in this prospectus. For additional information, please see Note 3 to
	the financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 and Note 16 to the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016 included in this prospectus.






	Going Concern





	        As described in the notes to our unaudited interim financial statements, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going
	concern. This uncertainty is based on our substantial near-term liabilities, limited revenue and negative working capital, among other things which existed as of March 31, 2017. We are
	dependent on obtaining funding from operations and the sale of debt or equity to continue as a going concern. Our plan of operations, as set forth below, is subject to our obtaining adequate working
	capital, of which there can be no assurance.




	        At
	March 31, 2017, we had a cash balance of approximately $4.9 million and other current assets of approximately $3.2 million. Subsequent to March 31, 2017,
	our cash balance has decreased significantly as we have paid certain acquisition and development costs, including costs previously accrued, and general and administrative expenses. In June 2017, we
	are obligated to repay approximately $3.6 million in principal and approximately $250,000 in accrued interest to satisfy the terms of our supplemental line of credit, and approximately $500,000
	accrued interest payment on our initial line of credit, and an approximately $500,000 accrued interest payment on our outstanding convertible promissory notes. We also will incur additional expenses
	related to our recently commenced operated drilling program on our
	Shook pad during the second and third quarters of this year. We had net losses of approximately $2.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and $4.5 million during
	the year ended December 31, 2016.




	        Our
	ability to continue as a going concern depends on the success of our current drilling efforts, future exploration and development efforts, and our ability to generate revenue
	sufficient to cover our costs and expenses. In the event we are unable to obtain adequate funding from our ongoing drilling efforts, both operated and non-operated, and through the sale of debt or
	equity securities, we may have to delay, reduce or eliminate certain of our planned operations, reduce overall overhead expense, or divest assets. This in turn may have an adverse effect on our
	ability to realize the value of our assets.






	Plan of Operation and Expected Capital Expenditures





	        Our plan of operation for the next 12 months includes: (i) continuing the development of our operated drilling programs, including
	on the Shook, Corcillius and Brighton Lakes pads in the Southern Core, (ii) participating as a non-operator in drilling projects operated, or to be operated, by third-parties,
	(iii) identifying other lease and asset acquisitions in and around the Southern Core, (iv) managing the wells we purchased from PDC and Crimson, and (v) monitoring activity near
	our Buck Peak prospect. Our plan of operation is contingent upon our obtaining adequate working capital from operations and proceeds from this offering. Our goal is to become a leading independent
	producer of crude oil and natural gas and liquids in the Wattenberg Field.




	        We
	plan to use the net proceeds from this offering, along with cash on hand and cash flow from operations, including from our non-operated wells, and equity and debt financings as
	necessary, to

	embark
	on an aggressive drilling program to convert our undeveloped leasehold position to production, cash flow and reserves. Through June 30, 2018, we plan to spend approximately
	$38.7 million to drill 10.2 net operated horizontal wells and approximately $5.8 million to participate in the drilling of 1.3 net non-operated wells in the Southern Core. We also have
	budgeted approximately $4.6 million for additional completion costs relating to the recently completed 14 gross (2.5 net) Jacobucci pad wells in which we are participating as a non-operator and
	$4.1 million for additional leasehold acquisitions and working capital.

	Todd Creek FarmsOperated Activity





	        We have obtained permits for 22 operated wells on our Todd Creek Farms acreage. After setting surface casing in April 2017, we began horizontal
	lateral drilling operations of all 14 Shook pad wells in May 2017, on which we have permitted 6 Codell wells and 8 wells targeting all three benches of the Niobrara. Our working interest in the Shook
	pad wells averages approximately 45%. Our second operated pad is expected to be the Corcillius pad, on which we have permitted 8 wells targeting the Codell and Niobrara formations. However, we do not
	expect to begin any drilling operations on the Corcillius pad until early 2018.




	        Under
	our operated capital plan through June 30, 2018, we plan to drill and complete 14 gross (6.3 net) operated horizontal wells on our Shook pad and 7 gross (3.1 net) operated
	horizontal wells on our Corcillius pad, for a total capital expenditure of approximately $34 million.

	Table of Contents







	South BrightonOperated Activity





	        We anticipate that our first operated drilling program at South Brighton will be the Brighton Lakes pad on which we have an application pending
	for 8 extended-range lateral wells. We expect the pad to consist of up to 3 Codell wells and 5 Niobrara wells. Our working interest in the
	proposed Brighton Lakes pad wells averages approximately 26%. We expect to begin drilling operations on the Brighton Lakes pad by the first quarter of 2018. Under our operated capital plan through
	June 30, 2018, we plan to drill and complete 3 gross (0.8 net) operated horizontal wells on our Brighton Lakes pad, for a total capital expenditure of $4.4 million.






	Todd Creek FarmsNon-Operated Activity





	        During 2016 and the first quarter of 2017, we participated in the drilling and completion of 17 gross (2.9 net) horizontal wells in Todd Creek
	Farms. All of these wells are operated by companies with an established track record in the Wattenberg Field, including PDC, Great Western, and Ward. In addition to the aforementioned wells, we have
	been informed that Great Western and Ward plan to collectively drill up to 12 additional gross wells on pads in Todd Creek Farms over the next 12 to 14 months. While as a non-operator we are
	unable to control whether and when these additional wells will be drilled and completed, we have allocated a total capital cost of $5.8 million for an additional 1.3 wells net to our interest.




	        The
	PDC Jacobucci pad, where we have working interests ranging from 8% to 27%, is currently on production and flowing back into the sales pipeline. The Jacobucci pad is comprised of 14
	mid-range horizontal wells, including 6 Codell wells, 3 Niobrara B wells, and 5 Niobrara C wells. In the same area, we participated in 2 extended-range lateral wells that are operated by Great Western
	on its Marcus pad, targeting the two separate benches in the Niobrara, with an approximately 15% working interest in each well. The Marcus pad wells had 120-day average daily production rates of 639
	and 645 gross BOE/D per well, respectively. We also participated in one standard-range lateral Codell well with an approximately 11% working interest operated by Ward on its Riverdale pad, which had a
	90-day average daily production rate of 542 gross BOE/D.






	South BrightonNon-Operated Activity





	        We have not participated in any non-operated wells in South Brighton; however, industry activity has picked up and we expect to receive notice
	to participate in wells from operators on our acreage over the next 12 months. Each of Great Western, Edge Petroleum, Ward, and HRM Resources has acreage offsetting our South Brighton acreage.
	Edge Petroleum has permitted 10 standard-range lateral wells in South Brighton in which we have a 25% working interest; however, Edge Petroleum has not submitted an authorization for expenditure on
	these wells and they may or may not be drilled by June 30, 2018.






	Runway





	        A number of public and private company operators are developing acreage near our position and we plan to monitor these operators' results. We
	believe this area to have extensive hydrocarbon saturation in tight sand reservoirs. At this time, we do not plan on allocating any capital to this area over the next 12 months; however, we
	will monitor nearby activity and may increase allocated capital to our Runway prospect if we feel the risk-adjusted returns on capital meet internal return targets.






	Northern Wattenberg Field





	        At this time, we do not plan on allocating any capital to our northern Wattenberg Field prospect over the next 12 months; however, we
	will monitor activity and may allocate capital in in the northern Wattenberg Field if we determine the risk-adjusted returns on capital meet internal return targets.

	Buck Peak





	        As of March 31, 2017, we had generated only nominal revenue related to the sale of oil from Buck Peak. Management has determined that
	further exploration at Buck Peak is currently uneconomic due to the downturn in oil prices over the past two years and the nominal production rate of the initial two wells. We intend to continue
	monitoring oil prices, as well as other development in the area, to determine further activities in that area.

	        Overview:




	    For the three months ended March 31, 2017, we realized a net loss of $2,139,139, or $0.10 per share, compared to
	a net loss of
	$722,806, or $0.03 per share, for the three months ended March 31, 2016. We realized our first significant revenue in the first quarter of 2017. Despite this, our loss for the first quarter of
	2017 increased $1,416,333 primarily from an increase in our general and administrative expenses, including a substantial increase in share-based compensation, an increase in




	67











	Table of Contents





	lease
	operating expenses, and an increase in depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion expenses due to our participation in a drilling program that commenced in mid-2016. We expect to
	continue operating at a loss until such time as the anticipated cash flow from the wells in which we have an interest is sufficient to cover operating, general and administrative and other expenses;
	however, we believe that our cash flow from our operated properties is currently sufficient to cover all of our recurring general and administrative expenses.






	        Revenues:




	    Crude oil, natural gas and NGL sales revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2017 increased $1,461,385 from
	$nil for the three
	months ended March 31, 2016, as described in "Volumes and Prices" below. All of the revenue that we reported in 2017 came from the sale of oil, natural gas and NGLs produced from the vertical
	wells that we acquired during the prior year, as well as horizontal wells placed in service during the first quarter 2017 in which we participated as a non-operator.






	        Volumes and Prices:




	    Crude oil, natural gas and NGL sales volumes for the three months ended March 31, 2017 increased
	39,928.4 BOE. We did not
	sell any crude oil, natural gas or NGLs during the same period in 2016. The oil, natural gas and NGL sales volumes for the three months ended March 31, 2017 were the result of production from
	wells acquired during the prior year, three non-operated wells completed in the fourth quarter of 2016, and 14 non-operated wells that were put on production in the first quarter of 2017. For the
	three months ended March 31, 2017, our average oil sales price was $41.75 per Bbl; our average natural gas sales price was $3.79 per Mcf; and our average NGLs sales price was $21.76 per Bbl.
	Our overall average price for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $36.60 per BOE.

	        Total
	operating expense increased $421,473, for the three months ended March 31, 2017, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016, primarily due to a relative
	lack of production in the first quarter of 2016 and wells completed during the three months ended March 31, 2017.




	        Lease
	operating costs per BOE were $5.70 and $nil for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As a percent of crude oil, natural gas and NGL sales revenue,
	routine LOE was 16% and nil% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.




	        Production
	taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2017 amounted to $189,962 as compared to $1,442 for the three months ended March 31, 2016, primarily due to production
	from the wells acquired during the second half of the year ended December 31, 2016 and wells placed on-line in the first quarter of 2017.




	        Overall
	operating costs (crude oil and natural gas operating costs, including production taxes) per BOE was $10.56 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to $nil for
	the three months ended March 31, 2016, primarily due to the increased volume from wells acquired during the second half of the year ended December 31, 2016, and wells placed on-line in
	the first quarter of 2017.






	        Depreciation, depletion, amortization, and accretion expense:




	    Depletion, depreciation, amortization and accretion increased
	$471,289, to $473,336 for
	the three months ended March 31, 2017, from $2,047




	68











	Table of Contents





	for
	the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase in expense was the result of increased production volumes related to wells acquired and non-operated wells coming on-line during the 2017
	period, partially offset by an increase in our reserves.






	        Interest income (expense):




	    During the three months ended March 31, 2017, we recognized interest income of $102 compared to
	$363 in the three
	months ended March 31, 2016. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, we recognized interest expense of $1,429,800 compared to $21,946 in the three months ended March 31,
	2016. The interest expense recognized in the current period primarily relates to advances on our two lines of credit and amortization of debt discounts. The amortization of the debt discount will
	continue until the convertible notes are repaid or until they mature.






	        General and administrative expenses:




	    We incurred general and administrative expenses of $1,190,084 during the three months ended
	March 31,
	2017 compared to $679,575 in the three months ended March 31, 2016, representing an increase of $510,509, or 75.1%. This increase is attributable to an increase in salary and wage expenses to
	$548,750 from $134,250 related to the payment of bonuses and the addition of new employees, as well as increased legal and accounting fees, board of director fees, filing fees and investor relations
	expense associated with being a public company required to file reports with the SEC.

	        Overview:




	    For the year ended December 31, 2016, we realized a net loss of $4,481,272, or $0.21 per share, compared to a net
	loss of
	$1,523,375, or $0.09 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in net loss of $2,957,897 for the year ended December 31, 2016 resulted primarily from an increase in
	our general and administrative expenses, including a substantial increase in share-based compensation, an increase in lease operating expenses, and an increase in depreciation, depletion, amortization
	and accretion expenses, partially offset by a decrease in our impairment loss.






	        Revenue:




	    Crude oil and natural gas sales revenue increased $331,788, for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $333,116 from
	$1,328 for the year
	ended December 31, 2015, as described in "Volumes and Prices" below. All of the revenue that we reported in 2016 came from the sale of oil, natural gas and NGLs produced from the vertical wells
	that we acquired during the year, as none of the horizontal wells in which we participated were completed and put on line in time for us to realize any revenue during 2016.

	Table of Contents







	        Volumes and Prices:




	    Crude oil and natural gas sales volumes increased 10,720 BOE for the year ended December 31, 2016
	compared to the year
	ended December 31, 2015. The oil and natural gas sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2016 were the result of production from wells acquired during the year and the completion
	of three non-operated wells that were put on production in the
	fourth quarter of 2016. In 2015, by comparison, we produced only nominal volumes of oil due to our election not to sell any volumes from the limited production in the last three quarters of the year.




	        For
	the year ended December 31, 2016, our average oil sales price was $48.91 per Bbl compared to $36.29 per Bbl for the year ended December 31, 2015, reflecting higher
	average oil prices in 2016 compared to 2015; our average natural gas sales price was $2.62 per Mcf compared to $nil for the year ended December 31, 2015; and our average NGLs sales price was
	$16.55 per Bbl compared to $nil for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease of $5.32, or 15%, per BOE from 2015 to 2016 results primarily from a change in our product sales mix to
	include natural gas and NGL at blended lower sales prices, partly offset by higher average crude oil prices during the year ended December 31, 2016.

	        Total
	operating expense increased $174,713, for the year ended December 31, 2016, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to increased lease
	operating costs ("LOE"), production taxes, and transportation expense related to the wells acquired and completed during the year ended December 31, 2016. As mentioned above, our production
	during 2015 was nominal.




	        LOE
	per BOE was $15.59 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $870.60 for the year ended December 31, 2015. As a percent of crude oil and natural gas sales
	revenue, routine LOE was 50% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to 2,399% for the year ended December 31, 2015.




	        Production
	taxes for the year ended December 31, 2016 amounted to $38,634 as compared to $(11) for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to production from the
	wells acquired during the year ended December 31, 2016 and wells placed online in the fourth quarter of 2016.




	        Overall
	operating costs (crude oil and natural gas operating costs, including production taxes) per BOE was $19.21 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $871.82 for
	the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to the increased volume from wells acquired during the year ended December 31, 2016.






	        Depreciation, depletion, amortization, and accretion expense:




	    Depletion, depreciation, amortization and accretion increased
	$81,595, to $95,516 for
	the year ended December 31, 2016, from $13,921 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in expense was the result of increased production volumes related to wells acquired and
	non-operated wells coming online during the 2016 period, partially offset by an increase in our reserves.






	        Interest income (expense):




	    During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized interest income of $573 compared to $46 in
	the year ended
	December 31, 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized interest expense of $323,170 compared to $48,602 in the year ended




	71











	Table of Contents





	December 31,
	2015, an increase of 565%. The interest expense recognized primarily in the year ended December 31, 2016 related to advances on our two lines of credit, recorded during
	2016.






	        General and administrative expenses:




	    We incurred general and administrative expenses of $4,022,969 during the year ended
	December 31, 2016
	compared to $1,265,134 in the year ended December 31, 2015, representing an increase of $2,757,835, or 218%. This increase is attributable to an increase in share-based compensation expense, to
	$1,365,388 from $191,205 in the prior year; increases in salary and wage expenses related to the payment of bonuses and the addition of new employees, to $697,583 from $498,000, and legal and
	accounting fees, board of director fees, filing fees and investor relations expense associated with being a public company required to file reports with the SEC, compared to more limited activity in
	the prior period as we were commencing operations. Also included in general and administrative expense during the 2016 period are costs of approximately $1.0 million incurred in connection with
	an abandoned public offering in the fourth quarter of the year.








	Liquidity and Capital Resources







	Overview





	        To date, we have generated the majority of our capital resources through the sale of debt and equity, prospect fees received from working
	interest partners, drilling advances from working interest partners, and advances under our lines of credit. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, we received $8,057,400 in proceeds
	from the sale of units consisting of convertible promissory notes and common stock purchase warrants in a private placement. To date, we have generated limited cash from operations and negative cash
	flows from operating activities.




	        On
	May 13, 2015, we entered into a revolving line of credit facility agreement, or the initial line of credit, with Providence. The initial line of credit was amended on
	February 24, 2016 to change the maturity date to June 1, 2018. Under the terms of the initial line of credit, we are permitted to borrow up to $5.0 million. Interest on the
	initial line of credit accrues at the rate of 8% per year and interest only payments are due beginning the first day of the month after we receive our first production payment from a well associated
	with the Participation Agreement with Providence and shall continue thereafter. We have fully drawn our initial line of credit with Providence and have $5.0 million of principal plus accrued
	interest of approximately $453,000 outstanding.




	        On
	October 13, 2016, we entered into the supplemental line of credit with PEP III, which permitted us to borrow up to $10.0 million to pay costs associated with our
	acquisition and development of oil and
	gas properties in the Wattenberg Field. Interest on the supplemental line accrues at the rate of 8% per year and monthly interest-only payments are due beginning upon the advancement of funds.
	Pursuant to an amendment on March 30, 2017, we repaid approximately $3.5 million in outstanding principal and agreed not to borrow additional funds against the supplemental line of
	credit in exchange for PEP III extending the maturity date. We have approximately $3.6 million plus accrued interest of approximately $237,000 outstanding against our supplemental line of
	credit, all of which is due on June 13, 2017.




	        The
	amount we invest in development, drilling, and leasing activities depends on, among other factors, opportunities presented to us, the results of drilling to date and the success of
	any fundraising efforts. The most significant of our future capital requirements, in addition to repayment of debt and payment of accounts payable and accrued liabilities, include (i) costs to
	drill or participate in additional wells; (ii) costs to acquire additional acreage that we may identify in the Southern Core area or other areas; (iii) approximately $313,000 per month
	for salaries and other corporate overhead; and (iv) legal and accounting fees associated with our status as a public company required to file reports with the SEC. We anticipate funding these
	projected capital requirements with cash on hand, revenue from operations, and proceeds from this offering.

	Recent Private Placement





	        During December 2016 and January 2017, we completed a private placement of units consisting of convertible promissory notes and warrants to
	purchase our common stock for net proceeds of approximately $9.0 million, after placement agent fees and other associated expenses. Each unit sold in the private placement is comprised of a 10%
	unsecured convertible promissory note in the face amount of $50,000 and 33,333 common stock purchase warrants. Each note is one of a series of similar notes designated the "10% Unsecured Convertible
	Promissory Notes" with the series totaling $10.0 million. The notes bear interest at the rate of 10% per year and are due and payable on December 31, 2018. Interest is payable
	semi-annually beginning June 30, 2017 and until the notes are paid in full. At any time after issuance, the principal amount of the notes and any accrued but unpaid interest are convertible
	into shares of our common stock at the option of the holder at the rate of $1.50 per share. The conversion price will be proportionately adjusted in the event of any stock splits, stock dividends or a
	capital reorganization.




	        We
	may force a conversion of the notes at any time after June 30, 2017 if and when all of the following conditions are satisfied:






	




	Shares of common stock into which the notes are convertible have been registered for sale with the SEC or are eligible for resale under
	Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended;








	




	The last sales price of our common stock on the OTCQB or other trading market equals or exceeds $3.00 for 20 out of 30 trading days and
	maintains an average daily trading volume of at least 100,000 shares per day during that time; and








	




	We have paid or pay at the time of conversion an amount that would result in the holder having received a minimum of 12 months'
	interest.






	        Each
	warrant issued in the private placement allows the holder to purchase one share of our common stock at a price of $3.00 per share at any time on or before December 31, 2019.
	The exercise price of the warrants, as well as the shares issuable upon the exercise of the warrants, is subject to adjustment in the event of any stock splits, stock dividends or a capital
	reorganization.




	        We
	have the right to redeem any or all of the outstanding and unexercised warrants at a redemption price of $0.01 per warrant in the event (i) a registration statement covering
	the shares of the common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrant has been filed with the SEC and is in effect on the date of notice and the redemption date contained therein, (ii) there
	exists a public quotation for our common stock in any electronic quotation medium, and (iii) the public trading price of our common stock has equaled or exceeded $5.00 per share for 20 out of
	30 trading days preceding the date of such notice with a volume of at least 100,000 shares per day. The holders of the warrants called for redemption shall have the right to exercise the warrants
	evidenced thereby until the close of business on the date next preceding the date fixed for redemption. On or after the date fixed for redemption, the holder of the warrants shall have no rights with
	respect to the warrant except the right to receive $0.01 per warrant upon surrender of the holder's warrant certificate




	        In
	connection with the private placement, we paid the placement agent and participating broker-dealers a total commission of $1.0 million. As additional compensation to the agent,
	we issued a placement agent warrant to purchase a total of 666,600 shares of our common stock exercisable at a price of $1.50 per share. The placement agent warrant expires on December 31,
	2021.




	        In
	connection with the private placement, we granted to the holders of the notes, warrants, and placement agent warrants the right to include the common stock issuable upon exercise or
	conversion of those securities in any registration statement we file with the SEC. The underwriters have informed us that, in their opinion, the inclusion of the shares underlying the securities in
	the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part would adversely affect their ability to market this

	Accordingly, we plan to file a new registration statement upon completion of this offering to register the underlying common stock.






	Working Capital







	March 31, 2017





	        As of March 31, 2017, we had negative working capital of $6,891,737, comprised of current assets of $8,115,500 and current liabilities of
	$15,007,237. Working capital decreased by $776,236 from December 31, 2016, primarily due to increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities related to accrued capital costs for the
	development of our oil and gas properties. Our continued decline in short-term liquidity compels us to seek additional outside financing on an expedited basis.




	        During
	the three months ended March 31, 2017, we received gross proceeds of $8,057,400, less offering costs of $805,739, from the sale of units consisting of convertible
	promissory notes and common stock purchase warrants in a private placement. This compares to gross proceeds of $95,000 from the sale of common stock during the three months ended March 31,
	2016.






	December 31, 2016





	        As of December 31, 2016, we had negative working capital of $6,115,501, comprised of current assets of $4,361,281 and current liabilities
	of $10,476,782. Working capital decreased by $9,226,990 from December 31, 2015, primarily due to advances on our lines of credit to pay for property acquisitions and increases in accounts
	payable and accrued liabilities related to accrued capital costs for the development of our oil and gas properties.




	        During
	the year ended December 31, 2016, we received gross proceeds of $2,037,600, less offering costs of $205,260, from the sale of common stock and units in two private
	placements. This compares to gross proceeds of $4,199,000, less offering costs of $364,999, from the sale of common stock during the year ended December 31, 2015.






	Cash Flows







	Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 Compared to March 31, 2016







	Operating Activities





	        Net
	cash used in operating activities during the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $1,311,640 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of
	$305,799 during the three months ended March 31, 2016, representing a decline of $1,617,439. The decline for the 2017 period is attributable to an increase in net loss as discussed in Results
	of Operations above, and increases in accounts receivable and accounts receivable due from our working interest partners, partially offset by increased accretion of convertible notes, accounts payable
	and accrued liabilities.






	Investing Activities





	        Net
	cash used in investing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $3,464,803 compared to $818,868 during the three months ended
	March 31, 2016, representing an increase of $2,645,935 and reflecting a significant increase in our acquisition and development activities. During the 2017 period, we paid $666,000 for the
	acquisition of acreage in our Southern Core prospects and we also paid $2,735,765 for our share of the development of our properties. During the 2016 period, we recorded net acquisitions of $790,253
	related to the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas properties in our Todd Creek Farms prospect, additions of $11,574 in furniture, fixtures and equipment and development of crude oil and natural
	gas properties of $17,041.

	Financing Activities





	        During
	the three months ended March 31, 2017, we received net proceeds of $7,251,661 in the private placement of units. This compares to net proceeds of $95,000
	from the sale of common stock during the three months ended March 31, 2016.






	Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to December 31, 2015







	Operating Activities





	        Net
	cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 was $2,679,993 compared to $1,417,532 during the year ended December 31,
	2015, representing an increase of $1,262,461. The increase in the 2016 period is attributable to an increase in net loss as discussed in Results of Operations above, increases in prepaid drilling
	expense, accounts receivable and accounts receivable due from our working interest partners, partially offset by increased share based compensation and accounts payable and accrued liabilities.






	Investing Activities





	        Net
	cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 was $10,757,041 compared to $892,721 during the year ended December 31,
	2015, representing an increase of $9,864,320 and reflecting a significant increase in our acquisition and development activities. During 2016, we paid $7,675,217 for the acquisition of properties and
	other fixed assets, including the PDC and Crimson acquisitions. We also paid $3,038,339 for our share of the development of our properties in 2016. During the 2015 period, we made investments totaling
	$892,721 related to the acquisition and development of our properties due to limited capital.






	Financing Activities





	        Financing
	activities in 2016 consisted primarily of borrowings under our two lines of credit and the sale of debt in a private placement. A planned underwritten public
	offering of our common stock was abandoned in the fourth quarter of the year due to market conditions.




	        During
	the year ended December 31, 2016, we borrowed $3,937,815 on the initial line of credit from Providence and repaid $nil of that amount as compared to borrowing of $1,890,000
	and repayment of $827,815 during the year ended December 31, 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we borrowed $7,105,000 on the supplemental line of credit and repaid $nil of
	that amount. The supplemental line of credit did not exist in 2015.




	        During
	the year ended December 31, 2016, we received gross offering proceeds of $1,942,600, less offering costs of $205,260, from the sale of units in a private placement. We
	received an additional $95,000 in a private placement of common stock in January 2016. This compares to gross proceeds of
	$4,199,000, less offering costs of $364,999, from the sale of our common stock during the year ended December 31, 2015.






	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements





	        We have no material off-balance sheet transactions, arrangements, or obligations.






	JOBS Act Emerging Growth Company





	        We are an "emerging growth company" as defined in the JOBS Act. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of
	(1) the last day of the fiscal year during which our total annual revenues equal or exceed $1 billion (subject to adjustment for inflation), (2) the last day of the fiscal year
	during which occurs the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering, (3) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in
	non-convertible debt, or (4) the date on which we are deemed a "large accelerated filer" under the Exchange Act.




	75





















	Table of Contents





	        As an emerging growth company, we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies
	that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to the following:






	




	not being required to obtain an auditor attestation under Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes Oxley Act;








	




	reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements;








	




	exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and from holding a vote for stockholder
	approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved;








	




	presenting not more than two years of audited financial statements to make our registration statement effective with respect to an initial
	public offering; and








	




	providing executive compensation disclosure under Item 402 of Regulation S-K to the extent required by smaller reporting
	companies as defined by rule of the SEC.






	        Certain
	exemptions described above are also available to us as a smaller reporting company. Specifically, the reduced disclosure obligation regarding executive compensation, presenting
	not more than two years of audited financial statements, and not being required to obtain an auditor attestation under Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes Oxley Act are the same for an emerging
	growth company such as ours that qualifies as a smaller reporting company.




	        Section 102(b)
	of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the
	Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise
	apply to private companies. We have elected to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we are not required to adopt any new or revised accounting standards on the relevant
	dates when adoption of such standards are required for other public companies. While we are not required to adopt any new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates, we may elect to do so.






	Critical Accounting Policies







	Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements





	        The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements, which have been
	prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("US GAAP"). The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and
	judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.




	        Our
	significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 of the Notes to Financial Statements included as part of this prospectus. We have identified below the policies that we
	believe are of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and which require the application of significant judgment by management. We analyze our
	estimates, including those related to oil and gas reserve estimates, on a periodic basis and base our estimates on historical experience, independent third party reservoir engineers and various other
	assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following
	critical accounting




	76











	Table of Contents





	policies
	affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements:






	Successful Efforts Method of Accounting





	        Our application of the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas exploration and production activities requires judgments as
	to whether particular wells are developmental or exploratory, since exploratory costs and the costs related to exploratory wells that are determined to not have proved reserves must be expensed
	whereas developmental costs are capitalized. The results from a drilling operation can take considerable time to analyze, and the determination that commercial reserves have been discovered requires
	both judgment and application of industry experience. Wells may be completed that are assumed to be productive and actually deliver oil and natural gas in quantities insufficient to be economic, which
	may result in the abandonment of the wells at a later date. On occasion, wells are drilled which have targeted geologic structures that are both developmental and exploratory in nature, and in such
	instances an allocation of costs is required to
	properly account for the results. The evaluation of natural gas and oil leasehold acquisition costs included in unproved properties requires management's judgment of exploratory costs related to
	drilling activity in a given area. Drilling activities in an area by other companies may also effectively condemn leasehold positions.






	Oil and Gas Reserves





	        Our estimates of proved reserves are based on the quantities of oil, natural gas and NGLs, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering
	data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government
	regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or
	probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. Our independent petroleum engineers, Cawley Gillespie, prepare a reserve and economic evaluation of all of our properties on a well-by-well basis.
	The accuracy of reserve estimates is a function of the:






	




	quality and quantity of available data;








	




	interpretation of that data;








	




	accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions; and








	




	judgment of the independent reserve engineer.






	        One
	of the most significant estimates we make is the estimate of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves. Oil, natural gas and NGL reserve estimates require significant judgments in the
	evaluation of all
	available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. The data for a given area may change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including, but not limited to, additional
	development activity, production history, projected future production, economic assumptions relating to commodity prices, operating expenses, severance and other taxes, capital expenditures and
	remediation costs and these estimates are inherently uncertain. For example, if estimates of proved reserves decline, our depreciation, depletion, and amortization (DD&A) rate will increase, resulting
	in an increase in net loss. A decline in estimates of proved reserves could also cause us to perform an impairment analysis to determine if the carrying amount of oil and gas properties exceeds fair
	value and could result in an impairment charge, which would increase our loss. We cannot predict what reserve revisions may be required in future periods.




	        The
	recent significant decline in oil, natural gas and NGL prices increases the uncertainty as to the impact of commodity prices on our estimated proved reserves. We are unable to
	predict future commodity prices with any greater precision than the futures market. A prolonged period of depressed




	77











	Table of Contents





	commodity
	prices may have a significant impact on the value and volumetric quantities of our proved reserve portfolio, assuming no other changes to our development plans or costs.






	Depreciation, Depletion, Amortization and Accretion





	        Our DD&A rate is dependent upon our estimates of total proved and proved developed reserves, which incorporate various assumptions and future
	projections. If our estimates of total proved or proved developed reserves decline, the rate at which we record DD&A expense increases, which in turn increases our net loss. Such a decline in reserves
	may result from lower commodity prices or other changes to reserve estimates, as discussed above, and we are unable to predict changes in reserve quantity estimates as such quantities are dependent on
	the success of our exploration and development program, as well as future economic conditions.






	Impairment of Proved Oil and Gas Properties





	        Proved oil and gas properties are reviewed for impairment annually or when events and circumstances indicate a possible decline in the
	recoverability of the carrying amount of such property. We estimate the expected future cash flows of our oil and gas properties and compare these undiscounted cash flows to the carrying amount of the
	oil and gas properties to determine if the carrying amount is recoverable. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, we will write down the carrying amount of the
	oil and gas properties to fair value. The factors used to determine fair value include, but are not limited to, estimates of reserves, future commodity prices, future production estimates, estimated
	future capital expenditures, estimated future operating costs, and discount rates commensurate with the risk associated with realizing the projected cash flows. Impairment expense for proved oil and
	gas properties is reported in impairment of long lived assets in the consolidated statements of operations, which increases accumulated depletion, depreciation and amortization.




	        Our
	impairment analyses requires us to apply judgment in identifying impairment indicators and estimating future cash flows of our oil and gas properties. If actual results are not
	consistent with our assumptions and estimates or our assumptions and estimates change due to new information, we may be exposed to an impairment charge.






	Impairment of Unproved Oil and Gas Properties





	        Unproved oil and gas properties consist of costs to acquire unevaluated leases as well as costs to acquire unproved reserves. We evaluate
	significant unproved oil and gas properties for impairment based on remaining lease term, drilling results, reservoir performance, seismic interpretation or future plans to develop acreage. When
	successful wells are drilled on undeveloped leaseholds, unproved property costs are reclassified to proved properties and depleted on a unit-of-production basis. Impairment expense and lease extension
	payments for unproved properties is reported in exploration expenses in the statements of operations.






	Accounting for Business Combinations





	        We account for all of our business combinations using the purchase method, which is the only method permitted under FASB ASC
	805



	, Business Combinations



	, and involves the use of significant judgment. In connection with a business combination, the acquiring company must allocate
	the cost of the acquisition to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on fair values as of the acquisition date. Any excess or shortage of amounts assigned to assets and liabilities over or
	under the purchase price is recorded as a gain on bargain purchase or goodwill. The amount of goodwill or gain on bargain purchase recorded in any particular business combination can vary
	significantly depending upon the values attributed to assets acquired and liabilities assumed.




	78











	Table of Contents





	        In
	estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, we make various assumptions. The most significant assumptions relate to the estimated
	fair values assigned to proved and unproved oil and gas properties. If sufficient market data is not available regarding the fair values of proved and unproved properties, we must prepare estimates.
	To estimate the fair values of these properties, we prepare estimates of gas, oil and NGL reserves. We estimate future prices to apply to the estimated reserves quantities acquired and estimate future
	operating and development costs to arrive at estimates of future net cash flows. For estimated proved reserves, the future net cash flows are discounted using a market-based weighted average cost of
	capital rate determined appropriate at the time of the acquisition. The market-based weighted average cost of capital rate is subjected to additional project-specific risking factors. To compensate
	for the inherent risk of estimating and valuing unproved reserves, when a discounted cash flow model is used, the discounted future net cash flows of probable and possible reserves are reduced by
	additional risk factors. In some instances, market comparable information of recent transactions is used to estimate fair value of unproved acreage.




	        Estimated
	fair values assigned to assets acquired can have a significant effect on results of operations in the future. A higher fair value assigned to a property results in higher DD&A
	expense, which results in increased net loss. Fair values are based on estimates of future commodity prices, reserves quantities, operating expenses and development costs. This increases the
	likelihood of impairment if future commodity prices or reserves quantities are lower than those originally used to determine fair value, or if future operating expenses or development costs are higher
	than those originally used to determine fair value. Impairment would have no effect on cash flows but would result in an increase in net loss for the period in which the impairment is recorded.






	Asset Retirement Obligations





	        Our asset retirement obligations ("ARO") consist of estimated future costs associated with the plugging and abandonment of oil, natural gas and
	NGL wells, removal of equipment and facilities from leased acreage and land restoration in accordance with applicable local, state and federal laws, and applicable lease terms. The fair value of an
	ARO liability is required to be recognized in the period in which it is incurred, with the associated asset retirement cost capitalized as part of the carrying cost of the oil and gas asset. The
	recognition of an ARO requires management to make numerous assumptions regarding such factors as the estimated probabilities, amounts and timing of settlements; the credit-adjusted risk-free discount
	rate to be used; and inflation rates. In periods subsequent to the initial measurement of the ARO, we must recognize period-to-period changes in the liability resulting from the passage of time and
	revisions to either the timing or the amount of the original estimate of undiscounted cash flows. Increases in the ARO liability due to the passage of time impact operating results as accretion
	expense. The related capitalized cost, including revisions thereto, is charged to expense through DD&A over the life of the oil and gas property.






	Stock Based Compensation





	        We currently utilize a standard option pricing model (i.e., Black-Scholes) to measure the fair value of stock options granted to
	employees and directors. The determination of the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment in developing assumptions, which involve a number of variables. These variables
	include, but are not limited to, the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, the expected dividend yield and the expected stock option exercise behavior.




	        Our
	computation of expected volatility is based on a combination of historical and market-based implied volatility. The volatility rate was derived by examining historical stock price
	behavior and assessing management's expectations of stock price behavior during the term of the option. The term of the options was derived based on the "simplified method" calculation. The simplified
	method allows companies that do not have sufficient historical experience to provide a reasonable basis for an




	79











	Table of Contents





	estimate
	to instead estimate the expected term of a "plain vanilla" option by averaging the time to vesting and the full term of the option. ("Plain vanilla" options are options with the following
	characteristics: (1) the options are granted at-the-money; (2) exercisability is conditional only upon performing service through the vesting date; (3) if an employee terminates
	service prior to vesting, the employee would forfeit the options; (4) if an employee terminates service after vesting, the employee would have a limited time to exercise the options (typically
	30 to 90 days); and (5) the options are nontransferable and non-hedgeable.) The Company periodically evaluates the applicability of using the simplified method with respect to the
	characteristics noted above to estimate the expected term of our options and will continue to do so as our business continues to evolve. If any of the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model
	change significantly, stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period.

	Changes In and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure







	Resignation of independent registered public accounting firm





	        On May 1, 2015, we were informed by our independent registered public accounting firm, StarkSchenkein, LLP, or StarkSchenkein,
	that certain individuals joined the practice of SingerLewak LLP, or SingerLewak. As a result, StarkSchenkein resigned as our independent registered public accounting firm effective that date.




	        During
	the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the subsequent interim period through May 1, 2015, there were (i) no disagreements, as that term is defined in
	Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K, with StarkSchenkein on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which if
	not resolved to StarkSchenkein's satisfaction would have caused StarkSchenkein to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in connection with its reports, and (ii) no reportable
	events of the types described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K. Moreover, except as noted in the paragraph immediately below, the reports of StarkSchenkein on our financial
	statements for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were the reports qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope
	or accounting principles.




	        The
	report of StarkSchenkein on our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014 contained an explanatory paragraph that noted there was substantial doubt
	as to our ability to continue as a going concern based on our nominal revenue, losses from operations and accumulated deficit as of the year then-ended.




	        We
	provided StarkSchenkein with a copy of the foregoing disclosure and requested StarkSchenkein to furnish us with a letter addressed to the SEC stating whether it agrees with the
	statements made herein, which StarkSchenkein furnished on May 6, 2015.






	Engagement of new independent registered public accounting firm





	        On May 6, 2015, our Board of Directors approved the engagement of SingerLewak as our independent registered public accounting firm to
	replace StarkSchenkein.




	        During
	the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the subsequent interim period through May 6, 2015, we did not consult with SingerLewak regarding either
	(i) the application of accounting

	to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on our financial statements, and no written or oral advice was provided to us
	by SingerLewak that was an important factor considered by us in reaching a decision as to any accounting,
	auditing or financial reporting issue; or (ii) any matter that was subject of a disagreement, as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K, or reportable event
	of the types described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.

	July 2016










	        Each
	of our directors is serving a term which expires at the next annual meeting of our shareholders and until his successor is elected and qualified or until he resigns or is removed.




	        The
	following information summarizes the business experience of each of our officers and directors for at least the last five years:

	    Mr. Conrad has served as Chairman of our Board of Directors since our inception. He is presently
	an independent
	consultant, providing financial management services. From January 1990 until December 2012, Mr. Conrad served as the Vice-President, Chief Financial Officer and Director of MCM Capital
	Management, Inc., or MCM, a privately-held financial and management consulting firm. MCM assisted other companies in developing and implementing their business plans and capital formation
	strategies. In that capacity, Mr. Conrad participated in the organization or development of a number of companies in industries as diverse as oil and gas, real estate, and technology. From 2006

	exploration and production company. Mr. Conrad's extensive experience as a director of other extraction companies gives him valuable insight into the growth and development of our company. For
	these reasons, we believe Mr. Conrad is qualified to serve as a director of our company.

	Secretary in August

	in Geology from Colorado College, an M.B.A. in Energy Management from the University of Denver, and is a member of Society of Petroleum Engineers, the American Association of Petroleum Geologists and
	the Rocky Mountain Association of Geologists. Our Board of Directors believes that Mr. Witsell is well qualified to serve as a director and executive officer of the company as a result of his
	extensive oil and gas industry experience including in areas of executive management and operations developed by serving as an executive officer of other oil and gas companies throughout his career.
	Mr. Witsell brings years of hands-on experience with oil and natural gas companies in many capacities and across multiple basins. For these reasons, we believe Mr. Witsell is qualified

	Director Independence





	        In connection with this offering, we intend to apply to list our common stock on the NYSE MKT. Under the rules of the NYSE MKT, independent
	directors must comprise at least a majority of a listed company's board of directors. In addition, the rules of NYSE MKT require that, subject to specified exceptions, each member of a listed
	company's audit, compensation, and nominating committees be independent. Under the rules of NYSE MKT, a director will only qualify as an "independent director" if, in the opinion of that company's
	board of directors, that person does not have a relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director.




	        Our
	Board of Directors has determined that Bill M. Conrad, Scott C. Chandler, James H. Sinclair, and Douglas R. Harris each qualify as "independent" in accordance with
	Section 803(A) of the NYSE MKT Company Guide. During the review, our Board of Directors considered relationships and transactions during 2016 and during the past three fiscal years between each
	director or any member of his immediate family, on the one hand, and our company and our affiliates, on the other hand. The purpose of this review was to determine whether any such relationships or
	transactions were inconsistent with a determination that the director is independent. The only compensation or remuneration that we provide to Messrs. Conrad, Chandler, Sinclair, or Harris
	during their tenures as a director is compensation as a non-employee director. Neither Messrs. Conrad, Chandler, Sinclair, or Harris, nor any members of their families, have participated in any
	transaction with us that would




	85











	Table of Contents





	disqualify
	him as an "independent" director under the standard described above. Stephen J. Foley and Frederick J. Witsell do not qualify as "independent" because they are executive officers.






	Committees






	        Audit Committee.



	    Messrs. Conrad, Chandler, and Harris serve as members of our audit committee and Mr. Chandler serves as the
	Chairman
	of the audit committee. The Board has determined that Messrs. Conrad, Chandler, and Harris are each "independent" in accordance with the NYSE MKT definition of independence, that
	Mr. Chandler is a "financial expert," as defined by SEC regulations, and each has the related financial management expertise within the meaning of the NYSE MKT rules.




	        The
	primary purpose of the audit committee is to act on behalf of our Board of Directors in its oversight of all material aspects of our accounting and financial reporting processes,
	internal controls, and audit function, including our compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Pursuant to its charter, our audit committee reviews on an on-going basis for
	potential conflicts of interest, and approves if appropriate, all of our related party transactions. For purposes of the audit committee charter, related party transactions means those transaction
	required to be disclosed pursuant to SEC regulations. In addition, the audit committee reviews, acts on, and reports to our Board of Directors with respect to various auditing and accounting matters,
	including the selection of our independent registered public accounting firm, the scope of annual audits, fees to be paid to our independent registered public accounting firm, the performance of our
	independent registered public
	accounting firm, our accounting practices, and our internal controls and legal compliance functions. The audit committee also reviews, prior to publication, our reports to the SEC on Forms 10-K
	and 10-Q. The audit committee operates pursuant to a written charter, which is available on our website, www.petrosharecorp.com. The charter describes the nature and scope of responsibilities of the
	audit committee.





	        Compensation Committee.



	    We do not currently have a compensation committee. In accordance with the rules of the NYSE MKT, we anticipate
	the
	compensation of our chief executive officer will be determined by a majority of our independent directors. The compensation of our remaining executive officers is determined by our Board of Directors.
	Executive officers who also serve on our Board of Directors do not vote on matters pertaining to their own personal compensation. Although we may form a compensation committee in the future,
	there is no assurance as to when or whether we will do so.





	        Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.



	    We do not currently have a nominating and corporate governance committee. In accordance
	with the rules
	of the NYSE MKT, we anticipate Board of Directors nominations will be selected by a majority of our independent directors.









	Director Compensation





	        Bill M. Conrad, the Chairman of our Board of Directors, was paid a director's fee in the amount of $6,500 per month beginning November 2013 and
	continuing through February 2016. Effective March 1, 2016, Mr. Conrad's compensation was increased to $10,000 per month. Scott C. Chandler, James H. Sinclair, and Douglas R. Harris are
	each are paid a director's fee in the amount of $6,000 per quarter. Mr. Chandler is paid an additional $1,000 per month to serve as Chair of our audit committee. In connection with their
	appointment to the Board, Mr. Chandler and Mr. Sinclair were each granted 25,000 shares of our common stock and options to purchase an additional 25,000 shares of our common stock, which
	options are exercisable at a price of $1.10 per share until December 31, 2022. In connection with his appointment to our Board of Directors, Mr. Harris was granted 25,000 shares of our
	common stock and options to purchase an additional 25,000 shares of our common stock, which options are exercisable at a price of $1.60 per share until December 31, 2022.

	        On
	August 18, 2016, our Board of Directors adopted the Amended and Restated PetroShare Corp. Equity Incentive Plan, or the Amended Plan, which replaced and restated our original
	equity incentive plan. The Amended Plan terminates by its terms on August 17, 2026. Among other things, the Amended Plan increased the number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance
	thereunder from 5,000,000 to 10,000,000 shares. Our shareholders approved the Amended Plan at our annual meeting of shareholders on September 8, 2016. We currently have 4,933,300 shares
	available for issuance under the Amended Plan.






	Indemnification and Limitation on Liability of Directors





	        Our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws provide that we may indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by Colorado law, any of our directors,
	officers, employees or agents made or threatened to be made a party to a proceeding, by reason of the person serving or having served in a capacity as such, against judgments, penalties, fines,
	settlements and reasonable expenses incurred by the person in connection with the proceeding if certain standards are met. At present, there is no pending litigation or proceeding involving any of our
	directors, officers, employees or agents where indemnification will be required or permitted. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our
	directors, officers and controlling persons pursuant to the
	foregoing provisions, or otherwise, we have been advised that in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore,
	unenforceable.




	        The
	Colorado Business Corporation Act, or the CBCA, allows indemnification of directors, officers, employees and agents of a company against liabilities incurred in any proceeding in
	which an individual is made a party because he was a director, officer, employee or agent of the company if such




	88











	Table of Contents





	person
	conducted himself in good faith and reasonably believed his actions were in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the company, and with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no
	reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. A person must be found to be entitled to indemnification under this statutory standard by procedures designed to assure that disinterested members
	of the Board of Directors have approved indemnification or that, absent the ability to obtain sufficient numbers of disinterested directors, independent counsel or shareholders have approved the
	indemnification based on a finding that the person has met the standard. Indemnification is limited to reasonable expenses.




	        Our
	Articles of Incorporation limit the liability of our directors to the fullest extent permitted by the CBCA. Specifically, our directors will not be personally liable for monetary
	damages for breach of fiduciary duty as directors, except for:






	




	any breach of the duty of loyalty to our company or our stockholders;








	




	acts or omissions not in good faith or that involved intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law;








	




	dividends or other distributions of corporate assets that are in contravention of certain statutory or contractual restrictions;








	




	violations of certain laws; or








	




	any transaction from which the director derives an improper personal benefit.






	Liability
	under federal securities law is not limited by the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws.















	CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS






	        The following includes a summary of transactions, during our last three fiscal years, to which we have been a party, in which the amount
	involved in the transaction exceeded $120,000 or one percent of the average of our total assets at fiscal year-end for the last three fiscal years, and in which any of our directors, executive
	officers or, to our knowledge, beneficial owners of more than 5% of our capital stock or any member of the immediate family of any of the foregoing persons had or will have a direct or indirect
	material interest, other than equity and other compensation, termination, change in control and other arrangements which are described under "Director Compensation" and "Executive Compensation."






	Providence Energy Operators, LLC







	Revolving Line of Credit Facility Agreement





	        On May 13, 2015, we entered into the initial line of credit with Providence. The initial line of credit was amended on
	February 24, 2016 to extend the maturity date to June 1, 2018. Under the terms of the initial line of credit, we are permitted to borrow up to $5.0 million. Interest on the
	outstanding principal balance of the initial line of credit accrues at an annual rate of 8% simple interest per year. The outstanding balance on the initial line of credit is $5.0 million, plus
	approximately $453,000 of accrued but unpaid interest.






	Participation Agreement





	        On May 13, 2015, we entered into the Participation Agreement with Providence. Under the terms of the Participation Agreement, we assigned
	an undivided 50% to our right, title and interest in and to our then existing leases. Providence agreed to pay its pro rata share of lease acquisition expenses and the expenses necessary to maintain
	the leases in full force and effect. In addition, the Participation Agreement designates an area of mutual interest, or AMI, pursuant to which if either party acquires




	89











	Table of Contents





	any
	lease in the AMI territory on or before May 13, 2018, then the non-acquiring party shall have the right to acquire its proportionate 50% interest in and to such AMI leases. The AMI covers
	an area in Adams County, Colorado containing all of Township 1 South, Range 67 West, consisting of approximately 23,100 gross acres, with an additional one-mile border around the defined AMI area,
	plus any other mutually agreeable areas. To date, Providence has exercised its option under the Participation Agreement or otherwise has participated in all of our acreage acquisitions in the
	Wattenberg Field, the result of which is we retain a 50% or less interest in all of our DJ Basin properties. The payments made to us by Providence were based on the pro rata share of our acquisition
	costs, which in turn were determined by negotiations with independent third parties.




	        Providence
	owns 13.3% of our common stock.






	Private Placement





	        During December 2016 and January 2017, we completed a private placement of 200 units at an offering price of $50,000 per unit. Certain of the
	units were purchased by our directors and officers in the following amounts and on the following dates on the same terms and conditions as independent third parties:

	totaling $209,988 for his services, which was paid in accordance with our placement agent agreement and arrangements our placement agent had with certain subagents. As additional sales compensation,
	Mr. Kruljac was allocated a portion of the placement agent warrant to purchase up to 154,358 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $1.50 per share.

	AND OTHER BENEFICIAL OWNERS






	        There are a total of 22,551,537 shares of our common stock outstanding, our only class of voting securities currently outstanding. The following
	table describes the ownership of our voting securities before the offering and after the offering, by: (i) each of our named executive officers and directors; (ii) all of our executive
	officers and directors as a group; and (iii) each shareholder known us to own beneficially more than 5% of our common stock. Unless otherwise stated, the address of each of the individuals is

	important terms of our capital stock. Because it is only a summary, it does not contain all the information that may be important to you. For a complete description, you should refer to our Articles
	of Incorporation, Bylaws and other exhibits included as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part, and to the applicable provisions of Colorado law.






	Common Stock





	        The holders of our common stock are entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters submitted to stockholders, including the
	election of directors. Cumulative voting for directors is not permitted. Except as provided by special agreement, the holders of common stock are not entitled to any preemptive rights and the shares
	are not redeemable or convertible. The holders of our common stock are entitled to dividends if, as and when declared by our Board of Directors from legally available funds, subject to the
	preferential rights of the holders of any outstanding preferred stock. Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our affairs, the holders of our common stock are
	entitled to share, on a pro rata basis, all assets remaining after payment to creditors and prior to distribution rights, if any, of any series of outstanding preferred stock.




	        All
	outstanding common stock is, and all common stock offered hereby will be, when issued and paid for, fully paid and non-assessable. The number of authorized shares of common stock may
	be




	92











	Table of Contents





	increased
	or decreased (but not below the number of shares then outstanding or otherwise reserved under obligations for issuance by us) by the affirmative vote of a majority of shares cast at a
	meeting of our shareholders at which a quorum is present.




	        Provisions
	of our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws may delay, defer or prevent a change in control of our company. These provisions could adversely affect the price of our common
	stock. Among other things, our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws:






	




	permit our Board of Directors to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, with any rights, preferences and privileges as they may
	designate (including the right to approve an acquisition or other change in our control);








	




	provide that the authorized number of directors may be fixed only by our Board of Directors from time to time;








	




	do not provide for cumulative voting rights (therefore allowing the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock entitled to vote in any
	election of directors to elect all of the directors standing for election, if they should so choose); and








	




	provide that special meetings of our shareholders may be called only by our President, Board of Directors, or by the holders of at least 10% of
	the stock entitled to vote at such meeting.






	        In
	addition, as a matter of Colorado law, certain significant transactions would require the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares eligible to vote at a meeting of shareholders
	which requirement could result in delays to, or greater cost associated with, a change in control of our company.






	Warrants





	        We currently have purchase warrants to purchase an aggregate 7,588,800 shares of our common stock outstanding. The transactions resulting in our
	issuing purchase warrants are as follows:






	




	in November 2015, we issued warrants to purchase 255,600 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $1.25 per share to underwriters in our
	initial public offering. These warrants expire on November 12, 2020.








	




	in December 2016 and January 2017, we issued warrants to purchase 6,666,600 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $3.00 per share to
	investors in our private placement. These warrants expire on December 31, 2019.








	




	in January 2017, we issued warrants to purchase 666,600 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $1.50 per share to a placement agent in
	our private placement. These warrants expire on December 31, 2021.








	Preferred Stock





	        Our Articles of Incorporation vest our Board of Directors with authority to divide the preferred stock into series and to fix and determine the
	relative rights and preferences of the
	shares of any such series so established to the full extent permitted by the laws of the State of Colorado and our Articles of Incorporation in respect to, among other
	things:






	




	the number of shares to constitute such series and the distinctive designations thereof;








	




	the rate and preference of dividends, if any, the time of payment of dividends, whether dividends are cumulative and the date from which any
	dividend shall accrue;








	




	whether preferred stock may be redeemed and, if so, the redemption price and the terms and conditions of redemption;






	93











	Table of Contents







	




	the liquidation preferences payable on preferred stock in the event of involuntary or voluntary liquidation;








	




	sinking fund or other provisions, if any, for redemption or purchase of preferred stock;








	




	the terms and conditions by which preferred stock may be converted, if the preferred stock of any series are issued with the privilege of
	conversion; and








	




	voting rights, if any.






	        We
	have not designated or authorized any preferred stock for issuance.

	representatives, we have agreed to sell to the underwriters, and each underwriter has severally agreed to purchase, at the public offering price less the underwriting discounts and commissions set
	forth on the cover page of this prospectus, the number of shares of common stock listed next to its name in the following table:

	        The
	underwriting agreement provides that the underwriters' obligation to purchase our common stock is subject to approval of legal matters by counsel and the satisfaction of the
	conditions contained in the underwriting agreement. The conditions contained in the underwriting agreement include the conditions that the representations and warranties made by us to the underwriters
	are true, that there has been no material adverse change to our condition or in the financial markets, and that we deliver to the underwriters customary closing documents. The underwriters are
	obligated to purchase all of the shares of common stock (other than those covered by the option to purchase additional shares described below) if they purchase any of the shares of common stock.






	Option to Purchase Additional Common Shares





	        We have granted to the underwriters an option, exercisable for 30 days from the date of this prospectus, to purchase up to
	                additional shares of common stock at the public offering price per share less the underwriting discount and commissions shown on the cover page of this
	prospectus.






	Underwriting Discount and Commissions and Offering Expenses





	        The underwriters propose to offer the common stock to the public at the public offering price set forth on the cover of this prospectus. The
	underwriters may offer the common stock to securities dealers at the price to the public less a concession not in excess of $            per share of common stock. After the common stock is
	released for sale to the public, the underwriters may vary the offering price and other selling terms from time to time.

	        The
	underwriting discounts and commissions include a 1% incentive fee payable to the representatives. We estimate our expenses associated with the offering, excluding underwriting
	discounts and commissions, will be approximately $             million. If the gross proceeds of the offering exceed $20.0 million, the representatives shall have the right, but
	not
	the obligation, to act as the lead underwriters or placement agents in any subsequent offering of our securities, which right will expire and be of no effect on the 12-month anniversary of the closing
	date of this offering.








	Indemnification





	        We have agreed to indemnify the underwriters against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws, or to
	contribute to payments that may be required to be made in respect of these liabilities.






	Lock-Up Agreements





	        We and our officers and directors have agreed that, for a period of 90 days from the date of this prospectus, we and they will not,
	without the prior written consent of the representatives (which consent may be withheld at the sole discretion of the representatives), directly or indirectly, sell, offer, contract, or grant any
	option to sell, pledge, transfer, or establish an open "put equivalent position" within the meaning of the Exchange Act or otherwise dispose of or transfer, or announce the offering of, or file any
	registration statement under the Securities Act in respect of, any shares of our common stock, options, or warrants to acquire shares of our common stock or securities exchangeable or exercisable for
	or convertible into shares of our common stock. In addition, our officers and directors may not enter into a swap or other derivatives transaction that transfers to another, in whole or in part, the
	economic benefits or risk of ownership in our common stock, or otherwise dispose of any shares of our common stock, options or warrants or securities exchangeable or exercisable for or convertible
	into shares of our common stock currently or later owned either of record or beneficially, or publicly announce an intention to do any of the foregoing.




	        The
	restrictions above do not apply to (i) our issuance of shares of our common stock or options to purchase shares of our common stock, or shares of our common stock upon
	exercise of options, pursuant to any stock option, stock bonus, or other stock plan or arrangement described in this prospectus or any amendment to or replacement of such plan and (ii) the
	filing of one or more registration statements on Form S-8 or amendments thereto relating to the issuance of shares of our common stock or the issuance and exercise of options to purchase shares
	of our common stock granted under our employee benefit plans existing on the date of this prospectus or any amendment to or replacement of such plan. Our officers and directors may transfer shares of
	our common stock or such other convertible, exercisable or exchangeable securities without the prior written consent of the representatives if: (a) the representatives receive a signed lock-up
	agreement for the balance of the 90-day restricted period from each donee, trustee, distributee, or transferee, as the case may be; (b) any such transfer does not involve a disposition for
	value; (c) such transfers are not publicly reportable under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, and their related rules and regulations; (d) the transferor does not otherwise
	voluntarily effect any public filing or report regarding such transfers; and




	95











	Table of Contents





	(e) such
	transfer is (i) a bona fide gift or gifts; (ii) to any trust for the direct or indirect benefit of the transferor or the immediate family of the transferor; or
	(iii) to the transferor's affiliates or to any investment fund or other entity controlled or managed by the transferor.




	        If
	(A) during the last 17 days of the 90-day period, we issue an earnings release or material news or a material event relating to us occurs or (B) prior to the
	expiration of the 90-day period, we announce
	that we will release earnings results during the 16-day period beginning on the last day of the 90-day period, then in each case the 120-day period will be extended until the expiration of the 18-day
	period beginning on the date of the issuance of the earnings release or the occurrence of the material news or material event, as applicable, except that such extension will not apply under certain
	circumstances if we certify to the representatives that our common stock is an "actively traded security" as defined in Regulation M and that we meet certain other requirements.






	Price Stabilization, Short Positions and Penalty Bids; Passive Market Making





	        The underwriters may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing transactions, syndicate covering transactions, penalty bids and passive market making
	in accordance with Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Over-allotment involves syndicate sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a syndicate short position. Covered short sales are
	sales made in an amount not greater than the number of shares available for purchase by the underwriters under their over-allotment option. The underwriters may close out a covered short sale by
	exercising their over-allotment option or purchasing shares in the open market. Naked short sales are sales made in an amount in excess of the number of shares available under the over-allotment
	option. The underwriters must close out any naked short sale by purchasing shares in the open market. Stabilizing transactions permit bids to purchase the underlying security so long as the
	stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of the shares of common stock in the open market after the distribution has been completed in
	order to cover syndicate short positions. Penalty bids permit the underwriters to reclaim a selling concession from a syndicate member when the shares of common stock originally sold by such syndicate
	member is purchased in a syndicate covering transaction to cover syndicate short positions. Penalty bids may have the effect of deterring syndicate members from selling to people who have a history of
	quickly selling their shares. In passive market making, market makers in the shares of common stock who are underwriters or prospective underwriters may, subject to certain limitations, make bids for
	or purchases of the shares of common stock until the time, if any, at which a stabilizing bid is made. These stabilizing transactions, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the
	price of the shares of common stock to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. The underwriters are not required to engage in these activities, and may end any of
	these activities at any time.






	Electronic Distribution





	        This prospectus may be made available on the websites maintained by one or more of the underwriters. The underwriters may agree to allocate a
	number of shares of common stock for sale to their online brokerage account holders. The common stock will be allocated to underwriters that may make Internet distributions on the same basis as other
	allocations. In addition, common stock may be sold by the underwriters to securities dealers who resell common stock to online brokerage account holders.




	        Other
	than this prospectus, information contained in any website maintained by an underwriter is not part of this prospectus, has not been endorsed by us and should not be relied on by
	investors in deciding whether to purchase common stock. The underwriters are not responsible for information contained in websites that they do not maintain.

	Relationship with the Underwriters





	        From time to time, certain of the underwriters and their respective affiliates have provided, and may continue to provide, investment banking
	services to us in the ordinary course of their businesses, and have received, and may continue to receive, compensation for such services.

	otherwise or where the offer is pursuant to a disclosure document which complies with Chapter 6D of the Corporations Act. Any person acquiring shares must observe such Australian on-sale
	restrictions.




	        This
	prospectus contains general information only and does not take account of the investment objectives, financial situation or particular needs of any particular person. It does not
	contain any securities recommendations or financial product advice. Before making an investment decision, investors need to consider whether the information in this prospectus is appropriate to their
	needs, objectives and circumstances, and, if necessary, seek expert advice on those matters.

	intermediary will be deemed to have represented, acknowledged and agreed that the shares of our common stock acquired by it in the offer have not been acquired on a non-discretionary basis on behalf

	sales of our common stock in the public market, or the availability of such shares for sale in the public market, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock
	prevailing from time to time. Sales of substantial amounts of common stock (including shares issued upon the exercise or conversion of outstanding options, warrants or convertible notes) in the public
	market after this offering could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Those sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity-related securities in the future or reduce
	the price at which we could sell any equity-related securities.




	        Upon
	the closing of this offering, we will have outstanding an aggregate of                shares of common stock
	(or                shares of common stock if the underwriters' option
	to purchase additional shares is exercised). Of these shares, all of the                shares of common stock (or        shares
	of common stock if the underwriters' option to purchase
	additional shares is exercised) to be sold in this offering will be freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act, unless the shares are held by any of our
	"affiliates" as such term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act.






	Rule 144





	        In general, under Rule 144 under the Securities Act as currently in effect, a person (or persons whose shares are aggregated) who is not
	deemed to have been an affiliate of ours at any time during the three months preceding a sale, and who has owned restricted securities within the meaning of Rule 144 for at least sixth months
	(including any period of consecutive ownership of preceding non-affiliated holders) would be entitled to sell those shares, subject only to the availability of current public information about us. A
	non-affiliated person (who has been unaffiliated for at least the past three months) who has owned restricted securities within the meaning of Rule 144 for at least one year would be entitled
	to sell those shares without regard to the provisions of Rule 144.




	        A
	person (or persons whose shares are aggregated) who is deemed to be an affiliate of ours and who has owned restricted securities within the meaning of Rule 144 for at least six
	months would be entitled to sell within any three-month period a number of shares that does not exceed the greater of one percent of the then outstanding shares of our common stock or the average
	weekly trading volume of our common stock reported through the OTCQB Marketplace or, if we are approved for listing, the NYSE MKT, during the four calendar weeks preceding the filing of notice of the
	sale. Such sales are also subject to certain manner of sale provisions, notice requirements and the availability of current public information about us.






	Registration Rights





	        In connection with the private placement in December 2016 and January 2017, we granted to the holders of the notes, warrants, and placement
	agent warrants the right to include the common stock issuable upon exercise or conversion of those securities in any registration statement we file with the SEC. The convertible promissory notes have
	an aggregate face value of $10,000,000 are convertible at $1.50 per share, subject to adjustments, at any time prior to December 31, 2018. We issued warrants to purchase an aggregate 6,666,600
	shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $3.00 per share, subject to adjustment, at any time prior to December 31, 2019. We issued warrants to the placement agent to purchase 666,600
	shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $1.50 per share, subject to adjustment, at any time prior to December 31, 2021.

	NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)






	March 31, 2017







	NOTE 1ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS





	        PetroShare Corp. ("PetroShare" or the "Company") is a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Colorado on September 4, 2012 to investigate, acquire and develop crude
	oil and natural gas properties in the Rocky Mountain or mid-continent portion of the United States. Since inception, the Company has focused on financing activities and the acquisition, exploration
	and development of crude oil and natural gas prospects in the Denver-Julesburg Basin, or DJ Basin, in northeast Colorado. The Company's current operating focus is within the Wattenberg Field of the DJ
	Basin, which is located primarily in Adams and Weld Counties, Colorado.






	NOTE 2BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES








	Basis of Presentation






	        The interim condensed financial statements included herein have been prepared by the Company, without audit, pursuant to the rules and
	regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). Certain information and note disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles
	generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although the Company believes that the disclosures
	included are adequate to make the information presented not misleading.




	        In
	management's opinion, the Balance Sheets as of March 31, 2017 (unaudited) and December 31, 2016 (see Note 3), the unaudited Statements of Operations for the three
	months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, and the unaudited Statements of Cash Flows for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, contained herein, reflect all adjustments, consisting
	solely of normal recurring items, which are necessary for the fair presentation of the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows on a basis consistent with that of the
	Company's prior audited financial statements. However, the results of operations for the interim periods may not be indicative of results to be expected for the full fiscal year. Therefore, these
	financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto and summary of significant accounting policies included in the Company's annual report on
	Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. Except as noted below, there have been no changes to the footnotes from those accompanying the audited consolidated financial statements
	contained in the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.







	Loss Per Share






	        Basic and diluted loss per share is computed by dividing net (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
	period. The Company excluded potentially dilutive securities, as shown below, as the effect of their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.

	Deferred Equity Issuance Costs






	        The Company defers as other current assets the direct incremental costs of raising capital through equity offerings until such time as the
	offering is completed. At the time of the completion of an offering, the costs are offset against the proceeds received. Should an offering be terminated, deferred equity issuance costs are charged to
	operations during the period in which an offering is terminated. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company charged $544,070 in deferred equity issuance costs to operations in
	connection with an abandoned public offering. As of March 31, 2017, the Company's deferred equity issuance costs totaled $8,715, with $nil recorded as of December 31, 2016.







	Debt Discount Costs






	        On January 30, 2017, the Company completed the third and final closing of a private placement of units consisting of common stock
	purchase warrants and convertible promissory notes with a total aggregate face value of $10,000,000 (Note 7). The convertible promissory notes contain an embedded beneficial conversion feature.
	The proceeds from the sale of the convertible notes was allocated between the conversion feature and the warrants based on the fair values of the debt
	instrument without the warrants and of the warrants themselves at the time of issuance. The fair value of the beneficial conversion feature has been recorded as a reduction of the carrying value of
	the convertible promissory notes and is being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the notes. The fair value of the warrants has been recorded as a
	reduction to the carrying value of the convertible promissory notes and accounted for as paid in capital.







	Debt Issuance Costs






	        Debt issuance costs include origination and other fees incurred in connection with the Company's private placement and with the origination of
	the Company's supplemental line of credit. Debt issuance costs related to the private placement are amortized to interest expense on a straight-line basis over the respective borrowing term.

	NOTE 2BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)








	Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements






	        In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842)"
	("ASU 2016-02"), which establishes a comprehensive new lease standard designed to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities
	on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. In transition, lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period
	presented using a modified retrospective approach. The modified retrospective approach includes a number of optional practical expedients that entities may elect to apply. An entity that elects to
	apply the practical expedients will, in effect, continue to account for leases that commence before the effective date in accordance with previous U.S. GAAP. ASU 2016-02 is effective for public
	businesses for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of
	the adoption of this standard on its financial statements.




	        In
	May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)" ("ASU 2014-09"), which establishes a comprehensive new revenue recognition
	standard designed to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration the
	entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In doing so, companies may need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under current revenue recognition guidance. In
	March 2016, the FASB released certain implementation guidance through ASU 2016-08 (collectively with ASU 2014-09, the "Revenue ASUs") to clarify principal versus agent considerations. The Revenue ASUs
	allow for the use of either the full or modified retrospective transition method, and the standard will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 including
	interim periods within that period, with early adoption permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Currently, the Company has not identified any contracts that
	would require a change from the entitlements method, historically used for certain domestic crude oil and natural gas sales, to the sales method of accounting. The Company is continuing to evaluate
	the provisions of these ASUs as pertinent to certain sales contracts and in particular as they relates to disclosure requirements.




	        There
	were various updates recently issued by the FASB, most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific industries and are not
	expected to a have a material impact on the Company's reported financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.






	NOTE 3REVISION OF PRIOR PERIOD FINANCIAL STATEMENTS





	        In connection with the preparation of its condensed financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, the Company identified an error related to the manner in which it
	accounted for the fair value of convertible promissory notes and warrants issued in the Company's private placement during December 2016 (Note 7). Specifically, the Company was required to
	apply the guidance of FASB ASC 470, and more specifically, ASC 470-20-25-2 and ASC 470-20-25-3. On the balance sheet at December 31, 2016, the Company recorded the face value of convertible
	notes payable issued in connection with the private placement under liabilities, discounted by (i) the value of the original issue

	NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (Continued)

	discount
	and (ii) the value of the warrants issued to the placement agent. The Company did not, however, discount the value of the convertible notes payable by the fair value of the warrants
	issued to individual investors.




	        In
	accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 99,



	Materiality



	, and SAB No. 108,



	Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying
	Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements



	, the Company evaluated the error
	and determined that the related impact was not material to the Company's results of operations or financial position for any prior annual or interim period. Accordingly, the Company has corrected
	these errors for the year ended December 31, 2016 by revising the condensed financial statements. Periods not presented herein will be revised, as applicable, in future filings.

	following tables present the revisions to the balance sheet as of, and the statement of operations for the year ended, December 31, 2016:

	NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (Continued)






	March 31, 2017







	NOTE 4GOING CONCERN





	        Pursuant to the FASB ASU 2014-15, the Company has assessed its ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the date of the issuance of these financial
	statements. Substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern exists when relevant conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, indicate that it is probable that the
	entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year from the financial statement issuance date. As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company incurred a
	net loss of $2.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2017, and as of that date, the Company's current liabilities exceeded its current assets by $6.9 million.




	        At
	March 31, 2017, the Company had a cash balance of approximately $4.9 million and other current assets of approximately $3.2 million. Subsequent to
	March 31, 2017, the Company's cash balance has decreased as it has paid certain acquisition and development costs, including costs previously accrued, and general and administrative expenses.
	In June 2017, the Company is obligated to repay approximately $3.6 million in principal and approximately $250,000 in accrued interest to satisfy the terms of its supplemental line of credit,
	an approximately $500,000 accrued interest payment on the Company's initial line of credit, and an approximately $500,000 accrued interest payment on the Company's outstanding convertible promissory
	notes (Note 7). The Company also will incur additional expenses related to its operated drilling program during the second and third quarters of this year.




	        As
	of March 31, 2017, the Company has insufficient working capital and revenues from operations to meet its debt obligations and other liabilities incurred in connection with the
	Company's development activities. The Company will need to generate sufficient cash flow from operations and sell equity or debt to fund further operations and acquisitions. If sufficient cash flow
	and additional financing is not available, the Company may be compelled to reduce the scope of its business activities, reduce general and administrative expenses and/or sell a portion of the
	Company's interests in its oil and gas properties. This, in turn, may have an adverse effect on its ability to realize the values of its assets. These factors raise substantial doubt about the
	Company's ability to continue as a going concern.




	        The
	Company's financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the realization of the carrying value of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might
	be necessary should the Company be unable to continue in existence. The Company's ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to obtain additional financing. Management
	believes that it can be successful in obtaining equity and/or debt financing which will enable the Company to continue as a going concern.






	NOTE 5ACQUISITIONS





	        During the quarter ended March 31, 2017, the Company acquired various mineral rights, royalty interests and oil and gas leases. The net acquisition cost to the Company for these
	interests was $666,000 after disposition of 50% of the Company's acquired interest to Providence Energy Operators, LLC ("Providence"), which is the Company's principal lender and an owner of
	13.3% of the Company's common stock.




	        On
	April 3, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of oil and gas leases covering approximately 5,874 gross (1,462 net) acres in Adams and Weld Counties, Colorado. The seller
	reserved

	to
	itself all rights in the leases that exist below 50 feet above the top of the uppermost J Sand formation for those lands located in Township 7 North, Range 63 West in Weld County, Colorado. The
	acquisition was effective January 1, 2017. Providence acquired 50% of the Company's interest in the acquired assets in exchange for approximately $1.3 million. The net purchase price to
	the Company's retained interest in the assets following Providence's acquisition and a reduction in purchase price due to title defects was $1,284,589. The Company paid a deposit of $258,250 at the
	time it entered into the purchase agreement, which was credited against the net purchase price at closing. The Company paid
	the remainder of the net purchase price using cash in the amount of $216,339 and the issuance to the seller of 450,000 shares of the Company's common stock, valued at $1.80 per share.




	        On
	April 21, 2017, the Company acquired a 9.37% royalty interest covering approximately 145 net acres located in Adams County, Colorado for a net purchase price of $569,225
	following Providence's 50% participation in the transaction. The acquisition was effective April 1, 2017. In connection with the acquisition, the Company is obligated to pay to a lease broker a
	finders' fee of 20,555 shares of common stock valued at $1.80 per share.




	        On
	May 9, 2017, the Company acquired 200 gross (70 net) acres in Adams County, Colorado for a net purchase price of $350,000 following Providence's 50% participation in the
	transaction. The transaction was effective April 1, 2017.

	NOTE 7DEBT







	Line of credit





	        On May 13, 2015, the Company entered into a Revolving Line of Credit Facility Agreement ("initial line of credit") with Providence, which
	provides to the Company a revolving line of credit of up to $5,000,000. As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the outstanding balance on the initial line of credit was $5,000,000
	plus accrued interest of $401,107 and $302,477, respectively. During the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company recorded interest expense of $98,630 and $21,185 respectively,
	related to the initial line of credit.




	        Interest
	on the outstanding principal balance of the initial line of credit begins accruing on the dates of advancements of principal at an annual rate equal to 8.0% simple interest. The
	Company is obligated to pay interest monthly after the Company receives its first production payment from any well associated with its Participation Agreement with the lender and/or in which the
	Company has or has had a working interest and in accordance with the terms of the promissory note. The Company expects to make the first interest payment in June 2017.






	Supplemental line of credit





	        On October 13, 2016, the Company entered into a revolving line of credit facility agreement (the "supplemental line of credit") with
	Providence Energy Partners III, LP ("PEP III"). PEP III is an affiliate of Providence by virtue of having some common management personnel. The supplemental line of credit permitted the Company
	to borrow up to $10.0 million to pay costs associated with its acquisition and development of oil and gas properties in the Wattenberg Field. The supplemental line of credit was originally due
	on April 13, 2017.




	        As
	of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the outstanding balance on the supplemental line of credit was $7,105,000 and $7,088,698, plus accrued interest of $190,575 and
	$50,422, respectively.

	NOTE 7DEBT (Continued)





	During
	the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Company recorded interest expense of $140,153 related to the supplemental line of credit.




	        The
	supplemental line of credit was amended on March 30, 2017, pursuant to which the Company agreed not to borrow additional amounts against the supplemental line of credit and to
	repay $3,552,500 in outstanding principal not later than April 13, 2017, in exchange for PEP III extending the maturity date of the supplemental line of credit until June 13, 2017. On
	April 12, 2017, the Company paid $3,552,500 in accordance with the amendment.






	Convertible notes





	        On December 30, 2016, January 20, 2017 and January 30, 2017, the Company completed the private placement of units
	consisting of convertible promissory notes and common stock purchase warrants. The Company received net proceeds of approximately $9.0 million from the private placement, after placement agent
	fees and other associated expenses.




	        Each
	unit sold in the private placement is comprised of a 10% unsecured convertible promissory note in the face amount of $50,000 and 33,333 common stock purchase warrants
	(Notes 10 and 12). Each note sold in the private placement is one of a series of similar notes designated the "10% Unsecured Convertible Promissory Notes" with the series totaling
	$10.0 million. The notes bear interest at the rate of 10% per year and are due and payable on December 31, 2018. Interest is payable semi-annually beginning June 30, 2017 and
	until the notes are paid in full. At any time after issuance, the principal amount of the notes and any accrued but unpaid interest are convertible into shares of the Company's common stock at the
	option of the holder at the rate of $1.50 per share. The conversion price will be proportionately adjusted in the event of any stock splits, stock dividends or a capital reorganization.




	        In
	connection with the offering, the Company paid $1,000,000 in cash and issued warrants to purchase 666,600 shares of common stock (Note 10) to the placement agent as a
	commission for the offering. The fair value of the warrants issued to the placement agent of $1,001,471 has been recorded as a charge to paid in capital.




	        In
	connection with the offering the Company recorded debt issuance costs of $1,011,000 including $1,000,000 in broker fees and $11,000 in other fees incurred. Debt issuance costs are
	being amortized to interest expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the notes. As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the unamortized portion of debt issuance costs
	amounted to $910,466 and $204,703, respectively. The Company recorded expense of $99,977 related to the accretion of the discount for the three months ended March 31, 2017.




	        In
	accordance with ASC 470, the proceeds from the sale of the convertible notes was allocated between the conversion feature and the warrants based on the fair values of the debt
	instrument without the
	warrants and of the warrants themselves at the time of issuance. The fair value of the beneficial conversion feature of $5,306,456, has been recorded as a reduction of the carrying value of the
	convertible promissory notes and is being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the notes. The fair value of the warrants of $3,682,544, has been recorded
	as a reduction to the carrying value of the convertible promissory notes and is being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the notes.

	        The
	fair value of each share-based award was estimated on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes pricing model that incorporates key assumptions including volatility, dividend
	yield and risk-free interest rates. As the Company's common stock has limited historical trading data, the expected stock price volatility is based primarily on the historical volatility of a group of
	publicly-traded companies that share similar operating metrics and histories. The expected term of the awards represents the period of time that management anticipates awards will be outstanding. As
	there was insufficient historical data available to ascertain a forfeiture rate, the plain vanilla method was applied in calculating the expected term of the options. The risk-free rates for the
	periods within the contractual life of the options are based on the US Treasury bond rate in effect at the time of the grant for bonds with maturity dates at the expected term of the options. The
	Company has never paid dividends on its common stock and currently does not intend to do so, and as such, the expected dividend yield is zero. Compensation expense related to stock options was
	recorded net of estimated forfeitures, which for options remaining at March 31, 2017, was $nil.

	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM





	To
	the Board of Directors and Shareholders

	PetroShare Corp.




	        We
	have audited the accompanying balance sheets of PetroShare Corp. as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 and the related statements of operations, shareholders' equity, and cash flows
	for the years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.




	        We
	conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
	obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal
	control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances,
	but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
	Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
	principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.




	        In
	our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of PetroShare Corp. as of December 31, 2016 and 2015,
	and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

	PetroShare Corp.


	NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


	December 31, 2016 and 2015








	NOTE 1ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS





	        PetroShare Corp. ("PetroShare" or the "Company") is a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Colorado on September 4, 2012 to investigate, acquire and develop crude
	oil and natural gas properties in the Rocky Mountain or mid-continent portion of the United States. Since inception, the Company has focused on financing activities and the acquisition, exploration
	and development of crude oil and natural gas prospects. The Company's current development focus is on the Denver-Julesburg basin in the State of Colorado. The Company realized its first significant
	revenue in 2016, following the acquisition of certain oil and gas producing properties.






	NOTE 2BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES








	Basis of Presentation






	        The Company prepares its financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
	("US GAAP").







	Business Combinations






	        The Company accounts for the acquisition of oil and gas properties, that are not commonly controlled, based on the requirements of the Financial
	Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, which requires an acquiring entity to recognize the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value under the
	acquisition method of accounting, provided such assets and liabilities qualify for acquisition accounting under the standard. The Company accounts for certain property acquisitions of proved developed
	oil and gas property as business combinations.







	Use of Estimates






	        The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
	reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
	reporting period




	        Estimated
	quantities of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves are the most significant of the Company's estimates. All reserve data included in these financial
	statements are based on estimates. Reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. There are numerous
	uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data
	and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. As a result, reserve estimates may be different from the quantities of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids that are ultimately
	recovered.




	        Other
	items subject to estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, the carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment, asset retirement obligations, valuation
	allowances for deferred income tax assets and valuation assumptions related to the Company's share-based compensation. Management evaluates estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using
	historical experience and other factors, including the current economic and commodity price environment. The

	volatility
	of commodity prices results in increased uncertainty inherent in such estimates and assumptions. See



	Unaudited Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserve
	Information



	. (Note 15)







	Loss Per Common Share






	        Basic and diluted loss per share attributable to PetroShare shareholders is computed by dividing net (loss) by the weighted average number of
	common shares outstanding during
	the period. The Company excluded potentially dilutive securities as shown below, as the effect of their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.

	Cash






	        The Company's bank accounts periodically exceed federally insured limits. The Company maintains its deposits with high quality financial
	institutions and, accordingly, believes its credit risk exposure associated with cash is minimal.







	Revenue Recognition






	        The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs when production is delivered to, and title has transferred to,
	the purchaser and to the extent the selling price is reasonably determinable. In general, settlements for hydrocarbon sales may occur after the month in which the oil, natural gas or other hydrocarbon
	products were produced. The Company may estimate and accrue for the value of these sales using information available to it at the time its financial statements are generated. Differences are reflected
	in the accounting period that payments are received from the purchaser.







	Accounts ReceivableCrude oil, natural gas and NGLs






	        Accounts receivableCrude oil, natural gas and NGLs consists of amounts receivable from sales from the Company's well interests.
	Management continually monitors accounts receivable for collectability.

	NOTE 2BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)








	Accounts ReceivableJoint interest billing






	        Accounts receivableJoint interest billing consists primarily of joint interest billings, which are recorded at the invoiced and
	to-be-invoiced amounts. Collateral is not required for such receivables, nor is interest charged on past due balances. Joint interest billing receivables are collateralized by the pro rata revenue
	attributable to the joint interest holders and further by the interest itself.







	Deferred Offering Costs






	        The Company defers as other current assets the direct incremental costs of raising capital through equity offerings until such time as the
	offering is completed. At the time of the completion of the offering, the costs are charged against the capital raised. Should the offering be terminated, deferred offering costs are charged to
	operations during the period in which the offering is terminated. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company charged $544,070 in deferred offering costs to operations, as the offering
	was terminated. As of December 31, 2016, the Company's deferred offering costs totaled $nil, with $nil recorded as of December 31, 2015.







	Debt Issuance Costs






	        Debt issuance costs include origination and other fees incurred in connection with the Company's private placement and with the origination of
	the Company's supplemental line of credit. Debt issuance costs related to the private placement are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the respective borrowing
	term.







	Crude Oil and Natural Gas Properties








	Proved





	        The Company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for its crude oil and natural gas properties. Under this method of accounting,
	all property acquisition costs and development costs are capitalized when incurred and depleted on a units-of-production basis over the remaining life of proved reserves and proved developed reserves,
	respectively. Costs of drilling exploratory wells are initially capitalized but are charged to expense if the well is determined to be unsuccessful.




	        The
	Company assesses its proved crude oil and natural gas properties for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be
	recoverable. The impairment test compares estimated undiscounted future net cash flows to the assets' net book value. If the net capitalized costs exceed estimated future net cash flows, then the cost
	of the property is written down to fair value. Fair value for crude oil and natural gas properties is generally determined based on estimated discounted future net cash flows. Impairment expense for
	proved properties is reported in exploration and impairment expense.




	        The
	net carrying values of retired, sold or abandoned properties that constitute less than a complete unit of depreciable property are charged or credited, net of proceeds, to
	accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization unless doing so significantly affects the unit-of-production

	PetroShare Corp.






	NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)






	December 31, 2016 and 2015







	NOTE 2BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)





	amortization
	rate, in which case a gain or loss is recognized in the statement of operations. Gains or losses from the disposal of complete units of depreciable property are recognized in earnings
	(loss).






	Unproved





	        Unproved properties consist of costs to acquire undeveloped leases as well as costs to acquire unproved reserves. Undeveloped lease costs and
	unproved reserve acquisitions are capitalized, and individually insignificant unproved properties are amortized on a composite basis, based on past success, past experience and average lease-term
	lives. The Company evaluates significant unproved properties for impairment based on remaining lease term, drilling results, reservoir performance, seismic interpretation or future plans to develop
	acreage. When successful wells are drilled on undeveloped leaseholds, unproved property costs are reclassified as proved properties and depleted on a unit-of- production basis. Impairment expense for
	unproved properties is reported in exploration and impairment expense.






	Exploratory





	        Geological and geophysical costs, including exploratory seismic studies, and the costs of carrying and retaining unproved acreage are expensed
	as incurred. Costs of seismic studies that are utilized in development drilling within an area of proved reserves are capitalized as development costs. Amounts of seismic costs capitalized are based
	on only those blocks of data used in determining development well locations. To the extent that a seismic project covers areas of both developmental and exploratory drilling, those seismic costs are
	proportionately allocated between development costs and exploration expense.




	        Costs
	of drilling exploratory wells are initially capitalized, pending determination of whether the well contains proved reserves. If an exploratory well does not contain proved
	reserves, the costs of drilling the well and other associated costs are charged to expense. Costs incurred for exploratory wells that contain reserves, which cannot yet be classified as proved,
	continue to be capitalized if (a) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well, and (b) the Company is making sufficient progress
	assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. If either condition is not met, or if the Company obtains information that raises substantial
	doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project, the exploratory well costs, net of any salvage value, are expensed.







	Property, Plant and Equipment






	        Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using straight-line methods over the
	estimated useful lives of the related assets. Expenditures for renewals and betterments which increase the estimated useful life or capacity of the asset are capitalized; expenditures for repairs and
	maintenance are expensed when incurred.

	NOTE 2BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)








	Asset Impairment






	        Proved crude oil and natural gas properties are reviewed for impairment on a field-by-field basis each quarter, or when events and circumstances
	indicate a possible decline in the recoverability of the carrying value of such field. The estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected in connection with the field are compared to the carrying
	amount of the field to determine if the carrying amount is recoverable. If the carrying amount of the field exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, the carrying amount of the field is
	reduced to its estimated fair value. Due to the unavailability of relevant comparable market data, a discounted cash flow method is used to determine the fair value of proved properties. The
	discounted cash flow method utilizes the most recent third party reserve estimation report and estimates future cash flows based on management's estimates of future crude oil and natural gas
	production, commodity prices based on commodity futures price strips, operating and development costs, and a risk-adjusted discount rate. The Company recognized impairment expense of $116,303 during
	the year ended December 31, 2016, while expense of $154,776 was recorded in 2015.







	Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization






	        Depreciation, depletion and amortization of capitalized drilling and development costs of producing crude oil and natural gas properties,
	including related support equipment and facilities, are computed using the unit-of-production method on a field basis based on total estimated proved developed crude oil and natural gas reserves.
	Amortization of producing leaseholds is based on the unit-of-production method using total estimated proved reserves. In arriving at rates under the unit-of-production method, the quantities of
	recoverable crude oil and natural gas reserves are established based on estimates made by the Company and external independent reserve engineers. Upon sale or retirement of properties, the cost and
	related accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization are eliminated from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognized. Unit of production rates are revised whenever there
	is an indication of a need, but at least in conjunction with annual reserve reports. Revisions are accounted for prospectively as changes in accounting estimates. Depletion expense for the year ended
	December 31, 2016 was $59,262, and expense of $9,898 was recorded in 2015.







	Prepaid Drilling Costs






	        Prepaid drilling costs consist of cash payments made by the Company to the operators of oil and gas properties and other third party service
	providers.







	Drilling Advancesrelated party






	        The Company's drilling advances consist of cash provided to the Company from its joint interest partners for planned drilling activities.
	Advances are applied against the joint interest partner's share of expenses incurred. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, drilling advances totaled $234,452 and $nil, respectively.

	NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)






	December 31, 2016 and 2015







	NOTE 2BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)








	Income Taxes






	        The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and
	liabilities using the enacted tax rates that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to be recovered. The Company provides a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for
	which it does not consider realization of such assets to be more likely than not.







	Asset Retirement Obligation






	        Asset retirement obligations associated with tangible long-lived assets are accounted for in accordance with ASC 410, "Accounting for Asset
	Retirement Obligations." The estimated fair value of the future costs associated with dismantlement, abandonment and restoration of crude oil and natural gas properties is recorded generally upon the
	completion of a well. The net estimated costs are discounted to present values using a risk adjusted rate over the estimated economic life of the crude oil and natural gas properties. Such costs are
	capitalized as part of the related asset. The asset is depleted on the units-of-production method. The liability is periodically adjusted to reflect: (1) new liabilities incurred;
	(2) liabilities settled during the period; (3) accretion expense; and (4) revisions to estimated future cash flow requirements. The accretion expense is recorded as a component of
	depreciation, depletion, accretion and amortization expense in the accompanying statements of operations.







	Share Based Compensation






	        The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair-value of stock-based awards in accordance with ASC 718,
	"Compensation." The option-pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the option's expected life, the price volatility of the underlying stock, and the estimated
	dividend yield of the underlying stock. The Company's expected term represents the period that stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding and is determined based on the contractual terms of the
	stock-based awards, vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior as influenced by changes to the terms of its stock-based awards. As there was insufficient historical data available
	to ascertain a forfeiture rate, the plain vanilla method was applied in calculating the expected term of the options. The Company's common stock has limited historical trading data, and as a result
	the expected stock price volatility is based on the
	historical volatility of a group of publicly traded companies that share similar operating metrics and histories. The Company has never paid dividends on its common stock and does not intend to do so
	in the foreseeable future, and as such, the expected dividend yield is zero.







	Loans and Borrowings






	        Borrowings are recognized initially at fair value, net of financing costs incurred, and subsequently measured at amortized cost. Any difference
	between the amounts originally received and the redemption value of the debt is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations over the period to maturity using the effective interest method.

	Fair Value of Financial Instruments






	        Fair value accounting, as prescribed in ASC Section 825, utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation
	techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the
	lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:






















	Level 1




	 




	Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities;







	Level 2





	 





	Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability; and







	Level 3





	 





	Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (supported by little or no market activity).













	Going Concern Assessment






	        Pursuant to ASU 2014-15, the Company has assessed its ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the date of the
	issuance of these financial statements. Substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern exists when relevant conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, indicate
	that it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year from the financial statement issuance date. As shown in the accompanying financial
	statements, the Company incurred a net loss of $4,481,272 during the year ended December 31, 2016, and as of that date, the Company's current liabilities exceeded its current assets by
	$6,115,501.




	        Management
	has evaluated these conditions and determined that a reduction in the working capital deficit subsequent to December 31, 2016 related to a private placement
	(Note 6) and an extension and amendment to the Company's supplemental line of credit (Note 6), coupled with anticipated increased revenues from the Company's non-operated and operated
	properties, will allow the Company to meet its maturing debt and interest obligations and continue as a going concern through March 31, 2018.




	        As
	part of the analysis, the Company considered selective participation in certain non-operated drilling programs based on availability of working capital and the timing of production
	related cash flows.







	Recent Accounting Pronouncements









	Standards Adopted in 2016







	        Debt Issuance Costs



	In April 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in the financial statements.
	Under this updated guidance, debt issuance costs are presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs is reported
	as interest expense. In August 2015, the

	December 31, 2016 and 2015







	NOTE 2BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)





	FASB
	subsequently issued a clarification as to the handling of debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements that allows the presentation of these costs as an asset. The standards update
	was effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company adopted this standards update, as required, effective January 1, 2016. The adoption of this
	standards update did not affect the Company's method of amortizing debt issuance costs and did not have a material impact on its financial statements.





	        Measurement-Period Adjustments



	In September 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance that eliminates the requirement to restate prior periods to reflect
	adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination. The updated guidance requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the
	measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The standards update was effective prospectively for interim and annual periods beginning after
	December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this standard update, as required, effective January 1, 2016, which did not have a material impact on its financial
	statements.





	        Stock Compensation



	In March 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance on share-based payment accounting. The standards update is intended to simplify
	several areas of accounting for share-based compensation arrangements, including the income tax impact, classification on the statement of cash flows and forfeitures. The standards update is effective
	for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 with early adoption permitted. The Company elected to
	early-adopt this standards update as of April 1, 2016 in connection with its initial grant of awards under the Company's 2015 Equity Incentive Plan. The Company has elected to record the impact
	of forfeitures on compensation cost as they occur. The Company is also permitted to withhold income taxes upon settlement of equity-classified awards at up to the maximum statutory tax rates. There
	was no retrospective adjustment as the Company did not have any forfeitures nor settlements outstanding equity awards prior to adoption.





	        Going Concern Analysis



	In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, "Presentation of Financial StatementsGoing Concern
	(Subtopic 205-40)." The new guidance addresses management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern and in certain
	circumstances to provide related footnote disclosures. The standard is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016 and for annual and interim periods thereafter. The Company
	adopted this standard as required, which did not have a material impact on its financial statements.







	Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted






	        Various accounting standards and interpretations were issued in 2016 with effective dates subsequent to December 31, 2016. The Company
	has evaluated the recently issued accounting pronouncements that are effective in 2016 and believe that none of them will have a material effect on the Company's financial position, results of
	operations or cash flows when adopted.

	NOTE 2BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)





	        In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers." The standard requires an entity to recognize revenue in a
	manner that depicts the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU
	No. 2014-09 will supersede most of the existing revenue recognition requirements in US GAAP when it becomes effective and is required to be adopted using one of two retrospective
	application methods. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, "Revenue from Contracts with CustomersDeferral of the Effective Date," which approved a one year deferral of
	ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted as of the original effective date
	for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the method of adoption and
	impact this standard will have on its financial statements and related disclosures.




	        In
	February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The standard requires lessees to recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from leases on the balance sheet. A
	lessee should recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for
	the lease term. The new guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The amendments should be applied at the beginning of the earliest
	period presented using a modified retrospective approach with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact
	of the new guidance on its financial statements.




	        Further,
	the Company is monitoring the joint standard-setting efforts of the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board. There are a large number of pending accounting
	standards that are being targeted for completion in 2017 and beyond, including, but not limited to, standards relating to revenue recognition, accounting for leases, fair value measurements,
	accounting for financial instruments, disclosure of loss contingencies and financial statement presentation. Because these
	pending standards have not yet been finalized, at this time the Company is not able to determine the potential future impact that these standards will have, if any, on its financial position, results
	of operations or cash flows.






	NOTE 3ACQUISITIONS







	PDC Acquisition





	        On June 30, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of certain oil and gas assets from PDC Energy, Inc. ("PDC"), including
	leases covering approximately 3,652 gross (1,410 net) acres of lands located in Adams County, Colorado and PDC's interest in 35 producing wells ("PDC assets"). Simultaneous with the closing, the
	Company's working interest partner and primary lender exercised its option under a participation agreement (the "Participation Agreement") (Note 12) and acquired 50% of the Company's interest
	in the PDC assets. The acquisition was effective April 1, 2016.

	        Following

	NOTE 3ACQUISITIONS (Continued)







	2016 Activity





	        On March 10, 2016, the Company acquired certain surface rights and easements on lands located in Township 1 South, Range 67 West located
	on its Todd Creek Farms prospect in exchange for $184,360 in cash. The surface rights and easements permit the Company to access its Shook well pad.




	        On
	March 31, 2016, the Company acquired oil and gas assets on land adjacent to the Company's Todd Creek Farms prospect, including approximately 160 net acres and a 50% working
	interest in one well following an assignment to the Company's working interest partner pursuant to the Participation Agreement. The Company's net cost for the foregoing assets was $590,274.




	        On
	April 14, 2016, the Company acquired oil and gas leases in the Todd Creek Farms prospect covering approximately 189 net acres. The Company's net cost for the leases was
	$288,056.




	        In
	connection with obtaining its supplemental line of credit (Note 6), the Company assigned Providence Energy Partners III, LP ("PEP III") 10% of the Company's working
	interest in 278 gross (170 net) net acres in the Wattenberg Field including the Company's interest in the Jacobucci wells.




	        On
	October 14, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of additional royalty interests in 10 Jacobucci pad horizontal wells located on its Todd Creek Farms
	prospect. The Company's net cost for the royalty interests was $1.55 million, which the Company paid using a draw under its supplemental line of credit.






	2015 Activity





	        On May 15, 2015, the Company acquired approximately 1,280 gross acres (171 net acres) located in the Todd Creek Farms Prospect. The
	Company paid $785,630 and Kingdom conveyed to the Company an 80% net revenue interest in the acreage after accounting for landowner and other royalties. Pursuant to the provisions of the Participation
	Agreement, executed in connection with the Company's initial line of credit (See Note 6), the Company assigned the right to acquire up to 50% of its interest in the Todd Creek Farms prospect to
	Providence in part consideration for extending the Company the initial line of credit, which Providence exercised with an effective date of June 1, 2015. The Company recorded the exercise of
	the option by reducing its acquisition costs in the Kingdom Lease by 50%. A reduction of acquisition costs in the amount of $287,815 was recorded, comprised of $392,815 net of $105,000 related to a
	one-time credit issued to the lender pursuant to the provisions of the Participation Agreement. The Company has recorded the net assignment of interest to Providence as a $287,815 non-cash payment
	against the initial line of credit.




	        Between
	May 15, 2015 and December 31, 2015, the Company acquired approximately 77 additional net acres in the Todd Creek Prospect area and, as of December 31, 2015,
	the Todd Creek Farms prospect area covers approximately 1,460 gross and 244 net acres.

	NOTE 6DEBT (revised)







	Line of credit





	        On May 13, 2015, the Company entered into a Revolving Line of Credit Facility Agreement ("initial line of credit") with Providence, which
	provides to the Company a revolving line of credit of up to $5,000,000. As of December 31, 2016, the outstanding balance on the initial line of credit was $5,000,000 plus accrued interest of
	$302,477. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company borrowed $3,937,815 on the initial line of credit, primarily to fund the acquisition and development of crude oil and natural gas
	properties (Note 3 and Note 12). During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded interest expense of $253,875 related to the initial line of credit.




	        Interest
	on the outstanding principal balance of the initial line of credit begins accruing on the dates of advancements of principal at an annual rate equal to 8.0% simple interest. The
	Company is obligated to pay interest monthly after the Company receives its first production payment from a well associated with the Participation Agreement and/or in which the Company has or has had
	a working interest and in accordance with the terms of the promissory note.






	Supplemental line of credit





	        On October 13, 2016, the Company entered into a revolving line of credit facility agreement (the "supplemental line of credit") with
	Providence Energy Partners III, LP ("PEP III"). PEP III is an affiliate of Providence by virtue of having some common management personnel. The supplemental line of credit permitted the Company
	to borrow up to $10.0 million to pay costs associated with its acquisition and development of oil and gas properties in the Wattenberg Field. The original maturity date for the supplemental
	line of credit was April 13, 2017.




	        As
	amended on March 30, 2017, the Company agreed to repay $3,552,500 in outstanding principal not later than April 13, 2017 and not to borrow additional funds in exchange
	for PEP III extending the maturity date of the supplemental line of credit until June 13, 2017. (Note 14)

	NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)






	December 31, 2016 and 2015







	NOTE 6DEBT (revised) (Continued)





	        As
	of December 31, 2016, the outstanding balance on the supplemental line of credit was $7,088,698 net of deferred financing fees of $16,302, plus accrued interest of $50,422.
	During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company borrowed $7,105,000 under the supplemental line of credit, primarily to fund the acquisition and development of crude oil and natural gas
	properties (Note 3 and Note 12). During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded interest expense of $50,422 related to the supplemental line of credit.






	Convertible notes





	        On December 30, 2016, the Company completed the first closing of a private placement of 200 units, each unit consisting of a
	convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $50,000 ("Notes") and 33,333 common stock purchase warrants ("Warrants"). Each Note sold in the private placement is one of a series of similar
	Notes designated the "10% Unsecured Convertible Promissory Notes" with the series totaling $10,000,000. The Notes bear interest at the rate of 10% per year and are due and payable on
	December 31, 2018. Interest is payable semi-annually beginning June 30, 2017 and until the Notes are paid in full. At any time after issuance, the principal amount of the Notes and any
	accrued but unpaid interest are convertible into shares of the Company's common stock at the option of the holder at the rate of $1.50 per share. Each Warrant allows the holder to purchase one share
	of the Company's common stock at a price of $3.00 per share at any time on or before December 31, 2019. (Note 9)




	        Related
	to the December 31, 2016 closing, the Company sold 38.85 units consisting of $1,942,600 principal amount of Notes and Warrants to purchase 1,294,987 shares of common
	stock. The Company received gross proceeds of $1,942,600 and net proceeds of $1,747,340 after placement agent fees and expenses. The Company also issued warrants to purchase 129,526 shares of common
	stock to the placement agent. (Note 9).




	        In
	connection with the first closing the Company recorded debt issuance costs of $205,260 including broker fees and $11,000 in other fees incurred. Debt issuance costs are being
	amortized to interest expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the notes. As of December 31, 2016, the unamortized portion of debt issuance costs amounted to $204,703.




	        In
	accordance with ASC 470, the proceeds from the sale of the convertible notes was allocated between the conversion feature and the warrants based on the fair values of the debt
	instrument without the warrants and of the warrants themselves at the time of issuance. The fair value of the beneficial conversion feature of $1,033,586 has been recorded as a reduction of the
	carrying value of the convertible promissory notes and is being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the notes. The fair value of the warrants of $703,753
	has been recorded as a reduction to the carrying value of the convertible promissory notes and is being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the notes.




	        As
	of December 31, 2016, the Company recorded accrued interest of $1,064 and recognized interest expense of $1,064 related to the convertible notes. The Company recognized
	interest expense of $5,308 in relation to the accretion of the debt discount costs.

	        The
	fair value of each share-based award was estimated on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes pricing model that incorporates key assumptions including volatility, dividend
	yield and risk-free interest rates. As the Company's common stock has limited historical trading data, the expected stock price volatility is based primarily on the historical volatility of a group of
	publicly-traded companies that share similar operating metrics and histories. The expected term of the awards represents the period of time that management anticipates awards will be outstanding. As
	there was insufficient historical data available to ascertain a forfeiture rate, the plain vanilla method was applied in calculating the expected term of the options. The risk-free rates for the
	periods within the contractual life of the options are based on the US Treasury bond rate in effect at the time of the grant for bonds with maturity dates at the expected term of the options. The
	Company has never paid dividends on its common stock and currently does not intend to do so, and as such, the expected dividend yield is zero. Compensation expense related to stock options was
	recorded net of estimated forfeitures, which for options remaining at December 31, 2016, the Company expects no additional forfeitures.

	table below summarizes assumptions utilized in the Black-Scholes pricing model for the years ended 2016 and 2015:

	NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

	NOTE 10STOCK BASED COMPENSATION (Continued)





	        During
	the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded share-based compensation of $1,140,967 and $191,205, respectively. Unvested share-based compensation at
	December 31, 2016 amounted to $1,434,961.






	NOTE 11PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES





	        Deferred taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards and
	deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax basis.
	Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.




	        The
	Company has analyzed filing positions in all of the federal and state jurisdictions where it is required to file income tax returns, as well as all open tax years in these
	jurisdictions. No uncertain tax positions have been identified as of December 31, 2016.




	        The
	Company is in a position of cumulative reporting losses for the current and preceding reporting periods. The volatility of energy prices is not readily determinable by management. At
	this date, this fact pattern does not allow the Company to project sufficient sources of future taxable income to offset tax loss carry-forwards and net deferred tax assets. Under these circumstances,
	it is management's opinion that the realization of these tax attributes does not reach the "more likely than not criteria" under ASC 740, "Income Taxes." As a result, the Company's deferred tax assets
	as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 are subject to a full valuation allowance.

	NOTE 14SUBSEQUENT EVENTS (Continued)







	Pending Acquisitions





	        On February 23, 2017 the Company entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with an independent third party seller to acquire oil and gas
	leases totaling approximately 5,879 gross (2,930 net) acres, with an average net revenue interest of 84%, located in Weld and Adams Counties, Colorado. The total purchase price for the leases
	and associated assets is $2,582,500. Providence has agreed to purchase a 50% interest in the assets, which would reduce the Company's interest to 1,465 net acres. Subject to satisfaction of closing
	conditions, the Company will pay approximately $460,000 in cash and issue 450,000 shares of its common stock to the seller for its 50% share of the acquisition.




	        On
	March 16, 2017, the Company entered into a Letter Agreement with an independent third party seller to acquire an 18.75% royalty interest covering approximately 291 net acres,
	located in Adams County, Colorado. The total purchase price for the interests is $1,138,800. If completed, the transaction will be effective April 1, 2017. If completed, the Company may sell
	50% of its acquired interest to Providence.






	NOTE 15UNAUDITED CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES INFORMATION





	        The reserves at December 31, 2016, presented below were prepared by the independent engineering firm Cawley, Gillespie & Associates Inc. All reserves are located
	within the DJ Basin. Proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves are the estimated quantities of oil, natural gas and NGLs which geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to
	be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions (i.e., prices and costs) existing at the time the estimate is made. Proved developed oil, natural
	gas and NGL reserves are proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells and equipment in place and under operating methods being utilized at the time the estimates were
	made. A variety of methodologies are used to determine the proved reserve estimates. The principal methodologies employed are decline curve analysis, advance production type curve matching, petro
	physics/log analysis and analogy. Some combination of these methods is used to determine reserve estimates in substantially all of the Company's fields. The Company emphasizes that reserve estimates
	are inherently imprecise and that estimates of new discoveries and undeveloped locations are more imprecise than estimates of established proved producing oil and gas properties. Accordingly, these
	estimates are expected to change as future information becomes available.




	        As
	the result of volatile crude oil prices coupled with nominal estimated reserve volumes, the Company's management deemed that is was not economically prudent to obtain a reserve report
	for the year December 31, 2015. Based on management's analysis, as of December 31, 2015, the Company has ascribed no value related to proved reserves. At December 31, 2014, the
	Company had ascribed a nominal value to the standardized measure of estimated discounted future net cash flows related to its reserves.

	NOTE 15UNAUDITED CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES INFORMATION (Continued)





	        The
	values for the 2016 oil, natural gas and NGL reserves are based on the 12-month arithmetic average of the first day of the month prices for the period from January through
	December 31, 2016. The unweighted arithmetic average first-day-of-the-month prices for the prior twelve months were $42.75 per barrel (West Texas Intermediate price) for crude oil and NGLs and
	$2.48 per MMBtu (Henry Hub price) for natural gas. All prices are then further adjusted for transportation, quality and basis differentials. The average resulting price used as of December 31,
	2016 was $34.09 per barrel for oil, $2.69 per Mcf for natural gas and $14.44 per barrel for NGLs.




	        The
	Company did not ascribe a value to its proved reserves as of December 31, 2015 due to immaterial quantity estimates and a volatile price environment.




	        The
	values for the 2014 oil and natural gas reserves are based on the 12- month arithmetic average of the first day of the month prices for the period January through December, 31, 2014.
	The unweighted arithmetic average first-day-of-the-month prices for the prior twelve months were $94.99 per barrel (West Texas Intermediate price) for crude oil and NGLs and $4.35 per MMBtu (Henry Hub
	price) for natural gas. All prices are then further adjusted for transportation, quality and basis differentials.




	        For
	the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company reported extensions and discoveries of 6,030,624 BOE as a result of drilling and completion activities during 2016. Additionally,
	during 2016 the Company purchased reserves of 287,999 BOE.




	        For
	the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company had downward revisions of previous estimates of 122 BOE. The Company ascribed no value related to proved reserves at
	December 31, 2015.




	        For
	the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company reported extensions discoveries of 250 BOE related to the drilling and completion of two wells.






	Standardized Measure of Estimated Discounted Future Net Cash Flows to Proved Oil and Natural Gas
	Reserves (in thousands):





	        The Company follows the guidelines prescribed in ASC 932,



	Extractive ActivitiesOil and
	Gas



	for computing a standardized measure of future net cash flows and changes therein relating to estimated proved reserves. The following summarizes the policies used in the
	preparation of the accompanying oil, natural gas and NGL reserve disclosures, standardized measures of discounted future net cash flows from proved oil, natural gas and NGL reserves and the
	reconciliations of standardized measures from year to year.




	        The
	information is based on estimates of proved reserves attributable to the Company's interest in oil and gas properties as of December 31 of the years presented. These estimates
	were prepared by Cawley Gillespie & Associates, Inc., independent petroleum engineers.




	        The
	standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from production of proved reserves was developed as follows: (1) estimates are made of quantities of proved reserves
	and future periods during which they are expected to be produced based on year-end economic conditions; (2) the estimated future cash flows are compiled by applying the twelve month average of
	the first of the

	NOTE 15UNAUDITED CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES INFORMATION (Continued)





	month
	prices of crude oil and natural gas relating to the Company's proved reserves to the year-end quantities of those reserves for reserves; (3) the future cash flows are reduced by estimated
	production costs, costs to develop and produce the proved reserves and abandonment costs, all based on year-end economic conditions, plus Company overhead incurred; and (4) future net cash
	flows are discounted to present value by applying a discount rate of 10%.




	        The
	assumptions used to compute the standardized measure are those prescribed by the FASB and the SEC. These assumptions do not necessarily reflect the Company's expectations of actual
	revenues to be derived from those reserves, nor their present value. The limitations inherent in the reserve quantity estimation process, as discussed previously, are equally applicable to the
	standardized measure computations, since these reserve quantity estimates are the basis for the valuation process. The Company emphasizes that reserve estimates are inherently imprecise and that
	estimates of new discoveries and undeveloped locations are more imprecise than estimates of established proved producing oil and gas properties. The standardized measure of discounted future net cash
	flows does
	not purport, nor should it be interpreted, to present the fair value of the Company's oil and natural gas reserves. An estimate of fair value would also take into account, among other things, the
	recovery of reserves not presently classified as proved, anticipated future changes in prices and costs and a discount factor more representative of the time value of money and the risks inherent in
	reserve estimates.

	NOTE 16REVISION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR DECEMBER 31, 2016





	        In connection with the preparation of its condensed financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, the Company identified an error related to the manner in which it
	accounted for the fair value of convertible promissory notes and warrants issued in the Company's private placement during December 2016 (Note 6). Specifically, the Company was required to
	apply the guidance of FASB ASC 470, and more specifically, ASC 470-20-25-2 and ASC 470-20-25-3. On the balance sheet at December 31, 2016, the Company recorded the face value of convertible
	notes payable issued in connection with the private placement under liabilities, discounted by (i) the value of the original issue discount and (ii) the value of the warrants issued to
	the placement agent. The Company did not, however, discount the value of the convertible notes payable by the fair value of the warrants issued to individual investors.




	        In
	accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") No. 99,



	Materiality,



	and SAB No. 108,



	Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying
	Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements,



	the Company evaluated the error
	and determined that the related impact was not material to the Company's results of operations or financial position for any prior annual or interim period. Accordingly, the Company corrected these
	errors for the year ended December 31, 2016 by revising the condensed interim financial statements.

	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITOR





	To
	the Board of Directors and Shareholders

	PetroShare Corp.




	        We
	have audited the accompanying statement of revenues and direct operating expenses of certain assets acquired from PDC Energy, Inc. (the "PDC Assets") for the years ended
	December 31, 2015 and 2014. These financial statements are the responsibility of the management of PetroShare Corp. (the "Company"). Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
	financial statements based on our audit.







	Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statement






	        Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the statement of revenues and direct operating expenses in accordance
	with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair
	presentation of the statement of revenues and direct operating expenses that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.







	Auditor's Responsibility






	        Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the statement of revenues and direct operating expenses based on our audit. We conducted our
	audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
	the statement of revenues and direct operating expenses is free from material misstatement.




	        An
	audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment,
	including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control
	relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
	expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal controls of the PDC Assets. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting
	policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.




	        We
	believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.







	Opinion






	        In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the statements of revenues and direct
	operating expenses of the PDC Assets for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.







	Emphasis of Matter






	        The accompanying statements of revenues and direct operating expenses were prepared for the purpose of complying with the rules and regulations
	of the Securities and Exchange Commission for

	PDC Assets






	Notes to Statements of Revenues and Direct Operating Expenses







	NOTE 1ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF OPERATIONS





	        PetroShare Corp. ("PetroShare" or the "Company") is a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Colorado on September 4, 2012 to investigate, acquire and develop crude
	oil and natural gas properties in the Rocky Mountain or mid-continent portion of the United States. Since inception, PetroShare has focused on financing activities and the acquisition, exploration and
	development of crude oil and natural gas prospects in the Rocky Mountain and mid-continent region of the United States. The Company's recent focus is on the Wattenberg Field, part of the
	Denver-Julesburg Basin in northeast Colorado. The Company recently acquired certain crude oil and natural gas properties located in Adams County, Colorado from PDC Energy, Inc. ("PDC"). The
	accompanying financial statements represent the revenues and direct operating expenses of the properties acquired.






	NOTE 2ACQUISITION





	        On June 30, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of certain oil and gas assets from PDC, including leases covering approximately 3,652 gross (1,410 net) acres of lands
	located in Adams County, Colorado and PDC's interest in 35 currently-producing wells (collectively, the "PDC assets"). Simultaneous with the closing, the Company's principal lender, Providence Energy
	Operators, LLC
	("Providence"), exercised its option under a participation agreement and acquired 50% of the interest the Company acquired in the PDC assets. The acquisition was effective April 1, 2016.




	        The
	gross purchase price for the PDC assets was $4,611,833 after a holdback allowance of $542,797 associated with certain title defects. Following Providence's exercise of its option
	under the participation agreement, the net purchase price to the Company was $2,305,917. The gross purchase price may be adjusted upwards to $5,154,630 if PDC completes certain title curative actions
	within 90 days following closing. The purchase price is also subject to certain post-closing adjustments based on a final proration of costs and revenues from operation of the assets following
	the effective date. The post-closing adjustment is scheduled 90 days after the acquisition date, or September 28, 2016.




	        The
	acquisition was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") No. 805,



	Business
	Combinations



	, which among other things requires the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured and recorded at their fair values as of the acquisition date.






	NOTE 3SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES







	Basis of presentation





	        The accompanying Statements of Revenues and Direct Operating Expenses and related notes present the revenues and direct operating expenses
	related to the PDC assets for the six month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 (unaudited) and for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, and have been derived from historical
	data related to the PDC assets. Revenues relate to the
	historical net revenue interests and net working interests acquired by the Company. Direct operating expenses include lease operating expenses, production and ad valorem taxes, transportation and all
	other direct operating costs associated with the PDC assets.




	        The
	Statements of Revenues and Direct Operating Expenses are presented because it is not practicable to obtain full historical audited financial statements with respect to the PDC
	assets. The Statements of Revenues and Direct Operating Expenses are not indicative of the financial condition or results of operations of the PDC assets going forward due to the omission of various
	operating




	F-57












	PDC Assets






	Notes to Statements of Revenues and Direct Operating Expenses (Continued)







	NOTE 3SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)





	expenses.
	During the periods presented, the PDC assets were not accounted for as a separate business unit. As such, certain costs, such as depreciation, depletion and amortization of oil and gas
	properties, accretion of asset retirement obligations, general and administrative expenses, interest expense and income taxes were not allocated to the PDC assets.




	        The
	preparation of the Statements of Revenues and Direct Operating Expenses in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("US GAAP")
	required management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and operating expenses during the reporting periods. Although these estimates are based on
	management's best available knowledge of current and future events, actual results could be different from those estimates.






	Revenue recognition





	        Oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids revenues are recognized under the sales method when production is sold to a purchaser at a fixed or
	determinable price, when delivery has occurred and title has transferred, and if collectability of the revenue is probable. Revenues are reported net of overriding and other royalties due to third
	parties.






	NOTE 4OMITTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION





	        Historical financial statements reflecting financial position, results of operations and cash flows required by US GAAP are not presented as such information was not available on
	a property-by-property basis, nor is it practicable to obtain such information in these circumstances. Historically, no allocation of general and administrative, interest expense, corporate taxes,
	accretion of asset retirement obligations, and depreciation, depletion and amortization of oil and gas properties was made to the PDC assets. Accordingly, the Statements of Revenues and Direct
	Operating Expenses are presented in lieu of the financial statements required under Rules 3-01 and 3-02 of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation S-X.






	NOTE 5SUBSEQUENT EVENTS





	        Management has evaluated subsequent events through September 16, 2016, the date the financial statements were available to be issued. No subsequent events were identified
	requiring additional recognition or disclosure in the accompanying financial statements.






	NOTE 6SUPPLEMENTAL OIL AND GAS RESERVE INFORMATION (UNAUDITED)







	Oil and Gas Reserve Information





	        The following tables summarize the net ownership interests in estimated quantities of proved, proved developed, and proved undeveloped ("PUD")
	oil and natural gas reserves of the PDC assets for the periods indicated, estimated by the Company's independent petroleum engineers, and the related summary of changes in estimated quantities of net
	remaining proved reserves during the periods indicated. Reserve estimates are inherently imprecise and estimates of new discoveries are more

	(2)




	Increases
	in proved undeveloped reserves during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 are attributable to the increases in economic horizontal drilling
	activity adjacent to the subject acreage.






	        Proved
	reserves are estimated quantities of oil and natural gas which geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in future years from known
	reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions (i.e., prices and costs) at the time the estimate is made. Proved developed reserves are proved reserves that can be expected to be
	recovered through existing wells and equipment in place and under operating methods being utilized at the time the estimates were made.






	Standardized Measure of Discounted Estimated Future Net Cash Flows Relating to Proved Oil and Natural
	Gas Reserves





	        The following table sets forth the computation of the standardized measure of estimated discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil
	and gas reserves and the changes in standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows of the PDC assets in accordance with ASC Topic 932,



	Extractive
	ActivitiesOil and Gas



	("ASC 932"), and based estimated on oil and natural gas reserve and production volumes. Estimated future cash inflows as of
	December 31, 2015 and 2014 were computed by applying average fiscal-year prices (calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the




	F-59












	PDC Assets






	Notes to Statements of Revenues and Direct Operating Expenses (Continued)







	NOTE 6SUPPLEMENTAL OIL AND GAS RESERVE INFORMATION (UNAUDITED) (Continued)





	first-day-of-the-month
	oil and gas prices for each month within the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014) to estimated future production. Future production and development costs are computed
	by estimating the expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves at year-end, based on year-end costs and assuming the continuation of
	existing economic conditions. Price changes based on inflation, federal regulatory changes and supply and demand are not considered. Estimated future production costs related to period-end reserves
	are based on period-end costs. Such costs include, but are not limited to, production taxes and direct operating costs. Inflation and other anticipatory costs are not considered until the actual cost
	change takes effect. In accordance with the ASC 932, a discount rate of 10% is applied to the annual estimated future net cash flows.




	        The
	prices, calculated as described above, were $50.28 per barrel of oil and $2.59 per MMBtu of natural gas at December 31, 2015, and $94.99 per Bbl and $4.35 per MMBtu of natural
	gas at December 31, 2014. The prices were based on index prices, which have been adjusted for historical average location and quality differentials. Estimated future cash inflows were reduced
	by estimated future development, abandonment and production costs based on period-end costs resulting in net cash flow before tax. Future income tax expense was estimated based on an estimated
	effective tax rate of 37.5%.




	        The
	standardized measure is not intended to be representative of the fair market value of the proved reserves. The calculations of revenues and costs do not necessarily represent the
	amounts to be received or expended. Accordingly, the estimates of future net cash flows from proved reserves and the present value thereof may not be materially correct when judged against actual
	subsequent results. Further, since prices and costs do not remain static, and no price or cost changes have been considered, and future production and development costs are estimates to be incurred in
	developing and producing the estimated proved oil and gas reserves, the results are not necessarily indicative of the fair market value of estimated proved reserves, and the results may not be
	comparable to estimates disclosed by other oil and gas producers.

	INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT





	Audit
	Committee

	PetroShare Corp.






	Report on the Statements





	        We have audited the accompanying statements of revenues and direct operating expense of the properties acquired by PetroShare Corp. (the
	"Company"), for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.






	Management's Responsibility for the Statements





	        Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these statements ("the Statements") in accordance with accounting
	principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes the design, implementation and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of
	Statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.






	Auditor's Responsibility





	        Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards
	generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Statements are free from material
	misstatement.




	        An
	audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the Statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including
	the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the Statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's
	preparation and fair presentation of the Statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness
	of the entity's internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant
	accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the Statements.




	        We
	believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.






	Opinion





	        In our opinion, the statements of revenues and direct operating expense referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the revenues
	and direct operating expenses of the properties acquired by PetroShare Corp. for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
	United States of America.

	Notes to the Statements of Revenues and Direct Operating Expenses







	NOTE 1BASIS OF PRESENTATION





	        On December 22, 2016, PetroShare Corp. (the "Company") completed the acquisition of certain oil and gas assets ("Crimson assets") from Crimson Exploration Operating, Inc.,
	a Delaware corporation ("Crimson"). The accompanying Statements of Revenues and Direct Operating Expenses (the "Statements") are presented on the accrual basis of accounting and relate to the
	operations of the Crimson assets and have been derived from the historical accounting records of Crimson. Certain costs such as depreciation, depletion, and amortization, accretion of asset retirement
	obligations, general and administrative expenses, interest and corporate income taxes are omitted. As such, the Statements are not intended to be a complete presentation of the revenues and expenses
	of the Crimson assets. Furthermore, the Statements may not be representative of future operations due to changes in the business and the omission of certain information.




	        The
	financial information for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is unaudited. In the opinion of management, however this information contains all
	adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring accruals, necessary for fair statements of the revenues and direct operating expenses for the periods presented in accordance with the indicated basis
	of presentation. The revenues and direct operating expenses for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the revenues and direct operating expenses for the full fiscal year.




	        Historical
	financial statements reflecting financial position, results of operations and cash flows required by the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
	("US GAAP") are not presented as such information was not available on a property-by-property basis, nor is it practicable to obtain such information in these circumstances. Historically, no
	allocation of general and administrative, or interest expense, corporate taxes, accretion of asset retirement obligations, and depreciation, depletion and amortization of oil and gas properties was
	made to the Crimson assets. Accordingly, the Statements of Revenues and Direct Operating Expenses are presented in lieu of the financial statements required under Rule 3.05(b) of the Securities
	and Exchange Commission's Regulation S-X.






	NOTE 2USE OF ESTIMATES IN PREPARATION OF THE STATEMENTS OF REVENUES AND DIRECT OPERATING EXPENSES





	        The preparation of the Statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and direct
	operating expenses during the respective reporting periods. Actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Statements.






	NOTE 3ACQUISITION





	        On November 21, 2016, the Company entered into a definitive purchase and sale agreement with Crimson, pursuant to which the Company agreed to acquire the Crimson assets.
	Completion of the acquisition occurred on December 22, 2016, with an effective date of December 1, 2016.




	        The
	Crimson assets include leases located mostly in Adams and Weld Counties, Colorado. All of the acreage is currently held by production. The Company also acquired a 50% interest in 32
	currently producing wells and six shut in wells located on the acreage.




	F-65












	Notes to the Statements of Revenues and Direct Operating Expenses (Continued)







	NOTE 4REVENUE RECOGNITION





	        Oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids revenues are recognized on the sales method when production is sold to a purchaser at a fixed or determinable price, when delivery has occurred
	and title has transferred, and if collectability of the revenue is probable. Revenues are reported net of overriding and other royalties due to third parties.






	NOTE 5COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES





	        Pursuant to the terms of the definitive purchase and sale agreement there are no known claims, litigation or disputes pending as of the effective date of the Crimson purchase, or any
	other matters arising in connection with the indemnification and the parties of the Crimson agreement are not aware of any environmental or other commitments that would have a material effect on these
	statements.






	NOTE 6SUBSEQUENT EVENTS





	        In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 855, the Company has evaluated subsequent events through March 10, 2017, the date the accompanying Statements were
	available to be issued. There were no material subsequent events that required recognition or additional disclosure in the Statements.






	NOTE 7SUPPLEMENTAL OIL AND GAS RESERVE INFORMATION (UNAUDITED)







	Oil and Gas Reserve Information





	        The following tables summarize the net ownership interest of the Company in estimated quantities of proved developed oil and natural gas
	reserves of the Crimson assets for the periods indicated, estimated by the Company's management and independent petroleum engineers, and the related summary of changes in estimated quantities of net
	remaining proved reserves during the periods indicated. There were no proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2015 or 2014. Reserve estimates are inherently imprecise and estimates of new
	discoveries are more imprecise than those of producing oil and gas properties. Accordingly, reserve estimates are expected to change as additional performance data becomes available.

	Barrel
	of oil equivalent ("BOE") is equal to (i) 42 gallons of natural gas liquids per barrel of oil ("Bbl") or (ii) 6 thousand cubic feet
	("Mcf") of natural gas per Bbl. Included in natural gas volumes are natural gas liquids.






	(2)




	Included
	in natural gas volumes ("Mcf") are natural gas liquids.






	(3)




	The
	revision to estimates in natural gas volumes (including natural gas liquids) for the year ended December 31, 2015 is attributable to the significant
	decrease in pricing for natural gas and natural gas liquids, and the economics of reserves.






	        Proved
	reserves are estimated quantities of oil and natural gas which geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in future years from known
	reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions (i.e., prices and costs) at the time the estimate is made. Proved developed reserves are proved reserves that can be expected to be
	recovered through existing wells and equipment in place and under operating methods being utilized at the time the estimates were made.






	Standardized Measure of Discounted Estimated Future Net Cash Flows Relating to Proved Oil and Natural
	Gas Reserves





	        The following table sets forth for the Crimson assets the computation of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating
	to proved oil and gas reserves and the changes in standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows of the Crimson assets in accordance with ASC Topic 932,



	Extractive
	ActivitiesOil and Gas



	("ASC 932"), and based on oil and natural gas reserve and production volumes. Estimated future cash inflows as of December 31, 2015
	and 2014 were computed by applying average fiscal-year prices (calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month oil and gas prices for each month within the years ended
	December 31, 2015 and 2014) to estimated future production. Future production and development costs are computed by estimating the expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the
	estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves at year-end, based on year-end costs and assuming the continuation of existing economic conditions. Price changes based on inflation, federal regulatory
	changes and supply and




	F-67












	Notes to the Statements of Revenues and Direct Operating Expenses (Continued)







	NOTE 7SUPPLEMENTAL OIL AND GAS RESERVE INFORMATION (UNAUDITED) (Continued)





	demand
	are not considered. Estimated future production costs related to period-end reserves are based on period-end costs. Such costs include, but are not limited to, production taxes and direct
	operating costs. Inflation and other anticipatory costs are not considered until the actual cost change takes effect. In accordance with the ASC 932, a discount rate of 10% is applied to the annual
	estimated future net cash flows.




	        The
	prices, calculated as described above, were $36.71 per barrel of oil and $2.35 per Mcf of natural gas at December 31, 2015, and $81.23 per Bbl and $3.98 per Mcf of natural gas
	at December 31, 2014. The prices were based on index prices, which have been adjusted for historical average location and quality differentials. Estimated future cash inflows were reduced by
	estimated future development, abandonment and production costs based on period-end costs resulting in net cash flow before tax. Future income tax expense was estimated based on an estimated effective
	tax rate of 37.06%.




	        The
	standardized measure is not intended to be representative of the fair market value of the proved reserves. The calculations of revenues and costs do not necessarily represent the
	amounts to be received or expended. Accordingly, the estimates of future net cash flows from proved reserves and the present value thereof may not be materially correct when judged against actual
	subsequent results. Further, since prices and costs do not remain static, no price or cost changes have been considered, and future production and development costs are estimates to be incurred in
	developing and producing the estimated proved oil and gas reserves, the results are not necessarily indicative of the fair market value of estimated proved reserves, and the results may not be
	comparable to estimates disclosed by other oil and gas producers.

	APPENDIX A

	GLOSSARY OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS TERMS





	        Unless otherwise indicated in this prospectus, natural gas volumes are stated at the legal pressure base of the state or geographic area in
	which the reserves are located at 60 degrees Fahrenheit. Crude oil and natural gas equivalents are determined using the ratio of six Mcf of natural gas to one barrel of crude oil, condensate or
	natural gas liquids.




	        The
	following are abbreviations and definitions of terms commonly used in the oil and natural gas industry and within this prospectus:




	        "




	Bbl




	"Barrel or 42 US gallons liquid volume.




	        "




	MBbls




	"One thousand Bbls.




	        "




	BOE




	"One barrel of crude oil equivalent, which combines Bbls of oil, Bbls of natural gas liquids, and Mcf of natural gas by
	converting each six Mcf of natural gas to one Bbl of oil.




	        "




	MBOE




	"One thousand BOE.




	        "




	BOE/D




	"Barrels of oil equivalent per day.




	        "




	Condensate




	"A mixture of hydrocarbons that exists in the gaseous phase at original reservoir temperature and pressure, but
	that, when produced, is in the liquid phase at surface pressure and temperature.




	        "




	Developed acreage




	"The number of acres that are allocated or assignable to producing wells or wells capable of production.




	        "




	Development well




	"A well drilled within the proved area of a crude oil or natural gas reservoir to the depth of stratigraphic
	horizon (rock layer or formation) noted to be productive for the purpose of extracting proved crude oil or natural gas reserves.




	        "




	Exploratory well




	"A well drilled to find and produce crude oil or natural gas in an unproved area, to find a new reservoir in
	a field previously found to be producing crude oil or natural gas in another reservoir, or to extend a known reservoir.




	        "




	Field




	"An area consisting of either a single reservoir or multiple reservoirs, all grouped on or related to the same
	individual geological structural feature and/or stratigraphic condition.




	        "




	Gross acres




	"The number of acres in which the Company owns a gross working interest.




	        "




	Gross well




	"A well in which the Company owns a working interest.




	        "




	Leases




	"Full or partial rights in mineral interests authorizing the leaseholder to drill for, produce and sell oil and
	natural gas in exchange for any or all of rental, bonus and royalty payments. Leases are generally acquired from private landowners (fee leases) and from federal and state governments on acreage held
	by them.




	        "




	Mcf




	"One thousand cubic feet of natural gas.




	        "




	MMcf




	"One thousand Mcf.




	        "




	MMBtu




	"One million British thermal unitsa measure of the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of a
	one-pound mass of water one degree Fahrenheit at sea level.




	        "




	Net acres




	" or "




	Net wells




	"The sum of the fractional working interests owned
	in gross acres or wells, as the case may be, expressed as whole numbers and fractions thereof.




	        "




	NGL




	"Natural gas liquids.




	A-1











	Table of Contents





	        "




	Operator




	"The individual or company responsible to the working interest owners for the exploration, development and
	production of an oil or natural gas well or lease.




	        "




	Producing well




	"A well that is currently producing crude oil, natural gas, or liquids.




	        "




	Productive well




	"A producing well or a well mechanically capable of production.




	        "




	Prospect




	"A location where hydrocarbons such as crude oil and natural gas are believed to be present in quantities which are
	economically feasible to produce.




	        "




	Proved developed reserves




	"Reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and
	operating methods. Additional crude oil and natural gas expected to be obtained through the application of fluid injection or other improved recovery techniques for supplementing the natural forces
	and mechanisms of primary recovery are included in "proved developed reserves" only after testing by a pilot project or after the operation of an installed program has confirmed through production
	response that increased recovery will be achieved.




	        "




	Proved reserves




	"Proved crude oil and natural gas reserves are those quantities of crude oil and natural gas, which, by
	analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically produciblefrom a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing
	economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulationsprior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is
	reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be
	reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time.




	        "




	Proved undeveloped reserves




	"Proved crude oil and natural gas reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on
	undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for development. Reserves on undrilled acreage are limited to those drilling units offsetting productive units
	that are reasonably certain of production when drilled. Proved reserves for other undrilled units are claimed only where it can be demonstrated with certainty that there is continuity of production
	from the existing productive formation. Estimates for proved undeveloped reserves are not attributed to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is
	contemplated, unless such techniques have been proven effective by actual tests in the area and in the same reservoir.




	        "




	PV-10 value




	" means the present value of estimated future gross revenue to be generated from the production of estimated net proved
	reserves, net of estimated production and future development costs, using prices and costs in effect as of the date indicated (unless such prices or costs are subject to change pursuant to contractual
	provisions), without giving effect to non-property related expenses such as general and administrative expenses, debt service and future income tax expenses or to depreciation, depletion and
	amortization, discounted using an annual discount rate of 10 percent. While this measure does not include the effect of income taxes as it would in the use of the standardized measure
	calculation, it does provide an indicative representation of the relative value of our company on a comparative basis to other companies and from period to period.




	        "




	Reservoir




	"A porous and permeable underground formation containing a natural accumulation of producible crude oil and/or
	natural gas that is confined by impermeable rock or water barriers and is separate from other reservoirs.




	        "




	Resources




	"Quantities of crude oil and natural gas estimated to exist in naturally occurring accumulations. A portion of the
	resources may be estimated to be recoverable, and another
	portion may be considered to be unrecoverable. Resources include both discovered and undiscovered accumulations.




	A-2











	Table of Contents





	        "




	Revenue interest




	"The amount or percentage of revenue/proceeds derived from a producing well that the owner is entitled to
	receive.




	        "




	Section




	"640 acres.




	        "




	Shut-in




	"A well which is capable of producing but is not presently producing.




	        "




	Spacing




	" or "




	Spacing Unit




	"The distance between wells producing from the same
	reservoir. Spacing is often expressed in terms of acres, e.g., 40-acre spacing, and is often established by regulatory agencies.




	        "




	Standardized measure




	"The present value of estimated future cash inflows from proved natural gas and crude oil reserves, less
	future development and production costs and future income tax expenses, using prices and costs as of the date of estimation without future escalation, without giving effect to hedging activities,
	non-property related expenses such as general and administrative expenses, debt service and depreciation, depletion and amortization and discounted using an annual discount rate of 10% to reflect
	timing of future cash flows.




	        "




	Undeveloped acreage




	"Leased acres on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the
	production of economic quantities of crude oil and natural gas, regardless of whether or not such acreage contains proved reserves. Undeveloped acreage includes net acres under the bit until a
	productive well is established in the spacing unit.




	        "




	Unproved property




	"A property or part of a property with no proved reserves.




	        "




	Working interest




	"The amount or percentage of costs that an owner is required to pay of drilling and production expenses. It
	also gives the owners, in the aggregate, the right to drill,
	produce and conduct operating activities on the property and to share in any revenue from the production.

	Item 14.    Indemnification of Directors and Officers.






	        Our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws provide that we may indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by Colorado law, any of our directors,
	officers, employees or agents made or threatened to be made a party to a proceeding, by reason of the person serving or having served in a capacity as such, against judgments, penalties, fines,
	settlements and reasonable expenses incurred by the person in connection with the proceeding if certain standards are met. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act
	of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, may be permitted to our directors, officers and controlling persons pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, we have been advised that in the
	opinion of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.




	        The
	Colorado Business Corporation Act, or the CBCA, allows indemnification of directors, officers, employees and agents of a company against liabilities incurred in any proceeding in
	which an individual is made a party because he was a director, officer, employee or agent of the company if such person conducted himself in good faith and reasonably believed his actions were in, or
	not opposed to, the best interests of the company, and with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. A person must be found to be
	entitled to indemnification under this statutory standard by procedures designed to assure that disinterested members of the Board of Directors have approved indemnification or that, absent the
	ability to obtain sufficient numbers of disinterested directors, independent counsel or shareholders have approved the indemnification based on a finding that the person has met the standard.
	Indemnification is limited to reasonable expenses.




	        Our
	Articles of Incorporation limit the liability of our directors to the fullest extent permitted by the CBCA. Specifically, our directors will not be personally liable for monetary
	damages for breach of fiduciary duty as directors, except for:






	




	any breach of the duty of loyalty to our company or our stockholders;








	




	acts or omissions not in good faith or that involved intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law;






	II-1











	Table of Contents







	




	dividends or other distributions of corporate assets that are in contravention of certain statutory or contractual restrictions;








	




	violations of certain laws; or








	




	any transaction from which the director derives an improper personal benefit.






	Liability
	under federal securities law is not limited by the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws. The Underwriting Agreement (Exhibit 1.1 hereto) provides for indemnification by the
	underwriters of us and our executive officers and directors for certain liabilities, including liabilities arising under the Securities Act.




	        We
	have purchased and intend to maintain insurance on behalf of each and any person who is or was one of our directors or officers against any loss arising from any claim asserted
	against him or her and incurred by him or her in any such capacity, subject to certain exclusions.




	        See
	also the undertakings set out in response to Item 17 herein.

	underwriters within the meaning of the Securities Act, including making reasonable inquiry prior to accepting any subscription, making written disclosure regarding the restricted nature of the
	securities and placing a legend on the certificates representing the shares. In each case, the offerees were provided with a subscription agreement detailing the restrictions on transfer of the shares
	and eliciting their investment intent. Further, stop transfer restrictions were placed with our transfer agent and a restrictive legend was placed on the certificate in connection with these
	offerings. In addition, sales in the transactions exempt under Rule 506(b) were made exclusively to what the Company reasonably believed were accredited investors as defined in Rule 501

	Item 17.    Undertakings.






	        Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling
	persons of the Registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is
	against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the Registrant of
	expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the Registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or
	controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the Registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to
	a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such
	issue.




	        The
	undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes that it will:





	        (1)   For
	purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act, the information omitted from the form of prospectus filed as part of this registration statement in
	reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in a form of prospectus filed by the Registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b) (1) or (4) or 497(h) under the Securities Act shall be deemed
	to be part of this registration statement as of the time it was declared effective.




	        (2)   For
	the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each post-effective amendment that contains a form of prospectus shall be deemed to be a
	new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.

	AMENDED AND RESTATED






	EXECUTIVE EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT





	 




	This Amended and Restated Executive Employment Agreement (this 

	Agreement

	) is entered into as of the 1st day of March 2016 between Stephen J. Foley (the 

	Executive

	) and PetroShare Corp., a Colorado corporation (the 

	Company

	). The Executive and Company may be referred to in this Agreement as a 

	Party

	 or collectively as the 

	Parties

	.




	 





	BACKGROUND





	 




	The Executive is currently employed by the Company as Chief Executive Officer;




	 




	The Company and the Executive previously entered into an employment agreement defining the terms and conditions of Executives employment with the Company, dated as of November 1, 2013 (

	Original Agreement

	);




	 




	The Original Agreement provided Executive with certain rights, responsibilities, and benefits;




	 




	The Parties believe that it is in their mutual best interest to make certain changes to the terms and conditions of Executives employment with the Company;




	 




	The Company desires to continue to receive the services of Executive, and Executive desires to provide services to the Company, in accordance with the terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement; and




	 




	This Agreement sets forth all of the terms of Executives employment by the Company and amends and restates those terms in their entirety.




	 





	AGREEMENT





	 




	1.


	                                     


	Employment; Devotion to Duties

	.



	 




	(a)


	                                


	General

	. The Company will employ Executive as its Chief Executive Officer reporting to its Board of Directors (the 

	Board

	), and Executive accepts employment to serve in this capacity, all upon the terms and conditions in this Agreement. Executive will have those duties and responsibilities that are consistent with Executives position as Chief Executive Officer, as determined by the Board. The Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to change or modify Executives position, title and duties during the term of this Agreement, subject to Executives rights under Section 7(e).



	 




	(b)


	                                


	Devotion to Duties

	. During the Term (defined in Section 2(b)), Executive (i) will faithfully, with diligence and to the best of his ability, experience and talents, devote all of his business time and efforts to the performance of his duties on the Companys behalf, and (ii) will not at any time or place or to any extent whatsoever, without the express written consent of the Board, engage in any outside employment, or in any activity competitive with or adverse to the Companys business, or affairs, whether alone or as partner, manager, member, officer, director, employee, or shareholder of any entity or as a trustee, fiduciary, consultant or other

	representative.  This is not intended to prohibit Executive from engaging in activities such as personal investments, a family business or charitable work, so long as those activities do not conflict with the Company and, in the case of positions on other boards of directors or similar bodies, receive the prior written approval of the Board. Participation to a reasonable extent in civic, social, community or charitable activities is encouraged. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any outside activities will be conducted in compliance with the Companys corporate governance policies and other policies and procedures as in effect from time-to-time.




	 




	2.


	                                     


	Term

	.



	 




	(a)


	                                


	Initial Term

	. Executive will continue employment with the Company under the terms of this Agreement starting on March 1, 2016 (the 

	Commencement Date

	). Executive will be employed under this Agreement until December 31, 2018 (the 

	Initial Term

	), unless the term is extended under Section 2(b), or Executives employment is terminated earlier pursuant to Section 7.



	 




	(b)


	                                


	Renewal Term

	. Following the Initial Term, the term of this Agreement and the Executives employment shall renew automatically for successive one-year periods (each, a 

	Renewal Term

	), unless at least 90 days before the end of the Initial Term or any Renewal Term, either party gives notice to the other party that this Employment Agreement will terminate at the end of the Initial Term or any Renewal Term (the Initial Term, together with any Renewal Terms, the 

	Term

	Ownership of Work, Materials and Documents

	. The Executive will disclose promptly to the Company any and all inventions, discoveries, and improvements (whether or not patentable or registrable under copyright or similar statutes), and all patentable or copyrightable works, initiated, conceived, discovered, reduced to practice, or made by him, either alone or in conjunction with others, during the Executives employment with the Company and related to the business or activities of the Company and its affiliates (the 

Immediately upon the Companys request at any time during or following the Term, Executive is required to return to the Company any and all Confidential and Proprietary Information (as defined hereinafter) and any other property of the Company then within Executives possession, custody and/or control.

	Confidential and Proprietary Information

	. During the course of Executives employment, Executive will be exposed to a substantial amount of confidential and proprietary information, including, but not limited to, financial information, annual reports, audited and unaudited financial reports, operational budgets and strategies, geologic and well data, methods of operation, customer lists, strategic plans, business plans, marketing plans and strategies, new business strategies, merger and acquisition strategies, management systems programs, computer systems, personnel and compensation information and payroll data, and other such reports, documents or information (collectively the 

	8

Executive promises that Executive will not retain, take with Executive or make any copies of such Confidential and Proprietary Information in any form, format, or manner whatsoever (including paper, digital or other storage in any form) nor will Executive disclose the same in whole or in part to any person or entity, in any manner either directly or indirectly, either while the Executive is employed by the Company or following termination of his employment for any reason. Excluded from this Agreement is information that (i) is or becomes publicly known through no violation of this Agreement; (ii) is lawfully received by the Executive from any third party without restriction on disclosure or use; (iii) is required to be disclosed by law; or (iv) is expressly approved in writing by the Company for release or other use by the Executive. Executive and the Company also acknowledge that because Executive is a senior executive he will have access to information (some of which is Confidential and Proprietary Information and some of which is not), employees and knowledge about the Company that is extremely valuable to the Company and which the Company needs to protect for a period of time after Executive terminates employment. Additionally, the Parties agree that the covenants in this Section 8 are reasonable and necessary to protect the Companys legitimate business interests. Executive and the Company agree that the foregoing restrictive covenants are fair and reasonable and are freely, voluntarily and knowingly entered into. Further, each party has been given the opportunity to consult with legal counsel before entering into this Agreement.




	 




	(c)


	                                 


	Judicial Amendment

	. If the scope of any provision of this Section 8 of this Agreement is found by a court to be too broad to permit enforcement to its full extent, then that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permitted by law. The parties agree that, if legally permissible, the scope of any provision of this Agreement may be modified by a judge in any proceeding to enforce this Section 8, so that the provision can be enforced to the maximum extent permitted by law. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the parties agree that it will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement.



	 




	(d)


	                                


	Injunctive Relief, Damages and Forfeiture

	. Due to the nature of Executives position with the Company, and with full realization that a violation of this Section 8 may cause immediate and irreparable injury and damage, which is not readily measurable, and to protect the parties interests, the parties understand and agree that either party may also seek injunctive relief to enforce this Agreement in a court of competent jurisdiction to cease or prevent any actual or threatened violation of this Agreement.  In any action brought pursuant to this Section 8(d), the prevailing party will be entitled to an award of attorneys fees and costs.

Company will reimburse Executive for his reasonable out-of-pocket expenses that Executive incurs in connection with such cooperative efforts. Additionally, at all times after the Executives

	employment with the Company has terminated, Company (defined for these purpose only as any Company press release and the Board, the CEO and the CEOs direct reports, and no other employees) and Executive agree to refrain from making any disparaging or derogatory remarks, statements and/or publications regarding the other, its employees or its services.

	General Provisions

	.



	 




	(a)


	                                


	Severability

	. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable under any applicable law, then, if legally permissible, such provision will be deemed to be modified to the extent necessary to render it legal, valid and enforceable, and if no modification will make the provision legal, valid and enforceable, then this Agreement will be construed as if not containing the provision held to be invalid, and the rights and obligations of the parties will be construed and enforced accordingly.



	 




	(b)


	                                


	Assignment by Company

	. Nothing in this Agreement precludes the Company from consolidating or merging into or with, or transferring all or substantially all of its assets to, another corporation or entity that assumes this Agreement and all obligations and undertakings hereunder.

This Agreement may be amended only in writing executed by the Company and Executive.



	 




	(d)

	.

	AMENDED AND RESTATED






	EXECUTIVE EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT





	 




	This Amended and Restated Executive Employment Agreement (this 

	Agreement

	) is entered into as of the 1st day of March 2016 between Frederick J. Witsell (the 

	Executive

	) and PetroShare Corp., a Colorado corporation (the 

	Company

	). The Executive and Company may be referred to in this Agreement as a 

	Party

	 or collectively as the 

	Parties

	.




	 





	BACKGROUND





	 




	The Executive is currently employed by the Company as President;




	 




	The Company and the Executive previously entered into an employment agreement defining the terms and conditions of Executives employment with the Company, dated as of March 1, 2013 (

	Original Agreement

	);




	 




	The Original Agreement provided Executive with certain rights, responsibilities, and benefits;




	 




	The Parties believe that it is in their mutual best interest to make certain changes to the terms and conditions of Executives employment with the Company;




	 




	The Company desires to continue to receive the services of Executive, and Executive desires to provide services to the Company, in accordance with the terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement; and




	 




	This Agreement sets forth all of the terms of Executives employment by the Company and amends and restates those terms in their entirety.




	 





	AGREEMENT





	 




	1.


	                                     


	Employment; Devotion to Duties

	.



	 




	(a)


	                                


	General

	. The Company will employ Executive as its President reporting to its Board of Directors (the 

	Board

	), and Executive accepts employment to serve in this capacity, all upon the terms and conditions in this Agreement. Executive will have those duties and responsibilities that are consistent with Executives position as President, as determined by the Board. The Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to change or modify Executives position, title and duties during the term of this Agreement, subject to Executives rights under Section 7(e).



	 




	(b)


	                                


	Devotion to Duties

	. During the Term (defined in Section 2(b)), Executive (i) will faithfully, with diligence and to the best of his ability, experience and talents, devote all of his business time and efforts to the performance of his duties on the Companys behalf, and (ii) will not at any time or place or to any extent whatsoever, without the express written consent of the Board, engage in any outside employment, or in any activity competitive with or adverse to the Companys business, or affairs, whether alone or as partner, manager, member, officer, director, employee, or shareholder of any entity or as a trustee, fiduciary, consultant or other

	representative.  This is not intended to prohibit Executive from engaging in activities such as personal investments, a family business or charitable work, so long as those activities do not conflict with the Company and, in the case of positions on other boards of directors or similar bodies, receive the prior written approval of the Board. Participation to a reasonable extent in civic, social, community or charitable activities is encouraged. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any outside activities will be conducted in compliance with the Companys corporate governance policies and other policies and procedures as in effect from time-to-time.




	 




	2.

	). Executive will be employed under this Agreement until December 31, 2018 (the 

	Initial Term

	), unless the term is extended under Section 2(b), or Executives employment is terminated earlier pursuant to Section 7.

	), unless at least 90 days before the end of the Initial Term or any Renewal Term, either party gives notice to the other party that this Employment Agreement will terminate at the end of the Initial Term or any Renewal Term (the Initial Term, together with any Renewal Terms, the 

	Term

	). Notwithstanding the above, the Executives employment is subject to earlier termination under with Section 7. If the Company timely elects not to renew this Agreement at the end of the Initial Term or any Renewal Term, the Executives termination of employment will be characterized as a termination without Cause under Section 7(c).

Travel away from Colorado may be necessary for, among other things, meetings and presentations with investors, potential investors, investment bankers and analysts.

	) in the amount of $13,000.00 per month ($156,000 per year). The Base Salary will be paid in accordance with the Companys payroll practices in effect from time-to-time. Executives Base Salary will be reviewed at least annually in accordance with the Companys executive compensation review policies and practices and may be increased in accordance with such review, looking to the results of such review and the Companys financial progress, among other things, as guides in making any adjustments. All payments to Executive under this Agreement will be subject to withholding as required by applicable law.

	Clawback Policy

	). By signing this Agreement, Executive agrees to fully cooperate with the Company in assuring compliance with such policies and the provisions of applicable law, including, but not limited to, promptly returning any compensation subject to recovery by the Company pursuant to a Clawback Policy and applicable law.

	PTO

	) in an amount not to exceed 30 days, or otherwise in accordance with the Companys PTO policies as in effect from time-to-time. Vacations and other PTO shall be scheduled so as to not unreasonably interfere with the business of the Company.



	 




	(b)

Further, if required to avoid imposition of penalties or interest under 409A, the amounts payable under this Agreement and subject to 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) may not be paid before the later of (1) 18 months following the date of this Agreement, or (2) six months following the payment event.

	(i)


	                                    


	Mitigation/Offset

	. The Executive is under no obligation to seek other Employment or to otherwise mitigate the obligations of the Company under this Agreement, and the Company may not offset against amounts or benefits due Executive under this Agreement or otherwise on account of any claim (other than any preexisting debts then due in accordance with their terms) the Company or its affiliates may have against him or any remuneration or other benefit earned or received by Executive after such termination.



	 




	8.


	                                     


	Other Obligations

	.



	 




	(a)


	                                


	Ownership of Work, Materials and Documents

	. The Executive will disclose promptly to the Company any and all inventions, discoveries, and improvements (whether or not patentable or registrable under copyright or similar statutes), and all patentable or copyrightable works, initiated, conceived, discovered, reduced to practice, or made by him, either alone or in conjunction with others, during the Executives employment with the Company and related to the business or activities of the Company and its affiliates (the 

	Developments

	). Except to the extent any rights in any Developments constitute a work made for hire under the U.S. Copyright Act, which the parties acknowledge are owned by the Company and/or its applicable affiliate, the Executive assigns all of his right, title and interest in all Developments (including all intellectual property rights) to the Company or its nominee without further compensation, including all rights or benefits, including, without limitation, the right to sue and recover for past and future infringement.  Whenever requested by the Company, the Executive will execute any and all applications, assignments or other instruments which the Company deems necessary to apply for and obtain trademarks, patents or copyrights of the United States or any foreign country or otherwise protect its interests. These obligations continue beyond the end of the Executives employment with the Company with respect to inventions, discoveries, improvements or copyrightable works initiated, conceived or made by the Executive while employed by the Company, and are binding upon the Executives employers, assigns, executors, administrators and other legal representatives. Immediately upon the Companys request at any time during or following the Term, Executive is required to return to the Company any and all Confidential and Proprietary Information (as defined hereinafter) and any other property of the Company then within Executives possession, custody and/or control. Failure to return this property, whether during the term of this Agreement or after its termination, is a breach of this Agreement.



	 




	(b)


	                                


	Confidential and Proprietary Information

	. During the course of Executives employment, Executive will be exposed to a substantial amount of confidential and proprietary information, including, but not limited to, financial information, annual reports, audited and unaudited financial reports, operational budgets and strategies, geologic and well data, methods of operation, customer lists, strategic plans, business plans, marketing plans and strategies, new business strategies, merger and acquisition strategies, management systems programs, computer systems, personnel and compensation information and payroll data, and other such reports, documents or information (collectively the 

	Confidential and Proprietary Information

	).  Due to Executives senior position with the Company and its affiliates, Executive acknowledges that he regularly receives Confidential and Proprietary Information with respect to



	 



	8













	 




	the Company and/or its affiliates; for the avoidance of doubt, all such information is expressly included in Confidential and Proprietary Information. Executive promises that Executive will not retain, take with Executive or make any copies of such Confidential and Proprietary Information in any form, format, or manner whatsoever (including paper, digital or other storage in any form) nor will Executive disclose the same in whole or in part to any person or entity, in any manner either directly or indirectly, either while the Executive is employed by the Company or following termination of his employment for any reason. Excluded from this Agreement is information that (i) is or becomes publicly known through no violation of this Agreement; (ii) is lawfully received by the Executive from any third party without restriction on disclosure or use; (iii) is required to be disclosed by law; or (iv) is expressly approved in writing by the Company for release or other use by the Executive. Executive and the Company also acknowledge that because Executive is a senior executive he will have access to information (some of which is Confidential and Proprietary Information and some of which is not), employees and knowledge about the Company that is extremely valuable to the Company and which the Company needs to protect for a period of time after Executive terminates employment. Additionally, the Parties agree that the covenants in this Section 8 are reasonable and necessary to protect the Companys legitimate business interests. Executive and the Company agree that the foregoing restrictive covenants are fair and reasonable and are freely, voluntarily and knowingly entered into. Further, each party has been given the opportunity to consult with legal counsel before entering into this Agreement.




	 




	(c)


	                                 


	Judicial Amendment

	. If the scope of any provision of this Section 8 of this Agreement is found by a court to be too broad to permit enforcement to its full extent, then that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permitted by law. The parties agree that, if legally permissible, the scope of any provision of this Agreement may be modified by a judge in any proceeding to enforce this Section 8, so that the provision can be enforced to the maximum extent permitted by law. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the parties agree that it will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement.



	 




	(d)


	                                


	Injunctive Relief, Damages and Forfeiture

	. Due to the nature of Executives position with the Company, and with full realization that a violation of this Section 8 may cause immediate and irreparable injury and damage, which is not readily measurable, and to protect the parties interests, the parties understand and agree that either party may also seek injunctive relief to enforce this Agreement in a court of competent jurisdiction to cease or prevent any actual or threatened violation of this Agreement.  In any action brought pursuant to this Section 8(d), the prevailing party will be entitled to an award of attorneys fees and costs.



	 




	(e)


	                                 


	Survival

	. The provisions of this Section 8 survive the termination of this Agreement.



	 




	(f)


	                                  


	Cooperation; No Disparagement

	. So long as Executive is receiving any payments from the Company, Executive agrees to provide reasonable assistance to the Company (including assistance with litigation matters), upon the Companys request, concerning the Executives previous employment responsibilities and functions with the Company. Company will reimburse Executive for his reasonable out-of-pocket expenses that Executive incurs in connection with such cooperative efforts. Additionally, at all times after the Executives



	 



	9













	 




	employment with the Company has terminated, Company (defined for these purpose only as any Company press release and the Board, the CEO and the CEOs direct reports, and no other employees) and Executive agree to refrain from making any disparaging or derogatory remarks, statements and/or publications regarding the other, its employees or its services.




	 




	9.


	                                     


	General Provisions

	.



	 




	(a)


	                                


	Severability

	. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable under any applicable law, then, if legally permissible, such provision will be deemed to be modified to the extent necessary to render it legal, valid and enforceable, and if no modification will make the provision legal, valid and enforceable, then this Agreement will be construed as if not containing the provision held to be invalid, and the rights and obligations of the parties will be construed and enforced accordingly.



	 




	(b)


	                                


	Assignment by Company

	. Nothing in this Agreement precludes the Company from consolidating or merging into or with, or transferring all or substantially all of its assets to, another corporation or entity that assumes this Agreement and all obligations and undertakings hereunder. Upon any consolidation, merger or transfer of assets and assumption, the term Company means any other corporation or entity, as appropriate, and this Agreement will continue in full force and effect.



	 




	(c)


	                                 


	Entire Agreement

	. This Agreement and any agreements concerning equity compensation or other benefits, embody the Parties complete agreement with respect to the subject matter in this Agreement and supersede any prior written or contemporaneous oral, understandings or agreements between the parties that may have related in any way to the subject matter in this Agreement, including but not limited to any offer letter provided to or signed by Executive. This Agreement may be amended only in writing executed by the Company and Executive.



	 




	(d)


	                                


	Governing Law

	. Because the Company is a Colorado corporation, and because it is mutually agreed that it is in the best interests of the Company and all of its employees that a uniform body of law consistently interpreted be applied to the employment agreements to which the Company is a party, this Agreement will be deemed entered into by the Company and Executive in Colorado. The law of the State of Colorado will govern the interpretation and application of all of the provisions of this Agreement.



	 




	(e)


	                                 


	Notice

	. Any notice required or permitted under this Agreement must be in writing and will be deemed to have been given when delivered personally or by overnight courier service or three days after being sent by mail, postage prepaid, at the address indicated below or to such changed address as such person may subsequently give such notice of:



	 




	if to the Company:

	(f)


	                                  


	Non-Waiver; Construction; Counterparts

	. The failure in any one or more instances of a party to insist upon performance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement, to exercise any right or privilege conferred in this Agreement, or the waiver by that party of any breach of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement,  will not be construed as a subsequent waiver of any such terms, covenants, conditions, rights or privileges, but the waiver will continue and remain in full force and effect as if no such forbearance or waiver had occurred.  No waiver is effective unless it is in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the waiving party. This Agreement will be construed fairly as to both parties and not in favor of, or against, either party, regardless of which party prepared the Agreement. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original, and all such counterparts will constitute but one instrument.



	 




	(g)


	                                 


	Successors and Assigns

	. This Agreement is solely for the benefit of the parties and their respective successors, assigns, heirs and legatees. Nothing in this Agreement will be construed to provide any right to any other entity or individual.



	 




	(h)


	                                


	Indemnification

	. The Company agrees to indemnify the Executive to the fullest extent provided under the Companys Bylaws, on the same terms and conditions as indemnification is generally provided to the Companys officers and directors, in the event that he was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, by reason of the fact that the Executive is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or any of its affiliates; provided, however, that the Executive is not entitled to indemnification under this Section 9(h) relating to any claims, actions, suits or proceedings arising from his breach of this Agreement.

	Agreement

	) is entered into to be effective as of the 15th day of April 2016 between William R. Givan (the 

	Executive

	) and PetroShare Corp., a Colorado corporation (the 

	Company

	). The Executive and Company may be referred to in this Agreement as a 

	Party

	 or collectively as the 

	Parties

	.




	 





	BACKGROUND





	 




	The Company wishes to employ Executive as part of its executive management team in the position described below, and to provide the Executive with compensation and other benefits on the terms and subject to the conditions contained in this Agreement.




	 




	Executive is willing to accept such employment and perform services for the Company on the terms and subject to the conditions contained in this Agreement.




	 




	The Parties desire to set forth the terms and conditions upon which Executive will be employed by the Company.




	 





	AGREEMENT





	 




	1.


	                                     


	Employment; Devotion to Duties

	.



	 




	(a)


	                                


	General

	. The Company will employ Executive as its Vice President of Land reporting to the Companys President (

	President

	) and Executive accepts employment to serve in this capacity, all upon the terms and conditions in this Agreement. Executive will have those duties and responsibilities that are consistent with Executives position as Vice President of Land, as determined by the President. The Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to change or modify Executives position, title and duties during the term of this Agreement, subject to Executives rights under Section 7(d).



	 




	(b)


	                                


	Devotion to Duties

	. During the Term (defined in Section 2(b)), Executive (i) will faithfully, with diligence and to the best of his ability, experience and talents, devote all of his business time and efforts to the performance of his duties on the Companys behalf, and (ii) will not at any time or place or to any extent whatsoever, without the express written consent of the Companys Board of Directors (the 

	Board

	), engage in any outside employment, or in any activity competitive with or adverse to the Companys business or affairs, whether alone or as a partner, manager, member, officer, director, employee, or shareholder of any entity or as a trustee, fiduciary, consultant or other representative.  This is not intended to prohibit Executive from engaging in activities such as personal investments, a family business or charitable work, so long as those activities do not conflict with the Company and, in the case of positions on other boards of directors or similar bodies, receive the prior written approval of the Board. Participation to a reasonable extent in civic, social, community or charitable activities is encouraged. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any outside activities will be conducted in compliance with the Companys corporate governance policies and other policies and procedures as in effect from time-to-time.



	 



	1













	 




	2.

	Initial Term

	. Executive will commence employment with the Company under the terms of this Agreement starting on April 15, 2016 (the 

	Commencement Date

	). Executive will be employed under this Agreement until April 14, 2017 (the 

	Initial Term

	), unless the term is extended under Section 2(b), or Executives employment is terminated earlier pursuant to Section 7.



	 




	(b)


	                                


	Renewal Term

	. Following the Initial Term, the term of this Agreement and the Executives employment shall renew automatically for successive one-year periods (each, a 

	Renewal Term

	), unless at least 90 days before the end of the Initial Term or any Renewal Term, either party gives notice to the other party that this Employment Agreement will terminate at the end of the Initial Term or any Renewal Term (the Initial Term, together with any Renewal Terms, the 

	Term

	). Notwithstanding the above, the Executives employment is subject to earlier termination under Section 7. If the Company timely elects not to renew this Agreement at the end of the Initial Term or any Renewal Term, the Executives termination of employment will be characterized as a termination without Cause under Section 7(c).



	 




	3.


	                                     


	Location

	. The location of Executives principal place of employment will be at the Companys principal executive offices in Centennial, Colorado;  provided, however, the Executive understands and agrees that he may be required to travel and perform services outside of this area as reasonably necessary to properly perform his duties under this Agreement. Travel away from Colorado may be necessary for, among other things, meetings and presentations with investors, potential investors, investment bankers and analysts.



	 




	4.

	. The Company will pay Executive an annual base salary (

	Base Salary

	) in the amount of $10,833.33 per month ($130,000 per year). The Base Salary will be paid in accordance with the Companys payroll practices in effect from time-to-time. Executives Base Salary will be reviewed at least annually in accordance with the Companys executive compensation review policies and practices and may be increased in accordance with such review, looking to the results of such review and the Companys financial progress, among other things, as guides in making any adjustments. All payments to Executive under this Agreement will be subject to withholding as required by applicable law.



	 




	5.


	                                     


	Incentive Compensation

	.



	 




	(a)


	                                


	Annual Bonus

	. Executive will be eligible to receive additional cash compensation in the form of bonuses based on criteria established by and in the sole discretion of the President, the Board or one of its committees. Unless deferred pursuant to a plan that complies with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (

	Code

	), this bonus, if any, will be paid to the Executive no later than two and one-half months following the end of the relevant fiscal year in which the services were performed.



	 




	(b)


	                                


	Equity Incentive

	. Executive will also be eligible to receive equity grants under the Companys Equity Incentive Plan(s) in accordance with his position with the Company, as determined by the Board or a committee of the Board in its sole and absolute discretion. In addition to any other grants for which Executive may be eligible, upon execution



	 



	2













	 




	of this Agreement, the Company shall grant Executive options to acquire up to 250,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $0.80 per share. The options shall be represented by an agreement, the form of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A and incorporated herein by reference, and shall be subject to vesting as described in that exhibit.




	 




	6.


	                                     


	Executive Benefits

	.



	 




	(a)


	                                


	Fringe Benefits; Paid Time Off

	. The Company will provide Executive with those fringe and other executive benefits on the same terms and conditions as are generally available to senior management from time-to-time (

	e.g.

	, health and other insurance programs, etc.); provided, however, that the Company reserves the right to amend or terminate any employee or executive benefit plan or program at any time. Executive shall be entitled each year to one or more vacations and other paid time off (

	PTO

	) in an amount not to exceed four weeks, or otherwise in accordance with the Companys PTO policies as in effect from time-to-time. Vacations and other PTO shall be scheduled so as to not unreasonably interfere with the business of the Company.



	 




	(b)


	                                


	Reimbursement of Expenses

	. Executive is entitled to be reimbursed by the Company for reasonable business expenses incurred in performing his duties under the Companys expense reimbursement policies as in effect from time-to-time or as otherwise approved by the President or the Board.



	 




	7.


	                                     


	Termination of Employment During the Term of the Agreement

	. Upon, and as of, the date of the Executives termination of employment with the Company for any reason, the Executive will be deemed to have resigned from all positions he then holds as an officer or director of the Company. The Executives employment may be terminated during the Term of this Agreement pursuant to the following terms and conditions:

	Disability

	.



	 




	(i)


	                                    

	Should the Executive be unable to engage in any significant activity required by the terms of this Agreement by reason of any medically-determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or to last for a continuous period of three months or more, Executive shall be deemed disabled and the Company shall be entitled to terminate his employment. The Board shall have the right to determine disability for the purposes of this provision, relying where necessary on the advice of qualified medical providers, and any such determination shall be evidenced by the Boards written opinion delivered to the Executive and shall be final and binding on the Executive. Such written opinion shall specify with particularity the reasons supporting such opinion and shall be signed by at least a majority of the Board. The Executives employment will terminate on the first day following the determination that the Executive is disabled.



	 




	(ii)


	                                 

	Upon a determination that the Executive is disabled, the Company shall pay to the Executive (1) all earned but unpaid Base Salary through the date of termination, prorated for any partial period of employment, (2) any benefits to which Executive is entitled under any benefit plan maintained by the Company to the date of termination; (3) any accrued but unused vacation or PTO in accordance with Company policy, and (4) any unreimbursed



	 



	3













	 




	business expenses in accordance with the applicable policies of the Company (collectively, the 

	Release Agreement

	), in the form and substance reasonably requested by the Company.  The Release Agreement will require Executive to release the Company, directors, officers, employees, agents and other affiliates with the Company from any and all claims, including claims relating to Executives employment with the Company and the termination of Executives employment.  The Release Agreement must be executed and returned to the Company within either the 21 or 45 day period described in the Release Agreement (if applicable) and it must not be revoked by Executive within the seven-day revocation period described in the Release Agreement (if applicable).  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (1) the Company will provide the Release Agreement to the Executive in a timely manner to comply with the provisions under Code Section 409A, and (2) if the Company concludes, in the exercise of its discretion, that the payments due pursuant to this Agreement are subject to Section 409A of the Code, and if the consideration period, plus the revocation period described in the Release Agreement, spans two calendar years, the payments will be begin in the second calendar year.

	(ii)


	                                 


	Effective Date of Termination

	. Executives employment will terminate on the earlier to occur as determined in the sole discretion of the Company of (x) the date that Executive terminates his employment or (y) the 60th day after the expiration of the Companys cure period as specified in Section 7(e)(i).



	 




	(iii)


	                              


	Compensation and Benefits

	. If the Executive voluntarily resigns his employment for Good Reason (subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including without limitation Section 7(h)), Company will pay or provide Executive the same compensation and benefits as if the Executive was terminated by the Company without Cause as set forth in Section 7(c)(ii).



	 




	(iv)


	                             


	Release Agreement

	. The Company will not make any payment to Executive or furnish any benefit under this Section 7(e) unless Executive signs (and does not revoke) a Release Agreement pursuant to the same terms and conditions as set forth in Section 7(c)(iii).

	Executive Voluntarily Resigns Without Good Reason

	Effective Date of Termination

	Compensation and Benefits

	. If the Executive voluntarily resigns without Good Reason, the Company will pay Executive the Accrued Obligations.

	Leave of Absence

	. At the Companys sole discretion, Executive may be placed on a paid administrative leave of absence for a reasonable period of time (not to exceed 60 days unless otherwise reasonably required to resolve matters under investigation) should the Board believe it necessary for any reason, including, but not limited to confirm that reasonable grounds exist for a termination for Cause, for example, pending the outcome of any internal or other investigation or any criminal charges.  During this leave, the Company may bar Executives access to the Companys or any affiliates offices or facilities or may provide Executive with access subject to terms and conditions as the Company chooses to impose.  The Companys decision to place Executive on a paid leave of absence will not constitute grounds for Executive to terminate his employment for Good Reason and receive any severance payments or benefits pursuant to Section 7(e).



	 




	(h)


	                                


	Compliance with Code Section 409A

	To the extent required to avoid the imposition of penalties or interest under Section 409A, any payment or benefit to be paid or provided on account of the Executives Separation from Service within the meaning of Section 409A if the Executive is a specified employee (within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(B) of the Code) that would be paid or provided prior to the first day of the seventh month following the Executives Separation from Service shall be paid or provided on the first day of the seventh month following the Eligible Individuals Separation from Service or, if earlier, the date of the Executives death. Further, if required to avoid imposition of penalties or interest under 409A, the amounts payable under this Agreement and subject to 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) may not be paid before the later of (1) 18 months following the date of this Agreement, or (2) six months following the payment event.

	7













	 




	their terms) the Company or its affiliates may have against him or any remuneration or other benefit earned or received by Executive after such termination.




	 




	8.


	                                     


	Other Obligations

	.



	 




	(a)


	                                


	Ownership of Work, Materials and Documents

	. The Executive will disclose promptly to the Company any and all inventions, discoveries, and improvements (whether or not patentable or registrable under copyright or similar statutes), and all patentable or copyrightable works, initiated, conceived, discovered, reduced to practice, or made by him, either alone or in conjunction with others, during the Executives employment with the Company and related to the business or activities of the Company and its affiliates (the 

	Developments

	). Except to the extent any rights in any Developments constitute a work made for hire under the U.S. Copyright Act, which the parties acknowledge are owned by the Company and/or its applicable affiliate, the Executive assigns all of his right, title and interest in all Developments (including all intellectual property rights) to the Company or its nominee without further compensation, including all rights or benefits, including, without limitation, the right to sue and recover for past and future infringement.  Whenever requested by the Company, the Executive will execute any and all applications, assignments or other instruments which the Company deems necessary to apply for and obtain trademarks, patents or copyrights of the United States or any foreign country or otherwise protect its interests. These obligations continue beyond the end of the Executives employment with the Company with respect to inventions, discoveries, improvements or copyrightable works initiated, conceived or made by the Executive while employed by the Company, and are binding upon the Executives employers, assigns, executors, administrators and other legal representatives. Immediately upon the Companys request at any time during or following the Term, Executive is required to return to the Company any and all Confidential and Proprietary Information (as defined hereinafter) and any other property of the Company then within Executives possession, custody and/or control. Failure to return this property, whether during the term of this Agreement or after its termination, is a breach of this Agreement.



	 




	(b)


	                                


	Confidential and Proprietary Information

	. During the course of Executives employment, Executive will be exposed to a substantial amount of confidential and proprietary information, including, but not limited to, financial information, annual reports, audited and unaudited financial reports, operational budgets and strategies, geologic and well data, methods of operation, customer lists, strategic plans, business plans, marketing plans and strategies, new business strategies, merger and acquisition strategies, management systems programs, computer systems, personnel and compensation information and payroll data, and other such reports, documents or information (collectively the 

	Confidential and Proprietary Information

	).  Due to Executives senior position with the Company and its affiliates, Executive acknowledges that he regularly receives Confidential and Proprietary Information with respect to the Company and/or its affiliates; for the avoidance of doubt, all such information is expressly included in Confidential and Proprietary Information. Executive promises that Executive will not retain, take with Executive or make any copies of such Confidential and Proprietary Information in any form, format, or manner whatsoever (including paper, digital or other storage in any form) nor will Executive disclose the same in whole or in part to any person or entity, in any manner either directly or indirectly, either while the Executive is employed by the Company or following termination of his employment for any reason. Excluded from this Agreement is information that



	 



	8













	 




	(i) is or becomes publicly known through no violation of this Agreement; (ii) is lawfully received by the Executive from any third party without restriction on disclosure or use; (iii) is required to be disclosed by law; or (iv) is expressly approved in writing by the Company for release or other use by the Executive. Executive and the Company also acknowledge that because Executive is a senior executive he will have access to information (some of which is Confidential and Proprietary Information and some of which is not), employees and knowledge about the Company that is extremely valuable to the Company and which the Company needs to protect for a period of time after Executive terminates employment. Additionally, the Parties agree that the covenants in this Section 8 are reasonable and necessary to protect the Companys legitimate business interests. Executive and the Company agree that the foregoing restrictive covenants are fair and reasonable and are freely, voluntarily and knowingly entered into. Further, each party has been given the opportunity to consult with legal counsel before entering into this Agreement.




	 




	(c)


	                                 


	Judicial Amendment

	. If the scope of any provision of this Section 8 of this Agreement is found by a court to be too broad to permit enforcement to its full extent, then that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permitted by law. The parties agree that, if legally permissible, the scope of any provision of this Agreement may be modified by a judge in any proceeding to enforce this Section 8, so that the provision can be enforced to the maximum extent permitted by law. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the parties agree that it will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement.



	 




	(d)


	                                


	Injunctive Relief, Damages and Forfeiture

	. Due to the nature of Executives position with the Company, and with full realization that a violation of this Section 8 may cause immediate and irreparable injury and damage, which is not readily measurable, and to protect the parties interests, the parties understand and agree that either party may also seek injunctive relief to enforce this Agreement in a court of competent jurisdiction to cease or prevent any actual or threatened violation of this Agreement.  In any action brought pursuant to this Section 8(d), the prevailing party will be entitled to an award of attorneys fees and costs.



	 




	(e)


	                                 


	Survival

	. The provisions of this Section 8 survive the termination of this Agreement.



	 




	(f)


	                                  


	Cooperation; No Disparagement

	. So long as Executive is receiving any payments from the Company, Executive agrees to provide reasonable assistance to the Company (including assistance with litigation matters), upon the Companys request, concerning the Executives previous employment responsibilities and functions with the Company. Company will reimburse Executive for his reasonable out-of-pocket expenses Executive incurs in connection with such cooperative efforts. Additionally, at all times after the Executives employment with the Company has terminated, Company (defined for these purpose only as any Company press release and the Board, the President and the Presidents direct reports, and no other employees) and Executive agree to refrain from making any disparaging or derogatory remarks, statements and/or publications regarding the other, its employees or its services.

	General Provisions

	.



	 




	(a)


	                                


	Severability

	. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable under any applicable law, then, if legally permissible, such provision will be deemed to be modified to the extent necessary to render it legal, valid and enforceable, and if no modification will make the provision legal, valid and enforceable, then this Agreement will be construed as if not containing the provision held to be invalid, and the rights and obligations of the parties will be construed and enforced accordingly.



	 




	(b)


	                                


	Assignment by Company

	. Nothing in this Agreement precludes the Company from consolidating or merging into or with, or transferring all or substantially all of its assets to, another corporation or entity that assumes this Agreement and all obligations and undertakings hereunder. Upon any consolidation, merger or transfer of assets and assumption, the term Company means any other corporation or entity, as appropriate, and this Agreement will continue in full force and effect.



	 




	(c)


	                                 


	Entire Agreement

	.

This Agreement may be amended only in writing executed by the Company and Executive.



	 




	(d)


	                                


	Governing Law

	. Because the Company is a Colorado corporation, and because it is mutually agreed that it is in the best interests of the Company and all of its employees that a uniform body of law consistently interpreted be applied to the employment agreements to which the Company is a party, this Agreement will be deemed entered into by the Company and Executive in Colorado. The law of the State of Colorado will govern the interpretation and application of all of the provisions of this Agreement.



	 




	(e)

	this Agreement, to exercise any right or privilege conferred in this Agreement, or the waiver by that party of any breach of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement,  will not be construed as a subsequent waiver of any such terms, covenants, conditions, rights or privileges, but the waiver will continue and remain in full force and effect as if no such forbearance or waiver had occurred.  No waiver is effective unless it is in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the waiving party. This Agreement will be construed fairly as to both parties and not in favor of, or against, either party, regardless of which party prepared the Agreement. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original, and all such counterparts will constitute but one instrument.

	RESTRICTED STOCK AGREEMENT






	 




	THIS RESTRICTED STOCK AGREEMENT (this 

	Agreement

	) is made and entered into as of                      (the 

	Grant Date

	) by and between PetroShare Corp., a Colorado corporation with its principal offices at Englewood, Colorado (the 

	Company

	), and                      , an employee of the Company (the 

	Participant

	).




	 





	BACKGROUND





	 




	WHEREAS, the Company has adopted the Amended and Restated PetroShare Corp. Equity Incentive Plan (the 

	Plan

	) to permit shares of the Companys common stock (the 

	Stock

	), to be awarded to certain key salaried employees and non-employee directors of the Company and any affiliate of the Company; and




	 




	WHEREAS, the Participant is an employee of the Company, and the Company desires such person to remain in such capacity and to further an opportunity for his or her stock ownership in the Company in order to increase his or her proprietary interest in the success of the Company;




	 




	WHEREAS, certain capitalized terms not defined in this Agreement shall have the meaning assigned to them in the Plan;




	 





	AGREEMENT





	 




	NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the covenants and agreements herein set forth, the parties hereby mutually covenant and agree as follows:




	 




	1.


	                                     


	Award of Restricted Stock

	.  Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein and the Plan, the Company hereby awards the Participant         shares of Stock (the 

	Restricted Stock

	).



	 




	2.


	                                     


	Restrictions

	.  Except as otherwise provided herein, Restricted Stock may not be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, encumbered or otherwise alienated or hypothecated until the date of release (the 

	Release Date

	) determined as follows:



	 




	(a)


	                                

	the Release Date with respect to          of the shares shall be        , so long as the Participant remains continuously employed by the Company at that date;



	 




	(b)


	                                

	the Release Date with respect to an additional          shares shall be the first anniversary of the Grant Date if the Participant remains in the employ of the Company at that date; and



	 




	(c)


	                                 

	the Release Date with respect to the remaining          shares shall be the second anniversary of the Grant Date if the Participant remains in the employ of the Company at that date.



	 












	 




	3.


	                                     


	Initial Issuance

	.  The Restricted Stock shall be issued as soon as practicable in the name of the Participant but shares that are subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 2 shall be held in a segregated account by the transfer agent of the Company.  If the shares subject to restrictions are held in certificated form, those certificates shall be endorsed in blank by the Participant.  Unless forfeited as provided herein, shares of Restricted Stock eligible for release pursuant to the terms hereof shall be delivered to the Participant on the applicable Release Date.

	(a)


	                                

	On the applicable Release Date as determined in accordance with Section 2, that portion of Restricted Stock shall become free of the restrictions of Section 2 and be freely transferable by the Participant.  Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary herein however, the Participant agrees and acknowledges with respect to any Restricted Stock that has not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the 

	Act

	) that (i) he will not sell or otherwise dispose of such Stock except pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Act and any applicable state securities laws, or in a transaction which, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, is exempt from such registration, and (ii) a legend will be placed on the certificate(s) for the Restricted Stock to such effect.



	 




	(b)


	                                

	Participant understands that the Company is under no obligation to register the Restricted Stock under the Act.  Nor is the Company obligated to comply, or to assist the Participant in complying with, any exemption from such registration requirements, including supplying the Participant with any information necessary to permit routine sales of the Stock under Rule 144 of the Act.

	(b)


	                                

	If the Participant does not make an election under Section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, with respect to the Restricted Stock awarded hereunder, the Participant may satisfy the Companys withholding tax requirements by electing to have the Company withhold that number of shares of Restricted Stock otherwise deliverable to the Participant from the segregated account hereunder or to deliver to the Company a number of shares of Stock, in each case, having a Fair Market Value (as defined in the Plan) on the Tax Date (as defined below) equal to the minimum amount required to be withheld as a result of the termination of the restrictions on such Restricted Stock.  The election must be made in writing and must be delivered to the Company prior to the Tax Date.  If the number of shares so determined shall include a fractional share, the Participant shall deliver cash in lieu of such fractional share.  All elections shall be made in a form approved by the Committee and shall be subject to disapproval, in whole or in part, by the Committee.  As used herein, 

	Tax Date

	 means

	10.


	                              


	Interpretation by Committee

	.  The Participant agrees that any dispute or disagreement which may arise in connection with this Agreement shall be resolved by the Committee, in its sole discretion, and that any interpretation by the Committee of the terms of this Agreement or the Plan and any determination made by the Committee under this Agreement or the Plan may be made in the sole discretion of the Committee and shall be final, binding, and conclusive.

PetroShare Corp. Executes
Agreement to Acquire

Producing Wells and Associated
Leases

 


 


CENTENNIAL, COLORADO – (May 31,
2016) – PetroShare
Corp. (OTC.QB: PRHR) announced today that the Company has entered
into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with a major area operator to
acquire producing vertical wells and associated leases totaling
approximately 4,850 gross and 2,200 net acres in Adams County,
Colorado.  A significant portion of the acreage is located
within the Company’s Todd Creek Farms project area in
Township 1 South, Range 67 West.  All of the acreage is
currently held by production.  Closing of the acquisition is
scheduled for the second quarter of 2016 and is subject to
satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including title and
environmental diligence.

 

If completed, this acquisition would immediately
provide the Company with approximately 125 BOEPD of production from
the wells.  The acquisition would also allow for the potential
drilling of up to 36 Niobrara and Codell one mile long horizontal
wells, and includes eight (8) currently-approved horizontal well
permits. The Company will own a substantial interest in this
acreage acquisition and intends to be the operator.  It is
expected that the Company’s strategic partner will exercise
its option to acquire 50% of the interest to be acquired by the
Company.

 

The acreage is located in the southern core area
of the Greater Wattenberg oil and gas field in the DJ Basin of
Northeastern Colorado. Based on independent engineering estimates,
the potential reserves associated with this anticipated acquisition
would be a significant addition to the Company’s proven
reserve base.

 

Stephen J. Foley, CEO of PetroShare, stated,
“We are excited to have the opportunity to expand our asset
base and development drilling inventory in this marquee resource
play.  The fact that the leases associated with this
acquisition are held by production providing us flexibility as to
when we choose to further develop the acreage, is important in this
commodity price environment.  We also acknowledge the support
that we anticipate from our strategic partner, which allows us the
opportunity to participate in this significant
acquisition.”

PetroShare Corp. Announces Acquisition of Approximately 16,000 Gross (5,600 Net) Acres in the DJ Basin


/EINPresswire.com/ --  CENTENNIAL, CO--(Marketwired - December 28, 2016) -  PetroShare Corp. (OTCQB: PRHR) ("PetroShare" or the "Company"), today announced it has closed the previously-announced Purchase and Sale Agreement with a third party ("Seller") for producing vertical wells and associated leases totaling approximately 15,514 gross (11,218 net) acres located principally in Adams and Weld Counties, Colorado. The total purchase price was $5.1 Million in cash after adjustments for product inventory and suspense accounts. The Company's strategic partner and lender, Providence Energy Operators, LLC, has purchased a 50% interest in the wells and oil and gas leases acquired by the Company. The Company paid $2.55 Million in cash for its 50% share of the acquisition. The acreage is currently held by production and the acquisition increased the Company's net leasehold interest by more than 200% to approximately 8,000 net acres.
The acquisition includes approximately 3,500 gross (1,300 net) acres located within the Company's Niobrara / Codell focus area in Adams County within the Southern Core portion of the Wattenberg Field in the DJ Basin of northeastern Colorado. The acquisition has potential for up to 60 (30 net) Niobrara and Codell standard and extended length horizontal wells. 
The Company will add approximately 63 barrels of oil equivalent per day (31 BOE/D net to the Company's interest) of production from 32 producing wells and approximately 12,500 gross (4,300 net) acres of leasehold with up to 40 identified conventional vertical well locations targeting the D and J Sands which are prevalent and can be highly productive across much of the DJ Basin. The Company believes that additional D and J Sand conventional locations can be delineated with modern 3D seismic and certain areas may have the potential to be developed with horizontal wellbores. PetroShare will serve as the operator of the vertical wells included in the acquisition.
