Equity crowdfunding allows you to tap into the investment opportunities once reserved for big players like venture capital firms.  At OurCrowd you can find exclusive opportunities to buy stakes in private startup companies for as little as $10,000, putting your money to work alongside experienced investors, and joining the growing trend of getting in on the ground floor rather than waiting for a company to go public. 


As the graph below shows today’s biggest returns are going to private investments, and not to those who wait until a company goes public.




Almost all the returns are now privateCreate bar charts

OurCrowd: Sparking the Next Wave of InnovationOurCrowd is the leading global equity crowdfunding platform for accredited investors. Managed by a team of seasoned investment professionals, OurCrowd vets and selects opportunities, invests its own capital, and brings companies to its accredited membership of global investors. OurCrowd provides post-investment support to its portfolio companies, assigns industry experts as mentors, and takes board seats. The OurCrowd community of almost 20,000 investors from over 112 countries has invested over $440M into 120 portfolio companies and funds.OurCrowd's role as a startup investing platform About Startup InvestingWhy invest in startups?By investing in startups, you are investing in an asset class that has the potential to provide substantial ROI, to access investment opportunities that were previously unavailable to the masses, to empower companies doing something meaningful to you, and to drive positive change in the world.What is equity crowdfunding?Crowdfunding uses the collective cooperation of the “crowd” to pool resources together in support of a specific project. Equity-based crowdfunding is where individual investors contribute funds to a business or project in exchange for equity.Why invest with equity crowdfunding?Equity crowdfunding allows you to tap into the investment opportunities once reserved for big players like venture capital firms. On equity crowdfunding platforms like OurCrowd, you can find exclusive opportunities to buy stakes in private startup companies, putting your money to work alongside experienced investors, and join the growing trend of getting in on the ground floor rather than waiting for a company to go public.Using OurCrowdHow do I join OurCrowd?It is simple to sign up: Register as an accredited investor; once your account is set up, you’ll have full access to information about the OurCrowd companies available for investment. Please note that there may be additional accreditation requirements that you must fulfill before making investments.Why is accreditation a requirement?Early stage, privately-held companies are high-risk investments, and many countries require individuals to meet certain financial criteria before being allowed to participate in these investments. Accreditation criteria vary country-by-country, but all address the following:Minimum level of income and/or net worth of investors.The investors must provide documents that proves that they meet these criteria.For example, the United States government requires that investors have an annual income of $200,000 ($300,000 if filing joint) for the last two years or a net worth, not including primary residence, of $1,000,000 in order to invest in early stage companies.*Accreditation criteria varies from country to country, for more information contact us.How do I make an investment?View the deals available to accredited investors in the “browse companies” section of the website. You will be provided with material about the company, including videos, presentation, analysis, deal terms, team backgrounds and more. You will also be able to participate in a webinar, call or meeting with company management as per request. Once you have decided to make an investment, you will indicate your amount on the Commit button. We will make allocations based on a process which combines both a first-come first-served and pro-rata calculation. We will send you deal documentation for signing and then transfer instructions.The deal documentation includes your signed certification that you meet your country’s income, asset, and/or experience criteria. In the US, you must have a licensed professional (broker, lawyer, accountant, investment adviser) sign a letter that certifies that you qualify. More details on our accreditation page.For further information browse the site, sign up, or contact us.Who is behind OurCrowd?Jon Medved, the co-founder and CEO of OurCrowd, is a leading Israeli venture capitalist and serial entrepreneur. He is the founder of Israel Seed, which has raised and managed $262M over four funds. He has made 100 investments (including both his angel and VC investment) in Israeli startup companies, 12 of which have reached an excess of $100M in value. Most recently, Jon founded and was the CEO of Vringo, publicly traded on NYSE MKT (VRNG).Steven Blumgart, the co-founder and Chairman of OurCrowd, is a leading investor and philanthropist. Steven was part of the senior management team at Glencore International (GLEN.LE) where he headed their aluminum business.Read more about Our Team

“It just seems like it’s raining Aussies on us. I’ve never seen so many,” says Jon Medved, chief executive of OurCrowd and one of Israel’s leading hi-tech venture capitalists. After a period of “clearly not enough” investment in innovation, Australia seems poised for a “really great moment”, he believes.

[Crowdfund Insider] OurCrowd’s Jon Medved: Business is Booming
OurCrowd’s co-founder and CEO Jon Medved is one of the most vocal advocates in the investment crowdfunding sector. Medved has created one of the most prominent funding marketplaces, eschewing borders and definitions to raise capital for promising early stage companies around the globe.
A best in breed crowdfunding site, OurCrowd invests in every single company that it lists on its platform – so investor interest is closely aligned. OurCrowd has garnered unique deal access, too. Smaller investors can find themselves investing alongside big name VCs like Sequoia, Khosla Ventures and perhaps Mark Cuban. This is typically pretty difficult unless you have big money or operate in Silicon Valley.

Internet Security












OverviewAt OurCrowd, ensuring data security of our clients, partners and employees is a top priority.While OurCrowd utilizes various security practices and measures to protect our clients’ confidential information, as the end user, you play an important role in safeguarding against risks related to virus attacks, unauthorized access and fraudulent online transactions. As part of our commitment to keeping your account and personal information safe and secure, we’ve compiled some best practices to help you protect yourself and to understand your role with respect to the Internet.Internet Fraud, Phishing and SpoofingPhishing is the practice of using fraudulent e-mails that appear to be from a company you have done business with and copies of legitimate websites to extract financial data and other personal information from unsuspecting computer users. Fraudsters continue to expand in sophistication and customers of financial institutions are increasingly targets of these scams. Because phishing and spoofing emails often look genuine and may appear to originate from real people, organizations, institutions and websites, the following precautions are suggested:E-mail Precautions:Just because OurCrowd is contained in an email or web address does not guarantee that it is an OurCrowd website or from an OurCrowd employee. Our emails will always be from @ourcrowd.com.Never open a website using a link provided in a suspicious e-mail. Links and the e-mail sender address can be forged. Instead, type the URL directly into the website or use your stored bookmarks.Be cautious about clicking links, opening attachments, or downloading files from e-mails regardless of file type or who sent them.Avoid including sensitive personal information in e-mail messages. A better practice is to call a company directly at the contact number you have from a reliable source or from the actual OurCrowd website, not one provided in an email.Be wary of requests that ask you to perform an urgent action (e.g., “Security Check”, “Activation”, or requests to wire funds/make payments).Be on the lookout for typos, grammatical errors, awkward writing and poor visual design and other errors, as they are often the mark of fraudulent e-mails and websites.When OurCrowd requires funds to be deposited for investments, the account will always be at a bank in the United States with no further forwarding to another account. Do not send money to OurCrowd to a non US/Israel account unless directed via secure methods on the OurCrowd site. When in doubt, call us.Online Access Precautions:Always type the official website address (URL) when logging into OurCrowd or your financial institutions.When logging into the website, check for a letter ‘s’ immediately after the “http” prefix and for the closed lock icon at the right-hand bottom of the screen. This indicates that both the site and connection are encrypted.Review websites for their privacy policies and guidance on staying safe online.Be wary of any request that asks you to disclose or verify information about yourself or your accounts, in particular, passwords or other information that a financial services provider may use to identify you (e.g. date of birth, mother's maiden name).Computer System Precautions:Keep computer software (e.g., system patches, anti-virus, and anti-spyware) up to date with the latest security patches.Contact the relevant institution immediately if you notice anything irregular with your bank account or other online accounts.If your computer and/or Internet connection appear erratic or crashes unusually during a session, disconnect the session and contact your provider’s support desk for assistance.How to Contact OurCrowdContact OurCrowd when you notice any suspicious account activity or experience any information security related events.Contact us External Sources of InformationPlease click the respective links below for further information:United StatesFederal Trade Commission (FTC)U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) Israelgov.il internet safetyAustraliaaustralia.gov.au online safetyUnited KingdomPrudential Regulation Authority (PRA)Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)British Bankers' Association (BBA)

Building a Case for Investing in StartupsAfter deciding to get more involved in startup investing, the next step for a serious investor is to plan fordiversification. Diversification is a fundamental strategy for hedging risk in any asset class. Spreadinginvestments across different sectors and stages can statistically decrease structural risk and improve theROI of the overall portfolio. With OurCrowd’s Portfolio Reserve, accredited investors can easily builddiverse startup portfolios.About Portfolio ReservePortfolio Reserve is similar to a self-directed mutual fund of startups, with a few important caveats.Portfolio Reserve is a way to pre-fund an escrow account and simplify the investment process. Investorschoose a default allocation amount for new deals and maintain full discretion over their investments.Portfolio Reservists receive VIP treatment and are never put on a waiting list for oversubscribed investments.The minimum to open a Portfolio Reserve is $100k with allocations starting at $5k per company.Primary BenefitsBuild a startup investment portfolio with minimal paperwork Reserve a spot in every new investment - even the highest-demand opportunities - while retaining the right to opt out of any investment Start with a minimum $5K investment per startup for greater diversity Watch the video below to learn more about how Portfolio Reserve works. To speak to an OurCrowd representative, please fill in the form to the right.
How It Works

FAQS
How does it work?For investors seeking to build a diverse startup portfolio, Portfolio Reserve is a way to pre-fund an escrow account and simplify the investment process. Investors choose a default allocation amount for new deals and maintain full discretion over their investments.What is the minimum? The minimum to open a Portfolio Reserve is $100k. Allocations start at $5k per company.Who decides in which companies I invest, and how much I invest?Portfolio Reservists are automatically allocated into every new company in which OurCrowd invests. When an investor opens a Portfolio Reserve, they decide up front their default allocation for the investment. With proper notice, they can change this amount per investment. Do you invest in every deal? If so, how much does OurCrowd invest?OurCrowd diligences, curates, and ultimately invests in roughly 2% of the deals we see at a pace of roughly one new investment per week. We invest our own funds into each deal.Is allocation guaranteed for every deal? What about follow-on rounds?Portfolio Reservists are not automatically reserved allocations in follow-on rounds and need to inform their Investor Relations contact to opt into the investment.How long do I have to decide on a new investment?Investors have a 7-day opt-out period to decide if they do not want to participate in a new investment opportunity. Is there a difference in fees for Portfolio Reserve?No, Portfolio Reserve is a tool to simplify the investment process. Your investments are in individual companies. You can find more information on OurCrowd¹s fee structure on the website: www.ourcrowd.com. In the event of an oversubscription, what happens to my investment?Portfolio Reservists are never put on a waiting list. In the event that one of our companies is oversubscribed, Portfolio Reservists are guaranteed at least a minimum, pre-defined allocation.What if I don’t like a company?Investors can cancel the deal online or notify their Investor Relations representative by sending an email stating the preference to opt out of the particular deal. If the notification happens on a phone call or in person, the Investors Relations contact will email the verification of this request to the Portfolio Reservist. Can I increase my account later on? Yes. Once investors’ Portfolio Reserve funds have been fully allocated and deployed, they receive a notification asking whether to refill the active balance.Do I collect interest on my funds once transferred?Investor funds remain in a non-interest bearing escrow account (JP Morgan Chase) until deployment. Funds are reserved and allocated into new companies at the time of launch on the OurCrowd platform.What if I want to cancel the account?If you decide to cancel your Portfolio Reserve or would like a refund of the unallocated balance, OurCrowd will return your funds within 30 days.How does this save me time and make investing easier?You sign one set of documents and make one wire transfer. This would save you time (and money) on completing documents and wiring for individual deals. What kind of documentation do I need to provide and sign?If new to OurCrowd, there are standard documents required to complete. For Portfolio Reserve, there is one document which needs to be signed on a once-off basis. See here for the full Terms and Conditions.Still have questions? Contact us.

Edenshield II
Non-Toxic Crop Protection


Company Information

Website:
http://www.eden-shield.com 
Sector:
Agricultural products & related activities
Location:
Jerusalem, Israel



Eden Shield is the producer of a novel plant extract that makes crops odorless to insects. This helps prevent several billion dollars worth of damage to crops annually, and reduces insecticide use by up to 75%.
4 reasons to take a look:
1. Patented, odor-masking technology: 
EdenShield has developed a bio-insecticide based on a plant extract that masks the odor of crops, making them undetectable to common insects. It is effective for tomatoes, peppers, herbs, medical cannabis, etc.
By comparison, traditional insecticides protect crops by poisoning insects as they eat the crops, and inevitably end up being consumed by humans. Traditional insecticides rapidly become ineffective as insects become resistant to their effects. In response, farmers use increasingly higher quantities of insecticides to protect their crops.
Eventually, farmers are forced to stop using the insecticide, either because the insects become immune or because of health and environmental regulations. EdenShield brings two key advantages over other solutions: Firstly, since odor masking technology does not attack insects, it is not subject to resistance; and secondly, the solution is entirely non-toxic. 
EdenShield has demonstrated in field trials that its solution reduces insects by 81%-100%, resulting in increased yield and a reduction of insecticide used on behalf of the farmer.
2. Progress since previous investment: 
The company had eight successful Israeli and European beta-sites in 2015, which led to 15 orders of its Gatekeeper solution in H1 2016. 
Additionally, the company has built a pipeline of potential customers and distribution partners in Spain, Italy, Greece, Mexico, and Israel (expecting 90 new orders in H2 2016). 
EdenShield also successfully tested and began initial sales for its foliar spray products targeted at home hydroponic systems and greenhouses (including medicinal cannabis growers, that are particularly sensitive to toxicity due the medical application of their crops). Furthermore, the farm used to grow EdenShield’s formula-yielding crops has been expanded from a 0.5 acre plot (pre-investment), to a 10 acre plot today. The yield per square meter has also been increased. 
Moreover, the  company continues to optimize the amount of active ingredient in its formula in order to bring down the cost of the product. EdenShield continues to engage with regulatory authorities and expects Spain to be the first country in which it receives clearance for open field spraying, allowing access to this much larger market. 
The company also received its first granted US patent, and filed several additional patents.
3. Addressing large and rapidly-growing market: 
In the near term, EdenShield’s product will be applied to screens and nets used in greenhouses. The greenhouse crop-protection market is valued at $2 billion. Longer term, EdenShield’s solution will target the market for open-field insecticides, valued at $11 billion. 
The solution is effective against Whiteflies, Thrips and Tuta Absoluta, which collectively cause over $2 billion in crop damage, despite billions of dollars spent on greenhouse crop protection and open field insecticides. 
Additionally, a new and rapidly growing market opportunity for EdenShield is the market for medical cannabis. The same insects against which EdenShield effectively protects traditional vegetable/herb/flower are three of the most common insects that damage cannabis crops. 
4. Skilled management team with a strong industry track-record: 
EdenShield’s management is comprised of an eight person team with deep industry experience in the fields of chemical engineering, agronomy, entomology, industrial engineering and business development. 
The team is led by Yaniv Kitron and Guy Malchi, who each have over 20 years of industry experience at leading companies such as Netafim, Israel Chemicals and Fertilizers and Rosetta Genomics (ROSG).

Israel’s EdenShield Raises $1 Million for Nontoxic Pesticides






















EdenShield,   a portfolio company of The Trendlines Group’s Agtech which develops nontoxic pesticides,   recently completed an investment round of just over $1 million,   led by OurCrowd. The Company,   now in commercial stage,   will use the funds to expand operations,   establish a distribution network,   and reinforce the Company’s team.
Israeli scientists have been at the forefront of agro-tech for decades. This has included innovations in water conservation as well as the development of safer and less expensive ways to protect crops.
As a nation famous for establishing new farms in the desert Israel was at the head of world agro-tech before there even was such a thing as height tech. Today its strong environmental community has been blending Israeli tech innovation with green tech.
EdenShield’s nontoxic technology for insect control is based on extracts of medicinal plants endemic to Israel’s semi-desert. The company boasts that by leveraging the beneficial characteristics of desert plants,   the product masks the odor of the crop and lowers insect attraction,   causing the insects to simply pursue feeding options elsewhere.
Pests cause damage of more than $2 billion annually,   by direct damage to crops or through the transmission of devastating viruses. Conventional chemical pesticides are ineffective,   as insects quickly develop resistance,   even in a single growing season. The EdenShield material,   the firm asserts,   sustains its efficacy throughout the entire growing season of the crop,   and insects do not develop resistance to it. A natural material,   the EdenShield product can be used close to harvest,   without health risks associated with conventional pesticides.
The Company’s first product (NET) is applied to greenhouse screens. Its second product (DIRECT) is applied directly to greenhouses flowers and medical cannabis. Tests demonstrated that EdenShield’s product lowers greenhouse penetration of thrips,   whiteflies,   red spider mites,   and tuta absoluta by over 90%.
Yaniv Kitron,   CEO of EdenShield,   remarked,   “We are delighted with the completion of the financing round and the support of OurCrowd,   which will enable us to commercialize our products and to respond to the great interest we are getting from farmers and partners.”
Elan Zivotofsky,   General Partner at OurCrowd,   commented,   “We are excited about our investment in EdenShield because of their unique ‘green’ value proposition and disruptive technology that addresses a major pain point in farming,   globally.”

Foreign Investment in Israeli Company Focusing on Insect Prevention

EdenShield, a company which specializes in odor masking insect prevention, gains investmentJanuary 11, 2015

EdenShield, Trendlines Agtech subsidiary, recently completed an investment round led by OurCrowd of just over $1 million. The Company, which is in commercial stage now, will use the funds to expand operations, establish a distribution network, and reinforce the Company’s team. 
EdenShield’s nontoxic insect control technology is based on extracts of medicinal plants endemic to Israel’s semi-desert. The product masks the odor of the crop and lowers insect attraction, leveraging the beneficial characteristics of desert plants, causing the insects to simply pursue feeding options elsewhere.
Pests cause damage of over $2 billion annually, by direct damage to crops or indirectly through the transmission of devastating viruses. Conventional chemical pesticides are ineffective, as insects quickly develop resistance, even in a single growing season. This pest control material sustains its efficacy throughout the entire growing season of the crop, and insects do not develop resistance to it. As a natural material, the EdenShield product can be used close to harvest, without health risks associated with conventional pesticides.
The Company’s first product (NET) is applied to greenhouse screens. Its second product (DIRECT) is applied directly to greenhouse flowers and medical cannabis. Tests showed that this product lowers greenhouse penetration of whiteflies, thrips, tuta absoluta, red spider mites, and by over 90%.

Equity crowdfunding allows you to tap into the investment opportunities once reserved for big players like venture capital firms.  At OurCrowd you can find exclusive opportunities to buy stakes in private startup companies for as little as $10,000, putting your money to work alongside experienced investors, and joining the growing trend of getting in on the ground floor rather than waiting for a company to go public. 


As the graph below shows today’s biggest returns are going to private investments, and not to those who wait until a company goes public.




Almost all the returns are now privateCreate bar charts

OurCrowd: Sparking the Next Wave of InnovationOurCrowd is the leading global equity crowdfunding platform for accredited investors. Managed by a team of seasoned investment professionals, OurCrowd vets and selects opportunities, invests its own capital, and brings companies to its accredited membership of global investors. OurCrowd provides post-investment support to its portfolio companies, assigns industry experts as mentors, and takes board seats. The OurCrowd community of almost 20,000 investors from over 112 countries has invested over $440M into 120 portfolio companies and funds.OurCrowd's role as a startup investing platform About Startup InvestingWhy invest in startups?By investing in startups, you are investing in an asset class that has the potential to provide substantial ROI, to access investment opportunities that were previously unavailable to the masses, to empower companies doing something meaningful to you, and to drive positive change in the world.What is equity crowdfunding?Crowdfunding uses the collective cooperation of the “crowd” to pool resources together in support of a specific project. Equity-based crowdfunding is where individual investors contribute funds to a business or project in exchange for equity.Why invest with equity crowdfunding?Equity crowdfunding allows you to tap into the investment opportunities once reserved for big players like venture capital firms. On equity crowdfunding platforms like OurCrowd, you can find exclusive opportunities to buy stakes in private startup companies, putting your money to work alongside experienced investors, and join the growing trend of getting in on the ground floor rather than waiting for a company to go public.Using OurCrowdHow do I join OurCrowd?It is simple to sign up: Register as an accredited investor; once your account is set up, you’ll have full access to information about the OurCrowd companies available for investment. Please note that there may be additional accreditation requirements that you must fulfill before making investments.Why is accreditation a requirement?Early stage, privately-held companies are high-risk investments, and many countries require individuals to meet certain financial criteria before being allowed to participate in these investments. Accreditation criteria vary country-by-country, but all address the following:Minimum level of income and/or net worth of investors.The investors must provide documents that proves that they meet these criteria.For example, the United States government requires that investors have an annual income of $200,000 ($300,000 if filing joint) for the last two years or a net worth, not including primary residence, of $1,000,000 in order to invest in early stage companies.*Accreditation criteria varies from country to country, for more information contact us.How do I make an investment?View the deals available to accredited investors in the “browse companies” section of the website. You will be provided with material about the company, including videos, presentation, analysis, deal terms, team backgrounds and more. You will also be able to participate in a webinar, call or meeting with company management as per request. Once you have decided to make an investment, you will indicate your amount on the Commit button. We will make allocations based on a process which combines both a first-come first-served and pro-rata calculation. We will send you deal documentation for signing and then transfer instructions.The deal documentation includes your signed certification that you meet your country’s income, asset, and/or experience criteria. In the US, you must have a licensed professional (broker, lawyer, accountant, investment adviser) sign a letter that certifies that you qualify. More details on our accreditation page.For further information browse the site, sign up, or contact us.Who is behind OurCrowd?Jon Medved, the co-founder and CEO of OurCrowd, is a leading Israeli venture capitalist and serial entrepreneur. He is the founder of Israel Seed, which has raised and managed $262M over four funds. He has made 100 investments (including both his angel and VC investment) in Israeli startup companies, 12 of which have reached an excess of $100M in value. Most recently, Jon founded and was the CEO of Vringo, publicly traded on NYSE MKT (VRNG).Steven Blumgart, the co-founder and Chairman of OurCrowd, is a leading investor and philanthropist. Steven was part of the senior management team at Glencore International (GLEN.LE) where he headed their aluminum business.Read more about Our Team
