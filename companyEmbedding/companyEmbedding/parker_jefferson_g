I went through several "family law specialists" who had a smaller retainer, but ended up charging me outrageous fees while getting nothing done!  I came to a point where I was very discouraged with attorneys only responding at their convenience and upon opposing counsel's request. I can tell you- this is not the case with Mr. Howard and his staff!  They extremely PROFESSIONAL and will Email you any and all correspondence right away. They are STRATEGIC and FORWARD-THINKING. This attorney knows the law very well and is extremely efficient. He managed to resolve major complications within less than 3 months when other attorneys did nothing for 3 years!  It was well worth it and I feel blessed that I was able to find and retain this attorney as he has defended me and protected my child as if we were his own family. If you want a lawyer who will get things done, GET HOWARD! No regrets!Bloom Legal LLCLacar M. ratedI have used these guys more than once for minor legal problems, and they are the best. They will not forget you exist or make you wait forever before they call you back. They are very friendly and easy to work with and, most importantly, great at making annoying legal problems go away. Even if you do not currently have a legal problem and don't expect to, write down their number and put it in your wallet anyway. Because seriously, they are the people you want to call first is something dumb happens. Even if you got yourself into the situation by being stupid and/or irresponsible, they will put you at ease and figure it out for you without making you feel like the idiot you might actually be.Bloom Legal LLCZacharius R. ratedSeth Bloom routinely went out of his way to provide outstanding service with a couple of legal issues I’ve faced since relocating to New Orleans.  He’s extremely knowledgeable as a criminal defense professional, and never failed to give me the most sound advice on my legal proceedings. Most importantly, I feel that Seth is really out for my best interest—as his client, I felt that he does really care.  His staff was extremely on top of both my cases and even answered questions and email after hours and on the weekend. I would highly recommend Seth for anyone in need in the New Orleans area.Calogero Law FirmIluta U. ratedWhen life strikes you with many unpredictable things, and when the most horrible things happen, it is always amazing to meet people who you can count on. Gerald Calogero is not only a amazing person, good listener, but, since the first day, he has been outstanding, hard working, consistent, persistent, and he never leaves you out of the loop. I had a very difficult and serious injury case, and I could never imagine that it will have positive consequences, but Gerald Calogero took a good care of everything. Highly recommend for anyone who needs a lawyer. Bloom Legal LLCFord C. ratedMr. Bloom has a great practice in New Orleans. His office is extremely easy to find and his staff is professional and efficient. He worked well with my case and got me the results I wanted. He is very detail oriented, often times stopping to ask if I had questions and clarifying all points of confusion. My whole family has been happy with his work and we use him whenever trouble arises. We have been very happy with his work so far and plan to use him for any problems that may arise in the future.Bloom Legal LLClespoc ratedI was referred to Seth when I ...I was referred to Seth when I had to sue my flood insurance carrier after Hurricane Katrina.  Seth was extremely professional, knowledgable and timely in keeping me informed about the progress of my case.  Seth ultimaltely got us policy limits; we were very pleased.  Several years later when I was seriously injured in a car accident, I again called Seth.  We ultimately settled for $5000 less than policy limits.  Again, I was extremely satisfied.  I give Seth Bloom my highest recommendation!Bloom Legal LLCMarcus G. ratedBloom Legal made handling my recent legal matter seem effortless and stress-free. Not only were they professional and efficient, but I felt a very genuine concern to help me with my situation. Within a matter of days after discussing my matter with Mr. Bloom, I received an confirmation that the issue had been resolved with almost no effort on my part. I would recommend Bloom Legal highly for anyone dealing with traffic court issues like mine. 5 stars!Bloom Legal LLCNick D. ratedAlthough I typically avoid situations that require legal help, I accidentally got into an issue while at school here in NOLA.  Being far away from home made it a bit more challenging, but having met Seth before, I had help right away.  He was very helpful with the situation and offered great advice for future issues as well as how to avoid these problems better.  Everything was taken care of and Seth's office did it all effectively and discretely.Bloom Legal LLCimmjoph96 ratedMy experience with Bloom Legal...My experience with Bloom Legal has been nothing short of excellent. I was dealing with a routine traffic ticket but I was quite concerned about how it would affect my clean driving record. Seth Bloom and everyone I dealt with at Bloom Legal not only put my mind at ease, but they took care of the ticket while keeping my record in tact. I would recommend Seth to anyone looking for courtesy, honesty, and results.Bloom Legal LLCElizabeth A. ratedMy experience with Bloom Legal has been so efficient and stress-free. They have helped me with several problems over the last five years and each time I have been confident with my decision about choosing their representation and the results have no disappointed me. I will continue using this law firm and would strongly encourage anyone else looking for quality representation to contact Bloom Legal. Did You Know?Types of AttorneysThe legal profession is vast, with each attorney having his or her specialties. Here are some of the most common attorneys individuals seek out when they require legal aid:Criminal Lawyer
A criminal defense lawyer is probably the attorney the average person imagines. Criminal attorneys are the men and women who defend individuals accused of a crime. The lawyer may work pro bono - for the public good - so the accused is certain to have representation, even if he or she cannot afford an attorney.Criminal lawyers are experts in the criminal justice system. They help their clients decide how to plead when first charged by the police and guide them through trial procedures. Defense lawyers must use every bit of their knowledge and resources to get their clients the fairest results from criminal proceedings.Business Lawyer
If you are a small business owner or the head of a larger corporation, you may come into contact with a business lawyer. Many big companies keep a legal staff on payroll to deal with the daily operations of running and maintaining a large enterprise. Business lawyers may have more specific specialties like copyright law, product liability and mergers and acquisitions.Business attorneys may focus their practices on certain industries. There are entertainment lawyers to guide artists through royalties and media contracts, while hospitals employ malpractice attorneys to protect doctors from aggressive litigation.Employment Lawyer
When you work for a company, you may find yourself in need of an employment lawyer - especially if the relationship between you and your employer sours. An employment attorney prevents people from losing their jobs due to unfair reasons. Workers' compensation lawyers help maintain safe employment conditions and ensure workers receive fair compensation after workplace injury or discrimination.Finance Lawyer
A personal finance attorney can protect and manage your investments and securities. You may use a finance lawyer to help you prepare your taxes, but you might be better off working with an accountant. A tax attorney is more commonly contacted after a business or individual runs into trouble with the IRS or state regulators.Real Estate Lawyer
Your family may keep a lawyer on retainer to guide you through the major expenses that come up in life. When buying a home, you could work with a real estate lawyer to make sure you get the best deal and won't get taken advantage of by tricky mortgage agreements or unfair landlords. An estate attorney can help you plan for the worst by creating a will and preparing your finances for after your death.Bankruptcy Lawyer
A bankruptcy lawyer is essential to help you resolve your financial difficulties when they start to spin out of control. Certain attorneys help create strategies to bring you out of debt and speak to your creditors. A lawyer can advise you on which type of bankruptcy you should file for.Civil Lawyer
If you are suing someone or being sued, you need a civil lawyer. Civil attorneys - and criminal lawyers - are the legal representatives who argue on your behalf in a courtroom setting. Civil lawyers may represent you on matters of business, finance or a wide variety of other specialized needs.One of the most common types of civil attorneys is a personal injury lawyer. When you're hurt by an outside party and you would like to hold them legally responsible, a personal injury attorney conducts litigation and negotiates settlements to compensate for your pain and suffering. Sometimes many wronged people will join together with a single civil lawyer or law office to form a class action lawsuit.Family/Divorce Lawyer
Most people will turn to a lawyer during a divorce to navigate the emotionally charged legal proceedings. A divorce attorney can assist in determining grounds for separation, division of property and custody of children.Family attorneys deal with much more personal matters. If you're getting married, a family lawyer can help you prepare a prenuptial agreement or other family planning paperwork such as adoption or inheritance documents.Questions One Should Ask a Lawyer Before Hiring ThemTo ensure you find a competent attorney who won't abuse your trust or drain your finances, you have to make the proper inquiries. There are several questions you should ask, but the majority will fall under three general topics:Training and Experience Questions
One of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorney's history. When you first step into a lawyer's office, you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas. You have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practice's success. Look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of court.Once you inquire about the broad details of their legal career, you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue. You should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs. Lawyers can't mention clients by name, but you should ask for basic details about identical past cases.Financial Questions
You need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney. You should request a list of all costs in advance so you won't be surprised by additional expenses like overhead. Also determine exactly when you will start being billed. You want to inspect paperwork carefully. If the attorney charges you for his or her experience, you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistant.Find out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour. Many civil lawyers work on contingency. Whatever the payment plan, make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performance.Lawyer/Client Relationship Questions
When you hire a lawyer, you're agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time. You need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship. The attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updates.You should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust. Ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyer/client relationship. Great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier, such as how to keep fees down or what daily disruptions you should expect from a long legal battle. The more forthcoming the lawyer appears to be with individual needs, the better.Top Reasons to Hire a LawyerYou may keep a lawyer on retainer or you could turn to an attorney during specific situations. Here are some common reasons people begin seeking legal representation or advice:You Know Your Limitations
If you sign documents and you come across a word you don't recognize, you need assistance. You may need a third party to help you navigate important employment or real estate paperwork. It's essential you fully understand the terms of any legally binding documentation or activity you become a part of. If you are not an expert in a given field, you'll want to hire an attorney who is.A lawyer may find legal implications or opportunities you might miss. If you find yourself in a civil or criminal matter, a proper attorney ensures you don't receive a harsh punishment for a small mistake.You're Facing an Important Event/Decision
When making decisions critical to your financial stability or personal life, you may want a lawyer with expertise in your situation to make sure you do everything you can to arrive at the proper resolution. This is especially true when you become involved in a criminal case and your freedom is on the line.It's not just a matter of legal knowledge; lawyer's have access to numerous resources you do not. They have staff ready to work around the clock and experts in a variety of fields to give your important issues the attention they deserve.You Can't Be Impartial
During times when personal matters intersect with legal proceedings, you may need to have an advocate to prevent your emotions from getting in the way of level-headed thinking. For example, divorce lawyers can mediate a heated argument and help both partners get on with their lives.Emotional investment could be subtle. You may want to have a lawyer look over an investment opportunity that looks too good to be true or investigate the merits of a possible civil suit when you feel wronged.You're Out of Options
Many people turn to lawyers when they are in trouble. If you've been accused of a crime or are in a terrible financial situation, you can find an attorney who will work with what you have available to assist you as you deal with your problems.Personal injury lawyers find solutions for people who can no longer work under their own power and bankruptcy attorneys prevent people from giving in to debt. If you find yourself in a situation where you can't find a solution, a lawyer may be able to offer the counsel you need.How to Choose a LawyerWhen it comes time to choose a lawyer, you should start by searching close to home. While you probably don't want the conflict of interest that comes from being represented by a family member, friends and loved ones can recommend lawyers who served them well in the past. If you do have attorneys you are familiar with, ask who they believe would be best for you.After going through personal references - especially from individuals who had similar needs - you should broaden your search through public information resources. You can call your area's attorney referral service or check legal organizations like Martindale-Hubbell. There are other resources available online. You should check websites for client reviews and other third-party forms of approval.When you build a list of possible candidates, perform a background check on each one. See if you can find information on their history and success record. Once you find a possible lawyer, you should call to arrange a consultation so you can ask your important questions in person.By performing the necessary research and taking every available precaution, you can narrow your search to the attorney most suited to your needs.

		COMING IN AUGUST!



A P.I. carrying his own vicious wounds hired to 
track that soldier down.

A race against the clock to bring the soldier home before he reveals the secret 
that haunts him.

Roland Ford�once a Marine, then a cop, now a private investigator�is good at 
finding people. But when he�s asked to locate Air Force veteran Clay Hickman, he 
realizes he�s been drawn into something deep and dark. He knows the weight of 
war, having served as a Marine in First Fallujah; he also knows the nightmare of 
indescribable personal pain, as only two years have passed since his young 
wife�s sudden death. What he doesn�t know is why a shroud of secrecy hangs over 
the disappearance of Clay Hickman�and why he�s getting a different story from 
everyone involved.

Soon, what began as just a job becomes a life-and-death obsession for Ford, 
pitting him against immensely powerful and treacherous people and forcing him to 
contend with chilling questions about truth, justice, and the American way.

		NOW AVAILABLE: CRAZY BLOOD



The Carson dynasty rules the ski resort town of 
Mammoth Lakes in the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California. Founded by patriarch 
Adam, the town is the site of the Mammoth Cup ski race-a qualifier for the 
Olympics. But when Wylie Welborn, Adam's illegitimate grandson, returns after a 
stint in Afghanistan, it reopens a dark moment in Carson family history: the 
murder of Wylie's father by his jealous and very pregnant wife, Cynthia. Her son 
Sky, born while his mother was in prison, and Wylie are half-brothers. They 
inherit not only superb athletic skills but an enmity that threatens to play out 
in a lethal drama on one of the fastest and most perilous ski slopes in the 
world.Three powerful and unusual women 
have central roles in this volatile family feud: Cynthia, bent on destroying 
Wylie; his mother Kathleen, determined to protect him; and April Holly, a 
beautiful celebrity snowboarder, on track to win Olympic Gold. But, as Wylie 
falls in love with April and they begin to imagine a life away from the violence 
that has shattered his family, history threatens to repeat itself and destroy 
them both.

Combining exquisite writing with breathtaking scenes of high stakes skiing, 
CRAZY BLOOD is an unforgettable story!

Patrick 
		Norris has seen the worst that Afghanistan has to offer�punishing heat, 
		bitter cold, and buddies blown away by bombs and snipers. He returns 
		home exhilarated by his new freedom and eager to realize his dream of a 
		sport fishing business. But the avocado ranch his family has owned for

THE FAMOUS AND THE DEAD 
is the explosive 
		conclusion to T. Jefferson Parker�s New York Times bestselling Charlie 
		Hood series



		Los 
		Angeles County sheriff �s deputy Charlie Hood is attached to the ATF, 
		working undercover on the iron river that flows across the U.S.-Mexican 
		border. The diamond fillings he wears in his left canine glimmer, 
		distracting the men who sell the illegal firearms that enable the 
		unspeakable violence on both sides of the map. Spotting the sparkle when 
		�Charlie Diamonds� opens his mouth is often their first step toward life 
		behind bars.

		Meanwhile, Bradley Jones, sheriff �s deputy and employee of the Baja 
		Cartel, son of the love of Charlie�s life, the deceased L.A. outlaw 
		Suzanne Jones, is expecting a son of his own. Suzanne was descended from 
		famed Mexican desperado Joaquin Murrieta, whose embalmed head Bradley 
		inherited from her and keeps nestled among piles of cash, proceeds from 
		Bradley�s own life of crime.

		Charlie knows all of Bradley�s secrets; the question is what he�ll do 
		with the information. Until he decides, his obsession remains the 
		inexplicable existence of Mike Finnegan, the diminutive devil who flits 
		in and out of both men�s lives, knowing things he shouldn�t, seemingly 
		immortal.

Erin McKenna, a beautiful songwriter married to a crooked Los Angeles County 
sheriff’s deputy, is kidnapped by Benjamin Armenta, the ruthless leader of the 
powerful Gulf Cartel. But his demands turn out to be as unusual as the crumbling 
castle in which Erin is kept. She is ordered to compose a unique narcocorrido, a 
folk ballad that records the exploits of the drug dealers, gunrunners, and 
outlaws who have populated Mexican history for generations. Under threat of 
death, Armenta orders Erin to tell his life story—in music—and write “the 
greatest narcocorrido of all time.”






 





 

THE BORDER LORDS

ATF agent Sean Ozburn is deep undercover supporting the sicarios of the 
	Baja Cartel when he suddenly goes completely dark, his only communications 
	being the haunting digital videos he sends to his desperately worried wife, 
	Seliah. Charlie Hood must determine if Oz is simply chasing demons deeper 
	undercover than anyone has ever gone, or whether his friend has suffered a 
	permanent break with his mission and his moral compass.  






 






 

IRON RIVER

US
 
 




 





This time around, 
	Hood is running the California-Mexico border with the ATF, searching for the 
	iron river – the massive and illegal flow of handguns and automatic weapons 
	that fuels the bloody cartel wars south of the border. Gunrunners by nature 
	aren’t exactly ethical, but the lengths they’ll go to, and the innocent 
	lives they’ll risk, are shocking even to Hood.














 

THE RENEGADES


Synopsis and reviews
Excerpt
	 



US
 
 








Some say that outlaws 
no longer exist, that the true spirit of the American West died with the 
legendary bandits of pulp novels and bedtime stories. Charlie Hood knows that 
nothing could be further from the truth. These days he patrols vast stretches of 
the new American West, not on horseback but in his cruiser. The outlaws may not 
carry six-shooters, but they’re strapped all the same.

Wells Fargo


                                            I find it quite disturbing to see 24 one star, the lowest, ratings on the first page of Wallet Hub's most recent reviews of Wells Fargo. Somehow, in its overall summary, Wallet Hub still gives the impression Wells Fargo is a good banking option. What's going on here?

                                            It is my opinion that you would do better to find a different company. In the long run they will charge you plenty and the support is virtually non-existent. They don't even have a working answering system. They are disorganized  and a nightmare to work with.

                                            i love banking with veridian, but the new updated online banking is garbage.10x harder to navigate than before staring from the log in page. Making simple transfers or even looking at accounts is harder and more confusing. bring back the old version.

Virginia Credit Union


                                            I was pre qualified for a mortgage loan. They waited until the week before closing and decided that I did not qualify.  This was after i put $500.00 down and paid for the inspection and gave notice to where I was renting .

If the company isn't reporting the account correctly, you can submit a dispute to the credit bureaus asking them to correct it.

If you were a grad victim you don't need to fill out a fraud package. Google it. And send it to the credit bureaus.

I live on a fixed income. Its very difficult. My father and I are fairly comfortable, but due to the 40+ derogatory items on my credit report, which are all medically related. Lexington law, if you can afford their services, have done soo much for me. In only two months time, they removed 25+ items off my report. Unfortunately I'm unable to continue working with them, due to the roughly $100/mo fee, which is a bit too high for me.… read more

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.

Genre: Suspense


Blue Hour, The

By:
T. Jefferson Parker

Performed by:
Tavia Gilbert

#1 in Merci Rayborn Series



                Tim Hess is a semiretired veteran cop staring at a death sentence-his own. Detective Merci Rayborn, young enough to be his daughter, is brash, impatient, and not someone from whom Hess wants to be taking orders. He certainly isn’t planning on falling in love with her…
Together they must track down a psychopathic killer who’s been abducting beautiful young women from the malls of Orange County. Dubbed the “Purse Snatcher” for the chilling way he brags about his shockingly distinctive crimes, he is one of T. Jefferson Parker’s most original creations.

“Ingenious, intricate, complicated yet credible, a real page-turner. There are leaks, leads, false leads, and an express train of an ending. Within the crackling tale, a quieter current carries an unforeseen and ill-starred love affair. A man much praised doesn’t need more encomiums; T. Jefferson Parker deserves all he gets.”
-Los Angeles Times.

“One of Parker’s best-and that’s a major statement considering his track record.”
-Chicago Tribune

But she also leaves behind two rivals who were in love with her -- passionate Joshua Weinstein, and FBI agent she was engaged to marry, and John Menden, the quiet newsman who was her lover. These men knew of each other's part in Rebecca's complex life, each hoping to be ultimately chosen by her.Weinstein solves the murder but he can't get the evidence to make an arrest -- the only person who can do that is Menden. Working together in an uneasy alliance, the two men join forces to bring down Rebecca's killer.

4.0 out of 5 starsTHE EMPTINESS OF REVENGE


      By
    
Michael Butts

 on April 4 2004Format: Mass Market Paperback


  Parker has written a very interesting and evocative thriller in THE TRIGGERMAN'S DANCE.  Ultimately, it is a novel of revenge:  Both John and Joshua want to avenge the accidental death of the woman they loved; Joshua also inwardly wants revenge for knowing that prior to her death, Rebecca was going to choose her lover, John and not Joshua, her fiance.  Fueled by this revenge, John and Joshua work together to bring the killer to justice.  A complex undercover assignment begins, with startling, if predictable results.  There are times in the novel when you want Parker to hasten things along; it seems like the time John spends on the ranch is interminable, and there are times when the action slows down.  Fortunately, this doesn't hurt the overall impact of the story.  Parker is to be commended for allowing us to like and dislike both John and Joshua; to like and dislike the villain, Vann Holt; and to feel sorry for Valerie, Holt's daughter who ends up falling for the mole, John.This is a thoughtful, emotional novel and though not as suspenseful as some thrillers, still manages to both entertain and stimulate.

4.0 out of 5 starsSlow-Building Suspense


      By
    
untouchable

 on Aug. 13 2001Format: Mass Market Paperback


  After a woman is mistaken for a colleague and gunned down in the parking lot of the newspaper where she works, she leaves behind two men bent on revenge. One of them is an FBI agent and her fiancé; the other is a fellow journalist and her lover. Josh Weinstein, the FBI agent enlists John Menden, the lover to take an undercover role to bring the killer to justice. What makes this difficult is the suspect is an ex-FBI agent who now heads a very successful security agency and is surrounded by both heavily armed employees and a patrolled, virtually impregnable fortress.While the idea is good one, vengeance for the death of a loved one, the execution was just a little sloppy. The pretext that was used to penetrate the fortress was just a little too unbelievable for my liking. That's just a minor quibble on my part though and once I accepted that Mendon was in, I got on with enjoying the tension of a mole working undercover 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. If you enjoy this kind of slow boiling suspense story, then I think you'll enjoy "The Triggerman's Dance".

4.0 out of 5 starsHang with this one..it gets better and better.


      By
    
John J. Raspanti

 on July 20 2002Format: Mass Market Paperback


  I think I understand why some folks gave THE TRIGGERMANS DANCE a fair review.It starts really SLOW..so slow that I was thinking about the next book I was going to read. The character's..at the beginning..are not very interesting..and the story plods along.But..as I said..near page 100 or so..I began to care about John and the FBI agent, Joshua.The story is basically about revenge and what some are willing to do to achieve it. Two men in love with the same woman join forces to bring down the guy they think is responsible for a murder and there broken hearts. Is this guy guilty or innocent?When the author introduces Van Holt, a former FBI agent things really begin to take off. The tension builds and builds. Summing up..I would say..Stay with this one.T.Jefferson Parker knows how to write a good thriller, this time it just took a little while to get going.

4.0 out of 5 starsI liked this a lot...don't understand the bad reviews


      By
    
K. Barrett

 on May 17 2000Format: Mass Market Paperback


  So, it's a little far-fetched, a little bit technical and ascary scenario to think about, I still liked it a bunch! Joshua, theFBI agent; and John, the unlikely sports writer turned secret agent, drew me in and kept me on the edge of my chair throughout the entire read. I enjoyed the tension between the two men--and the terrible bond that held them together. I'm happy to have discovered T. Jefferson Parker recently. Loved The Blue Hour also. Parker has the ability to capture the inner workings of his characters' minds--and besides that he can tell a mighty interesting story.  I must also say I was drawn to the villain in the story. It was so very hard to hate him... I recommend this book....I really liked it.

3.0 out of 5 starsA Disappointment


      By
    
N. Sausser

 on April 27 1998Format: Mass Market Paperback


  I enjoyed two of Mr. Parker's previous novels, Pacific Heat and Laguna Heat, but I was a little disappointed in The Triggerman's Dance.  The premise was believable (wilder things have been reported in the news recently), but the actions and dialog of the characters seemed stiff and contrived.  The action scenes were good, but not strong enough to carry this book past average.

      T. Jefferson Parker certainly wrote a loser with this one! It's as if this book were written by someone totally different...who doesn't write nearly as well.

      This was my first book by this author.  I would try other books by Parker based on this one.  Most of the characters had major flaws along with wonderful characteristics.
