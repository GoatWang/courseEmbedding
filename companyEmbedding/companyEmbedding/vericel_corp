History[edit]
Aastrom Bio was formed in 1989 in Ann Arbor, Michigan.[1]
In the spring of 2013, Aastrom Bio acquired from Sanofi the "cell therapy and regenerative medicine business" which it had received when purchasing Genzyme in 2011.[1] This transformed the company in several ways: it increased the employee count by 8-fold and provided a revenue stream and products to market (which it had not had before).[1]
In October 2014, the company changed its name from Aastrom Bio to Vericel and relocated its headquarters from Ann Arbor, Michigan to Cambridge, Massachusetts.[1]
Corporate governance[edit]
As of November 2014[update], Vericel's chief executive officer (CEO) was Nick Colangelo.[2] The company has had at least two prior CEOs; Daniel Orlando, who held this role as of January 2013, and Tim Mayleben, who resigned in October 2012.[3] Daniel Orlando was a former vice president for business development across North and South America at Takeda.[3] Orlando stayed with Vericel and, as of November 2014, was the company's chief operating officer (COO).[2]:1
As of November 2014[update], the chief financial officer (CFO) role was held by Gerard Michel.[2]:1
As of November 2014[update], the chief medical officer was Dave Recker.[2]:1
As of November 2014[update], Vericel's chief science officer role had been filled by Ross Tubo.[2]:1
Among those outside the C-suite, Brian Gibson held the position of vice president for finance as of January 2013.[3]
Operations[edit]
Vericel has at least two facilities: an R&D facility in Ann Arbor, Michigan and a manufacturing facility in Cambridge, Massachusetts.[1] There is a manufacturing capability in Ann Arbor, though, which includes manufacture of ixmyelocel-T.[2]:5 There was also a facility in Denmark which focused on MACI production; however, as of November 2014, there was a drive to close this facility and pick up manufacture at the Cambridge manufacturing site.[2]:5
As of November 2014[update], the sales force dedicated to Carticel was 23 people, while there were only three people dedicated to Epicel sales.[2]:5
Products[edit]
Vericel has three products: Carticel, Epicel and MACI.[1]
There tends to be an uptick in Epicel use during the winter as a consequence of "inappropriate or unfortunate accidental use of heating elements".[2]:5
In development[edit]
In 2013, Vericel had ixmyelocel-T undergoing clinical trials for two indications: critical limb ischaemia and ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy.[3]

					Full Description



Vericel Corporation (Vericel), formerly Aastrom Biosciences, Inc., incorporated on March 24, 1989, is a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the identification, development and commercialization of therapies that enable the body to repair and regenerate damaged tissues and organs to restore normal structure and function. The Company operates through the research, product development, manufacture and distribution of patient-specific, expanded cellular therapies for use in the treatment of specific diseases segment. Vericel markets two autologous cell therapy products in the United States: Carticel (autologous cultured chondrocytes), an autologous chondrocyte implant for the treatment of cartilage defects in the knee, and Epicel (cultured epidermal autografts), a permanent skin replacement for the treatment of patients with deep-dermal or full-thickness burns approximately 30% of total body surface area (TBSA).The Company is developing MACI, a third-generation autologous chondrocyte implant for the treatment of cartilage defects in the knee, and ixmyelocel-T, a patient-specific multicellular therapy for the treatment of advanced heart failure due to ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). It has a cell-manufacturing facility in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which is used for the United States manufacturing and distribution of Carticel, Epicel manufacturing and also manufactured MACI for the SUMMIT study conducted for approval in Europe.CarticelCarticel is a first-generation autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) product for the treatment and repair of cartilage defects in the knee. Carticel is indicated for the repair of symptomatic cartilage defects of the femoral condyle (medial, lateral or trochlea) caused by acute or repetitive trauma, in patients who have had an inadequate response to a prior arthroscopic or other surgical repair procedure, such as debridement (the removal of damaged or defective cartilage), microfracture (the creation of tiny fractures in the bone to encourage new cartilage development, drilling/abrasion arthroplasty) and osteochondral allograft/autograft (transferring cartilage from one joint to another). Carticel is implanted by orthopedic surgeons after obtaining a cartilage biopsy during an initial arthroscopic procedure. The patient's chondrocytes, which are the cells that produce cartilage, are isolated and expanded in a manufacturing process compliant with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP). During a second surgical procedure, the cells are implanted in the cartilage defect under a sutured periosteal flap, where they produce new hyaline cartilage.EpicelEpicel (cultured epidermal autografts) is a permanent skin replacement for full thickness burns. Epicel is the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved autologous epidermal product available for total surface area burns. Epicel is produced by isolating and expanding keratinocytes, which are the predominant cell type in the epidermis or outer layer of the skin, obtained from a small biopsy of a patient's healthy skin. Epicel is a treatment option for patients with severe burns because these patients are generally understood to need a keratinocyte-based epithelium and there is very little skin, which is the only other source of keratinocyte-based epithelium, available for autografts for these patients. Epicel is a cell-based product.MACIMACI is a third-generation ACI product for the treatment of focal chondral cartilage defects in the knee. Similar to Carticel, during an initial surgical procedure, a surgeon obtains a biopsy of healthy cartilage from the patient and the chondrocytes are isolated, expanded and uniformly seeded onto a bioabsorbable Type I/III collagen membrane to form the autologous implantation. MACI is manufactured in a cGMP manufacturing facility. Unlike Carticel, MACI is implanted during a mini-arthrotomy in which the implant is trimmed to the size of the defect and fixed in the defect with fibrin glue and without sutures.Ixmyelocel-T Technology PlatformThe Company's preapproval-stage portfolio also includes ixmyelocel-T, a patient-specific multicellular therapy derived from an adult patient's own bone marrow, which utilizes its automated manufacturing system. Its cell manufacturing process expands the mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and M2-like anti-inflammatory macrophages in the patient's bone marrow mononuclear cells while retaining many of the hematopoietic cells. Studies examining the impact of ixmyelocel-T on human umbilical vein endothelial cells in vitro demonstrate the secretion of pro-angiogenic factors, enhanced migration of endothelial cells following injury, increased endothelial cell proliferation and branch formation. Treatment with ixmyelocel-T in a rat model of hind limb ischemia in vivo resulted in increased blood flow perfusion and capillary density, gene expression and plasma levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine. Its studies demonstrate that ixmyelocel-T brings to bear a combination of angiogenic and anti-inflammatory effects, which facilitate ischemic tissue repair.Ixmyelocel-T Clinical Development ProgramsThe Company's ixmyelocel-T clinical development program is focused on addressing chronic ischemic cardiovascular disease. It has completed Phase I/II clinical trials in DCM. Its Phase IIb ixCELL-DCM study, which is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial for patients with advanced heart failure due to ischemic DCM. Ixmyelocel-T has been granted a United States Orphan Drug designation by the FDA for the treatment of DCM. It also has an ixmyelocel-T investigator-initiated clinical study for the treatment of craniofacial reconstruction and it has conducted clinical studies for the treatment of critical limb ischemia (CLI).The Company has conducted two Phase IIa multicenter, randomized, open-label clinical studies in patients with ischemic DCM and nonischemic DCM investigating surgical (IMPACT-DCM) and catheter-based (Catheter-DCM) delivery of ixmyelocel-T. Results from these studies demonstrated that ixmyelocel-T was well-tolerated in patients with DCM. In the Catheter-DCM study and post-surgery in the IMPACT-DCM study, the incidence of adverse events was comparable between the ixmyelocel-T groups and the control groups.The Company competes with Zimmer Holdings Inc., Histogenics Corporation, Aesculap Biologics, LLC, Geistlich Pharma AG, TiGenix NV, Avita Medical, Mesoblast Ltd., Cardio3 Biosciences, Juventas Therapeutics, Inc., Celladon Corporation, Arthrex Inc., Baxter International, Inc., Biomet, Inc., Johnson & Johnson, Inc., Medtronic, Inc., Miltenyi Biotec Inc., Ocata Therapeutics, Inc., Cytomedix, Inc., Arteriocyte Medical Systems, Inc., Athersys, Inc., Cytori Therapeutics, Inc., International Stem Cell Corporation, Neostem, Inc., Terumo Medical Corporation, Osiris Therapeutics, Inc., Pluristem, Inc.

As of November 2014[update], Vericel's chief executive officer (CEO) was Nick Colangelo.[2] The company has had at least two prior CEOs; Daniel Orlando, who held this role as of January 2013, and Tim Mayleben, who resigned in October 2012.[3] Daniel Orlando was a former vice president for business development across North and South America at Takeda.[3] Orlando stayed with Vericel and, as of November 2014, was the company's chief operating officer (COO).[2]:1
As of November 2014[update], the chief financial officer (CFO) role was held by Gerard Michel.[2]:1
As of November 2014[update], the chief medical officer was Dave Recker.[2]:1
As of November 2014[update], Vericel's chief science officer role had been filled by Ross Tubo.[2]:1
Among those outside the C-suite, Brian Gibson held the position of vice president for finance as of January 2013.[3]
Operations[edit]
Vericel has at least two facilities: an R&D facility in Ann Arbor, Michigan and a manufacturing facility in Cambridge, Massachusetts.[1] There is a manufacturing capability in Ann Arbor, though, which includes manufacture of ixmyelocel-T.[2]:5 There was also a facility in Denmark which focused on MACI production; however, as of November 2014, there was a drive to close this facility and pick up manufacture at the Cambridge manufacturing site.[2]:5
As of November 2014[update], the sales force dedicated to Carticel was 23 people, while there were only three people dedicated to Epicel sales.[2]:5
Products[edit]
Vericel has three products: Carticel, Epicel and MACI.[1]
There tends to be an uptick in Epicel use during the winter as a consequence of "inappropriate or unfortunate accidental use of heating elements".[2]:5
In development[edit]
In 2013, Vericel had ixmyelocel-T undergoing clinical trials for two indications: critical limb ischaemia and ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy.[3]

Read More     Advancing Autologous Cell Therapy for the Treatment of Serious Conditions  Treatment OverviewManufacturing OverviewAbout Autologous TherapyAutologous cell therapy uses a patient’s own cells for the treatment of a condition or disease. The cells are collected from the patient and expanded or multiplied outside the body, then reintroduced to the same patient. Advantages for this type of cell therapy include minimizing the risk of rejection and therefore the need for immunosuppressive therapy. From Tissue to TreatmentCollection/Isolation: Physicians collect small target cell tissue samples from individual patients, then ship to a Vericel cGMP certified manufacturing site. The specific cell types are then isolated from the tissue based on the condition being treated.Expansion/Implantation: Using well-validated techniques and growth factors, the cells are expanded several million times and prepared by the surgeon for implantation into the same patient.

History[edit]
Aastrom Bio was formed in 1989 in Ann Arbor, Michigan.[1]
In the spring of 2013, Aastrom Bio acquired from Sanofi the "cell therapy and regenerative medicine business" which it had received when purchasing Genzyme in 2011.[1] This transformed the company in several ways: it increased the employee count by 8-fold and provided a revenue stream and products to market (which it had not had before).[1]
In October 2014, the company changed its name from Aastrom Bio to Vericel and relocated its headquarters from Ann Arbor, Michigan to Cambridge, Massachusetts.[1]
Corporate governance[edit]
As of November 2014[update], Vericel's chief executive officer (CEO) was Nick Colangelo.[2] The company has had at least two prior CEOs; Daniel Orlando, who held this role as of January 2013, and Tim Mayleben, who resigned in October 2012.[3] Daniel Orlando was a former vice president for business development across North and South America at Takeda.[3] Orlando stayed with Vericel and, as of November 2014, was the company's chief operating officer (COO).[2]:1
As of November 2014[update], the chief financial officer (CFO) role was held by Gerard Michel.[2]:1
As of November 2014[update], the chief medical officer was Dave Recker.[2]:1
As of November 2014[update], Vericel's chief science officer role had been filled by Ross Tubo.[2]:1
Among those outside the C-suite, Brian Gibson held the position of vice president for finance as of January 2013.[3]
Operations[edit]
Vericel has at least two facilities: an R&D facility in Ann Arbor, Michigan and a manufacturing facility in Cambridge, Massachusetts.[1] There is a manufacturing capability in Ann Arbor, though, which includes manufacture of ixmyelocel-T.[2]:5 There was also a facility in Denmark which focused on MACI production; however, as of November 2014, there was a drive to close this facility and pick up manufacture at the Cambridge manufacturing site.[2]:5
As of November 2014[update], the sales force dedicated to Carticel was 23 people, while there were only three people dedicated to Epicel sales.[2]:5
Products[edit]
Vericel has three products: Carticel, Epicel and MACI.[1]
There tends to be an uptick in Epicel use during the winter as a consequence of "inappropriate or unfortunate accidental use of heating elements".[2]:5
In development[edit]
In 2013, Vericel had ixmyelocel-T undergoing clinical trials for two indications: critical limb ischaemia and ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy.[3]

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. and SHANGHAI, China, May  10, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Vericel Corporation (Nasdaq:VCEL), a leading developer of expanded autologous cell therapies for the treatment of patients with serious diseases and conditions, today announced that it has entered into a License Agreement with Innovative Cellular Therapeutics (ICT), a leading China-based cell therapy company and developer of CAR-T cell therapy for cancer treatment, for development, manufacturing and commercialization of the Vericel product portfolio. Under the terms of the agreement, ICT will acquire exclusive rights to develop and distribute Carticel®, MACI®, Ixmyelocel-T, and Epicel® in Greater China, South Korea, Singapore, and other countries in the region. In connection with the license agreement, ICT will also enter in a warrant agreement with Vericel.Under the terms of the license agreement, Vericel will receive an upfront payment of $6.0 million. In addition, Vericel is eligible to receive approximately $8.0 million in development and commercial milestones. ICT has also agreed to pay tiered royalties to Vericel equal to a percentage of net sales of each licensed product in the low to middle double digits. ICT will be responsible for funding the development of the programs and manufacturing the products for commercialization in China and the rest of the territory. In connection with the license agreement and under the terms of the warrant agreement, Vericel will issue to ICT a warrant, exercisable for the number of shares of Vericel’s Common Stock equal to $5,000,000 less any withholding tax payable divided by Vericel’s closing price on May 9, 2017, with an exercise price of $0.01 per share. The funding transfer is subject to approval by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange of the People's Republic of China and is expected to conclude in the third quarter of 2017.“We are very pleased to have a strategic collaboration and develop a relationship with a leading cell therapy company in China, to begin to develop a global footprint for our product portfolio, and to create another potential revenue stream for the Company,” said Nick Colangelo, president and CEO of Vericel.Dr. Lei Xiao, Chairman of ICT commented “MACI, Epicel and Carticel are FDA approved products and have successfully treated thousands of patients in United States. Ixmyelocel-T has been evaluated in a phase II study in the U.S., and the encouraging data suggest that it may be a treatment option for millions of heart failure patients. This collaboration enables ICT to bring world-class cell therapy products to China and other Asian countries which will benefit the patients in multiple therapeutic indications. By combining with our advanced CAR-T portfolio, ICT further strengthens its leadership position in Cell Therapies in Asia.”About Vericel CorporationVericel develops, manufactures, and markets expanded autologous cell therapies for the treatment of patients with serious diseases and conditions. The company markets three cell therapy products in the United States. Vericel is marketing MACI® (autologous cultured chondrocytes on porcine collagen membrane), an autologous cellularized scaffold product indicated for the repair of symptomatic, single or multiple full-thickness cartilage defects of the knee with or without bone involvement in adults. Carticel® (autologous cultured chondrocytes) is an autologous chondrocyte implant for the treatment of cartilage defects in the knee in patients who have had an inadequate response to a prior arthroscopic or other surgical repair procedure. Epicel® (cultured epidermal autografts) is a permanent skin replacement for the treatment of patients with deep dermal or full thickness burns greater than or equal to 30% of total body surface area. Vericel is also developing ixmyelocel-T, an autologous multicellular therapy intended to treat advanced heart failure due to ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. For more information, please visit the company's website at www.vcel.com.About MACI® MACI® (autologous cultured chondrocytes on porcine collagen membrane) is an autologous cellular scaffold product that is indicated for the repair of symptomatic single or multiple full-thickness cartilage defects of the knee with or without bone involvement in adults. The MACI implant consists of autologous cultured chondrocytes seeded onto a resorbable Type I/III collagen membrane. Autologous cultured chondrocytes are human-derived cells which are obtained from the patient's own cartilage for the manufacture of MACI.About Epicel® Epicel® therapy treats severe burn patients with more than 30% of their total body surface area burned with Cultured Epidermal Autografts, also known as CEA. Vericel recently presented data demonstrating an 84% survival rate from the Epicel clinical experience databases in over 950 patients with a mean TBSA of 67%, which continues to support a probable survival benefit of Epicel in severe burn patients. This therapy will address a large unmet need in China where burn patients currently have limited treatment options.About Ixmyelocel‑T Ixmyelocel‑T is an investigational autologous expanded multicellular therapy manufactured from the patient's own bone marrow using Vericel's proprietary, highly automated, fully closed cell-processing system. This process selectively expands the population of mesenchymal stromal cells and alternatively activated macrophages, which are responsible for production of anti-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic factors known to be important for repair of damaged tissue. Ixmyelocel-T has been designated as an orphan drug by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in the treatment of DCM.About the ixCELL-DCM Trial  The ixCELL-DCM clinical trial was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b study designed to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of ixmyelocel-T compared to placebo when administered via transendocardial catheter-based injections to participants with end-stage heart failure due to ischemic DCM, who have no reasonable revascularization options (either surgical or percutaneous interventional) likely to provide clinical benefit. All participants were on maximized pharmacological heart failure treatment and had an automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator or cardiac resynchronization therapy. The primary endpoint of the ixCELL-DCM clinical trial is the number of all-cause deaths, cardiovascular hospital admissions, and unplanned outpatient and emergency department visits to treat acute decompensated heart failure over the 12 months following administration of ixmyelocel-T compared to placebo. Primary endpoint results were presented in a late-breaking clinical trial session at the American College of Cardiology's (ACC) 65th Annual Scientific Session. The ixCELL-DCM trial met its primary endpoint with a 37% reduction in the composite endpoint, primarily driven by a reduction in all cause deaths and cardiovascular hospitalizations. In addition, this study showed internal consistency (ie, repeatability) in observable or "hard" efficacy endpoints of survival and cardiovascular hospitalizations (total number and time to events), reduction in ventricular arrhythmias, and safety results including major cardiac adverse events (MACE), serious adverse events (SAEs), deaths, and intravenous pharmacological treatment for heart failure. Because the trial met the primary endpoint, patients who received placebo or were randomized to ixmyelocel‑T in the double-blind portion of the trial but did not receive ixmyelocel-T, have been offered the option to receive treatment with ixmyelocel‑T. Ixmyelocel-T received Fast Track Designation by the FDA in February of this year and Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy Designation by the FDA in May of this year, both of which highlight the potential of this cell therapy to address unmet clinical needs for heart failure patients.Epicel®, Carticel®, and MACI® are registered trademarks of Vericel Corporation. © 2017 Vericel Corporation. All rights reserved.About Innovative Cellular TherapeuticsInnovative Cellular Therapeutics (ICT) is a clinical-stage cell therapy company based in Shanghai, China.

Vericel markets three autologous cell therapy products in the United States. MACI® (autologous cultured chondrocytes on porcine collagen membrane) is a third generation autologous chondrocyte implant for the treatment of cartilage defects in the knee. Carticel® (autologous cultured chondrocytes) is an autologous chondrocyte implant for the repair of symptomatic cartilage defects of the femoral condyle (medial, lateral or trochlea). Epicel® (cultured epidermal autografts) is a permanent skin replacement for full thickness burns greater than or equal to 30% of total body surface area. Vericel is also developing 1 additional cell therapy treatment, Ixmyelocel-T. Ixmyelocel-T is a multicellular therapy for the treatment of advanced heart failure due to ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). In a Phase 2b clinical trial, results showed that patients who received ixmyelocel‑T had a 37% reduction in cardiac events at 12 months compared with placebo (composite endpoint of cardiac events: all-cause death, cardiovascular hospitalizations, and unplanned outpatient and emergency room interventions to treat acute decompensated heart failure).Vericel uses rigorous scientific methods to develop novel therapies for the treatment of patients with autologous (patient’s own) cells. In addition, personal integrity, team work, collaboration, and innovative technology are the foundations of our work. We seek to practice transparency in our clinical trials and research, in our relationships with each other, our patients, and the investors who support us. At this time Vericel is considering options for licensing and distribution of MACI and Epicel in various geographic regions outside of the United States. Furthermore, Vericel is evaluating partnerships for the development and global approval of ixmyelocel-T.

MACI is the first FDA-approved product that applies the process of tissue engineering to grow cells on scaffolds using healthy cartilage tissue from the patient’s own knee.Knee problems are common, and occur in people of all ages. Cartilage defects in the knee can result from an injury, straining the knee beyond its normal motion, or can be caused by overuse, muscle weakness, and general wear and tear.Learn More  IndicationMACI® (autologous cultured chondrocytes on porcine collagen membrane) is an autologous cellularized scaffold product that is indicated for the repair of single or multiple symptomatic, full-thickness cartilage defects of the adult knee, with or without bone involvement.MACI is intended for autologous use and must only be administered to the patient for whom it was manufactured. The implantation of MACI is to be performed via an arthrotomy to the knee joint under sterile conditions.The amount of MACI administered is dependent upon the size (surface in cm2) of the cartilage defect. The implantation membrane is trimmed by the treating surgeon to the size and shape of the defect, to ensure the damaged area is completely covered, and implanted cell-side down.Limitations of UseEffectiveness of MACI in joints other than the knee has not been established.Safety and effectiveness of MACI in patients over the age of 55 years have not been established.  Important Safety InformationMACI is contraindicated in patients with a known history of hypersensitivity to gentamicin, other aminoglycosides, or products of porcine or bovine origin. MACI is also contraindicated for patients with severe osteoarthritis of the knee, inflammatory arthritis, inflammatory joint disease, or uncorrected congenital blood coagulation disorders. MACI is also not indicated for use in patients who have undergone prior knee surgery in the past 6 months, excluding surgery to procure a biopsy or a concomitant procedure to prepare the knee for a MACI implant.MACI is contraindicated in patients who are unable to follow a physician-prescribed post-surgical rehabilitation program.The safety of MACI in patients with malignancy in the area of cartilage biopsy or implant is unknown. Expansion of present malignant or dysplastic cells during the culturing process or implantation is possible.Patients undergoing procedures associated with MACI are not routinely tested for transmissible infectious diseases. A cartilage biopsy and MACI implant may carry the risk of transmitting infectious diseases to healthcare providers handling the tissue. Universal precautions should be employed when handling the biopsy samples and the MACI product.Final sterility test results are not available at the time of shipping. In the case of positive sterility results, health care provider(s) will be contacted.To create a favorable environment for healing, concomitant pathologies that include meniscal pathology, cruciate ligament instability and joint misalignment, must be addressed prior to or concurrent with the implantation of MACI.Local treatment guidelines regarding the use of thromboprophylaxis and antibiotic prophylaxis around orthopaedic surgery should be followed. Use in patients with local inflammations or active infections in the bone, joint, and surrounding soft tissue should be temporarily deferred until documented recovery.The MACI implant is not recommended during pregnancy. For implantations post-pregnancy, the safety of breast feeding to infant has not been determined.Use of MACI in pediatric patients (younger than 18 years of age) or patients over 65 years of age has not been established.The most frequently occurring adverse reactions reported for MACI (≥5%) were arthralgia, tendonitis, back pain, joint swelling, and joint effusion.Serious adverse reactions reported for MACI were arthralgia, cartilage injury, meniscus injury, treatment failure, and osteoarthritis.         What is Carticel?Carticel is used to repair articular cartilage injuries in the knee (femoral condyle) in patients who have had an inadequate response to a prior arthroscopic or other surgical repair procedure. Carticel is an FDA-approved biologic product that consists of a patient’s own harvested cartilage cells (chondrocytes) which are then multiplied into millions of cells. These autologous cultured chondrocytes are then implanted into the knee cartilage defect in a surgical procedure called autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI). When implanted, Carticel generates hyaline-like cartilage repair tissue.Learn More  IndicationCarticel® (autologous cultured chondrocytes) is an autologous cellular product indicated for the repair of symptomatic cartilage defects of the femoral condyle (medial, lateral or trochlea), caused by acute or repetitive trauma, in patients who have had an inadequate response to a prior arthroscopic or other surgical repair procedure (e.g., debridement, microfracture, drilling/abrasion arthroplasty, or osteochondral allograft/autograft).Carticel should only be used in conjunction with debridement, placement of a periosteal flap and rehabilitation. The independent contributions of the autologous cultured chondrocytes and other components of the therapy to outcome are unknown.Carticel is not indicated for the treatment of cartilage damage associated with generalized osteoarthritis.Carticel is not recommended for patients with total meniscectomy unless surgically reconstructed prior to or concurrent with Carticel implantation.  Important Safety InformationCarticel should not be used in patients with a known history of hypersensitivity to gentamicin, other aminoglycosides or materials of bovine origin.It should not be used in patients who have previously had cancer in the bones, cartilage, fat or muscle of the treated limb.Pre-existing conditions, including meniscal tears, joint instability, or malalignment should be assessed and treated prior to or concurrent with Carticel implantation.Carticel is not routinely tested for transmissible infectious diseases and may transmit disease to the healthcare provider handling Carticel.Use of Carticel in children, patients over age 65, or in joints other than the knee has not yet been assessed.The occurrence of subsequent surgical procedures (SSPs), primarily arthroscopy, following Carticel implantation is common. In the Study of the Treatment of Articular Repair (STAR), forty-nine percent (49%) of patients underwent an SSP on the treated knee, irrespective of their relationship to Carticel, during the 4-year follow up. The most common serious adverse events (≥5% of patients), derived from STAR, include arthrofibrosis/joint adhesions, graft overgrowth, chondromalacia or chondrosis, cartilage injury, graft complication, meniscal lesion, graft delamination, and osteoarthritis.          Hope with EpicelEpicel is indicated for use in adults and pediatric patients who have deep dermal or full thickness burns comprising a total body surface area greater than or equal to 30%. It may be used in conjunction with split-thickness autografts, or alone in patients for whom split-thickness autografts may not be an option due to the severity and extent of their burns.What is Epicel?Epicel is a cultured epidermal autograft (CEA) — a skin graft grown from a patient’s own skin. These grafts provide skin replacement for patients who have deep dermal or full thickness burns comprising a total body surface area of greater than or equal to 30%. From 2 postage stamp-sized biopsies, Vericel can grow enough skin to cover the patient’s entire body.Learn MoreEpicel-A Scientific Overview  IndicationEpicel® (cultured epidermal autografts) is indicated for use in adults and pediatric patients who have deep dermal or full thickness burns comprising a total body surface area greater than or equal to 30%.  It may be used in conjunction with split-thickness autografts, or alone in patients for whom split-thickness autografts may not be an option due to the severity and extent of their burns.  Important Safety InformationEpicel (cultured epidermal autografts) is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to vancomycin, amikacin, or amphotericin. Epicel should not be used in patients with sensitivities to materials of bovine or murine origin. Epicel is contraindicated for use on clinically infected wounds.
Because Epicel is manufactured with and contains residual amounts of murine cells, the FDA considers it a xenotransplantation product. Therefore, recipients should not donate whole blood, blood components, source plasma, source leukocytes, tissue, breast milk, ova, sperm or other body parts for use in humans because there is a potential risk of carrying an infection that is transmitted from mouse cells to humans. In addition, the risk of disease transmission from Epicel is unknown.
Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) has been reported in patients with burn injury after being grafted with Epicel. The most common adverse reactions, occurring in > 2% of patients were infection, graft shear, blister, drainage, sepsis, graft detachment and renal failure.
Patient information supplied by treating physicians and attending burn teams from 1989 to 1996 included 552 patients, 205 children (age 21 years and younger) and 347 adults reported death (13%) and the adverse reactions of highest incidence as: infection (13.8%), graft shear (7.8%), blister (4.2%) and drainage (3.3%).
From June 1998 through September, 2015, over 1,662 patients, including 589 children (age 21 and younger) and 1,073 adults were tracked through spontaneous reports via medical device reports, reports from burn sites and published literature. Adverse reactions were similar to the previously identified adverse reactions. Events that were reported in ≥ 2% of patients included death (8.8%), and adverse reactions of multi-organ failure, sepsis, infection and graft procedure complications. Because of the potential underreporting of adverse reactions from these sources, the percentages of adverse reactions should be interpreted with caution.
Epicel is intended solely for autologous use.
The effectiveness of Epicel has not been proven in clinical studies. The long-term safety of Epicel is unknown. The safety of Epicel has not been studied in pregnant and nursing women.
