< Return to results listingGetting a Better Look at Propped Fractures
31 Mar 2017
 
JPT, March 2017

Carbo Ceramics is getting a clearer look at where the proppant goes. The ceramic proppant maker showed much-improved images at this year’s conference (SPE 184880) compared with the ones shown last year, as well as a new set of images showing three stages of a Marcellus gas well. The presentation at the start of the conference’s technical sessions drew a large crowd. The method discussed uses metallically coated ceramic proppant that is activated by an electric current run through the reservoir. The new method promises a deep look that is not available using alternatives such as radioactive markers, which are visible only within a couple feet of the wellbore.

< Return to results listingGetting a Better Look at Propped Fractures
31 Mar 2017
 
JPT, March 2017

Carbo Ceramics is getting a clearer look at where the proppant goes. The ceramic proppant maker showed much-improved images at this year’s conference (SPE 184880) compared with the ones shown last year, as well as a new set of images showing three stages of a Marcellus gas well. The presentation at the start of the conference’s technical sessions drew a large crowd. The method discussed uses metallically coated ceramic proppant that is activated by an electric current run through the reservoir. The new method promises a deep look that is not available using alternatives such as radioactive markers, which are visible only within a couple feet of the wellbore.

< Return to results listingCeramic media increases precision, reduces defects and improves safety in green sand casting
26 Apr 2017
 
Comprehensive research study confirms a safe, superior alternative to silica sand
Executive summary
For years, naturally occurring silica sand has been the most widely used molding media in the metal casting industry, due to its low cost and abundant availability.

However, the demand for increasingly complex castings requires media with greater thermal stability, increased dimensional accuracy and enhanced casting capabilities. In addition, increased environmental, health and safety (EHS) risks associated with silica sand have resulted in increasingly rigorous workplace regulations. Foundries face the requirement to add expensive systems and equipment, or to find an alternative to silica sand altogether.

This paper compares the use of ACCUCAST and KRYPTOCAST high-performance ceramic casting media versus silica sand in the green sand casting process. It is based on the findings of a comprehensive study conducted by the Metal Casting Center of the Department of Industrial Technology at the University of Northern Iowa, supplemented by other university studies and industry testing.

< Return to results listingRadioactive-free solution helps optimize fracturing program
24 Apr 2017
Well Data

Location: Oﬀshore, West Africa
Operator: Major E&P
Well type: Gas/condensate; vertical, single-stage well
Reservoir: Shaly sandstone marine deposition
Proppant: CARBOLITE NRT 20/40 and CARBOBOND LITE NRT 16/30 inert tracer technology
Detection tool: Pulsed neutron capture

 
CARBONRT inert tracer safely delivers valuable insight to advance field development, leading to optimized stimulation designs for enhanced production

The challenge
To help optimize completion designs for future multi-stage development wells, the operator first needed to determine the fracture height in a single zone hydraulically- fractured conventional exploration well. Combining post-stimulation fracture height with corresponding pressure match data would enable the operator to identify coverage of the stimulated interval, calibrate fracture models, and accurately estimate fracture conductivity. In the past, radioactive tracers would be incorporated in the proppant slurry and detected with a conventional spectral gamma ray tool. However, tightening environmental regulations in offshore West Africa restrict the use of radioactive tracers, thereby mandating an HSE-acceptable alternative.
The solution
That alternative came in the form of the CARBONRT inert tracer technology, the enabling component of the CARBO exclusive FRACTUREVISION proppant-delivered fracture evaluation service. Together with the CARBONRT tracer, a Pulsed Neutron Capture (PNC) tool was deployed pre- and post- fracturing operations to identify the location of the proppant and measure near-wellbore fracture height. The strategy considered utilizing FRACPRO fracture design and analysis software to pressure match fracture treatment data to derive fracture height, thereby comparing the predicted and measured heights, and determining correlations to further calibrate the fracture model.
The results
CARBONRT tracer signals were clearly observed, with the post-stimulation PNC logs measuring a propped fracture height growth of 43.6 m, as opposed to the nearly 64.2 m modeled height growth, which seemed an over-estimation from the pressure match simulation. The propped fracture height obtained from the PNC logs was deemed far more accurate, as it represents a direct measurement of proppant placement in the near-wellbore region. The combination of CARBONRT inert tracer technology and the PNC tool yielded considerable insight that will advance full-field development, without the safety and environmental issues associated with radioactive tracers.

< Return to results listingCasting defects eliminated, saving a billion-dollar casting project
20 Aug 2016
Project Details

Client: Captive aluminum marine foundry
Location: Midwestern US
Type: Lost foam process
Deliverables: Complex engine blocks, <100 lbs
Casting media: Replaced olivine sand with ACCUCAST LD30 and later ACCUCAST ID40 high-performance ceramic casting media

 
Switching to ACCUCAST ceramic casting media from olivine sand achieved necessary dimensional tolerances for aluminum marine foundry project.
The challenge
A captive aluminum marine foundry had a new billion-dollar project that was scheduled for startup. They were not able to meet casting dimensional tolerances using their existing olivine sand media. The project was in critical jeopardy, facing a delayed startup date. A replacement media would have to be:

Capable of delivering high thermal stability that would meet the required casting tolerances and dimensional precision
Abundant and readily available

The solution
ACCUCAST ceramic casting media was identified as a potential replacement for olivine sand. In trials it proved capable of meeting the necessary dimensional tolerances. As a synthetic, manufactured product, the ceramic media not only proved abundant and readily available, but the manufacturing process provided a consistent product that resulted in repeatable casting quality and performance. The product also proved durable, highly reclaimable and ideal for recycled use.
The results
The dimensional casting window was decreased and all casting tolerances were achieved. The billion-dollar project was saved and met scheduled startup.

< Return to results listingNew technology sets IP milestone in deep gas well: Pennsylvania
10 Mar 2016
Well Data

Operator: CONSOL Energy
Location: Utica Shale, Greene County, PA
Well type: Gas Well depth: 13, 400 ft TVD; 6,141 ft lateral 24 hr IP rate: 61.9 MMcfd
Proppant: KRYPTOSPHERE LD ultra-conductive, low-density ceramic proppant

 
KRYPTOSPHERE LD reduces completion costs while delivering among Utica's highest flow rates
Utica Shale, Greene County, PA
The challenge
CONSOL Energy controls roughly 85,000 net acres prospective for the Utica Shale within its Southwestern Pennsylvania operating area, including some 58,000 acres in Greene and Washington counties. The operator planned to target the underlying Utica in a well to be drilled within its existing Marcellus Shale field in Greene County. To access the Utica deep gas horizon, the well program called for a total vertical depth (TVD) of 13,500 ft with a 6,141 ft lateral. Owing to the stresses at this depth, enhancing production and overall economics required a proppant with maximum conductive strength and the capacity to increase propped fracture volume and sustain maximum reservoir drainage.
The solution
To help meet its production and economic objectives, the operator selected the newly engineered KRYPTOSPHERE LD ultra-conductive, low-density ceramic proppant for a field trial in its deep Utica gas well. Mono-sized with exceptional strength, durability and smoothness, KRYPTOSPHERE LD technology is designed to deliver high conductivity across the entire range of low to high-stress well conditions. It significantly exceeds the conductivity of existing low-density proppant, while reducing costly wear-and-tear on pressure pumping equipment, ultimately providing higher production and estimated ultimate recovery (EUR). In addition, the KRYPTOSPHERE LD technology provides comparable and, in many cases, higher conductivity than intermediate-density and bauxite ceramics, while delivering improved proppant transportand increased propped fracture volume.
The results
The first field application of the KRYPTOSPHERE LD ultra-conductive, low-density ceramic proppant proved to be a resounding success. The well flowed at an initial production (IP) rate of more than 61.9 MMcfd in a 24 hr period, which at the time made it one of the Utica's highest producing gas wells. What's more, KRYPTOSPHERE LD technology eliminated the need for gel and cross-linked fluids, thereby reducing overall completion costs.

CONSOL Energy Director of Regional Operations Kirby Walker said of the impressive field trial, "Integrating KRYPTOSPHERE LD technology into our completion design is an example of how CONSOL Energy has achieved the completion efficiency that has allowed us to showcase threeof the top ten dry Utica well results to-date across the industry."

< Return to results listingNew technology sets IP milestone in deep gas well: Pennsylvania
10 Mar 2016
Well Data

Operator: CONSOL Energy
Location: Utica Shale, Greene County, PA
Well type: Gas Well depth: 13, 400 ft TVD; 6,141 ft lateral 24 hr IP rate: 61.9 MMcfd
Proppant: KRYPTOSPHERE LD ultra-conductive, low-density ceramic proppant

 
KRYPTOSPHERE LD reduces completion costs while delivering among Utica's highest flow rates
Utica Shale, Greene County, PA
The challenge
CONSOL Energy controls roughly 85,000 net acres prospective for the Utica Shale within its Southwestern Pennsylvania operating area, including some 58,000 acres in Greene and Washington counties. The operator planned to target the underlying Utica in a well to be drilled within its existing Marcellus Shale field in Greene County. To access the Utica deep gas horizon, the well program called for a total vertical depth (TVD) of 13,500 ft with a 6,141 ft lateral. Owing to the stresses at this depth, enhancing production and overall economics required a proppant with maximum conductive strength and the capacity to increase propped fracture volume and sustain maximum reservoir drainage.
The solution
To help meet its production and economic objectives, the operator selected the newly engineered KRYPTOSPHERE LD ultra-conductive, low-density ceramic proppant for a field trial in its deep Utica gas well. Mono-sized with exceptional strength, durability and smoothness, KRYPTOSPHERE LD technology is designed to deliver high conductivity across the entire range of low to high-stress well conditions. It significantly exceeds the conductivity of existing low-density proppant, while reducing costly wear-and-tear on pressure pumping equipment, ultimately providing higher production and estimated ultimate recovery (EUR). In addition, the KRYPTOSPHERE LD technology provides comparable and, in many cases, higher conductivity than intermediate-density and bauxite ceramics, while delivering improved proppant transportand increased propped fracture volume.
The results
The first field application of the KRYPTOSPHERE LD ultra-conductive, low-density ceramic proppant proved to be a resounding success. The well flowed at an initial production (IP) rate of more than 61.9 MMcfd in a 24 hr period, which at the time made it one of the Utica's highest producing gas wells. What's more, KRYPTOSPHERE LD technology eliminated the need for gel and cross-linked fluids, thereby reducing overall completion costs.

CONSOL Energy Director of Regional Operations Kirby Walker said of the impressive field trial, "Integrating KRYPTOSPHERE LD technology into our completion design is an example of how CONSOL Energy has achieved the completion efficiency that has allowed us to showcase threeof the top ten dry Utica well results to-date across the industry."

< Return to results listingSCALEGUARD solves recurring scaling issues where prior liquid inhibitors have failed
10 Apr 2017
Well Data

Location: Reeves County, Texas
Operator: Independent
Formation: Wolfcamp
Well type: Oil
No. of stages: 24
Produced water volume: 170,000 bbl over 9 months
Proppant types: 100 mesh, 30/50 white and 30/50 resin sand, mixed with SCALEGUARD proppant-delivered scale-inhibiting technology

 
In a single-treatment, SCALEGUARD shuts down scaling despite excessive produced water volumes
Permian Basin, West Texas
The challenge
Owing largely to produced water volumes that reached a cumulative 170,000 bbl over a nine-month period, habitual scale deposition in the Wolfcamp formation restricted maximum production from the operator’s unconventional Permian Basin wells. Repeated treatments of conventional liquid scale inhibitors failed to stem the rapid and severe scale deposition, prompting the operator to seek a more sustainable alternative.
The solution
Upon CARBO’s recommendation, the operator incorporated the wateractivated SCALEGUARD proppant-delivered scale-inhibiting technology in a 24-stage Wolfcamp well to be stimulated with 100-mesh, 30/50 white and 30/50 resin-coated sand proppant. SCALEGUARD comprises a highly conductive ceramic proppant with engineered porosity that is then infused with scale inhibitors. Placed directly throughout the fracture network, SCALEGUARD attacks scale at its point of origin but utilizing a unique controlled release technology that inhibits scale at a designed rate. Following a water chemistry analysis, CARBO specialists engineered a blend of SCALEGUARD and 30/50 resin-coated sand proppant with a well-specific minimum inhibitor concentration (MIC) and placement release rate with the aim of extending the treatment duration.
The results
Nearly one year after the initial SCALEGUARD treatment, the operator has encountered no further instances of scale deposition and plans to incorporate SCALEGUARD in all upcoming wells targeting the water-prone Wolfcamp reservoir.

< Return to results listingSCALEGUARD solves recurring scaling issues where prior liquid inhibitors have failed
10 Apr 2017
Well Data

Location: Reeves County, Texas
Operator: Independent
Formation: Wolfcamp
Well type: Oil
No. of stages: 24
Produced water volume: 170,000 bbl over 9 months
Proppant types: 100 mesh, 30/50 white and 30/50 resin sand, mixed with SCALEGUARD proppant-delivered scale-inhibiting technology

 
In a single-treatment, SCALEGUARD shuts down scaling despite excessive produced water volumes
Permian Basin, West Texas
The challenge
Owing largely to produced water volumes that reached a cumulative 170,000 bbl over a nine-month period, habitual scale deposition in the Wolfcamp formation restricted maximum production from the operator’s unconventional Permian Basin wells. Repeated treatments of conventional liquid scale inhibitors failed to stem the rapid and severe scale deposition, prompting the operator to seek a more sustainable alternative.
The solution
Upon CARBO’s recommendation, the operator incorporated the wateractivated SCALEGUARD proppant-delivered scale-inhibiting technology in a 24-stage Wolfcamp well to be stimulated with 100-mesh, 30/50 white and 30/50 resin-coated sand proppant. SCALEGUARD comprises a highly conductive ceramic proppant with engineered porosity that is then infused with scale inhibitors. Placed directly throughout the fracture network, SCALEGUARD attacks scale at its point of origin but utilizing a unique controlled release technology that inhibits scale at a designed rate. Following a water chemistry analysis, CARBO specialists engineered a blend of SCALEGUARD and 30/50 resin-coated sand proppant with a well-specific minimum inhibitor concentration (MIC) and placement release rate with the aim of extending the treatment duration.
The results
Nearly one year after the initial SCALEGUARD treatment, the operator has encountered no further instances of scale deposition and plans to incorporate SCALEGUARD in all upcoming wells targeting the water-prone Wolfcamp reservoir.

< Return to results listingCeramic grinding media reduces vertical mill component wear and maintenance costs for mining company
18 Nov 2016
Project Details

Client: Large mining company
Location: Southwestern Spain
Type: Milling lead, copper and zinc
Grinding media: CARBOGRIND

 
CARBOGRIND high performance ceramic media significantly improves grinding efficiency, lowers mechanical equipment wear and reduces media replacement costs
Southwestern Spain
The challenge
A large mining company in southwestern Spain required an optimal grinding media for vertical mills processing lead, copper and zinc. As well as generating the desired grind, the media needed to reduce wear on milling equipment.
The solution
CARBO recommended CARBOGRIND high performance ceramic media due to its proven performance in vertical milling applications.

Inert and containing no quartz silica, CARBOGRIND ceramic media products are engineered to provide superior strength, hardness and uniform shape: guaranteeing a high resistance to particle attrition and compressive breakdown. CARBOGRIND ceramic media products have been used in both vertically and horizontally configured wet mills.

The sintering process used to create CARBOGRIND product yields a Mohs hardness approaching that of a diamond. Importantly, the uniform size, and spherical shape would also reduce wear on the mining company’s milling equipment.

As soon as the client utilized CARBOGRIND ceramic media product in their vertical mills, it realized immediate grinding performance improvements over silica sand and other specialty media products. Grinding efficiency was optimized and input energy was reduced, while less wear on the mechanical parts of its milling equipment meant lower maintenance requirements and costs.
The results
Finally, the hardness and durability of CARBOGRIND ceramic media product reduced final product contamination and lowered process costs. It also meant that the large Spanish mining company could use the ceramic grinding media for longer in its mills, reducing the usual costs associated with replacing, transporting and disposing of grinding media.

< Return to results listingCeramic grinding media reduces vertical mill component wear and maintenance costs for mining company
18 Nov 2016
Project Details

Client: Large mining company
Location: Southwestern Spain
Type: Milling lead, copper and zinc
Grinding media: CARBOGRIND

 
CARBOGRIND high performance ceramic media significantly improves grinding efficiency, lowers mechanical equipment wear and reduces media replacement costs
Southwestern Spain
The challenge
A large mining company in southwestern Spain required an optimal grinding media for vertical mills processing lead, copper and zinc. As well as generating the desired grind, the media needed to reduce wear on milling equipment.
The solution
CARBO recommended CARBOGRIND high performance ceramic media due to its proven performance in vertical milling applications.

Inert and containing no quartz silica, CARBOGRIND ceramic media products are engineered to provide superior strength, hardness and uniform shape: guaranteeing a high resistance to particle attrition and compressive breakdown. CARBOGRIND ceramic media products have been used in both vertically and horizontally configured wet mills.

The sintering process used to create CARBOGRIND product yields a Mohs hardness approaching that of a diamond. Importantly, the uniform size, and spherical shape would also reduce wear on the mining company’s milling equipment.

As soon as the client utilized CARBOGRIND ceramic media product in their vertical mills, it realized immediate grinding performance improvements over silica sand and other specialty media products. Grinding efficiency was optimized and input energy was reduced, while less wear on the mechanical parts of its milling equipment meant lower maintenance requirements and costs.
The results
Finally, the hardness and durability of CARBOGRIND ceramic media product reduced final product contamination and lowered process costs. It also meant that the large Spanish mining company could use the ceramic grinding media for longer in its mills, reducing the usual costs associated with replacing, transporting and disposing of grinding media.

					Full Description



CARBO Ceramics Inc., incorporated on June 23, 1987, is a technology company that provides products and services to the global oil and gas and industrial markets. The Company operates through two segments: Oilfield Technologies and Services, and Environmental Products and Services.The Company's oilfield technologies and services segment includes the manufacturing and selling of proppant products for use primarily in the hydraulic fracturing of oil and natural gas wells, Fracpro software for the design of fracture treatments, and StrataGen consulting services for the optimizing of well completions. The Company's environmental products and services segment is intended to protect operators' assets, minimize environmental risks, and lower lease operating expense (LOE). Hydraulic fracturing is a method of increasing production from oil and natural gas wells. The hydraulic fracturing process consists of pumping fluids down a natural gas or oil well at pressures sufficient to create fractures in the hydrocarbon-bearing rock formation. A granular material, called proppant, is suspended and transported in the fluid and fills the fracture, propping it open once high-pressure pumping stops. The proppant-filled fracture creates a conductive channel through which the hydrocarbons can flow more freely from the formation to the well and then to the surface. There are three primary types of proppant that can be utilized in the hydraulic fracturing process: sand, resin-coated sand and ceramic.The Company manufactures various ceramic proppants. KRYPTOSPHERE HD is a ceramic proppant engineered to deliver increased conductivity and durability in the highest closure stress wells. KRYPTOSPHERE LD meets client needs for a lower density proppant. CARBOHSP and CARBOPROP are high and intermediate density ceramic proppants, respectively, designed primarily for use in deep oil and gas wells. CARBOLITE, CARBOECONOPROP and CARBOHYDROPROP are low-density ceramic proppants. CARBOLITE is used in medium depth oil and gas wells, where higher production rates can be achieved due to the product's uniform size and spherical shape. It also produces resin-coated ceramic, CARBOBOND LITE. In addition, the Company manufactures CARBONRT, a detectable proppant that utilizes a non-radioactive tracer material to assist operators in determining the locations of fractures in a natural gas or oil well.The Company's FUSION technology improves well productivity by forming a stable, high-permeability proppant pack that prevents proppant washout from the non-compressive annulus and near-wellbore areas. CARBOAIR is a high-transport, ultra-low-density ceramic proppant technology. Its manufacturing facilities also produce ceramic pellets for use in various industrial technology applications, including but not limited to casting and milling. FracPro provides a suite of stimulation software solutions used for designing fracture treatments and for on-site real-time analysis. The Company, through Asset Guard Products Inc. (AGPI), provides spill prevention, containment and countermeasure systems for the oil and gas industry. The Company manufactures various ceramic proppants.The Company competes with Compagnie de Saint-Gobain, Mineracao Curimbaba, Imerys, S.A., Borovichi Refractory Plant, FORES Refractory Plant, Unimin Corp., U.S. Silica Company, Fairmount Minerals Limited, Inc., Hi-Crush Partners LP, Badger Mining Corp., and Hexion.

        Cash of $108 million can currently pay off all long term debt with money left over. But a lot of cash is neede to launch all the new products.
        The company will morph from just a ceramics company to a comprehensive value added solutions company. Critical diversification into other industries will offset proppant cyclicality.
        Board members have loaned $25 million, key officers have been buying stock, and institutions own 85% of the stock outstanding. All of this is a vote for a bright future.
        The past few years have been brutal to Carbo Ceramics (NYSE:CRR). Many managements would have given up the ghost and gone to oblivion. Sales collapsed far faster than management could adjust. But this management has faced up to some very tough medicine and is ready for more if it is needed. All the while the company is transitioning to a brand new world so that the past does not have to repeat. Low commodity pricing has made the transition longer and more costly. It would have helped if the crash had been more gentle and provided some cash flow to aid the transition, but this management appears to be going ahead in launching a whole new range of products without the cash flow help. This management raised the needed cash instead. So while shareholder dilution has been necessary, the shareholders still own a piece of a new company that will be far more technology oriented in the future. 



 Source: Carbo Ceramics Capital One Annual Energy Conference December 7, 2016 Management has launched a whole new line of products to try and offset the latest downturn. The collapse of ceramic product sales has management trying several new avenues of growth to diversify the company. The two big areas are the new technology in the oil business both with ceramics and without ceramics. Then the second prong involves expansion of the industrial division. The industrial division had always been a relatively small part of profitable sales. Now that the downturn has idled plenty of plant capacity, there is room to grow this division. Management intends to do just that for diversification purposes. Management has just learned the hard way the risks of relying on one historically very profitable product line. The second slide signifies a very significant change in the growth vision. 


 Source: Carbo Ceramics Capital One Annual Energy Conference December 7, 2016 Ceramics Proppant has always promised enough advantages to offset its cost. But the industry as shown some giant production strides without the advantages of proppant. As shown in the first slide, that initial production has jumped remarkably over the last few years. Companies rightly chose to pursue the improvements promising the largest returns. Several of the new improvements overshadowed the disadvantages of switching back to sand from ceramic proppant.
 Management believes that the giant strides of the past few years are slowing coming to an end. Then comparisons between sand wells and proppant wells can be made comparing "apples to apples". Up until now there were so many variables producing some giant improvements that ceramic proppant was not a priority. This has happened in the industry before, but it has taken an unusual amount of time for the large improvements to be realized before the ceramic proppant advantages became material. So the company watched its sales dry up because it was completely unable to make its case to the industry while other factors overshadowed the advantages of its product line. The new products promise complementary savings and can therefore aid in making the case for ceramic proppant advantages. Of course there were exceptions, such as the Utica shale and other deep wells where ceramic proppant is probably mandatory. Other areas such as the Bakken saw a collapse in sales because the leases are relatively high cost to produce. One of the larger operators, Continental Resources (NYSE:CLR) as moved much of its activity to the Scoop and Stack areas in Oklahoma while minimizing its Bakken activity. Other areas such as the Permian, Stack, and Scoop have lower pressures so the producers could use sand. 


 Source: Carbo Ceramics Capital One Annual Energy Conference December 7, 2016 The first slide gives the basic product line breakdown. The second slide is a little more specific. The guard line of products, for example, now consists of more than a half-dozen products. Two of those are at the marketing stage while more are undergoing field testing. But each of the three areas has multiple new products representing a far more comprehensive solution to customer concerns. Many of these products will lower costs for several years and provide a remarkable competitive advantage over current industry practices. A small example of the possibilities follow. A much more comprehensive overview is on the company website.
 


 Source: Carbo Ceramics Capital One Annual Energy Conference December 7, 2016 SCALEGUARD is the first product that finished field testing and is now being generally marketed. Of all the new products, this one is the furthest along the new product sales curve. As shown above it promises to save the customer a lot of money. Reworks are expensive and can far exceed the costs shown above. The whole product line marks a new way to do things for the industry. For the operator that is used two some shutdowns and lost production each year, relief is on the way. The next generation of cost savings is now ready for the industry. The downturn has made market penetration hard. But with a whole new line of products that promise to save money such as this, that corporate future is now becoming focused as more and more products finish field testing. 



 Source: Carbo Ceramics Capital One Annual Energy Conference December 7, 2016 Investors should expect a fair amount of cash burn from all the new products. The Guard line of products alone has several products that will exit field testing and begin general sales. As shown with these two slides, there are a lot more new product lines and enhancements besides Guard. This management has been very deliberate about comprehensively testing products, working with customers to minimize new product risks, and then finally marketing those new products. While this is a far more costly way of doing things, it often save a lot of headaches later. But new product introductions generally take patience and a lot of money. As will be seen, this company has a lot of new products. Many more of the new products are discussed far more fully on the company website. But this ambitious project amounts to a complete refocus of the company. This is no longer going to be just a ceramic proppant company. Instead the company will offer solutions affecting well product and costs for years after the products are purchased. Then alternative or other industry uses for the same products will be sought to increase sales, use idle capacity and diversify. 


 Source: Carbo Ceramics Capital One Annual Energy Conference December 7, 2016 Some of these products, such as the casting already have customers and the company is seeking more customers (market penetration) after favorable customer feedback. Much of this product line involves company products already in existence for use in areas other than oil wells. Many uses are in completely different industry that should counter-balance some of the oil industry cycles. In any event many of these proposals are low cost and quick payback proposals. The company also has several co-production proposals to produce other non-competing products in various industries for companies while it has excess capacity.
 So this company is becoming far more complex than it has in the past. Some segment reporting would help the company make its case to the market. Currently the company just reports one sales amount and lets the market make its own conclusions. So the market discounts these products and diversification efforts as insignificant. But the current industry downturn has magnified the importance of these efforts. As very the first slide shows, these products as a group are finally beginning to gain traction. This company management has always had a value-added technology approach. A properly executed value added approach should ensure above average profitability in the future. Sales of commodity products were a last resort. Now the indicated diversification may be the next crucial step towards the long term stabilization of company finances. 

 Source: Carbo Ceramics Capital One Annual Energy Conference December 7, 2016 This is the first time in awhile that the company is projecting any revenue growth in a quarter from the previous quarter. A large part of this fourth quarter growth will be from delayed sales. The market does not want to hear that. But it is just an accomplishment to hold the sales level such that any reason would increase sales. For quite a few quarters, sales were in a freefall. Now the new product sales should become significant enough in the next fiscal year to begin increasing overall sales. In fact, management projects double digit growth in sales in the next fiscal year. New product market penetration forecasts are not very accurate because of a lack of sales history. So new product sales could be erratic in the beginning until management can forecast a pattern. Large customer purchase of new products could initially enhance the erratic nature of new product sales. Patterns generally smooth as volume builds. Costs are likely to continue to run high as new product introductions are not cheap.
 All of these new products will require cash to fund that beginning growth past the introduction. Initial market penetration can be costly also. Profitability may be a little bit away. So the latest goal of positive cash flow and positive EBITDA before fiscal year end is understandable. There are enough new products that an investor could reasonable wonder if the project is too large and diverse for management. So one would have to hope that the inter-connectedness of the products will minimize the scope problem. As shown above there is more than enough cash to pay down all of the debt and liquidate. But this management is determined to drag this company into a new future. They have in so many ways put their money where their mouth is. In fact they have put quite a bit of their own money on the table. That action alone will minimize any chance of bankruptcy. Plus the land and buildings are probably worth quite a bit more than any debt, even if the inventories are not worth much at the bottom of a downturn. 


 Source: Carbo Ceramics Capital One Annual Energy Conference December 7, 2016 Ironically restarting the sand plant to sell a commodity product may enable the company to get "its foot in the door" to sell the higher margin projects. Currently the proppant business is severely depressed, but the sand business is growing by leaps and bounds. During the better years the company was capacity constrained, so the sand business was idled to concentrate on the far more profitable ceramic proppant business. But the easiest way to get new business is to add new business to existing business. So the sand business needs to get the salesmen in front of potential customers so the new products can be introduced while sand is sold. Therefore company is gaining customers in a commodity business as a way of selling its new products. It is an old tried and true strategy; so let us see how well it works for this company currently. The sand business may not have to be very profitable for this company to increase its profitability with the new product lines.
 Many of the company plants are located in the Southeast. So the Utica shale business is not only far away, it was not the initial emphasis of the business. From a distance perspective, anything Oklahoma, and then West would have been the initial focus years ago. Now this is not ideal because the deeper wells for proppant are located further away. However, the new company products promise large enough cost savings that the distance factor may be overcome. Plus the closer locations may use the proppant for the other advantages like SCALEGUARD, that promise huge savings for years to come. The company does have acreage in other areas such as Wisconsin (to service the Bakken potentially) that are not a priority in the current environment. But the land and sometimes empty buildings (that were not yet staffed or re-designed to produce) will provide a cheap way to grow. Like many in the industry, the company froze in mid-expansion when the industry collapsed. Now management is trying to grapple with the current situation consequences. For years this company was a debt free-large cash balance company. So this downturn has been a humbling experience. Not only has the company had to loan money, but officers of the company have loaned $25 milllion to keep the company afloat during the transition. The current product line has not supplied much cash for the transition because sales collapsed too fast. 



 Source: NASDAQ Website Information On Insider Ownership From the NASDAQ, insiders have been buying like crazy all the way down. In the last year they have purchased worth more than $6 million at current pricing. One director, William C Morris, owns more than 3 million shares alone. The president and CEO of the company, Gary Kolstead currently owns 219 thousand shares worth more than $2 million at current stock prices. He has significantly increased his holdings over the last 12 months. Those holdings and more assure investors that the top management is aligned with the shareholder interests. It is also a big vote in the future of the company as many of the shares were purchased at prices higher than the current market price. The pace of key officer purchases may have slowed in the latest quarter, but that pace is still pretty impressive overall as is the total value of key officer investments in the company. Many senior officers, as did many observers, expected the downturn to end far more quickly and painlessly. Now, even if the ceramic proppant downturn lasts, the new products are finally in a position to turn the tide favorably. There is always a lot of risk with new products but the careful product testing and work with customers should minimize many risks. There is also the risk of a new much more competitive product entering the market but right now none are apparent. 

 Source: NASDAQ Website Information On Insider Ownership An even larger vote of confidence in the future comes from the large institutional buyers who own 85% of the stock. Normally institutions invest in a stock to make profits. So those fairly sophisticated investors see a bright, if speculative, future for the company. So some good news could really send this stock soaring on a pseudo short squeeze. Notice that the overall institutional position is basically in maintenance mode. It is neither growing nor shrinking significantly. There is definitely no panic rush to the exits.
 The downside risk is minimal because the company has more than enough cash to pay its debt. Plus those fixed assets have value probably in excess of the current price if they were sold. That may not always be the case depending upon how the plan execution unfolds. But for right now, the company has more than enough financial strength to prevent any kind of financial crisis fears. This stock is a bet on the future of all those new products as well as a ceramic proppant recovery. If the new product lines succeed, the markets they target are many times the size of the original ceramic proppant market. Plus the diversification involved should lower the profit cycles of the company and result in more stable profits in the future. The company still has to get there though. But should management succeed this could be a $100 per share stock within five years.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
