       This Amendment is being jointly filed by the Reporting Persons,
who acknowledge that they are a group within the meaning of Section

activities subject to, Federal or state securities laws or finding any          
violation with respect to such laws.                                            

Item 5.     Interest in Securities of the Issuer.       

Pursuant to the Agreement, the Purchase shall only be   
consummated upon the satisfaction or waiver of each of the Conditions           
Precedent.  The occurrence of several of these conditions, including            
governmental approvals, is not within the control of the Sellers or the         
Reporting Persons and the Sellers and Reporting Persons cannot be certain       
that the Purchase will in fact be consummated.  Therefore, the Reporting        
Persons hereby disclaim beneficial ownership of the Share Consideration         
pursuant to Rule 13d-4 under the Act.                                           

On May 14, 1996, the Company issued 4,674,503 shares of 
Common Stock in a secondary offering.  To the best knowledge of the             
Reporting Persons, as of May 14, 1996, taking into account such issuance,       
there were outstanding (i) 15,060,721 shares of Common Stock, (ii) warrants     
and options to purchase an aggregate of 1,871,359 shares of Common Stock,       
and (iii) a restricted stock grant covering 200,000 shares of Common Stock.     
If the Purchase were to be consummated as set forth in the Agreement and        
assuming that 15,060,721 shares of Common Stock were issued and outstanding,    
the Reporting Persons would beneficially own approximately 5.9% of the issued   
and outstanding Common Stock.                                                   

      Upon consummation of the Purchase, the Reporting Persons would
have sole voting power to vote and dispose of such shares of Common Stock,      
subject to certain voting agreements contained in the Agreement.                

    Except as set forth in this Statement, none of the Reporting
Persons beneficially owns any Common Stock or has effected any transactions     
in the Common Stock during the past 60 days.

Advance Publications, Inc., is an American media company owned by the descendants of S.I. Newhouse Sr., Donald Newhouse and S.I. Newhouse, Jr. It is named after the Staten Island Advance, the first newspaper owned by the Newhouse family, in which Sam Newhouse bought a controlling interest in 1922. The company is nominally headquartered in the Advance offices in Staten Island's Grasmere neighborhood, though Advance does not have an official headquarters.[2]
As of October 2014, it was ranked as the 44th largest privately held company in the United States according to Forbes.[3] Crain's ranked Advance Publications the 4th largest private company in the New York area in 2012. In addition to holding publishing and communication assets, Advance serves as the holding company for the family's 31% stake in cable entertainment company Discovery Communications.[4] Advance also owns a 13% stake in Charter Communications, which it received when Bright House Networks merged with Charter.[5][6]

Newspapers and affiliate websites[edit]
The Advance Local media group, established in 2010, operates 12 local news and information websites and more than 30 newspapers. The Advance Local group includes Advance Digital, a "central source of sales and content strategy, product development and technology."[8] Another unit, Advance Central Services, supports the Advance Local publications, with responsibility for vendor management, finance and accounting, human resources, technology, production and facilities, and circulation. Headline Studio, established in 2015, is an in-house content marketing agency.
In 2009, Advance Publications launched a multi-year reorganization of its newspapers and their affiliate websites, beginning with its Michigan properties. Advance in most cases created regional "media groups" to oversee the websites and print publications, along with affiliate "central services" companies to print and deliver the newspapers and provide support services.
As each property reorganized, the new companies took a "digital-first" approach to publication; in most cases, the moves have been accompanied by layoffs. Staff-produced content is published first to a website; content is then harvested from the website for publication in the printed newspapers. Days of newspaper home delivery were reduced to three or four, except at the New Jersey papers and the Staten Island Advance.[9]

reddit.com:[15] "Reddit used to be owned by Condé Nast, but in 2011 it was moved out from under Condé Nast to Advance Publications, which is Condé Nast's parent company. Then in 2012, Reddit was spun out into a re-incorporated independent entity with its own board and control of its own finances, hiring a new CEO and bringing back co-founder Alexis Ohanian to serve on the board. Reddit has 3 sets of shareholders: The largest shareholder is still Advance Publications. The second-largest set of shareholders are Reddit employees. In the spin-out that occurred in early 2012, Advance voluntarily reduced its sole ownership to that of a partial owner in order to put ownership in the hands of current and future employees. The third and smallest fraction consists of a set of angel investors."[16]

reddit.com:[15] "Reddit used to be owned by Condé Nast, but in 2011 it was moved out from under Condé Nast to Advance Publications, which is Condé Nast's parent company. Then in 2012, Reddit was spun out into a re-incorporated independent entity with its own board and control of its own finances, hiring a new CEO and bringing back co-founder Alexis Ohanian to serve on the board. Reddit has 3 sets of shareholders: The largest shareholder is still Advance Publications. The second-largest set of shareholders are Reddit employees. In the spin-out that occurred in early 2012, Advance voluntarily reduced its sole ownership to that of a partial owner in order to put ownership in the hands of current and future employees. The third and smallest fraction consists of a set of angel investors."[16]

Advance Publications, Inc., is an American media company owned by the descendants of S.I. Newhouse Sr., Donald Newhouse and S.I. Newhouse, Jr. It is named after the Staten Island Advance, the first newspaper owned by the Newhouse family, in which Sam Newhouse bought a controlling interest in 1922. The company is nominally headquartered in the Advance offices in Staten Island's Grasmere neighborhood, though Advance does not have an official headquarters.[2]
As of October 2014, it was ranked as the 44th largest privately held company in the United States according to Forbes.[3] Crain's ranked Advance Publications the 4th largest private company in the New York area in 2012. In addition to holding publishing and communication assets, Advance serves as the holding company for the family's 31% stake in cable entertainment company Discovery Communications.[4] Advance also owns a 13% stake in Charter Communications, which it received when Bright House Networks merged with Charter.[5][6]

Publications[edit]
Newspapers and affiliate websites[edit]
The Advance Local media group, established in 2010, operates 12 local news and information websites and more than 30 newspapers. The Advance Local group includes Advance Digital, a "central source of sales and content strategy, product development and technology."[8] Another unit, Advance Central Services, supports the Advance Local publications, with responsibility for vendor management, finance and accounting, human resources, technology, production and facilities, and circulation. Headline Studio, established in 2015, is an in-house content marketing agency.
In 2009, Advance Publications launched a multi-year reorganization of its newspapers and their affiliate websites, beginning with its Michigan properties. Advance in most cases created regional "media groups" to oversee the websites and print publications, along with affiliate "central services" companies to print and deliver the newspapers and provide support services.
As each property reorganized, the new companies took a "digital-first" approach to publication; in most cases, the moves have been accompanied by layoffs. Staff-produced content is published first to a website; content is then harvested from the website for publication in the printed newspapers. Days of newspaper home delivery were reduced to three or four, except at the New Jersey papers and the Staten Island Advance.[9]

Advance Publications, Inc., is an American media company owned by the descendants of S.I. Newhouse Sr., Donald Newhouse and S.I. Newhouse, Jr. It is named after the Staten Island Advance, the first newspaper owned by the Newhouse family, in which Sam Newhouse bought a controlling interest in 1922. The company is nominally headquartered in the Advance offices in Staten Island's Grasmere neighborhood, though Advance does not have an official headquarters.[2]
As of October 2014, it was ranked as the 44th largest privately held company in the United States according to Forbes.[3] Crain's ranked Advance Publications the 4th largest private company in the New York area in 2012. In addition to holding publishing and communication assets, Advance serves as the holding company for the family's 31% stake in cable entertainment company Discovery Communications.[4] Advance also owns a 13% stake in Charter Communications, which it received when Bright House Networks merged with Charter.[5][6]

Publications[edit]
Newspapers and affiliate websites[edit]
The Advance Local media group, established in 2010, operates 12 local news and information websites and more than 30 newspapers. The Advance Local group includes Advance Digital, a "central source of sales and content strategy, product development and technology."[8] Another unit, Advance Central Services, supports the Advance Local publications, with responsibility for vendor management, finance and accounting, human resources, technology, production and facilities, and circulation. Headline Studio, established in 2015, is an in-house content marketing agency.
In 2009, Advance Publications launched a multi-year reorganization of its newspapers and their affiliate websites, beginning with its Michigan properties. Advance in most cases created regional "media groups" to oversee the websites and print publications, along with affiliate "central services" companies to print and deliver the newspapers and provide support services.
As each property reorganized, the new companies took a "digital-first" approach to publication; in most cases, the moves have been accompanied by layoffs. Staff-produced content is published first to a website; content is then harvested from the website for publication in the printed newspapers. Days of newspaper home delivery were reduced to three or four, except at the New Jersey papers and the Staten Island Advance.[9]

reddit.com:[15] "Reddit used to be owned by Condé Nast, but in 2011 it was moved out from under Condé Nast to Advance Publications, which is Condé Nast's parent company. Then in 2012, Reddit was spun out into a re-incorporated independent entity with its own board and control of its own finances, hiring a new CEO and bringing back co-founder Alexis Ohanian to serve on the board. Reddit has 3 sets of shareholders: The largest shareholder is still Advance Publications. The second-largest set of shareholders are Reddit employees. In the spin-out that occurred in early 2012, Advance voluntarily reduced its sole ownership to that of a partial owner in order to put ownership in the hands of current and future employees. The third and smallest fraction consists of a set of angel investors."[16]

reddit.com:[15] "Reddit used to be owned by Condé Nast, but in 2011 it was moved out from under Condé Nast to Advance Publications, which is Condé Nast's parent company. Then in 2012, Reddit was spun out into a re-incorporated independent entity with its own board and control of its own finances, hiring a new CEO and bringing back co-founder Alexis Ohanian to serve on the board. Reddit has 3 sets of shareholders: The largest shareholder is still Advance Publications. The second-largest set of shareholders are Reddit employees. In the spin-out that occurred in early 2012, Advance voluntarily reduced its sole ownership to that of a partial owner in order to put ownership in the hands of current and future employees. The third and smallest fraction consists of a set of angel investors."[16]
