An equity co-investment (or co-investment) is a minority investment, made directly into an operating company, alongside a financial sponsor or other private equity investor, in a leveraged buyout, recapitalization or growth capital transaction. In certain circumstances, venture capital firms may also seek co-investors.




Diagram of the structure of an equity co-investment in a portfolio company alongside a financial sponsor


Private equity firms seek co-investors for several reasons. Most important of these is that co-investments allow a manager to make larger investments without either dedicating too much of the fund's capital to a single transaction (i.e., exposure issues) or sharing the deal with competing private equity firms. Co-investors bring a friendly source of capital.
Typically, co-investors are existing limited partners in an investment fund managed by the lead financial sponsor in a transaction. Unlike the investment fund however, co-investments are made outside of the existing fund and as such co-investors rarely pay management fees or carried interest on an individual investment. Co-investments are typically passive, non-controlling investments, as the private equity firm or firms involved will exercise control and perform monitoring functions. For large private equity fund of funds and other investors, co-investments are a means of increasing exposure to attractive transactions and making investments that have a higher return potential because of the lower economics paid to the general partner. As a result, many private equity firms offer co-investments to their largest and most important investors as an incentive to invest in future funds.

Private Equity Co-Investment


The PECO Fund is, as far as we know, a unique private equity co-investment vehicle making use of the co-investment rights received by M&A Intermediaries as a result of their placement of a deal with a private equity sponsor. PECO is a family office fund that purchases co-investment opportunities on a case-by-case basis across a wide range of industries and deal sizes.
Our proprietary investment management teams (based on deal size and industry sector) help make investment decisions on our behalf. Usually PECO sources investment opportunities arising as a matter of a contractual right held by an M&A Intermediary. Sometimes, however, a private equity GP or LP will bring co-investments to PECO because they are constrained by investment restrictions around a particular deal size and thus need to bring in additional “outside co-investors.”
The basis for creating PECO lies in the fact that, in most cases, M&A Intermediaries do not have sufficient cash to fund their co-investment rights at the deal closing. These co-investment rights typically range from 5-15% of the equity of the deals they source. Currently over 120 M&A firms source and bring co-investment opportunities to PECO. The co-investment deals brought to PECO have already been vetted and approved through due diligence for investment by leading private equity sponsors.
Over the past five years, PECO has built an extensive network of participating M&A Intermediaries. PECO becomes informed of “prescreened,” “vetted” and “investment committee approved” private equity sponsored co-investments. These deals are funded by leading private equity firms and cover a wide range of business sectors. PECO has a unique opportunity to evaluate deals not otherwise available at-large. PECO’s deals typically range from $100 million to $500 million in enterprise value. Most co-investment opportunities are in the $1 million to $25 million range per transaction. However, over the past several years, about one third of the co-investment opportunities have been between $25 million to $60 million.
Deal volume increased as more and more M&A Intermediaries began participating. PECO provides carried interest compensation to the M&A firms that bring individual deals. M&A Intermediaries keep all cash transaction fees paid by the private equity sponsors supporting each transaction.

A private equity fund is a collective investment scheme used for making investments in various equity (and to a lesser extent debt) securities according to one of the investment strategies associated with private equity. Private equity funds are typically limited partnerships with a fixed term of 10 years (often with annual extensions). At inception, institutional investors make an unfunded commitment to the limited partnership, which is then drawn over the term of the fund. From the investors' point of view, funds can be traditional (where all the investors invest with equal terms) or asymmetric (where different investors have different terms).[1][2]
A private equity fund is raised and managed by investment professionals of a specific private equity firm (the general partner and investment advisor). Typically, a single private equity firm will manage a series of distinct private equity funds and will attempt to raise a new fund every 3 to 5 years as the previous fund is fully invested.[1]

Legal structure and terms[edit]




Diagram of the structure of a generic private equity fund


Most private equity funds are structured as limited partnerships and are governed by the terms set forth in the limited partnership agreement or LPA.[3] Such funds have a general partner (GP), which raises capital from cash-rich institutional investors, such as pension plans, universities, insurance companies, foundations, endowments, and high-net-worth individuals, which invest as limited partners (LPs) in the fund. Among the terms set forth in the limited partnership agreement are the following:[4][5]

Term of the partnership: The partnership is usually a fixed-life investment vehicle that is typically 10 years plus some number of extensions.
Management fees: An annual payment made by the investors in the fund to the fund's manager to pay for the private equity firm's investment operations (typically 1 to 2% of the committed capital of the fund.[6]
Distribution Waterfall : The process by which the returned capital will be distributed to the investor, and allocated between Limited and General Partner. This waterfall includes the preferred return : a minimum rate of return (e.g. 8%) which must be achieved before the General Partner can receive any carried interest, and the Carried interest, the share of the profits paid the General Partner above the preferred return (e.g. 20%).[6]
Transfer of an interest in the fund: Private equity funds are not intended to be transferred or traded; however, they can be transferred to another investor. Typically, such a transfer must receive the consent of and is at the discretion of the fund's manager.[7]
Restrictions on the General Partner: The fund's manager has significant discretion to make investments and control the affairs of the fund. However, the LPA does have certain restrictions and controls and is often limited in the type, size, or geographic focus of investments permitted, and how long the manager is permitted to make new investments.[8]

The following is an illustration of the difference between a private equity fund and a private equity firm:

Investments and financing[edit]
A private equity fund typically makes investments in companies (known as portfolio companies). These portfolio company investments are funded with the capital raised from LPs, and may be partially or substantially financed by debt. Some private equity investment transactions can be highly leveraged with debt financing—hence the acronym LBO for "leveraged buy-out". The cash flow from the portfolio company usually provides the source for the repayment of such debt. While billion dollar private equity investments make the headlines, private equity funds also play a large role in middle market businesses.[9]
Such LBO financing most often comes from commercial banks, although other financial institutions, such as hedge funds and mezzanine funds, may also provide financing. Since mid-2007, debt financing has become much more difficult to obtain for private equity funds than in previous years.[10][11]
LBO funds commonly acquire most of the equity interests or assets of the portfolio company through a newly created special purpose acquisition subsidiary controlled by the fund, and sometimes as a consortium of several like-minded funds.[12][13]
Multiples and prices[edit]
The acquisition price of a portfolio company is usually based on a multiple of the company's historical income, most often based on the measure of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). Private equity multiples are highly dependent on the portfolio company's industry, the size of the company, and the availability of LBO financing.[14]
Portfolio company sales (exits)[edit]
A private equity fund's ultimate goal is to sell or exit its investments in portfolio companies for a return, known as internal rate of return (IRR) in excess of the price paid. These exit scenarios historically have been an IPO of the portfolio company or a sale of the company to a strategic acquirer through a merger or acquisition (M&A), also known as a trade sale.[15] A sale of the portfolio company to another private equity firm, also known as a secondary, has become common feature of developed private equity markets.[14]
In prior years, another exit strategy has been a preferred dividend by the portfolio company to the private equity fund to repay the capital investment, sometimes financed with additional debt.[16][17]
Investment features and considerations[edit]
Considerations for investing in private equity funds relative to other forms of investment include:

Substantial entry requirements: With most private equity funds requiring significant initial commitment (usually upwards of $1,000,000), which can be drawn at the manager's discretion over the first few years of the fund.[18]
Limited liquidity: Investments in limited partnership interests (the dominant legal form of private equity investments) are referred to as "illiquid" investments, which should earn a premium over traditional securities, such as stocks and bonds. Once invested, liquidity of invested funds may be very difficult to achieve before the manager realizes the investments in the portfolio because an investor's capital may be locked-up in long-term investments for as long as twelve years. Distributions may be made only as investments are converted to cash with limited partners typically having no right to demand that sales be made.[19]
Investment Control: Nearly all investors in private equity are passive and rely on the manager to make investments and generate liquidity from those investments. Typically, governance rights for limited partners in private equity funds are minimal. However, in some cases, Limited Partners with substantial investment enjoy special rights and terms of investment.[20]
Unfunded Commitments: An investor's commitment to a private equity fund is satisfied over time as the general partner makes capital calls on the investor. If a private equity firm cannot find suitable investment opportunities, it will not draw on an investor's commitment, and an investor may potentially invest less than expected or committed.[4][10]
Investment Risks: Given the risks associated with private equity investments, an investor can lose all of its investment. The risk of loss of capital is typically higher in venture capital funds, which invest in companies during the earliest phases of their development or in companies with high amounts of financial leverage. By their nature, investments in privately held companies tend to be riskier than investments in publicly traded companies.[21]
High returns: Consistent with the risks outlined above, private equity can provide high returns, with the best private equity managers significantly outperforming the public markets.[22]

For the above-mentioned reasons, private equity fund investment is for investors who can afford to have capital locked up for long periods and who can risk losing significant amounts of money. These disadvantages are offset by the potential benefits of annual returns, which may range up to 30% for successful funds.[23]

This article is about private equity investment funds. For private equity fund managers or financial sponsors and an overview of the industry, see private equity firm and private equity.

A private equity fund is a collective investment scheme used for making investments in various equity (and to a lesser extent debt) securities according to one of the investment strategies associated with private equity. Private equity funds are typically limited partnerships with a fixed term of 10 years (often with annual extensions). At inception, institutional investors make an unfunded commitment to the limited partnership, which is then drawn over the term of the fund. From the investors' point of view, funds can be traditional (where all the investors invest with equal terms) or asymmetric (where different investors have different terms).[1][2]
A private equity fund is raised and managed by investment professionals of a specific private equity firm (the general partner and investment advisor). Typically, a single private equity firm will manage a series of distinct private equity funds and will attempt to raise a new fund every 3 to 5 years as the previous fund is fully invested.[1]

Legal structure and terms[edit]




Diagram of the structure of a generic private equity fund


Most private equity funds are structured as limited partnerships and are governed by the terms set forth in the limited partnership agreement or LPA.[3] Such funds have a general partner (GP), which raises capital from cash-rich institutional investors, such as pension plans, universities, insurance companies, foundations, endowments, and high-net-worth individuals, which invest as limited partners (LPs) in the fund. Among the terms set forth in the limited partnership agreement are the following:[4][5]

Term of the partnership: The partnership is usually a fixed-life investment vehicle that is typically 10 years plus some number of extensions.
Management fees: An annual payment made by the investors in the fund to the fund's manager to pay for the private equity firm's investment operations (typically 1 to 2% of the committed capital of the fund.[6]
Distribution Waterfall : The process by which the returned capital will be distributed to the investor, and allocated between Limited and General Partner. This waterfall includes the preferred return : a minimum rate of return (e.g. 8%) which must be achieved before the General Partner can receive any carried interest, and the Carried interest, the share of the profits paid the General Partner above the preferred return (e.g. 20%).[6]
Transfer of an interest in the fund: Private equity funds are not intended to be transferred or traded; however, they can be transferred to another investor. Typically, such a transfer must receive the consent of and is at the discretion of the fund's manager.[7]
Restrictions on the General Partner: The fund's manager has significant discretion to make investments and control the affairs of the fund. However, the LPA does have certain restrictions and controls and is often limited in the type, size, or geographic focus of investments permitted, and how long the manager is permitted to make new investments.[8]

The following is an illustration of the difference between a private equity fund and a private equity firm:

Investments and financing[edit]
A private equity fund typically makes investments in companies (known as portfolio companies). These portfolio company investments are funded with the capital raised from LPs, and may be partially or substantially financed by debt. Some private equity investment transactions can be highly leveraged with debt financing—hence the acronym LBO for "leveraged buy-out". The cash flow from the portfolio company usually provides the source for the repayment of such debt. While billion dollar private equity investments make the headlines, private equity funds also play a large role in middle market businesses.[9]
Such LBO financing most often comes from commercial banks, although other financial institutions, such as hedge funds and mezzanine funds, may also provide financing. Since mid-2007, debt financing has become much more difficult to obtain for private equity funds than in previous years.[10][11]
LBO funds commonly acquire most of the equity interests or assets of the portfolio company through a newly created special purpose acquisition subsidiary controlled by the fund, and sometimes as a consortium of several like-minded funds.[12][13]
Multiples and prices[edit]
The acquisition price of a portfolio company is usually based on a multiple of the company's historical income, most often based on the measure of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). Private equity multiples are highly dependent on the portfolio company's industry, the size of the company, and the availability of LBO financing.[14]
Portfolio company sales (exits)[edit]
A private equity fund's ultimate goal is to sell or exit its investments in portfolio companies for a return, known as internal rate of return (IRR) in excess of the price paid. These exit scenarios historically have been an IPO of the portfolio company or a sale of the company to a strategic acquirer through a merger or acquisition (M&A), also known as a trade sale.[15] A sale of the portfolio company to another private equity firm, also known as a secondary, has become common feature of developed private equity markets.[14]
In prior years, another exit strategy has been a preferred dividend by the portfolio company to the private equity fund to repay the capital investment, sometimes financed with additional debt.[16][17]
Investment features and considerations[edit]
Considerations for investing in private equity funds relative to other forms of investment include:

Substantial entry requirements: With most private equity funds requiring significant initial commitment (usually upwards of $1,000,000), which can be drawn at the manager's discretion over the first few years of the fund.[18]
Limited liquidity: Investments in limited partnership interests (the dominant legal form of private equity investments) are referred to as "illiquid" investments, which should earn a premium over traditional securities, such as stocks and bonds. Once invested, liquidity of invested funds may be very difficult to achieve before the manager realizes the investments in the portfolio because an investor's capital may be locked-up in long-term investments for as long as twelve years. Distributions may be made only as investments are converted to cash with limited partners typically having no right to demand that sales be made.[19]
Investment Control: Nearly all investors in private equity are passive and rely on the manager to make investments and generate liquidity from those investments. Typically, governance rights for limited partners in private equity funds are minimal. However, in some cases, Limited Partners with substantial investment enjoy special rights and terms of investment.[20]
Unfunded Commitments: An investor's commitment to a private equity fund is satisfied over time as the general partner makes capital calls on the investor. If a private equity firm cannot find suitable investment opportunities, it will not draw on an investor's commitment, and an investor may potentially invest less than expected or committed.[4][10]
Investment Risks: Given the risks associated with private equity investments, an investor can lose all of its investment. The risk of loss of capital is typically higher in venture capital funds, which invest in companies during the earliest phases of their development or in companies with high amounts of financial leverage. By their nature, investments in privately held companies tend to be riskier than investments in publicly traded companies.[21]
High returns: Consistent with the risks outlined above, private equity can provide high returns, with the best private equity managers significantly outperforming the public markets.[22]

For the above-mentioned reasons, private equity fund investment is for investors who can afford to have capital locked up for long periods and who can risk losing significant amounts of money. These disadvantages are offset by the potential benefits of annual returns, which may range up to 30% for successful funds.[23]

Legal structure and terms[edit]




Diagram of the structure of a generic private equity fund


Most private equity funds are structured as limited partnerships and are governed by the terms set forth in the limited partnership agreement or LPA.[3] Such funds have a general partner (GP), which raises capital from cash-rich institutional investors, such as pension plans, universities, insurance companies, foundations, endowments, and high-net-worth individuals, which invest as limited partners (LPs) in the fund. Among the terms set forth in the limited partnership agreement are the following:[4][5]

Term of the partnership: The partnership is usually a fixed-life investment vehicle that is typically 10 years plus some number of extensions.
Management fees: An annual payment made by the investors in the fund to the fund's manager to pay for the private equity firm's investment operations (typically 1 to 2% of the committed capital of the fund.[6]
Distribution Waterfall : The process by which the returned capital will be distributed to the investor, and allocated between Limited and General Partner. This waterfall includes the preferred return : a minimum rate of return (e.g. 8%) which must be achieved before the General Partner can receive any carried interest, and the Carried interest, the share of the profits paid the General Partner above the preferred return (e.g. 20%).[6]
Transfer of an interest in the fund: Private equity funds are not intended to be transferred or traded; however, they can be transferred to another investor. Typically, such a transfer must receive the consent of and is at the discretion of the fund's manager.[7]
Restrictions on the General Partner: The fund's manager has significant discretion to make investments and control the affairs of the fund. However, the LPA does have certain restrictions and controls and is often limited in the type, size, or geographic focus of investments permitted, and how long the manager is permitted to make new investments.[8]

Investments and financing[edit]
A private equity fund typically makes investments in companies (known as portfolio companies). These portfolio company investments are funded with the capital raised from LPs, and may be partially or substantially financed by debt. Some private equity investment transactions can be highly leveraged with debt financing—hence the acronym LBO for "leveraged buy-out". The cash flow from the portfolio company usually provides the source for the repayment of such debt. While billion dollar private equity investments make the headlines, private equity funds also play a large role in middle market businesses.[9]
Such LBO financing most often comes from commercial banks, although other financial institutions, such as hedge funds and mezzanine funds, may also provide financing. Since mid-2007, debt financing has become much more difficult to obtain for private equity funds than in previous years.[10][11]
LBO funds commonly acquire most of the equity interests or assets of the portfolio company through a newly created special purpose acquisition subsidiary controlled by the fund, and sometimes as a consortium of several like-minded funds.[12][13]
Multiples and prices[edit]
The acquisition price of a portfolio company is usually based on a multiple of the company's historical income, most often based on the measure of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). Private equity multiples are highly dependent on the portfolio company's industry, the size of the company, and the availability of LBO financing.[14]
Portfolio company sales (exits)[edit]
A private equity fund's ultimate goal is to sell or exit its investments in portfolio companies for a return, known as internal rate of return (IRR) in excess of the price paid. These exit scenarios historically have been an IPO of the portfolio company or a sale of the company to a strategic acquirer through a merger or acquisition (M&A), also known as a trade sale.[15] A sale of the portfolio company to another private equity firm, also known as a secondary, has become common feature of developed private equity markets.[14]
In prior years, another exit strategy has been a preferred dividend by the portfolio company to the private equity fund to repay the capital investment, sometimes financed with additional debt.[16][17]
Investment features and considerations[edit]
Considerations for investing in private equity funds relative to other forms of investment include:

Substantial entry requirements: With most private equity funds requiring significant initial commitment (usually upwards of $1,000,000), which can be drawn at the manager's discretion over the first few years of the fund.[18]
Limited liquidity: Investments in limited partnership interests (the dominant legal form of private equity investments) are referred to as "illiquid" investments, which should earn a premium over traditional securities, such as stocks and bonds. Once invested, liquidity of invested funds may be very difficult to achieve before the manager realizes the investments in the portfolio because an investor's capital may be locked-up in long-term investments for as long as twelve years. Distributions may be made only as investments are converted to cash with limited partners typically having no right to demand that sales be made.[19]
Investment Control: Nearly all investors in private equity are passive and rely on the manager to make investments and generate liquidity from those investments. Typically, governance rights for limited partners in private equity funds are minimal. However, in some cases, Limited Partners with substantial investment enjoy special rights and terms of investment.[20]
Unfunded Commitments: An investor's commitment to a private equity fund is satisfied over time as the general partner makes capital calls on the investor. If a private equity firm cannot find suitable investment opportunities, it will not draw on an investor's commitment, and an investor may potentially invest less than expected or committed.[4][10]
Investment Risks: Given the risks associated with private equity investments, an investor can lose all of its investment. The risk of loss of capital is typically higher in venture capital funds, which invest in companies during the earliest phases of their development or in companies with high amounts of financial leverage. By their nature, investments in privately held companies tend to be riskier than investments in publicly traded companies.[21]
High returns: Consistent with the risks outlined above, private equity can provide high returns, with the best private equity managers significantly outperforming the public markets.[22]

For the above-mentioned reasons, private equity fund investment is for investors who can afford to have capital locked up for long periods and who can risk losing significant amounts of money. These disadvantages are offset by the potential benefits of annual returns, which may range up to 30% for successful funds.[23]

A private equity fund is a collective investment scheme used for making investments in various equity (and to a lesser extent debt) securities according to one of the investment strategies associated with private equity. Private equity funds are typically limited partnerships with a fixed term of 10 years (often with annual extensions). At inception, institutional investors make an unfunded commitment to the limited partnership, which is then drawn over the term of the fund. From the investors' point of view, funds can be traditional (where all the investors invest with equal terms) or asymmetric (where different investors have different terms).[1][2]
A private equity fund is raised and managed by investment professionals of a specific private equity firm (the general partner and investment advisor). Typically, a single private equity firm will manage a series of distinct private equity funds and will attempt to raise a new fund every 3 to 5 years as the previous fund is fully invested.[1]

A private equity fund typically makes investments in companies (known as portfolio companies).

Some private equity investment transactions can be highly leveraged with debt financing—hence the acronym LBO for "leveraged buy-out".

Private equity multiples are highly dependent on the portfolio company's industry, the size of the company, and the availability of LBO financing.[14]

Investing involves risks. Since no one investment program is suitable for all types of investors you need to review your  investment objectives, risk tolerance, and liquidity needs before selecting an investment program. It is possible to lose money. You should periodically review your investment allocations particularly if your circumstances change. There is no assurance that an investment will achieve their objectives. Asset allocation does not assure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.

Save a little more today, 


	  

	  for the things you’ll love forever.

	  
Think about the things you love to do the most. Would you ever want to give them up? That’s the tough financial choice a lot of us could face when we retire. But if we start saving a little more today – even 1% more of our annual income – we could keep doing all the things we love.
It’s all part of Prudential’s goal to help everyone reach their own goals for retirement. We can help with everything from mutual funds to annuities to life insurance. And you can check out our tools for helpful insights on Social Security, ideal places to retire, and more.
Want to see how we can help you? Great – let’s keep going.

Disclaimers: The 1983 Social Security Amendments included a provision to raise the full retirement age gradually to 67, beginning with people born in 1938 or later. The FRA for those born prior to 1943 is 65 and are past the mandated distribution age. For those between 1955 and 1959 the FRA goes up in increments of 2 months beyond age 66. For example the FRA for those born in 1955 is 66 and 2 months, for those born in 1956 is 66 and 4months, and so on. Source: http://www.socialsecurity.gov/planners/retire/agereduction.html

Unexpected
LOSS OF
INCOME


You're already challenged to generate retirement income that could last 20 or 30 years. But if you're a surviving spouse or partner, you may also have to replace the loss of expected income, which could include Social Security and pension benefits.

The Impact of
INCOME
TAXES


The higher your tax rate in retirement, the more you'll have to withdraw from your investments to meet your retirement income target.



























See how we can help  >
You should consult with your tax advisors regarding your personal circumstances.




Medicare Premiums
AND HEALTH
EXPENSES


At age 65, Social Security payments are reduced to cover premiums for Medicare Parts B and D and Medigap insurance. Then there are health-care costs not covered by Medicare — which could average $220,000 for a 65-year-old couple.

Mutual funds and mutual funds investment advice | Ameriprise Financial



Skip to main content
























Mutual funds


Key Points

Mutual funds offer the advantage of professional management
Investors in mutual funds may benefit from diversification
Ameriprise Financial offers access to more than 3,500 funds from nearly 300 fund companies







A mutual fund is a company that pools money from many investors and invests the money in stocks, bonds, short-term money market instruments, other securities or assets or a combination of these investments.
Because professional managers provide ongoing supervision of mutual fund holdings, mutual funds can be a quick and efficient means of managing money.
In addition, mutual funds may provide diversification, an important element of a well-rounded investment portfolio.
Access to a wide variety of fund families
An Ameriprise financial advisor can help you build a portfolio that's right for you, selecting from more than 3,500 funds from nearly 300 fund companies.
If you would like to see if a particular mutual fund is available at Ameriprise, search for it by name or ticker using the Mutual Fund Screener tool. You can use the tool to view a complete list of mutual funds and fund families available at Ameriprise.

Clients should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of a mutual fund carefully before investing. The prospectus contains this and other important information about the funds and should be read carefully before investing. For a free prospectus, which contains this and other important information about each fund, call Ameriprise Financial at 1.800.297.7378.

Traditional and Roth IRAs | Ameriprise Financial



Skip to main content
























Traditional and Roth IRAs, rollovers and conversions


Key Points

Traditional and Roth IRAs offer tax advantages and a wide choice of investment options.
Ameriprise Financial offers a special beneficiary restriction for IRAs to control how assets are distributed.
You can consider, by reviewing the potential benefits and risks, a rollover from a 401(k) plan to an IRA. Consult with your advisor to discuss your individual situation.
An individual retirement account (IRA) can supplement your workplace retirement plan and provide an easy way to save for a confident retirement.







Contributing to a traditional IRA or Roth IRA may generate either tax-deferred or tax-free growth on the money you contribute. These earnings are then reinvested into your account and may generate even more earnings.
Traditional and Roth IRAs
There are two primary types of IRAs – Traditional and Roth. Each offers tax advantages and a wide variety of investment choices.
You can choose one or both depending on your tax situation and income, but all IRAs together are subject to the combined contribution limit.

Traditional IRAs are generally funded with pretax contributions and are taxed as ordinary income when withdrawing funds in retirement.
Roth IRAs are always funded with after-tax contributions and are tax free when you withdraw the money in retirement. You must satisfy rules on qualified distributions for the withdrawals to be considered tax-free.

You can make contributions throughout the year or in a lump sum by the contribution deadline (usually the tax return due date — not including extensions — in the following year). Yearly contribution limits are subject to change.
Workplace retirement plan rollovers
If you've changed jobs or recently retired, you may have multiple retirement plans with different providers. A rollover from an old workplace retirement plan to an Ameriprise® IRA may provide you with a more complete picture of your savings for retirement.
Some Ameriprise IRAs also have a unique feature that allows clients to restrict some beneficiaries from using the funds too quickly.
A workplace retirement plan rollover:

Provides greater control over the investment of your retirement assets
Allows a greater range of investment options than most employer retirement plans
May provide more distribution flexibility than an employer plan
Is not subject to a mandatory 20% withholding when rolled directly to an IRA
Provides flexible beneficiary and estate planning options
Maintains tax-deferred status of the account
Sometimes you can even rollover funds while you are still working

However, there are also some scenarios where it may make sense to leave assets in an employer plan. Some advantages to leaving assets in an employer qualified plan may include:

Special tax treatment for a lump sum distribution of appreciated employer stock
No 10% penalty for pre 59½ withdrawals if you leave your employer in the year you turn 55 or later*

	*For certain public safety workers in governmental plans, participants who stop working in the year they turn age 50 or can avoid the 10% penalty and 457(b) plans don’t have a 10% penalty at any age.
	 
Protection of assets from creditors; assets in ERISA qualified plans are protected under federal law while IRA asset protection outside of bankruptcy depends on state law
Access to competitively priced investments





Rollover assets to an IRA while still employed
By using this little known option, you may be able to transfer assets from your workplace 401(k) into a personal IRA while you’re still employed. Ask your advisor to help you explore the pros and cons of an in-service IRA rollover strategy.
Roth IRA conversions
You may want to consider converting a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA.
A Roth IRA offers a number of benefits that are not available with a traditional IRA or other pre-tax retirement plans, including:

Tax-free potential growth
Tax-free withdrawals
No lifetime required minimum withdrawals

A conversion of a pre-tax retirement plan to a Roth IRA is generally taxable in the year of the conversion so it is important to weigh the costs and benefits of a Roth IRA conversion. Consult your tax advisor to determine if a Roth conversion is right for you.
Take the next step
Contact an Ameriprise financial advisor today to learn more about your IRA, rollover and conversion options.
