MY ACCOUNT
To view your account information, you must first read the service agreement then acknowledge having read it by clicking the button below.
THE TRUST COMPANY OF VIRGINIA PORTFOLIO ONLINE ACCOUNT INFORMATION SERVICE AGREEMENT
This Agreement governs the use of Portfolio Online, the internet account information service provided by The Trust Company of Virginia. By using Portfolio Online to view your account, you agree to all of the following terms and conditions.
1. Definitions as used in this Agreement
Account and accounts mean The Trust Company of Virginia account(s) tied to your access identification number used through Portfolio Online. You, your, and yours mean the person(s) using Portfolio Online. We, our, us, and The Trust Company refer to The Trust Company of Virginia.
2. Required Equipment
In order to use Portfolio Online, you need a computer (in this Agreement, your computer and the related equipment are referred to together as your computer) with a web browser, an access identification number, and a personal identification number or PIN. The access identification number is assigned to you by The Trust Company of Virginia. It, along with your PIN, is used to access your account(s) through Portfolio Online. You are responsible for the installation, maintenance, and operation of your computer, browser and the software. The Trust Company of Virginia is not responsible for any errors or failures from any malfunction of your computer, the browser, or the software. The Trust Company of Virginia is also not responsible for any computer virus or related problems that may be associated with the use of an online system.
3. The Portfolio Online Service
Portfolio Online allows you to obtain account balances and other information about your accounts. To use Portfolio Online, you must have at least one Trust Company of Virginia account. Through Portfolio Online, you will have access to any of your Trust Company of Virginia accounts. The Trust Company of Virginia reserves the right to deny access to an account under certain circumstances. The information available via Portfolio Online is time delayed by at least one business day and therefore may not accurately represent current conditions within the account accessed. You should contact The Trust Company at (804) 272-9044 during business hours if you need up-to-the-minute information. The Trust Company of Virginia’s business days are Monday through Friday, except holidays on which The Trust Company of Virginia is closed. Access to Portfolio Online is available twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week, except during maintenance periods.
4. Unlawful or Unauthorized Use
You may not use Portfolio Online for any unlawful or unauthorized purpose whatsoever. You will adhere to all applicable laws and regulations which apply to service relationships of this nature and specifically agree that you will not attempt to utilize Portfolio Online to access the account of another person.
5. PIN Use and Security
Use of your unique PIN is required to access Portfolio Online. You acknowledge that your PIN is unique, and must be kept private and confidential to protect the security of your account. You agree not to give or make available your PIN to any unauthorized individual. If you believe your PIN has been lost or stolen, or someone has attempted to use Portfolio Online without your consent, your account(s) have been accessed, or someone has transferred funds without your permission, you must notify The Trust Company of Virginia immediately (see Contact Information below). If you lose or forget your PIN, contact The Trust Company of Virginia immediately so that you may select a new confidential PIN. In order to allow for a high degree of confidentiality and security, The Trust Company of Virginia recommends the use of browsers that provide encryption using a 128-bit key. The higher the level of encryption, the harder it is for unauthorized people to read information. Commercial, off-the-shelf browsers typically support 40-bit encryption. Many browser suppliers, however, offer special 128-bit encryption versions, available for download from their respective web sites. The Trust Company of Virginia recommends that customers protect their valuable financial information by using the most secure encryption possible.
6. The Trust Company of Virginia’s Liability
The Trust Company of Virginia will use its best efforts to make Portfolio Online available to you. However, The Trust Company of Virginia shall incur no liability if it is unable to provide Portfolio Online to you for any reason, including but not limited to any of the following circumstances:
A. You have not provided The Trust Company of Virginia with sufficient information to access Portfolio Online.
B. Your Computer, Internet Service Provider, Browser or Portfolio Online was not working properly.
C. Circumstances beyond The Trust Company of Virginia’s controls that prevent the proper execution of the transaction (including but not limited to power outages, internet failures, fire, flood, or interference from an outside force) .
You agree that your exclusive remedy and the cumulative liability of The Trust Company for any and all claims relating to Portfolio Online services provided by the Trust Company, in contract, tort, or otherwise, shall not exceed the total amount of any service fees paid to The Trust Company for Portfolio Online services. In no event shall The Trust Company of Virginia be liable for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, consequential, or exemplary damages, including lost profits (even if advised of the possibility thereof) arising in any way out of the use of Portfolio Online.
7. Exclusion of Warranties
You understand that Internetworking communications utilizing public access facilities may not be secure, and that such communications may be subject to interception, loss or distortion. The Trust Company of Virginia makes no warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory, concerning the confidentiality and accuracy of data of information available through the Portfolio Online service. Consequently, you acknowledge that the use of the Portfolio Online service, and the inherent possibilities of inaccuracy or disclosure of the data or information accessed through Portfolio Online, will be solely at your risk. Portfolio Online and related documentation are provided as is without any warranty of any particular kind expressed or implied, including, but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose
8. Concurrent Agreements
The terms and conditions in this Agreement are supplements to, and do not supersede, any trust agreements or any other agreements that you have with The Trust Company of Virginia.
9. Alterations and Amendments
The Terms of this Agreement may be altered or amended by The Trust Company of Virginia from time to time, including the addition of fees and service charges. In such event, The Trust Company of Virginia shall post any alterations or amendments to this Agreement on its Website in place of any prior version of this Agreement. Your continued use of the service after The Trust Company of Virginia provides you with such a notice of change will constitute your agreement to such change(s).
10. Termination or Discontinuation

You may terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to Portfolio Online. Neither termination nor discontinuation shall affect your liability or obligations under this Agreement.

No delay or omission on the part of The Trust Company of Virginia in exercising any right or remedy shall operate as a waiver of such right or remedy or any other rights or remedies.
