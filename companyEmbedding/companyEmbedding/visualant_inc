ABOUT VISUALANTVisualant, Inc. is a Nevada Corporation and a reporting company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.VISUALANTdevelops a uniqueSPECTRAL PATTERN Matching 'SPM' technology


Visualant develops a unique Spectral Pattern Matching ‘SPM’ technology in which structured light is directed onto a substance, through a liquid/gas, or off a surface, to capture a unique ChromaID. When matched against existing databases, a ChromaID can be used to identify, detect, or diagnosis markers invisible to the human eye. ChromaID scanner modules can be integrated into a variety of mobile or fixed-mount form factors. The patented technology is disruptive, making it possible to effectively conduct analyses in the field that could only previously be performed by large and expensive lab – based tests. The ‘ChromaID Technical White Paper’ provides an overview of how the technology works. The story of Visualant is told in the article ‘Nature’s Color Identifier – The ChromaID Story.’





In May 2012, Visualant received $2.25 million of equity capital from Sumitomo Precision Products Co., Ltd. ‘SPP’ a publicly-listed Japanese corporation. SPP also entered into a Joint Development Agreement and $1 million initial licensing agreement.
ChromaID technology has broad application across industrial, medical, security, and consumer markets. Government agencies, law enforcement, and security companies can use ChromaIDs to authenticate secured documents, identify counterfeits, or detect illicit drugs. Medical applications include measuring indicators of disease or health and identifying drugs. Consumers can identify colors, and measure cosmetic skin factors. Visualant plans to release a ChromaID Development Kit in 2013 to enable third parties to apply the technology to their own applications. Visualant will make available licensing agreements for Visualant Spectral Pattern Matching technology to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), who can integrate the technology into a wide range of devices. Visualant is also developing exemplar products to demonstrate the ChromaID technology.
ChromaID was awarded at the 2013 Annual Prism Awards at SPIE Photonics West in the Green Photonics section.


SUBSIDIARY








In 2009, Visualant, Inc. acquired TransTech Systems, Inc. to transform the access control, identification security and authentication industry.
TransTech Systems, Inc., is a leading provider of identification, security and authentication products and services through a global dealer channel as well as government and private sector customers worldwide.
With over $10 million in annual revenues, TransTech provides an established market presence for Visualant’s ChromaID technology, and enables the rapid deployment of enhanced security and authentication solutions.


PARTNERS







In March 2016, VISUALANT entered in a Joint-Development (JDA) with Intellicheck Mobilisa, Inc. (NYSE Ticker Symbol: IDN), a leader in threat identification, identity authentication, verification and validation solutions.
Through the JDA, Intellicheck will be developing a new line of threat identification products based on ChromaID that will provide an unparalleled deterrent in halting domestic and international terrorism and illegal profit-making operations.
Once commercialized, the Intellicheck expects the new ChromaID-based products, with their broad spectrum of anticipated applications across the Company’s exclusive markets, to be game-changer for a wide variety of clients who would benefit from this cutting-edge technology.










BioMedX Group, Inc. and Visualant entered into a JDA in December 2016.
BIOMEDX will be developing photonic holographic applications using Visualant’s ChromaID technology to analyze and determine various characteristics of the skin and underlying subdermal tissue as it relates to dermatologic, plastic surgery and aesthetic applications, addressing a multi-billion dollar global market.
The BIOMEDX Group is a private company, that has an exclusive worldwide license from PULSE Evolution, Inc, world leaders in holographic content for use in film and entertainment,  for all applications in medicine and healthcare, with an initial product development focus on the modeling and simulation of the human face for aesthetic and facial reconstruction applications.

Visualant, Incorporated develops a spectral matching technology using a patented ChromaID approach.[2][3] Founded in 1998, Visualant is a public company based in Seattle, Washington.[4] The ChromaID technology shines LED wavelengths or laser light onto a material and measures the intensity of the light that is reflected back..[5][6] The data collected can be used to determine what the material in question is by detecting slightest variations in the pattern of the material's reaction to the structured light.[7]

History[edit]
Visualant was founded in 1998 by Ron Erickson. The technology was originally developed by Professor Tom Furness University of Washington and Dr. Brian Showengerdt over a period of seven years at Furness's private research lab 'RATLab'.[8][9][10][11]
Visualant acquired TransTech Systems of Aurora, Oregon in 2010.[12] TransTech distributes security products and systems to security and law enforcement industries.[12]
In May 2012, Visualant entered into a joint development contract, and licensing agreement with Sumitomo Precision Products Co., Ltd. focusing on the commercialization of the SPM technology.[4][13] The following year, the United States Patent and Trademark Office granted its sixth Visualant a patent titled "Method, apparatus, and article to facilitate distributed evaluation of objects using electromagnetic energy."[14] Later in 2013, Visualant partnered with Intellectual Ventures (IV) to further the commercialization of Visualant's ChromaID technology and catalyze the development of further intellectual property through IV's 'Inventor Network'.[15]
Products[edit]
Visualant, Inc. offers the ChromaID Scanner Kit that includes the ChromaID Scanner and the necessary software (ChromaID Lab) to configure and operate the scanner from a PC. The kit also includes an SDK so developers can build their own applications using the technology.[16] The product consists of a hand-held scanner of LEDs that are emitted onto an object and measures the color variations reflected back. The ChromaID is produced from the data that is generated from this process and the associated ChromaID Lab software plots a chart showing the intensity of the light, the software then compares the result to a database of patterns.[8] This technology and product offer a wide variety of uses in industries in identification authentication, and diagnostics.[5]
Awards and recognition[edit]
In February 2013, Visualant won the Green Photonics category of the 2013 Prism Awards for Photonics Innovation for its ChromaID technology.[17]

Visualant, Incorporated develops a spectral matching technology using a patented ChromaID approach.[2][3] Founded in 1998, Visualant is a public company based in Seattle, Washington.[4] The ChromaID technology shines LED wavelengths or laser light onto a material and measures the intensity of the light that is reflected back..[5][6] The data collected can be used to determine what the material in question is by detecting slightest variations in the pattern of the material's reaction to the structured light.[7]

History[edit]
Visualant was founded in 1998 by Ron Erickson. The technology was originally developed by Professor Tom Furness University of Washington and Dr. Brian Showengerdt over a period of seven years at Furness's private research lab 'RATLab'.[8][9][10][11]
Visualant acquired TransTech Systems of Aurora, Oregon in 2010.[12] TransTech distributes security products and systems to security and law enforcement industries.[12]
In May 2012, Visualant entered into a joint development contract, and licensing agreement with Sumitomo Precision Products Co., Ltd. focusing on the commercialization of the SPM technology.[4][13] The following year, the United States Patent and Trademark Office granted its sixth Visualant a patent titled "Method, apparatus, and article to facilitate distributed evaluation of objects using electromagnetic energy."[14] Later in 2013, Visualant partnered with Intellectual Ventures (IV) to further the commercialization of Visualant's ChromaID technology and catalyze the development of further intellectual property through IV's 'Inventor Network'.[15]
Products[edit]
Visualant, Inc. offers the ChromaID Scanner Kit that includes the ChromaID Scanner and the necessary software (ChromaID Lab) to configure and operate the scanner from a PC. The kit also includes an SDK so developers can build their own applications using the technology.[16] The product consists of a hand-held scanner of LEDs that are emitted onto an object and measures the color variations reflected back. The ChromaID is produced from the data that is generated from this process and the associated ChromaID Lab software plots a chart showing the intensity of the light, the software then compares the result to a database of patterns.[8] This technology and product offer a wide variety of uses in industries in identification authentication, and diagnostics.[5]
Awards and recognition[edit]
In February 2013, Visualant won the Green Photonics category of the 2013 Prism Awards for Photonics Innovation for its ChromaID technology.[17]

Visualant, Incorporated develops a spectral matching technology using a patented ChromaID approach.[2][3] Founded in 1998, Visualant is a public company based in Seattle, Washington.[4] The ChromaID technology shines LED wavelengths or laser light onto a material and measures the intensity of the light that is reflected back..[5][6] The data collected can be used to determine what the material in question is by detecting slightest variations in the pattern of the material's reaction to the structured light.[7]

History[edit]
Visualant was founded in 1998 by Ron Erickson. The technology was originally developed by Professor Tom Furness University of Washington and Dr. Brian Showengerdt over a period of seven years at Furness's private research lab 'RATLab'.[8][9][10][11]
Visualant acquired TransTech Systems of Aurora, Oregon in 2010.[12] TransTech distributes security products and systems to security and law enforcement industries.[12]
In May 2012, Visualant entered into a joint development contract, and licensing agreement with Sumitomo Precision Products Co., Ltd. focusing on the commercialization of the SPM technology.[4][13] The following year, the United States Patent and Trademark Office granted its sixth Visualant a patent titled "Method, apparatus, and article to facilitate distributed evaluation of objects using electromagnetic energy."[14] Later in 2013, Visualant partnered with Intellectual Ventures (IV) to further the commercialization of Visualant's ChromaID technology and catalyze the development of further intellectual property through IV's 'Inventor Network'.[15]
Products[edit]
Visualant, Inc. offers the ChromaID Scanner Kit that includes the ChromaID Scanner and the necessary software (ChromaID Lab) to configure and operate the scanner from a PC. The kit also includes an SDK so developers can build their own applications using the technology.[16] The product consists of a hand-held scanner of LEDs that are emitted onto an object and measures the color variations reflected back. The ChromaID is produced from the data that is generated from this process and the associated ChromaID Lab software plots a chart showing the intensity of the light, the software then compares the result to a database of patterns.[8] This technology and product offer a wide variety of uses in industries in identification authentication, and diagnostics.[5]
Awards and recognition[edit]
In February 2013, Visualant won the Green Photonics category of the 2013 Prism Awards for Photonics Innovation for its ChromaID technology.[17]
