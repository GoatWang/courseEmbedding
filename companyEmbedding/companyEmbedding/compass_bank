HOUSTON, June 1, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- The BBVA Compass Foundation today announced a $50,000 donation to the American Red Cross' Central Texas Region, a $50,000 donation to the Texas Gulf Coast Region, and special product offers from BBVA Compass to help aid recovery efforts after heavy rainfall, thunderstorms, tornadoes and severe flooding forced evacuations and left thousands of Texans without electrical power across the state. 

"As our communities begin to rebuild their homes and property after the severe weather that has affected thousands of Texans across the state, we hope that these donations and special products will help ease some of the financial strain and hardships that some of our employees and customers are experiencing," said BBVA Compass Houston CEO Mark Montgomery.
The BBVA Compass Foundation's donation to the American Red Cross will help support overall response and relief efforts, including shelters' operating costs, meals, social services, financial assistance for affected families, neighborhood cleanups, and ongoing counseling and casework efforts to determine how many residents have lost their homes. More than 4,000 homes have been damaged by the severe storms in the Central Texas and Texas Gulf Coast regions, according to the latest assessment from the American Red Cross. The latest cost assessment for the American Red Cross to provide its disaster relief and recovery operations is more than $5 million statewide.   
BBVA Compass is also making limited-time offers available to consumer and small business clients, among them special loan and payment deferral programs, waived late fees and penalty-free CD withdrawals. The offers are available in designated counties, including Collin, Comal, Denton, Harris, Harrison, Hays, Hidalgo, Hood, Jasper, Johnson, Kendall, Nueces, Parker, Smith, Walker and Williamson. 
Components of the disaster-relief program, available in the affected areas, include:

Special rates and terms on consumer and small business loans 
Discounted rates on auto loans 
Discounted rates on home equity, construction and renovation loans and lines of credit 
Deferred payments on existing consumer and small business loans and credit cards 
Waived late fees 
Penalty-free CD withdrawals 
For more information on these offers, those affected should contact their local BBVA Compass branch. 

Applications for the limited-time offers may be submitted through July 31. All loans and lines of credit are subject to approval, including credit approval.

Loans | Compass Savings Bank































































headed in your directionVoice 412-824-1070Fax 412-824-3520 












 































Here are 6 reasons people borrow:To be able to drive: The automobile industry is known for high prices. If you need a car but you don’t have the cash on hand to buy a car, you can apply for a car loan.To buy a house: Getting a mortgage is one of the most important moments in someone’s life. If you want to buy a home, your best bet is to improve your personal finances and apply for a mortgage with a bank that understands your needs. You also need to save for a down payment which can take some time. So it is important to start managing your credit profile now.For DIY: Personal loans used to be popular options for people who wanted to do improvements on their homes. They have been replaced by Home Equity Loans. Personal loans can be used for any personal reason as long as your lender approves of it. Talk to our Loan Officer to find the best way to finance your dream. For Holidays: Many people have taken out loans to finance this period. The temptation to spend is everywhere from travelling to buying gifts for family and friends. You should try and save for holiday gift spending to avoid snowballing into debt.To widen monthly budgets: Payday loans and money advances are used by some people to help tide over their bills before payday. Payday loan usage has soared as the key way to help people sort out a few payments while they are waiting for their pay to come through. Relying on loans every month is not a good idea and payday loans and money advances should only be used in the short-term when a pressing financial need comes up. As a result, we do not offer payday loans.To save face from family and friends: Family and friends are two of the most common sources of cash for many people especially when times are hard. When you borrow money from a family member or a friend, you instantly change the dynamic of a relationship especially if you find that you cannot repay the money back on time. This is another key reason why many people turn to loans and credit to help them out with their financial problems instead of asking to borrow money from family and friends. Ultimately, borrowing from a responsible lender is better than putting your relationships with family and friends under strain.Talk with us. Let us help you find the loan product that works best for you.Types of LoansMortgages

Press Releases



Compass Bank Introduces New Brand - BBVA Compass
November 06, 2008


BIRMINGHAM, Ala., Nov. 6 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ --
Compass Bank today announced that it is launching its new brand, BBVA Compass, across its six-state "legacy" footprint, beginning in the bank's Colorado Springs, CO market and completing the transformation with its West Texas markets in the first quarter of 2009. The new brand is a result of Compass' year-long efforts to combine four of the BBVA Group's U.S. operating companies -- Compass Bank, State National Bank, Texas State Bank and LNB (formerly Laredo National Bank) -- under one enterprise. Compass Bank's brand change to BBVA Compass and new color scheme includes the replacement of all external and internal bank signage and new branding for http://www.compassbank.com, credit and check cards, ATM machines and other customer communications.
"Introducing the BBVA Compass brand and successfully integrating the four banks into Compass' operating systems and product platforms marks a significant step toward delivering on our vision of creating the leading financial services group in the Sunbelt region," said Jose María Garcia Meyer, BBVA Country Manager-U.S. and Chairman of Compass Bank. "Customers can look to these new BBVA Compass signs as a 'blending of the best' of the BBVA Group, an international financial leader with strength and stability, and Compass Bank, a strong local leader featuring innovative products and services for clients."
Compass plans to have all of its 579 branches and 734 ATMs re-branded by the end of first quarter 2009. The BBVA Compass brand was first introduced in August in several of Compass' new markets, including the Rio Grande Valley and East Texas, as Texas State Bank merged with Compass, completing the bank's second successful operating systems and product platforms conversion. Compass successfully converted State National Bank in March and will complete its final conversion in November when LNB adopts the BBVA Compass brand and implements its conversion to Compass' operating systems and product platforms.
The BBVA Compass brand also underscores BBVA's commitment to maintaining local leadership. Customers will see the same banking center managers, community banking leaders and have the same personal service they have come to expect from Compass Bank. At the same time, Compass' customers will have access to the full capabilities of the BBVA Group, a global financial services leader with more than 150 years of experience in delivering innovative products and exceptional customer service.
"The BBVA Compass brand is more than just a logo, it represents our ongoing commitment to our communities and the future of Compass Bank," said Gary Hegel, CEO of Compass Bank. "This new brand is a symbol of strength to those who desire the security of a financial institution strong enough to withstand the economic turmoil, yet diverse enough to meet their financial needs."
Compass ranks among the top 25 largest banks in the U.S. based on deposit market share and ranks among the largest banks in Texas (4th) and Alabama (3rd). The company has total assets of approximately $61.5 billion and operates 579 branches across a six state Sunbelt Region including: 312 in Texas, 92 in Alabama, 77 in Arizona, 44 in Florida, 33 in Colorado, and 21 in New Mexico.

HOUSTON, June 1, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- The BBVA Compass Foundation today announced a $50,000 donation to the American Red Cross' Central Texas Region, a $50,000 donation to the Texas Gulf Coast Region, and special product offers from BBVA Compass to help aid recovery efforts after heavy rainfall, thunderstorms, tornadoes and severe flooding forced evacuations and left thousands of Texans without electrical power across the state. 

"As our communities begin to rebuild their homes and property after the severe weather that has affected thousands of Texans across the state, we hope that these donations and special products will help ease some of the financial strain and hardships that some of our employees and customers are experiencing," said BBVA Compass Houston CEO Mark Montgomery.
The BBVA Compass Foundation's donation to the American Red Cross will help support overall response and relief efforts, including shelters' operating costs, meals, social services, financial assistance for affected families, neighborhood cleanups, and ongoing counseling and casework efforts to determine how many residents have lost their homes. More than 4,000 homes have been damaged by the severe storms in the Central Texas and Texas Gulf Coast regions, according to the latest assessment from the American Red Cross. The latest cost assessment for the American Red Cross to provide its disaster relief and recovery operations is more than $5 million statewide.   
BBVA Compass is also making limited-time offers available to consumer and small business clients, among them special loan and payment deferral programs, waived late fees and penalty-free CD withdrawals. The offers are available in designated counties, including Collin, Comal, Denton, Harris, Harrison, Hays, Hidalgo, Hood, Jasper, Johnson, Kendall, Nueces, Parker, Smith, Walker and Williamson. 
Components of the disaster-relief program, available in the affected areas, include:

Special rates and terms on consumer and small business loans 
Discounted rates on auto loans 
Discounted rates on home equity, construction and renovation loans and lines of credit 
Deferred payments on existing consumer and small business loans and credit cards 
Waived late fees 
Penalty-free CD withdrawals 
For more information on these offers, those affected should contact their local BBVA Compass branch. 

Applications for the limited-time offers may be submitted through July 31. All loans and lines of credit are subject to approval, including credit approval.
