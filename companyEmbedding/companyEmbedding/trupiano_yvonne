SpartanNash Hires New Chief Human Resources Officer




Yvonne Trupiano to join the company October 3, 2016






September 15, 2016 10:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time



GRAND RAPIDS, Mich.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--SpartanNash (Nasdaq: SPTN) is pleased to announce the appointment of 
      Yvonne S. Trupiano to the position of Senior Vice President, Chief Human 
      Resources Officer (CHRO), effective October 3, 2016. Ms. Trupiano will 
      assume the responsibilities of Jerry Jones, who is retiring from the 
      Company. Mr. Jones has led the Company’s Human Resources function since 
      2009.
    


      Ms. Trupiano will report directly to Dennis Eidson, Chief Executive 
      Officer and Chairman of the Board, and will be responsible for 
      developing, communicating and implementing the Company’s human resources 
      strategy. She will have responsibility for all aspects of the human 
      resources function, including: talent development, labor relations, 
      compensation and benefits, payroll, and HR operations, management and 
      development.
    

      Ms. Trupiano joins SpartanNash from Avis Budget Group, a global car 
      rental and car sharing supplier, where she most recently held the 
      position of Vice President, Human Resources. She has held a number of 
      leadership positions during her tenure at Avis Budget Group and played 
      key roles in that Company’s integration of new businesses, including the 
      2013 acquisitions of ZipCar and Payless Car Rental. As Vice President, 
      Human Resources, Ms. Trupiano served as the HR business partner to the 
      President of the Americas region ($7 billion revenue, 22,000 employees) 
      and was the senior HR leader to a team of 85 human resources 
      professionals who supported multiple banners in North and South America.
    

      “Yvonne’s extensive service leading a large, diverse, HR team will be a 
      tremendous asset to SpartanNash,” noted Eidson. “Yvonne’s success with 
      creating and implementing diversity and inclusion strategies to increase 
      female and veteran representation within operations, improving employee 
      satisfaction scores, and positioning the company as a Great Place to 
      Work by the Great Place to Work Institute align with our current 
      initiatives.” Eidson also noted that Yvonne’s extensive merger and 
      acquisition experience integrating teams, systems, and operations is 
      advantageous to SpartanNash, which is poised for growth.
    

      “We are excited to welcome Yvonne on board, but at the same time hate to 
      say good-bye to Jerry,” said Eidson. “His leadership throughout our 
      transformational merger in 2013 was critical to our integration. He also 
      played a key role in our search and selection process. Jerry has led by 
      example, serving on the board of directors of the Heart of West Michigan 
      United Way and serving as a strong proponent of our companywide 
      volunteer program and giving back to the communities we serve. We wish 
      him all the best as he looks forward to returning to his southern roots.”
