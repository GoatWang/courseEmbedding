(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 2016 Overview and Outlook IDEX is an applied solutions company specializing in fluid and metering technologies, health and science technologies, and fire, safety and other diversified products built to customers' specifications. IDEX's products are sold in niche markets to a wide range of industries throughout the world. Accordingly, IDEX's businesses are affected by levels of industrial activity and economic conditions in the U.S. and in other countries where it does business and by the relationship of the U.S. dollar to other currencies. Levels of capacity utilization and capital spending in certain industries and overall industrial activity are important factors that influence the demand for IDEX's products. The Company has three reportable business segments: Fluid & Metering Technologies, Health & Science Technologies and Fire & Safety/Diversified Products. Within our three reportable segments, the Company maintains thirteen platforms, where we focus on organic growth and strategic acquisitions. Each of our thirteen platforms is also a reporting unit, where we annually test for goodwill impairment. The Fluid & Metering Technologies segment contains the Energy (comprised of Corken, Faure Herman, Liquid Controls, SAMPI, and Toptech), Valves (comprised of Alfa Valvole, Richter, and Aegis), Water (comprised of Pulsafeeder, Knight, ADS, Trebor, and iPEK), Pumps (comprised of Viking and Warren Rupp), and Agriculture (comprised of Banjo) platforms. The Health & Science Technologies segment contains the Scientific Fluidics & Optics (comprised of Eastern Plastics, Rheodyne, Sapphire Engineering, Upchurch Scientific, ERC, CiDRA Precision Services, CVI Melles Griot, Semrock, and AT Films), Sealing Solutions (comprised of Precision Polymer Engineering, FTL Seals Technology, Novotema, and SFC Koenig), Gast, Micropump, and Material Processing Technologies (comprised of Quadro, Fitzpatrick, Microfluidics, and Matcon) platforms. The Fire & Safety/Diversified Products segment is comprised of the Fire & Safety (comprised of Class 1, Hale, Akron Brass, AWG Fittings, Godiva, Dinglee, Hurst Jaws of Life, Lukas, and Vetter), Band-It, and Dispensing platforms. The Fluid & Metering Technologies segment designs, produces and distributes positive displacement pumps, flow meters, valves, injectors, and other fluid-handling pump modules and systems and provides flow monitoring and other services for the food, chemical, general industrial, water & wastewater, agriculture and energy industries. The Health & Science Technologies segment designs, produces and distributes a wide range of precision fluidics, rotary lobe pumps, centrifugal and positive displacement pumps, roll compaction and drying systems used in beverage, food processing, pharmaceutical and cosmetics, pneumatic components and sealing solutions, including very high precision, low-flow rate pumping solutions required in analytical instrumentation, clinical diagnostics and drug discovery, high performance molded and extruded, biocompatible medical devices and implantables, air compressors used in medical, dental and industrial applications, optical components and coatings for applications in the fields of scientific research, defense, biotechnology, life sciences, aerospace, telecommunications and electronics manufacturing, laboratory and commercial equipment used in the production of micro and nano scale materials, precision photonic solutions used in life sciences, research and defense markets, and precision gear and peristaltic pump technologies that meet exacting original equipment manufacturer specifications. The Fire & Safety/Diversified Products segment produces firefighting pumps and controls, valves, monitors, nozzles, rescue tools, lifting bags and other components and systems for the fire and rescue industry, engineered stainless steel banding and clamping devices used in a variety of industrial and commercial applications, and precision equipment for dispensing, metering and mixing colorants and paints used in a variety of retail and commercial businesses around the world. Our 2016 financial results were as follows: Sales of $2.1 billion increased 5%, reflecting a 1% decrease in organic sales (excluding acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency translation), a 1% decrease due to foreign currency translation, and a 7% increase due to acquisitions/divestitures.   Operating income of $405.8 million and operating margin of 19.2% were down 6% and 220 basis points, respectively, from the prior year.   Net income decreased 4% to $271.1 million.   Diluted EPS of $3.53 decreased $0.09 or 2% compared to 2015.  Our 2016 financial results, adjusted for $3.7 million of restructuring costs, a $3.6 million pension settlement charge and a $22.3 million loss on sale of businesses, compared to our 2015 financial results adjusted for $11.2 million of restructuring costs and an $18.1 million gain on sale of a business are as follows (these non-GAAP measures have been reconciled to U.S. GAAP measures in Item 6, "Selected Financial Data"):  Table of Contents   Adjusted net income increased 4% to $288.4 million.   Adjusted EPS of $3.75 was 6% higher than prior year adjusted EPS of $3.55.  Overall, we remain cautious due to the uncertainty within the global economy and the global political environment and project 1 to 2 percent organic growth in 2017. We expect to deliver full year 2017 EPS of $3.87 to $3.95.  Results of Operations  The following is a discussion and analysis of our results of operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016. For purposes of this Item, reference is made to the Consolidated Statements of Operations in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." Segment operating income excludes unallocated corporate operating expenses. Management's primary measurements of segment performance are sales, operating income, and operating margin.  (In thousands) 2016 2015 Change Net sales $ 2,113,043 $ 2,020,668 5 % Operating income 405,801 431,738 (6 )% Operating margin 19.2 % 21.4 % (220 ) bps  Sales in 2016 were $2.1 billion, a 5% increase from last year.

Sales to customers outside the U.S. represented approximately 50% of total sales in both 2016 and 2015.  Table of Contents  During 2016, the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring expenses totaling $3.7 million as part of initiatives that support the implementation of key strategic efforts designed to facilitate long-term, sustainable growth through cost reduction actions primarily consisting of employee reductions and facility rationalization. In 2015, the Company recorded $11.2 million of restructuring expenses mainly attributable to employee severance from headcount reductions across all three segments and corporate.  (In thousands) 2016 2015 Change Net sales $ 849,101 $ 860,792 (1 )% Operating income 214,242 204,506 5 % Operating margin 25.2 % 23.8 % 140 bps  Sales of $849.1 million decreased $11.7 million, or 1%, in 2016 compared with 2015. This decrease reflected a 1% decline in organic sales, a 1% increase from acquisitions (Alfa Valvole - June 2015) and 1% of unfavorable foreign currency translation. In 2016, sales were flat domestically and decreased approximately 3% internationally. Sales to customers outside the U.S. were approximately 44% of total segment sales in both 2016 and 2015.  Table of Contents  Health & Science Technologies Segment (In thousands) 2016 2015 Change Net sales $ 744,809 $ 738,996 1 % Operating income 153,722 157,948 (3 )% Operating margin 20.6 % 21.4 % (80 ) bps  Sales of $744.8 million increased $5.8 million, or 1%, in 2016 compared with 2015. This increase reflected a 1% decrease in organic sales, a 3% increase from acquisitions / divestitures (Acquisitions: SFC Koenig - September 2016; CiDRA Precision Services - July 2015 and Novotema - May 2015. Divestitures: CVI Korea  (In thousands) 2016 2015 Change Net sales $ 520,009 $ 423,915 23 % Operating income 121,888 115,745 5 % Operating margin 23.4 % 27.3 % (390 ) bps  Sales of $520.0 million increased $96.1 million, or 23%, in 2016 compared with 2015. This increase reflected a 3% decline in organic sales, a 27% increase due to acquisitions (AWG Fittings - July 2016 and Akron Brass - March 2016) and 1% of unfavorable foreign currency translation. In 2016, sales increased 28% domestically and 18% internationally. Sales to customers outside the U.S. were approximately 51% of total segment sales in 2016 compared with 52% in 2015. Sales within our Dispensing platform increased year over year due to a strong Asian market and the overall strength of the X-Smart product sales, partially offset by the foreign currency impact caused by the strength of the U.S. dollar and challenges within the European markets. Sales decreased in our Band-It platform compared to 2015 as a result of declines in the oil & gas market, offset by strength in the transportation industry and the rebound of the European and Asian markets. Sales within our Fire & Safety platform increased compared to 2015 primarily due to the Akron Brass and AWG Fittings acquisitions as well as increased sales due to new product development, partially offset by project delays in Asia and large projects in Europe in 2015 which did not reoccur.  Table of Contents  Performance in 2015 Compared with 2014 (In thousands) 2015 2014 Change Net sales $ 2,020,668 $ 2,147,767 (6 )% Operating income 431,738 431,224 - % Operating margin 21.4 % 20.1 % 130 bps  Sales in 2015 were $2.0 billion, a 6% decrease from 2014. This decrease reflects a 4% decrease in organic sales, a 4% decrease from foreign currency translation and a 2% increase from acquisitions (CiDRA Precision Services - July 2015; Alfa Valvole - June 2015; Novotema - May 2015 and Aegis - April 2014). Sales to customers outside the U.S. represented approximately 50% of total sales in both 2015 and 2014.  (In thousands) 2015 2014 Change Net sales $ 860,792 $ 899,588 (4 )% Operating income 204,506 216,886 (6 )% Operating margin 23.8 % 24.1 % (30 ) bps  Sales of $860.8 million decreased $38.8 million, or 4%, in 2015 compared with 2014. This decrease reflected a 2% decline in organic sales, a 2% increase from acquisitions (Alfa Valvole - June 2015 and Aegis - April 2014) and 4% of unfavorable foreign currency translation. In 2015, sales decreased approximately 3% domestically and 5% internationally. Sales to customers outside the U.S. were approximately 44% of total segment sales in 2015, compared with 45% in 2014.  Table of Contents  Sales within our Energy platform decreased compared to 2014 primarily due to the fall in oil prices and the related delay in large capital projects in Europe and the Middle East. Sales within our Pumps platform (formerly Industrial) similarly decreased compared to 2014 due to the fall in oil & gas prices, but also due to the weakening of the North American industrial distribution market. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in European chemical project activity. Sales within our Agriculture platform decreased as OEM and after-market distribution sales fell significantly due to depressed commodity prices and lower farm incomes. The slight sales decrease in the Water platform was driven by weakness in North American industrial markets, offset by growth in the global municipal markets and share gains from new products. Sales in the Valves platform, which was created in the third quarter of 2015, increased as a result of the Alfa acquisition.  (In thousands) 2015 2014 Change Net sales $ 738,996 $ 752,021 (2 )% Operating income (loss) 157,948 152,999 3 % Operating margin 21.4 % 20.3 % 110 bps  Sales of $739.0 million decreased $13.0 million, or 2%, in 2015 compared with 2014. This decrease reflected a 1% decline in organic sales, a 2% increase from acquisitions (CiDRA Precision Services - July 2015 and Novotema - May 2015) and 3% unfavorable foreign currency translation. In 2015, sales decreased 3% domestically and 1% internationally. Sales to customers outside the U.S. were approximately 55% of total segment sales in 2015 compared with 54% in 2014. Sales within our Scientific Fluidics & Optics platform increased as demand from the core biotech, in-vitro diagnostic and analytical instrumentation markets grew and remained consistently strong through the year, partially offset by from slow demand in the industrial and laser optical end markets. Sales within our Material Processing Technologies platform decreased compared to 2014 due to softer orders in the first half of the year, as general spending on large capital projects declined. Sales within our Sealing Solutions platform increased compared to 2014 due to the acquisition of Novotema and strong growth in the semiconductor markets, partially offset by declines in the oil & gas market. Sales in our Gast platform decreased compared to 2014 due to softness in North American industrial distribution markets. Sales in our Micropump platform decreased compared to 2014 due to softness in Asian printing markets, and declines in the North American industrial distribution market.  (In thousands) 2015 2014 Change Net sales $ 423,915 $ 502,749 (16 )% Operating income 115,745 130,494 (11 )% Operating margin 27.3 % 26.0 % 130 bps  Sales of $423.9 million decreased $78.8 million, or 16%, in 2015 compared with 2014. This decrease reflected a 10% decline in organic sales and 6% unfavorable foreign currency translation. In 2015, sales decreased 12% domestically and 19% internationally. Sales to customers outside the U.S. were approximately 52% of total segment sales in 2015, compared with 54% in 2014.  Feb 23, 2017  (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved
