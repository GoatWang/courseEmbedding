ONEnergy 


































Our port facility operates around the clock, and we needed to upgrade security and light quality without disrupting operations.
ONEnergy retrofitted our facility without disruption and provided an intelligent lighting solution we can control from our smartphones. In providing a brighter facility, they saved us 90% on energy costs.
                            









I wanted to ensure our golf course provided world-class conditions on and off the course.
ONEnergy designed a customized LED lighting solution for our entire facility, from the putting greens to the pro shop. The ROI took less than one year and the retrofit has saved $29,000 yearly on energy costs.
                            









Unflattering fluorescent lighting in my clothing store was dissuading potential customers.
ONEnergy upgraded my business to LED lighting, which now floods the space with a natural quality of light, providing a much more flattering and inviting retail environment for mycustomers. 
                            









I wanted to provide my employees with a safer work environment.
ONEnergy evaluated our needs and provided an LED solution that increased security by providing a brighter, better quality of light in all areas, while simultaneously saving us 77% on energy costs. 
                            









I wanted to regulate the temperature in my store and better showcase our speciality wines.
ONEnergy devised an LED lighting solution that resulted in a brighter store with less glare obscuring our products. The temperature is also easy to regulate, which helps lengthen the shelf life of our products.
                            









I was spending thousands trying to offset the heat produced by outdated lighting in our refrigerated facility.
ONEnergy retrofitted our building with LEDs that work brilliantly in cooler temperatures, reducing our energy consumption by 92% and saving us over $75,000 in yearly energy and maintenance costs.
                            









Being in the recycling business, we needed our workplace to reflect our environmental ideologies.
ONEnergy installed LEDs with sensors and dimmers to help us capitalize on the large amount of natural light we receive, resulting in an 87% energy reduction, and more money for us to invest in our future.
