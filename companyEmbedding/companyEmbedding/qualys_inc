			Web App Security Solutions: Web App Scanning | Web App Firewall | Malware Detection



				Web applications live outside of the traditional network perimeter. If they're not properly secured, they offer hackers an attractive attack surface and a convenient entry point into your IT environment.
			

				Due to poor development and testing practices, web apps are often plagued with security vulnerabilities and configuration gaps. When breached, web apps can expose massive amounts of confidential business data.
			



Boost web app security with Qualys'
			
			cloud-based, integrated solutions
		


				With Qualys, you automate web app security, shield web servers from hackers, rid your websites from malware and make the software development lifecycle more secure.
			









					Qualys Web Application Scanning (WAS) crawls and tests custom web applications to identify vulnerabilities, while its extensive APIs let you integrate scan data with other security systems.
				








					Qualys Web Application Firewall (WAF) blocks attacks on web server vulnerabilities, and lets you control where and when your applications are accessed.
				








					Qualys Malware Detection (MD) proactively scans an organization’s customer-facing websites for infections, triggers automated alerts and generates detailed reports.
				




				As part of the integrated security and compliance Qualys Cloud Platform, these three apps are hosted and maintained by Qualys, can be immediately deployed, operate continuously, scale globally and offer users centralized management.
			








					WAS Features
				

					Discover
				

					WAS finds and catalogs all web apps in your network, including new and unknown ones, and gives you quick and comprehensive visibility of their vulnerabilities.
				

					Assess
				

					WAS' dynamic deep scanning covers all apps on your perimeter, internal networks, remote and mobile devices, and public cloud instances. Authenticated and complex scans are supported.
				

					Prioritize
				

					WAS offer highly customized reporting capabilities with a focus on OWASP’s Top 10 risks, while its unified, interactive dashboard gives you an at-a-glance view of your web app security.

Watch video







					WAF Features
				

					Integrated
				

					WAF is tightly integrated with WAS, so you have a single, interactive console for web app vulnerability detection (WAS) and rapid protection from attacks (WAF).
				

					Cloud Agility
				

					With no special hardware to buy nor maintain, WAF can be quickly deployed for apps on public or private clouds, and scaled seamlessly as new apps are added.
				

					Protection
				

					WAF lets you create “virtual patch” rules in response to WAS findings, rapidly resolve false positives and customize security rules for your environment.

Watch video













					MD Features
				

					Scalable Scanning
				

					Included with WAS but also available standalone, MD scans an organization's websites, and identifies, reports and removes infections, including zero-day threats via behavioral analysis.
				

					Interactive Dashboard and Reports
				

					A dashboard displays scan activity, like infected pages and trends, and remediation can be started from its interface. Reports can be mined for granular details and securely distributed.
				

					Centralized Management
				

					MD lets you create multiple user-defined roles with different permission levels, while tags let you categorize assets by criteria such as organizational groups and geography.

Key Features









								User-friendly, guided approach
							

PCI streamlines and walks you through the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard compliance process. With tips, a friendly, intuitive interface, online help and 24/7 Qualys email and phone support, PCI lets you protect cardholder information from breaches. No need to hire costly experts to achieve compliance.











								Streamlined scanning and remediation
							

PCI scans all Internet-facing networks and systems with Six Sigma (99.9996%) accuracy, generates easy to use reports and provides detailed patching instructions for each vulnerability discovered. That way, you’ll make sure you’re meeting the PCI DSS requirements for protecting the collection, storage, processing and transmission of cardholder data.











								Support for web app requirement
							

PCI also covers the standard’s requirement for maintaining secure web applications. Its Web Application Scanning module automates the evaluation of web apps during and after development, ensuring they’re built and maintained securely. The module conducts authenticated and unauthenticated scans within any web app type — custom-built in house, or commercial.











								Automated report submission
							

An auto-submission feature completes the compliance process once you’re finished with remediation. Enter your bank and merchant IDs in your account settings to activate this feature. PCI will send the compliance status report directly to the acquiring banks. You can also download PCI compliance reports in PDF.












					Achieve PCI compliance and secure your network
				


As an Approved Scanning Vendor (ASV), Qualys has been authorized by the PCI Security Standards Council to conduct the quarterly scans required to show compliance with PCI DSS. The cloud-based Qualys PCI solution helps you achieve compliance via a streamlined process that also gives you assurance your network is secure.



Benefit from the ASV requirements that Qualys PCI fulfills, including: Disruption-free: When conducting a scan, Qualys PCI doesn’t interfere with the cardholder data systemNo stealth software installations: Qualys PCI will never install any software on your systems without your knowledge and pre-approvalNo dangerous tests: Qualys PCI will not conduct tests that overload your systems or cause an outageConforming reports: Qualys PCI produces reports that conform to the standard’s requirements

Follow an easy step-by-step approach and intuitive compliance tips in a user-friendly interface

Automatically complete the required quarterly scans, and also scan as often as you like on an ad hoc manner, for PCI compliance and for identifying and remediating vulnerabilities as soon as they appear in your network

Scan your network in segments and remediate/re-scan for vulnerabilities on target IPs. No need to scan your entire network

Leverage 24/7 online help and email/telephone support for understanding and pursuing compliance

Monitor all assets on premises and in private, public or hybrid clouds 

Scan web apps during and after development to ensure they’re built and maintained securely



















					Quickly eliminate security threats with detailed remediation instructions
				


PCI DSS requires businesses to perform a network security scan every 90 days on all Internet-facing networks and systems in accordance with a defined set of procedures. To achieve compliance, businesses must identify and remediate all critical vulnerabilities detected during the scan. Qualys PCI:



Automates and greatly simplifies scanning and remediation

Provides easy-to-use reporting of vulnerabilities that will cause you to fail PCI DSS

Uses the Qualys Cloud Platform to accurately scan vulnerabilities

Provides detailed instructions for each detected vulnerability, with links to verified patches for rapid remediation



















					Generate reports
				


Qualys PCI generates two PCI network reports that are similar but intended for different purposes: One designed to offer proof of compliance, and the other to serve as a remediation guide.



Generates PCI Executive Report for submitting to the acquiring bank to document PCI compliance. This report provides summary level information only

Generates PCI Technical Report for identifying vulnerabilities and prioritizing remediation. This report includes technical details to assist with remediation

Includes in the reports an overall PCI compliance status of “passed” or “failed” An overall PCI compliance status of “passed” indicates that all hosts in the report passed the PCI DSS compliance standards set by the PCI Council. A host compliance status is provided for each host. A PCI compliance status of “passed” for a single host/IP indicates that no vulnerabilities or potential vulnerabilities were detected on the host.If you fail the assessment, you can view a list of detected vulnerabilities and potential vulnerabilities, including those that must be fixed to obtain compliance as well as vulnerabilities that we recommend that you fix. View detailed remediation information.



















					Auto-submit compliance status directly to acquiring bank
				


Once you have met the validation actions, the Qualys PCI “auto-submission” feature completes the compliance process.



Automatically submits compliance status directly to your acquiring banks

Allows you to download PCI compliance reports in PDF to submit to your acquiring bank or to assist in remediation efforts



















				Powered by the Qualys Cloud Platform

With Asset Inventory, you can detect a variety of issues, such as unauthorized software, or IT policy violations like the disabling of a personal firewall or the lowering of an app’s security settings.











								CMDB integration
							

A certified application synchronizes Qualys Asset Inventory data with ServiceNow’s Configuration Management system. Device changes are immediately transmitted to the Qualys Cloud Platform and then synchronized with ServiceNow. For customers, this means an end to unidentified and misclassified assets, and to data update delays, all of which increase chances of breaches.











								Real-time monitoring with Cloud Agents
							

In addition to Qualys network scanners, Asset Inventory leverages our Cloud Agents, which are lightweight, self-updating and run in the background. They continuously assess the compliance and security status of assets they reside on, including intermittently connected ones, without needing scan windows nor credential management.












					Access a complete, searchable IT asset inventory
				


You can’t protect – nor defend yourself from – what you don’t know is in your network, like unapproved devices and unauthorized software. Qualys gives you full horizontal visibility of all hardware and software, scaling up to millions of assets – on premises, in cloud instances and mobile endpoints.



Continuously collects and feeds system, compliance, and security data from IT assets into the Qualys Cloud Platform for aggregation, indexing, correlation and analysis

Covers all bases with a variety of data discovery and collection sensors, such as: Physical and virtual appliances that scan IT assets on premises, in private clouds, or in virtualized environmentsCloud appliances that remotely scan your IaaS and PaaS instances in commercial cloud platformsLightweight, all-purpose Cloud Agents that continuously monitor assets they’re installed on, such as laptops

Has a powerful search engine that lets you craft complex queries combining multiple asset criteria and that returns results instantly, so in two seconds you can find out: How many PCs from a particular manufacturer do we have in our environment?Which of our IT assets are impacted by a specific vulnerability?Which servers are running an OS that its vendor recently stopped supporting?Which IT assets have a particular piece of software installed?How many Lenovo laptops running the latest version of Windows 10 and located in my India office have a particular vulnerability?



















					Get a granular, deep view into asset components
				


Qualys gives you deep visibility into the assets, granting you a detailed, multidimensional view of each one that encompasses both its IT and security data. You can flag issues such as configuration problems, security risks, IT policy violations and regulatory non-compliance with an asset profile that includes a wealth of data, such as:



Hardware specs

Installed software, including applications, OS, drivers, utilities and plug-ins

Network connections

Approved users, and usage logs

Installed patches

Open vulnerabilities

Services, file systems, running processes and registry keys

Virtualized environment details, such as the constant proliferation of internal and external images

Geographic location and time zone

IT policy compliance settings



















					Get real-time, continuous inventory updates with Qualys Cloud Agents
				


An IT asset inventory loses its value if its data gets stale. New vulnerabilities are disclosed every day. Old ones can suddenly become more dangerous. A laptop can quickly go from secure to compromised. Qualys complements its physical, virtual and cloud scanners with its revolutionary Cloud Agents, which:



Are lightweight and, after the initial comprehensive asset assessment, only report detected changes, so they have a minimal impact on systems and networks

Run in the background and update themselves

Continuously assess the asset’s security and compliance status

Can be installed in assets that are on premises, in cloud instances and mobile endpoints

Are deployed via a flexible, compact agent installer



















					Highlight and rank criticality of assets
				


Not all assets carry the same weight within your organization. Asset Inventory lets you tag your assets, so you put relevant labels on them in the inventory and organize them in multiple ways. For example, you can specify which assets fall within the scope of PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) compliance.



Supports tagging of assets for easy labeling and identification, instantly adding business context to your inventory

Gives you the ability to apply tags manually or configure rules and parameters for automatic tagging

Supports creating any kind or any number of hierarchies, and giving assets as many tags as you want

Calculates criticality based on an asset’s aggregated and consolidated system, security, and compliance data, as well as established hierarchies and priorities



















					Visualize with customizable dashboards and powerful reports
				


It’s essential to graphically display and document IT inventory data so that you can act on insights and prevent and address threats. Asset Inventory’s interactive, customizable dashboard and powerful reporting capabilities let you visualize and share the security, configuration and compliance status of IT assets.



Leverages robust search engine to let you turn queries about IT assets into dashboard widgets updated in real time, so you don’t have to manually run a frequent query

Displays widget data in various ways using graphs, tables and charts

Lets you establish thresholds and alerts you when they’ve been reached, for example, by changing a widget’s background color from green to red

Allow you to create different dashboards and reports tailored for different purposes and users, such as InfoSec pros, compliance/risk managers, and CSOs



















					Integrate with your CMDB
				


IT asset inventory solutions must link up with your CMDB (configuration management database) and continuously feed it fresh, detailed data. That way, the CMDB can better illustrate and map the relationships, connections, hierarchies and dependencies among IT assets. The Qualys App for ServiceNow CMDB syncs information about assets Qualys discovers into ServiceNow.



Allows IT departments to be more effective at a variety of critical tasks, such as change management, service requests, incident response, system repair and impact analysis

Eliminates the need for IT staffers to manually update the CMDB with granular system, security and compliance data on new and changed assets across an IT environment

Supports flexible configuration for multiple Qualys accounts/API sources and synchronization schedules

As required by ServiceNow, stages changes to the ServiceNow CMDB for user approval before writing them to the CMDB

Features preconfigured table transform maps for open ports, assets, network interfaces, software, processors and volumes, as well as preconfigured reports



















				Powered by the Qualys Cloud Platform

Automate Host Discovery with Asset Tagging


								Posted
								by Parag Baxi								in Qualys Technology								on April 30, 2013							

Let’s assume you know where every host in your environment is. Wasn’t that a nice thought? The reality is probably that your environment is constantly changing. Knowing is half the battle, so performing this network reconnaissance is essential to defending it.
Tag, you’re mapped!
A common use case for performing host discovery is to focus scans against certain operating systems. This can be done a number of ways in QualysGuard, historically via maps or light scans followed by a manual workflow. Today, QualysGuard’s asset tagging can be leveraged to automate this very process. By dynamically tagging hosts by their operating system, one can split up scanning into the following:

Frequent light scans that update QualysGuard with the current mapping of your network via dynamic asset tags.
Targeted complete scans against tags which represent hosts of interest.

We step through how to set up your QualysGuard to do exactly this below.

How to Scan Across an Air Gap with QualysGuard


								Posted
								by Eric Perraudeau								in Qualys Technology								on April 10, 2013							

An air gap network, sometimes called an isolated network, is a set of systems that are intentionally isolated from the Internet or other networks for increased security. If there is an air gap, i.e. no physical connection between your systems and unsecured networks or the Internet, then you have better protection against data leakage or intrusion.
Air gap networks are most common in production or manufacturing environments, such as nuclear power plants or where SCADA-type systems are installed; in military or government organizations; and in sensitive financial applications like stock exchanges. Despite the air gap, these environments still can require security audits to ensure that other defense-in-depth controls are in place and working properly. For example, it is believed that the well-known Stuxnet virus entered the systems via a USB stick, showing how an air gap is not a foolproof security measure. In these cases, Qualys sees demand from our customers for a QualysGuard scan across the air gap.

Continuously Monitor Vulnerability Remediation Performance Across your Organization with QualysGuard v7.8 Vulnerability Scorecards


								Posted
								by Eric Perraudeau								in Qualys Technology								on February 25, 2013							

With QualysGuard 7.8, customers can now create new Vulnerability Scorecard Reports and set remediation goals to measure and monitor the performance of the teams in charge of fixing vulnerabilities in their companies. Enhancements to the Vulnerability Scorecard Reports will help security professionals better monitor the progress of their vulnerability remediation process.
In addition, Dynamic Asset Tagging and Management, which automatically identifies, categorizes and manages large numbers of assets in highly dynamic IT environments, is now integrated with Vulnerability Scorecard Reports. This integration gives security managers and executives always up-to-date reports that measure the number of vulnerable hosts per business unit against a list of vulnerabilities that represent the most important security risks.
These reports also display the groups of assets, or business units, that are meeting their goals in term of fixing these vulnerabilities. Furthermore, Vulnerability Scorecard Reports provide additional vulnerability management metrics and statistics, giving managers and unit managers more visibility into the efficiency of fixing critical and important vulnerabilities that expose their business to IT risks.
The Vulnerability Scorecard Reports offer these new capabilities:

Customizable Business Risk Goals represent the maximum allowed percentage of vulnerable hosts per asset tag or asset group.



Support for Vulnerability Search Lists: search lists can be used as a set of vulnerabilities that must be fixed according to their security risk, and the scorecards will measure the remediation progress and report the entities that have met their goal.


Breakdown of Vulnerabilities per Asset Tag and Asset Group organizes assets by business units, technology, or other organizational entities.



Number of New, Active, Fixed and Re-Opened Vulnerabilities gives insight into vulnerability scanning and remediation performance.



Number of Vulnerabilities by Age shows the number vulnerabilities that are less than one month, two months or three months old.



Number of Vulnerabilities by Type shows the breakdown of confirmed vulnerabilities versus potential vulnerabilities.



Vulnerability Scorecards can be scheduled on a daily, weekly or monthly basis to continuously monitor remediation progress.
Vulnerability Scorecards can be exported in CSV format automatically via the API or manually in the UI, for easy integration into external security performance dashboards.

Announcing WAS 3.0 with Malware Detection and Burp Suite Integration


								Posted
								by WillB								in Qualys Technology								on February 25, 2013							

In the last 10 years hackers have routinely taken advantage of web application vulnerabilities to successfully breach organizations. During that time there has also been an increase in the use of malware hosted on websites to infect unsuspecting users. Many times a vulnerability in a website is exploited to setup the malware that a legitimate website may then deliver. The relationship between website vulnerabilities and malware is one that is likely to continue to increase. The Verizon 2012 Data Breach Investigation Report notes: “Out of the 855 incidents this year, 81% leveraged hacking, 69% included malware, and an impressive 61% of all breaches featured a combination of hacking techniques and malware.“  The combination of threats presents organizations with a new challenge when trying to identify both web application vulnerabilities and malware that may exist on their sites.
WAS 3.0 Now Includes Malware Detection
In announcing QualysGuard WAS 3.0, organizations now have away to address the need to detect not only web application vulnerabilities, but also malware that may infect these same web properties.  Qualys has offered the Malware Detection Service as both a freemium solution for individuals and as an Enterprise Edition for larger organizations that need to protect a large number of websites. With WAS 3.0, Qualys has integrated this malware detection capability into the WAS solution to make it easy for organizations to configure both types of scans from WAS. Although the services are integrated, the way the scanning is executed and the threats that are identified by vulnerability scanning and malware detection are very different. Now that we’ve outlined the integration at a high level, lets go into a little more detail about how each type of scanning is performed, and how they are integrated in WAS 3.0.
Malware Detection Dashboard
Advanced Detection Methods
QualysGuard WAS works by interacting with a web application or website just as a user would, but does so in a fully automated way. The WAS scanner will request pages, login and follow links to new pages, posting forms as it goes. While interacting with the site, WAS injects hostile payloads and then observes how the web application responds. If the web application responds in a given way, WAS can determine that the application is vulnerable to the specific attack used. This is the same type of action that a penetration tester or malicious hacker would use to discover these vulnerabilities, but it is done in an automated way that takes a fraction of the time that it does for a human. This makes the automated scanning far more cost effective.
The Malware Detection Service (MDS) takes a different approach to detection. While MDS also automatically interacts with the site as a user would, navigating and following links, it uses a much different technique to detect malware.  MDS primarily uses Behavioral Analysis to identify when a website is infected with malware. MDS actually interacts with websites using an instrumented vulnerable browser hosted on a virtual machine. The virtual machine is created on the fly when the scan is requested. The service then navigates the site automatically, and by observing the behavior of the system the web browser is hosted on via the instrumentation, the service can detect when activities associated with malware take place. So instead of looking for something specific in the content itself, it is instead looking for what the browser and host do when pages are loaded. Behavioral analysis is superior in many ways to traditional malware detection methods because it can identify even zero-day malware that has not yet been analyzed to create a detection signature.
Malware Scan Report
Look for Malware Close to Home
Now that we have discussed how each service works and the differences in their detection techniques, we can discuss some other differences in web application vulnerability testing and malware detection.  While web application vulnerabilities can be expected in both internal and external web applications, website malware is typically found only on Internet facing web applications. This is because malware distributors want to infect as many users as possible, so hosting malware on sites that have the most exposure is the most effective approach. Malware is also typically not likely to be distributed evenly on websites. Unlike vulnerabilities, which are usually distributed throughout a web application because they are unintentional, malware is usually found on pages that are closer to the home page for the site. This is also to take advantage of the traffic patterns of users that will typically be heavier in the pages that are the fewest clicks away from the default for the site. So while WAS will scan a large number of pages to ensure it is testing all the relevant functions thatmay be vulnerable, MDS will seek to test just the unauthenticated pages that are closest to the default page for a site, where malware is most likely to be found. 
Another difference between the services that is important to note is the impact. While WAS is actively testing websites by injecting payloads and therefore usually requires advanced notice or scheduling in a maintenance window for production sites, the MDS service is purely observational and does not have any more impact on a site than a normal user would. This allows MDS to be run more often and without the notification that is typically required for running a vulnerability scan.
Malware Threat Detail
To bring these two services together, Qualys has added the ability to configure malware scanning for external web applications that are licensed in QualysGuard WAS. When an Internet accessible web application is being setup in WAS, the user will now have the option to indicate that they would like it to be scanned for malware. This will setup a daily scheduled malware scan for the site. If any malware is discovered the MDS service notifies the subscription owner with an email outlining the issue. Users can login to QualysGuard to see more details if needed.  So now organizations have an easy way to combine Web ApplicationScanning and Malware Detection to ensure that their Internet facing websites are free from web application vulnerabilities and malware.
Burp Suite Professional Integration
Last but not least, QualysGuard WAS 3.0 also introduces a first in a series of integrations with attack proxy tools used primarily to conduct more advanced manual application penetration and validation testing. While WAS is designed to be fully automated and scalable and is appropriate for the security testing requirements of the majority of applications, there are some web applications that require higher levels of assurance. These applications typically require both automated scanning as well as manual penetration testing activities. In most cases, web application penetration testing is primarily conducted with the use of attack proxy tools such as Burp Suite. Attack proxies provide a high level of control that helps to facilitate the depth of testing when it is required. Recognizing that there is a place for both automated scanning and attack proxies, Qualys is moving to combine the best of both approaches by integrating attack proxy tools, enabling customers to benefit from highly automated and scalable scanning while at the same time having access to manual tools when additional exploitation or risk evaluation is required. 
QualysGuard WAS 3.0 takes the first step in this evolution by integrating the scan results from Burp Suite Professional (BSP). BSP is a tool that combines many different interactive testing capabilities with scanning. Testers who use BSP can scan individual pages as they navigate a web application and discover vulnerabilities as they do so.  But BSP is primarily intended for use by a single user. There is no centralized storage for results that would allow them to be shared by multiple users, or to be tracked and trended over time. Qualys seeks to overcome this limitation by providing a way to import the BSP scanner findings. This gives organizations a way to store the findings discovered in the BSP scanner with those discovered by QualysGuard WAS.  
Upcoming versions of QualysGuard WAS are planned to extend the integration with BSP and other attack proxies by supporting the ability to define vulnerabilities that are discovered through manual testing with attack proxies and storing these along with the WAS automated findings. This will provide organizations a way to store and manage all the web application testing data together on one platform.  Qualys will also seek to send http request information directly to the proxy that was used by WAS to identify a specific vulnerability. This will help penetration testers who use attack proxies to more fully explore the level of risk that may be associated with a specific vulnerability.
As you can tell, QualysGuard WAS 3.0 is a major release with a lot of new capabilities that will help organizations better combat the growing threats to their web applications. We’re excited by the new WAS 3.0 and we look forward to getting it into your hands.

Add Pen Testing to Web App Scanning for More Security


								Posted
								by WillB								in Qualys Technology								on February 13, 2013							

While organizations increasingly adopt web applications to work and conduct business online, they often struggle to keep them secure and to protect critical business and customer data. Recent studies confirm that attackers are increasingly targeting web applications to breach the security defenses of organizations. The Verizon 2012 Data Breach Investigation report indicates that for large organizations, 54% of the hacking vectors for the investigated breaches were associated with web applications. But as the problem has grown, so too has the difficulty in hiring and retaining the highly skilled security professionals needed to ensure an organization has identified all the vulnerabilities that may be present in their mission critical web applications.
Some of this pressure has been absorbed by the emergence of highly automated web application vulnerability scanners such as QualysGuard WAS. These vulnerability scanners provide the ability to assess web applications in an automated way that reduces the need for trained security professionals and provides broad detection coverage of many of the most significant web application vulnerabilities, such as those identified by the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Top 10 including Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Automated scanning for these types of vulnerabilities is fast and accurate because the scanner is very good at injecting certain attack payloads and then checking for specific feedback in the application response. In the vast majority of cases, it is easy for the scanner to determine from the response if the application is vulnerable. Automated scanning is much more scalable and cost effective for identifying these security vulnerabilities than using trained security personnel, and as such it can also be used to provide continuous monitoring.
For high-risk applications, however, automated scanning may not be sufficient. There are a number of web application vulnerabilities and business logic security flaws that can only reliably be identified by a trained security professional. One example is access control testing. It is very difficult if not impossible for an automated scanner to identify when an application is vulnerable to vertical or horizontal privilege escalation. Vertical privilege escalation (or privilege elevation) allows a user who has a role with lower privileges to gain access to functionality that should be reserved for users with higher privileges. If an attacker can take advantage of a vulnerability to gain access to this higher privilege functionality, they have effectively moved up the vertical privilege ranking. 
An example is an ordinary web commerce user who is able to gain access administrative access and lower prices on the web store. Horizontal privilege escalation is when a user who is in the same role as a second user may be able to access or act on data that should be not be available to the first user. In this case, the user has not gained access to additional functionality but may have acted on data that should not have been accessed. An example of this would be a web commerce user who accesses another user of the web store and orders products to be sent to his/her address of choice. Automated testing for these types of security flaws is difficult and can lead to an unreasonable number of false positives. The only effective way to test for these types of security vulnerabilities is to use trained web application security testers.
Unfortunately, hiring and retaining these security professionals is difficult and expensive.  Even if an organization has web application penetration testing staff, the uneven demand for testing makes management difficult. Spikes in the need for security assessments can easily overwhelm the staff, while at other times there may not be enough testing activity to keep these specialized professionals engaged. This makes it difficult for most organizations to retain this function over the long term.
To address these challenges, organizations need an approach that combines the fast, cost-effective automated vulnerability scanning with highly trained security professionals who are equipped with the best tools.  This gives organizations the best blend of cost-effective automated scanning for all applications with the additional depth of testing required for those mission critical applications that require an additional level of security assurance.
Fig 1: Penetration Testing Steps
To create this service, iViZ Security seamlessly integrated QualysGuard WAS into its cloud portal via the powerful WAS Application Programming Interface (API). The REST-based QualysGuard WAS API enables customers and partners to conduct all the activities needed to setup web application configurations, schedule scans, and retrieve scan results. iViZ incorporated the WAS automated scanning capability with the API and created a workflow that allows their trained security professionals to confirm identified vulnerabilities for the customer. iViZ also goes a step above by performing business logic testing, manual exploitation and proof of exploitation with their Premium service for web applications that require a higher level of assurance.
Fig 2: Example Report Showing Penetration Testing Results
QualysGuard WAS has always been a great way for organizations to identify web application vulnerabilities through highly automated scanning. With the iViZ partnership, QualysGuard WAS can now also identify vulnerabilities for organizations that need the additional security assurance of a web application penetration test.

Automatic Scanning is now part of BrowserCheck Business Edition


								Posted
								by Jim Fulton								in Qualys Technology								on December 4, 2012							

Qualys BrowserCheck (www.qualys.com/browsercheck), our free “online checkup” service, now makes it easier for individuals and businesses to know whether their computers are up-to-date and safe for surfing the web.
With BrowserCheck, not only can you see whether or not your browsers and plugins are current with vendors’ latest releases, now you can also check your Windows PCs for any missing Microsoft Security Updates. In addition, businesses can have this scanning happen automatically, without any user intervention. 
IT administrators can now use the enhanced web console in BrowserCheck Business Edition to:

Set how often users’ machines are automatically scanned (such as daily, weekly, or monthly).
Get easy instructions for connecting users’ computers to BrowserCheck.
Continuously track which browsers and plugins are installed on each machine.
Verify that crucial OS security settings are enabled and that OS security updates are being received.
View at-a-glance dashboards and drill down into per-machine status.

BrowserCheck End User Enhancements
Users who visit BrowserCheck directly will now see:
Advanced Scanning for missing Microsoft Windows Security Updates. This release provides a simpler way for users on Windows PCs to choose how deeply they would like their computers to be scanned. Instead of having to pick among specific scanning features, users now can simply select a type of scan from a drop-down menu:

Basic– Scan just the browser that is currently being used and its plugins. This is the default type of scan and is like the scan done on non-Windows platforms which can’t use the BrowserCheck plugin. Previously, this was performed when none of the “Scan Options” check boxes were selected.
Intermediate– Scan all browsers installed on this PC as well as their associated plugins (even ones that are disabled). This also checks whether important OS settings are enabled, such as anti-virus, firewall, Windows Update and DNS-changer malware. In the previous release, this was performed when both of the “Scan Options” check boxes were selected.
Advanced (new in this release) – In addition to the checks listed above, this option causes BrowserCheck to identify any missing Microsoft Windows security updates. This is very powerful, but may take several minutes to perform.


BrowserCheck Business Edition Enhancements
IT administrators get several new features in BrowserCheck Business Edition:
Automated scanning. The web-based management console provided by BrowserCheck Business Edition now gives IT administrators the ability to have corporate PCs scanned every day, week or month. Users on PCs no longer have to manually revisit browsercheck.qualys.com; the BrowserCheck plugin will automatically re-scan their computer at the appropriate time. Note that the BrowserCheck plugin is still very lightweight; it only runs when the user’s browser is open, unlike heavyweight agents that run in the background all the time. This approach gives administrators an efficient, reliable way to keep track of what’s installed on each machine and whether it’s still current with vendors’ releases – without interrupting the user. 

Easier-to-use lists of scans. The Scans tab now follows the layout used in the Assets tab, making it easier for administrators to drill down into specific scans done on specific machines.
Faster. Switching among different tabs to examine data in different ways is now significantly faster than before.
Give it a try
If you haven’t already used BrowserCheck, go to www.qualys.com/browsercheck to try it yourself or sign up for a free BrowserCheck Business Edition account.

History[edit]
Qualys was founded in 1999. The company launched QualysGuard in December 2000, making Qualys one of the first entrants in the vulnerability management market.[11] The QualysGuard Intranet Scanner was released in 2002 to automatically scan corporate LANs for vulnerabilities and search for an available patch.[12] The following year, Qualys released FreeMap, a web-based tool for scanning, mapping and identifying possible security holes within networks connected to the Internet.[13]
In 2005, Qualys extended its QualysGuard product line. In 2008, Qualys introduced QualysGuard Policy Compliance, which extended the platform’s global scanning capabilities to collect IT compliance data across the organization and map this information into policies to document compliance for auditing purposes.[14] Qualys also released a service for web application scanning named QualysGuard Web Application Scanning (WAS). In 2010, at the RSA Conference USA, Qualys announced QualysGuard Malware Detection Service, a new service designed to scan and identify malware on web sites.[15] It also announced the Qualys SECURE Seal, which allows websites to show visitors that it has passed security scans.[16]
In July 2010, Qualys announced Qualys BrowserCheck, a service for checking web browsers and plug-ins for security vulnerabilities.[17] At RSA Conference 2011, Qualys launched a new open source web application firewall project, IronBee,[18] led by Ivan Ristic, the creator of ModSecurity and a director of engineering at Qualys.[19] At the RSA Conference in 2012, Qualys introduced updates to the QualysGuard Cloud Platform, which extended its capabilities to help customers improve the security of their IT systems and applications, further automate their compliance initiatives for IT-GRC, and provide online protection against cyber-attacks while reducing operational costs and increasing the efficiency of their security programs.[20]
Qualys went public on NASDAQ with the symbol QLYS on September 28, 2012, raising net proceeds of $87.5 million.[3][21] At the 2014 RSA Conference, Qualys announced general availability of its QualyGuard Web Application Firewall (WAF), which provides protection for websites running on Amazon EC2 and on-premises, as well as a new Continuous Monitoring solution and free Top 4 Security Controls service.[10][22] In 2015, the company released 2.0 of its WAF software which included virtual patching and customizable event responses.[23] That same year, Qualys also released an IT security and compliance solution called Cloud Agent Platform.[24][25] In August 2015, the company released a free asset management service, Qualys AssetView, that allowed organizations to keep inventory of computers and their software.[26][27]
In February 2016, Qualys released ThreatPROTECT, a vulnerability detection service for its cloud-based platform.[28]The company received full certification for its Configuration Management Databases (CMDBs) App for ServiceNow, allowing the app to be integrated into ServiceNow's system in March 2016.[29] In July 2016, it was announced that Qualys would integrate with Microsoft Azure Security Center.[30]

Qualys Expands QualysGuard PCI Cloud Platform for New Internal Scanning Requirements of PCI DSS 6.2


								Posted
								by qualys								in Qualys News								on October 11, 2012							

				Qualys today announced that it has expanded QualysGuard PCI to assist organizations of all sizes to meet Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standards (DSS), including new internal scanning requirements. The solution, used by thousands of businesses, online merchants and Member Service Providers, now includes workflows for risk ranking and reporting on internal vulnerabilities, enabling customers to meet the new requirements, pass quarterly scans and maintain continuous PCI compliance.
Merchants dealing with credit card transactions must comply with PCI DSS to ensure that customers' sensitive payment card information is protected. For smaller organizations, PCI DSS compliance can be overwhelming, especially with the latest PCI DSS 6.2 changes that became effective June 30, 2012 that require robust internal scanning and reporting. The new requirements for risk ranking vulnerabilities and passing quarterly internal scans add new process requirements, taking significant effort. QualysGuard PCI, which automates the quarterly scanning requirements for PCI DSS 11.2 for external systems, now includes new workflows for scanning internal systems with customized risk ranking and reporting on internal vulnerabilities, enabling customers to meet the new requirements.
"The QualysGuard PCI Cloud Platform is now used by more than 69 percent of ASVs, 50 percent of QSAs and 2,000 organizations worldwide, and with this new release provides a unified solution to address both internal and external PCI DSS scanning requirements," said Philippe Courtot, chairman and CEO for Qualys. "Because it is cloud-based, it offers an easy-to use, cost-effective solution helping companies of all sizes continuously meet PCI DSS standards to secure their data and IT assets from cyber attacks."
QualysGuard PCI provides a broad solution that helps customers meet the latest PCI DSS internal requirements, enabling them to:

Utilize Approved Scanning Vendor (ASV) solution to meet both external and internal scanning to satisfy the requirements for PCI DSS.
Perform unlimited PCI scanning on both external and internal systems and Web applications.
Rank vulnerabilities according to the criticality of the assets to manage the overall risk and customize it for each organization.
Generate PCI specific reports to document both internal quarterly scan compliance and external ASV scan requirements with executive, technical, and risk-rank reporting.

Qualys to Assist Organizations with EU Cookie Directive Compliance


								Posted
								by qualys								in Qualys News								on June 25, 2012							

				Qualys today announced that its QualysGuard Web Application Scanning (WAS) service helps organizations comply with the European Union (EU) Cookie Directive.
On May 26, 2011, the UK adopted regulations to implement the 2009 EU E-Privacy Directive, which requires web sites to gain consent from visitors before they can store cookies or other information used to track a user’s actions. The UK Cookie Directive is privacy legislation that requires web sites to gain consent from visitors before they can store cookies or other information used to track a user’s actions – fundamentally changing how web application owners interact with users.
With QualysGuard WAS, organizations can identify the cookies that their web applications are using, including those issued by third parties. With this information, organizations can evaluate whether the cookies are subject to the law and then update the web application to ensure it meets the EU legislation.
"As this new law impacts any web sites with European visitors, we are pleased to provide our customers with an easy-to-use solution to quickly assess their web sites and provide an accurate list of the ones that store cookies so they can review and update to meet this new law," said Philippe Courtot, chairman and CEO of Qualys.

								Posted
								by qualys								in Qualys News								on March 14, 2012							

 Qualys today announced QualysGuard® integration with Thycotic's Enterprise Password Management software, Secret Server, allowing customers to extend the scope and reach of authenticated scans to their most critical IT systems while protecting passwords.
With Thycotic’s Secret Server, authenticated scans using privileged IDs can be stored in the Secret Server Password repository and never leave the user’s perimeter. Users can also leverage Secret Server’s ability to log credential usage, restrict access, and periodically rotate credentials to ensure compliance with corporate policies and regulatory requirements.
"Thycotic’s Secret Server enables customers to easily and securely manage access to services delivered through the cloud," said Jonathan Cogley, CEO for Thycotic. "This new integration will help customers effectively protect their passwords as they use QualysGuard to scan for vulnerabilities and ensure compliance with policies and regulations to keep their IT systems and data safe."

Qualys Introduces New Services and Major Technological Innovations to QualysGuard Cloud Platform


								Posted
								by qualys								in Qualys News								on February 27, 2012							

 Qualys today announced at RSA Conference USA 2012 major enhancements to its QualysGuard Cloud Platform and suite of integrated applications for security and compliance. These new innovations will extend the cloud platform capabilities to help customers improve the security of their IT systems and applications, further automate their compliance initiatives for IT-GRC and provide online protection against cyber attacks, while reducing operational costs and increasing the efficiency of their security programs.
Qualys will unveil these latest major technological innovations tonight at booth #1431 at 7:00 p.m. PT at the RSA Conference USA:

Web Application Firewall (WAF). A brand new cloud service from Qualys, QualysGuard WAF protects web sites from unwanted requests and a range of online threats from spammers to SQL injection to DDoS, and provides increased web site performance through caching, compression and content optimization.


Zero-Day Risk Analyzer Module. Built on VeriSign’s iDefense zero-day security intelligence services, this new QualysGuard service allows customers to analyze zero-day threats and estimate their impact on their IT infrastructures and critical systems based on information collected from previous scan results.


Patent-Pending Technology for Enterprise Asset Management. Allows customers to tag assets dynamically based on scan results and to categorize assets in a hierarchical manner to keep pace with changing environments. Tags can then be used in all workflows including scanning, reporting or assigning security and access to assets.


Customizable Questionnaires Service for IT- GRC. Extends the QualysGuard Cloud Platform’s policy compliance capabilities to automate manual control assessments with a customizable questionnaire based on a repository of nearly 1,000 pre-mapped policy documents via the Unified Compliance Framework. Workflows are also provided out-of-the-box that can be tailored to fit business processes.


Malware Detection Service, Enterprise Edition. Built on the popular free Malware Detection service, the enterprise version will allow customers to track malware on multiple web sites with advanced reporting and notification options.


General Availability of Virtualized Scanner Appliances. Allows customers to deploy virtual scanner appliances in various modes – on laptops for mobile consultants, in data centers for enterprise scanning and in the Amazon EC2 and VPC platforms for cloud deployments.

			Web App Security Solutions: Web App Scanning | Web App Firewall | Malware Detection



				Web applications live outside of the traditional network perimeter. If they're not properly secured, they offer hackers an attractive attack surface and a convenient entry point into your IT environment.
			

				Due to poor development and testing practices, web apps are often plagued with security vulnerabilities and configuration gaps. When breached, web apps can expose massive amounts of confidential business data.
			



Boost web app security with Qualys'
			
			cloud-based, integrated solutions
		


				With Qualys, you automate web app security, shield web servers from hackers, rid your websites from malware and make the software development lifecycle more secure.
			









					Qualys Web Application Scanning (WAS) crawls and tests custom web applications to identify vulnerabilities, while its extensive APIs let you integrate scan data with other security systems.
				








					Qualys Web Application Firewall (WAF) blocks attacks on web server vulnerabilities, and lets you control where and when your applications are accessed.
				








					Qualys Malware Detection (MD) proactively scans an organization’s customer-facing websites for infections, triggers automated alerts and generates detailed reports.
				




				As part of the integrated security and compliance Qualys Cloud Platform, these three apps are hosted and maintained by Qualys, can be immediately deployed, operate continuously, scale globally and offer users centralized management.
			








					WAS Features
				

					Discover
				

					WAS finds and catalogs all web apps in your network, including new and unknown ones, and gives you quick and comprehensive visibility of their vulnerabilities.
				

					Assess
				

					WAS' dynamic deep scanning covers all apps on your perimeter, internal networks, remote and mobile devices, and public cloud instances. Authenticated and complex scans are supported.
				

					Prioritize
				

					WAS offer highly customized reporting capabilities with a focus on OWASP’s Top 10 risks, while its unified, interactive dashboard gives you an at-a-glance view of your web app security.

Watch video







					WAF Features
				

					Integrated
				

					WAF is tightly integrated with WAS, so you have a single, interactive console for web app vulnerability detection (WAS) and rapid protection from attacks (WAF).
				

					Cloud Agility
				

					With no special hardware to buy nor maintain, WAF can be quickly deployed for apps on public or private clouds, and scaled seamlessly as new apps are added.
				

					Protection
				

					WAF lets you create “virtual patch” rules in response to WAS findings, rapidly resolve false positives and customize security rules for your environment.

Watch video













					MD Features
				

					Scalable Scanning
				

					Included with WAS but also available standalone, MD scans an organization's websites, and identifies, reports and removes infections, including zero-day threats via behavioral analysis.
				

					Interactive Dashboard and Reports
				

					A dashboard displays scan activity, like infected pages and trends, and remediation can be started from its interface. Reports can be mined for granular details and securely distributed.
				

					Centralized Management
				

					MD lets you create multiple user-defined roles with different permission levels, while tags let you categorize assets by criteria such as organizational groups and geography.

PCI also covers the standard’s requirement for maintaining secure web applications. Its Web Application Scanning module automates the evaluation of web apps during and after development, ensuring they’re built and maintained securely. The module conducts authenticated and unauthenticated scans within any web app type — custom-built in house, or commercial.











								Automated report submission
							

An auto-submission feature completes the compliance process once you’re finished with remediation. Enter your bank and merchant IDs in your account settings to activate this feature. PCI will send the compliance status report directly to the acquiring banks. You can also download PCI compliance reports in PDF.












					Achieve PCI compliance and secure your network
				


As an Approved Scanning Vendor (ASV), Qualys has been authorized by the PCI Security Standards Council to conduct the quarterly scans required to show compliance with PCI DSS. The cloud-based Qualys PCI solution helps you achieve compliance via a streamlined process that also gives you assurance your network is secure.



Benefit from the ASV requirements that Qualys PCI fulfills, including: Disruption-free: When conducting a scan, Qualys PCI doesn’t interfere with the cardholder data systemNo stealth software installations: Qualys PCI will never install any software on your systems without your knowledge and pre-approvalNo dangerous tests: Qualys PCI will not conduct tests that overload your systems or cause an outageConforming reports: Qualys PCI produces reports that conform to the standard’s requirements

Follow an easy step-by-step approach and intuitive compliance tips in a user-friendly interface

Automatically complete the required quarterly scans, and also scan as often as you like on an ad hoc manner, for PCI compliance and for identifying and remediating vulnerabilities as soon as they appear in your network

Scan your network in segments and remediate/re-scan for vulnerabilities on target IPs. No need to scan your entire network

Leverage 24/7 online help and email/telephone support for understanding and pursuing compliance

Monitor all assets on premises and in private, public or hybrid clouds 

Scan web apps during and after development to ensure they’re built and maintained securely



















					Quickly eliminate security threats with detailed remediation instructions
				


PCI DSS requires businesses to perform a network security scan every 90 days on all Internet-facing networks and systems in accordance with a defined set of procedures. To achieve compliance, businesses must identify and remediate all critical vulnerabilities detected during the scan. Qualys PCI:



Automates and greatly simplifies scanning and remediation

Provides easy-to-use reporting of vulnerabilities that will cause you to fail PCI DSS

Uses the Qualys Cloud Platform to accurately scan vulnerabilities

Provides detailed instructions for each detected vulnerability, with links to verified patches for rapid remediation



















					Generate reports
				


Qualys PCI generates two PCI network reports that are similar but intended for different purposes: One designed to offer proof of compliance, and the other to serve as a remediation guide.



Generates PCI Executive Report for submitting to the acquiring bank to document PCI compliance. This report provides summary level information only

Generates PCI Technical Report for identifying vulnerabilities and prioritizing remediation. This report includes technical details to assist with remediation

Includes in the reports an overall PCI compliance status of “passed” or “failed” An overall PCI compliance status of “passed” indicates that all hosts in the report passed the PCI DSS compliance standards set by the PCI Council. A host compliance status is provided for each host. A PCI compliance status of “passed” for a single host/IP indicates that no vulnerabilities or potential vulnerabilities were detected on the host.If you fail the assessment, you can view a list of detected vulnerabilities and potential vulnerabilities, including those that must be fixed to obtain compliance as well as vulnerabilities that we recommend that you fix. View detailed remediation information.



















					Auto-submit compliance status directly to acquiring bank
				


Once you have met the validation actions, the Qualys PCI “auto-submission” feature completes the compliance process.



Automatically submits compliance status directly to your acquiring banks

Allows you to download PCI compliance reports in PDF to submit to your acquiring bank or to assist in remediation efforts

Top 6 Security Use Cases for Automated Asset Inventory
												Download free Solution Brief













With Qualys Asset Inventory, we can start to see the answers to questions such as: ‘Which PCs, laptops and business areas are at the highest risk of attack?’ and ‘Which systems are not being patched in a timely manner?’ and ‘Where can we deploy our resources to see the greatest cyber security benefit?’

Key Features









								Continuous discovery and 2-second visibility
							

Asset Inventory constantly gathers information on all assets, listing installed software, existing vulnerabilities and hardware details. Clicking on an asset record lets you see all the details Asset Inventory has collected about it. A powerful search engine lets you do ad hoc queries and refine them using different criteria.











								Actionable information
							

With Asset Inventory, you can detect a variety of issues, such as unauthorized software, or IT policy violations like the disabling of a personal firewall or the lowering of an app’s security settings.











								CMDB integration
							

A certified application synchronizes Qualys Asset Inventory data with ServiceNow’s Configuration Management system. Device changes are immediately transmitted to the Qualys Cloud Platform and then synchronized with ServiceNow. For customers, this means an end to unidentified and misclassified assets, and to data update delays, all of which increase chances of breaches.











								Real-time monitoring with Cloud Agents
							

In addition to Qualys network scanners, Asset Inventory leverages our Cloud Agents, which are lightweight, self-updating and run in the background. They continuously assess the compliance and security status of assets they reside on, including intermittently connected ones, without needing scan windows nor credential management.












					Access a complete, searchable IT asset inventory
				


You can’t protect – nor defend yourself from – what you don’t know is in your network, like unapproved devices and unauthorized software. Qualys gives you full horizontal visibility of all hardware and software, scaling up to millions of assets – on premises, in cloud instances and mobile endpoints.



Continuously collects and feeds system, compliance, and security data from IT assets into the Qualys Cloud Platform for aggregation, indexing, correlation and analysis

Covers all bases with a variety of data discovery and collection sensors, such as: Physical and virtual appliances that scan IT assets on premises, in private clouds, or in virtualized environmentsCloud appliances that remotely scan your IaaS and PaaS instances in commercial cloud platformsLightweight, all-purpose Cloud Agents that continuously monitor assets they’re installed on, such as laptops

Has a powerful search engine that lets you craft complex queries combining multiple asset criteria and that returns results instantly, so in two seconds you can find out: How many PCs from a particular manufacturer do we have in our environment?Which of our IT assets are impacted by a specific vulnerability?Which servers are running an OS that its vendor recently stopped supporting?Which IT assets have a particular piece of software installed?How many Lenovo laptops running the latest version of Windows 10 and located in my India office have a particular vulnerability?



















					Get a granular, deep view into asset components
				


Qualys gives you deep visibility into the assets, granting you a detailed, multidimensional view of each one that encompasses both its IT and security data. You can flag issues such as configuration problems, security risks, IT policy violations and regulatory non-compliance with an asset profile that includes a wealth of data, such as:



Hardware specs

Installed software, including applications, OS, drivers, utilities and plug-ins

Network connections

Approved users, and usage logs

Installed patches

Open vulnerabilities

Services, file systems, running processes and registry keys

Virtualized environment details, such as the constant proliferation of internal and external images

Geographic location and time zone

IT policy compliance settings



















					Get real-time, continuous inventory updates with Qualys Cloud Agents
				


An IT asset inventory loses its value if its data gets stale. New vulnerabilities are disclosed every day. Old ones can suddenly become more dangerous. A laptop can quickly go from secure to compromised. Qualys complements its physical, virtual and cloud scanners with its revolutionary Cloud Agents, which:



Are lightweight and, after the initial comprehensive asset assessment, only report detected changes, so they have a minimal impact on systems and networks

Run in the background and update themselves

Continuously assess the asset’s security and compliance status

Can be installed in assets that are on premises, in cloud instances and mobile endpoints

Are deployed via a flexible, compact agent installer



















					Highlight and rank criticality of assets
				


Not all assets carry the same weight within your organization. Asset Inventory lets you tag your assets, so you put relevant labels on them in the inventory and organize them in multiple ways. For example, you can specify which assets fall within the scope of PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) compliance.



Supports tagging of assets for easy labeling and identification, instantly adding business context to your inventory

Gives you the ability to apply tags manually or configure rules and parameters for automatic tagging

Supports creating any kind or any number of hierarchies, and giving assets as many tags as you want

Calculates criticality based on an asset’s aggregated and consolidated system, security, and compliance data, as well as established hierarchies and priorities



















					Visualize with customizable dashboards and powerful reports
				


It’s essential to graphically display and document IT inventory data so that you can act on insights and prevent and address threats. Asset Inventory’s interactive, customizable dashboard and powerful reporting capabilities let you visualize and share the security, configuration and compliance status of IT assets.



Leverages robust search engine to let you turn queries about IT assets into dashboard widgets updated in real time, so you don’t have to manually run a frequent query

Displays widget data in various ways using graphs, tables and charts

Lets you establish thresholds and alerts you when they’ve been reached, for example, by changing a widget’s background color from green to red

Allow you to create different dashboards and reports tailored for different purposes and users, such as InfoSec pros, compliance/risk managers, and CSOs



















					Integrate with your CMDB
				


IT asset inventory solutions must link up with your CMDB (configuration management database) and continuously feed it fresh, detailed data. That way, the CMDB can better illustrate and map the relationships, connections, hierarchies and dependencies among IT assets. The Qualys App for ServiceNow CMDB syncs information about assets Qualys discovers into ServiceNow.



Allows IT departments to be more effective at a variety of critical tasks, such as change management, service requests, incident response, system repair and impact analysis

Eliminates the need for IT staffers to manually update the CMDB with granular system, security and compliance data on new and changed assets across an IT environment

Supports flexible configuration for multiple Qualys accounts/API sources and synchronization schedules

As required by ServiceNow, stages changes to the ServiceNow CMDB for user approval before writing them to the CMDB

Features preconfigured table transform maps for open ports, assets, network interfaces, software, processors and volumes, as well as preconfigured reports

History[edit]
Qualys was founded in 1999. The company launched QualysGuard in December 2000, making Qualys one of the first entrants in the vulnerability management market.[11] The QualysGuard Intranet Scanner was released in 2002 to automatically scan corporate LANs for vulnerabilities and search for an available patch.[12] The following year, Qualys released FreeMap, a web-based tool for scanning, mapping and identifying possible security holes within networks connected to the Internet.[13]
In 2005, Qualys extended its QualysGuard product line. In 2008, Qualys introduced QualysGuard Policy Compliance, which extended the platform’s global scanning capabilities to collect IT compliance data across the organization and map this information into policies to document compliance for auditing purposes.[14] Qualys also released a service for web application scanning named QualysGuard Web Application Scanning (WAS). In 2010, at the RSA Conference USA, Qualys announced QualysGuard Malware Detection Service, a new service designed to scan and identify malware on web sites.[15] It also announced the Qualys SECURE Seal, which allows websites to show visitors that it has passed security scans.[16]
In July 2010, Qualys announced Qualys BrowserCheck, a service for checking web browsers and plug-ins for security vulnerabilities.[17] At RSA Conference 2011, Qualys launched a new open source web application firewall project, IronBee,[18] led by Ivan Ristic, the creator of ModSecurity and a director of engineering at Qualys.[19] At the RSA Conference in 2012, Qualys introduced updates to the QualysGuard Cloud Platform, which extended its capabilities to help customers improve the security of their IT systems and applications, further automate their compliance initiatives for IT-GRC, and provide online protection against cyber-attacks while reducing operational costs and increasing the efficiency of their security programs.[20]
Qualys went public on NASDAQ with the symbol QLYS on September 28, 2012, raising net proceeds of $87.5 million.[3][21] At the 2014 RSA Conference, Qualys announced general availability of its QualyGuard Web Application Firewall (WAF), which provides protection for websites running on Amazon EC2 and on-premises, as well as a new Continuous Monitoring solution and free Top 4 Security Controls service.[10][22] In 2015, the company released 2.0 of its WAF software which included virtual patching and customizable event responses.[23] That same year, Qualys also released an IT security and compliance solution called Cloud Agent Platform.[24][25] In August 2015, the company released a free asset management service, Qualys AssetView, that allowed organizations to keep inventory of computers and their software.[26][27]
In February 2016, Qualys released ThreatPROTECT, a vulnerability detection service for its cloud-based platform.[28]The company received full certification for its Configuration Management Databases (CMDBs) App for ServiceNow, allowing the app to be integrated into ServiceNow's system in March 2016.[29] In July 2016, it was announced that Qualys would integrate with Microsoft Azure Security Center.[30]
Awards[edit]
SC Magazine has awarded Qualys for its security software solutions every year from 2004-2014.[31][32] SC Magazine also awarded Qualys "Best Security Company" in 2014.[33]
In 2010, Inc. magazine ranked Qualys within 5000 fastest growing private companies in the USA based on 104% revenue growth from 2006 to 2009.[34] In 2012 Silicon Valley/San Jose Business Journal has recognized Qualys as one of the largest private companies in Silicon Valley – ranking 26th in a list of 51.[35][36][37]
In November 2014, Qualys received the 2014 Security Reader's Choice Awards for Best Risk and Policy Compliance Solution, Best Application Security Product, and Best Vulnerability.[38]

History[edit]
Qualys was founded in 1999. The company launched QualysGuard in December 2000, making Qualys one of the first entrants in the vulnerability management market.[11] The QualysGuard Intranet Scanner was released in 2002 to automatically scan corporate LANs for vulnerabilities and search for an available patch.[12] The following year, Qualys released FreeMap, a web-based tool for scanning, mapping and identifying possible security holes within networks connected to the Internet.[13]
In 2005, Qualys extended its QualysGuard product line. In 2008, Qualys introduced QualysGuard Policy Compliance, which extended the platform’s global scanning capabilities to collect IT compliance data across the organization and map this information into policies to document compliance for auditing purposes.[14] Qualys also released a service for web application scanning named QualysGuard Web Application Scanning (WAS). In 2010, at the RSA Conference USA, Qualys announced QualysGuard Malware Detection Service, a new service designed to scan and identify malware on web sites.[15] It also announced the Qualys SECURE Seal, which allows websites to show visitors that it has passed security scans.[16]
In July 2010, Qualys announced Qualys BrowserCheck, a service for checking web browsers and plug-ins for security vulnerabilities.[17] At RSA Conference 2011, Qualys launched a new open source web application firewall project, IronBee,[18] led by Ivan Ristic, the creator of ModSecurity and a director of engineering at Qualys.[19] At the RSA Conference in 2012, Qualys introduced updates to the QualysGuard Cloud Platform, which extended its capabilities to help customers improve the security of their IT systems and applications, further automate their compliance initiatives for IT-GRC, and provide online protection against cyber-attacks while reducing operational costs and increasing the efficiency of their security programs.[20]
Qualys went public on NASDAQ with the symbol QLYS on September 28, 2012, raising net proceeds of $87.5 million.[3][21] At the 2014 RSA Conference, Qualys announced general availability of its QualyGuard Web Application Firewall (WAF), which provides protection for websites running on Amazon EC2 and on-premises, as well as a new Continuous Monitoring solution and free Top 4 Security Controls service.[10][22] In 2015, the company released 2.0 of its WAF software which included virtual patching and customizable event responses.[23] That same year, Qualys also released an IT security and compliance solution called Cloud Agent Platform.[24][25] In August 2015, the company released a free asset management service, Qualys AssetView, that allowed organizations to keep inventory of computers and their software.[26][27]
In February 2016, Qualys released ThreatPROTECT, a vulnerability detection service for its cloud-based platform.[28]The company received full certification for its Configuration Management Databases (CMDBs) App for ServiceNow, allowing the app to be integrated into ServiceNow's system in March 2016.[29] In July 2016, it was announced that Qualys would integrate with Microsoft Azure Security Center.[30]
Awards[edit]
SC Magazine has awarded Qualys for its security software solutions every year from 2004-2014.[31][32] SC Magazine also awarded Qualys "Best Security Company" in 2014.[33]
In 2010, Inc. magazine ranked Qualys within 5000 fastest growing private companies in the USA based on 104% revenue growth from 2006 to 2009.[34] In 2012 Silicon Valley/San Jose Business Journal has recognized Qualys as one of the largest private companies in Silicon Valley – ranking 26th in a list of 51.[35][36][37]
In November 2014, Qualys received the 2014 Security Reader's Choice Awards for Best Risk and Policy Compliance Solution, Best Application Security Product, and Best Vulnerability.[38]
In both 2014 and 2015, Qualys received the award for Best Application Security Product from the SANS Institute.[39]

History[edit]
Qualys was founded in 1999. The company launched QualysGuard in December 2000, making Qualys one of the first entrants in the vulnerability management market.[11] The QualysGuard Intranet Scanner was released in 2002 to automatically scan corporate LANs for vulnerabilities and search for an available patch.[12] The following year, Qualys released FreeMap, a web-based tool for scanning, mapping and identifying possible security holes within networks connected to the Internet.[13]
In 2005, Qualys extended its QualysGuard product line. In 2008, Qualys introduced QualysGuard Policy Compliance, which extended the platform’s global scanning capabilities to collect IT compliance data across the organization and map this information into policies to document compliance for auditing purposes.[14] Qualys also released a service for web application scanning named QualysGuard Web Application Scanning (WAS). In 2010, at the RSA Conference USA, Qualys announced QualysGuard Malware Detection Service, a new service designed to scan and identify malware on web sites.[15] It also announced the Qualys SECURE Seal, which allows websites to show visitors that it has passed security scans.[16]
In July 2010, Qualys announced Qualys BrowserCheck, a service for checking web browsers and plug-ins for security vulnerabilities.[17] At RSA Conference 2011, Qualys launched a new open source web application firewall project, IronBee,[18] led by Ivan Ristic, the creator of ModSecurity and a director of engineering at Qualys.[19] At the RSA Conference in 2012, Qualys introduced updates to the QualysGuard Cloud Platform, which extended its capabilities to help customers improve the security of their IT systems and applications, further automate their compliance initiatives for IT-GRC, and provide online protection against cyber-attacks while reducing operational costs and increasing the efficiency of their security programs.[20]
Qualys went public on NASDAQ with the symbol QLYS on September 28, 2012, raising net proceeds of $87.5 million.[3][21] At the 2014 RSA Conference, Qualys announced general availability of its QualyGuard Web Application Firewall (WAF), which provides protection for websites running on Amazon EC2 and on-premises, as well as a new Continuous Monitoring solution and free Top 4 Security Controls service.[10][22] In 2015, the company released 2.0 of its WAF software which included virtual patching and customizable event responses.[23] That same year, Qualys also released an IT security and compliance solution called Cloud Agent Platform.[24][25] In August 2015, the company released a free asset management service, Qualys AssetView, that allowed organizations to keep inventory of computers and their software.[26][27]
In February 2016, Qualys released ThreatPROTECT, a vulnerability detection service for its cloud-based platform.[28]The company received full certification for its Configuration Management Databases (CMDBs) App for ServiceNow, allowing the app to be integrated into ServiceNow's system in March 2016.[29] In July 2016, it was announced that Qualys would integrate with Microsoft Azure Security Center.[30]
Awards[edit]
SC Magazine has awarded Qualys for its security software solutions every year from 2004-2014.[31][32] SC Magazine also awarded Qualys "Best Security Company" in 2014.[33]
In 2010, Inc. magazine ranked Qualys within 5000 fastest growing private companies in the USA based on 104% revenue growth from 2006 to 2009.[34] In 2012 Silicon Valley/San Jose Business Journal has recognized Qualys as one of the largest private companies in Silicon Valley – ranking 26th in a list of 51.[35][36][37]
In November 2014, Qualys received the 2014 Security Reader's Choice Awards for Best Risk and Policy Compliance Solution, Best Application Security Product, and Best Vulnerability.[38]
In both 2014 and 2015, Qualys received the award for Best Application Security Product from the SANS Institute.[39]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
