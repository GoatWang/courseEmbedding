WHAT DO OUR VISTORS & EXHIBITORS SAY








 
We are a foreign invested company in mainland China with a chain of 400 supermarkets (RT-Mart), and we also operate online sales business (Feiniu.com).This exhibition is professional and we are able to see many kinds of products. We will pick some quality products and bring them to mainland China.


Mr. Jackie Tsui
Director, Merchandise Department Feiniu, China







 
It is our first time exhibiting in Asia. As Asia is a very fast growing market, we think that it is a natural step to expand to this market. We had fruitful conversations with many actors and distributors, and we got quite a lot out of this exhibiting experience.


Mr. Oskar Holmblad
Director of Sales, Humble Brush, Sweden







 
We import and distribute natural and organic products in Singapore. The products here are very comprehensive and this is a good opportunity to meet up with the suppliers and understand more about their products.


Mr. Kelvin Chua
Director Taste Original Pte Ltd., Singapore







 
Asia is a huge market and we think it is time to come over to start doing business here. It is our first launch in Asia and it has been a fantastic show for us. We have met a lot of distributors who are interested in our products and got fantastic feedback. We are coming back again next year!


Ms. Frances Helfenbaum
Director, Mozzigear, Australia

Welcome to the world of Bamboo Teas! For hundreds of years bamboo leaves have been used 
			in both Chinese and Ayurvedic Medicines. Not only is it a sustainable crop, it can be used to make a tea that's good for you! Bamboo leaves have 
			some of the highest concentrations of vegetable silica, the mineral that makes bamboo grass grow strong, tall and flexible. Silica is great for 
			maintaining hair and nail health. Bamboo leaf tea also contains 1 gram of soluble fiber per 8oz cup and is a good source of micronutrients and antioxidants. 
			The natural flavor of bamboo tea is sweet, complex and mildly grassy for a fresh, light tea! Our Bamboo Teas are certified organic and caffeine-free, 
			unlike many other commercially harvested Bamboos. Organic means healthier for you, without all the modern toxic chemicals in the production process.

        Odd flavor maple like flavor in this mayonnaise
We wanted to like the new Organic Best Foods Mayonnaise, however after tasting two different lots, it's a no for us. It has an odd maple like flavor that imparts itself into everything we added into the mayonnaise, especially garlic. It's impossible to have a great tasting aioli with this mayonnaise because that odd flavor takes over the garlic notes. We're not sure if it's the natural flavor or the lemon juice concentrate that makes this odd aroma and flavor? We hope Best Foods will make a better version, as we want a great tasting organic mayonnaise. We love your regular Best Foods Mayonnaise, but want a healthier, better tasting, non gmo and organic oil ingredients product.

        looks awful
I just got your organic mayo and I will not open the jar because it does not look like mayonaise. It is so watery or soupy is the only way I can describe it and when shaked it looked like sour milk in oil. There is no way I would even taste it. Its a shame because I will not buy any other mayo but best foods. I am 78 and that is the only one I have ever used.. Plus there was no coupon to buy your product, which I would have used it for the regular mayo. thank you anyway . Plus what can you use this oily mayo for?????

        Tastes like mayo used to taste
If you are old enough, you will realize when you taste this that Best Foods lack of  taste in their regular Mayo is obivously because it isnt made with the same great ingredients it was when you were younger.  After tasting the Organic Mayo, I realized what I have been missing for years. I said to myself, that is what Best Foods used to taste like before they cut corners with nonorganic ingredients, like GMOs. Love the organic Mayo! They should make all their mayo like this and stop selling GMOs to people. I have posted it to all my friends on Facebook. Got to get it!

        Disgusting!
Our family has used Best Foods Real Mayonnaise exclusively for over 60 years and we have always enjoyed your product. In a recent attempt at culinary correctness my wife purchased a jar of your new Organic Mayonnaise and, in short, it tastes disgusting, there is no other way to describe this awful product. As a retired marketing executive I can with confidence advise you to withdraw this mess from the market as soon as possible to avoid irreparable damage to your reputation.

        Best foods organic
Tastes nothing like the regular best foods mayo. I don't know if they use different oil or spices, but definitely not as good. It also costs ALOT more. Organic foods should cost less than conventional because the farmer does not have to buy pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, chemical fertilizer, the equipment used to apply it or spend the man hours to apply it. The plants are healthier and stronger thereby able to resist pests and disease, resulting in higher yeld.

Best Foods Mayo is hands-down the best! It's so easy to just walk past all of the other choices and get the best. This product, on the other hand, is hands-down the worst mayo I have ever had. It tastes a little like it was made with rancid oil (I highly doubt that any of the ingredients were sub-par, but that's the flavor I get). I usually like organic foods better but I had to toss the unused portion and fetch a new jar of regular Best Foods Mayo.

That's where the rest of the jar of your organic mayo is going.  We buy ONLY Best Foods mayo at our house--we've each been eating it since we were children and we won't change to any other brand,  But your organic mayo is a non-starter.  Great that you are trying to offer a healthier version, but this is a failed attempt in our opinion.  It just tastes weird.  We'd give it a zero rating if we could.

The flavor of this hummus is similar in flavor to hummus made with canned garbanzo beans (or chickpeas), only fresher. If you don't have fresh garbanzo beans, you can sub with canned ones, just drain and rinse first.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
