Optimize High-Performance Polymer Molding


		This article by Mold Making Technology discusses hot runners versus high performance polymers. Parkway directly works with PEEK and Torlon materials in which we serve Aerospace & Defense, Automotive and Industrial end markets. This information presented in the article helps explain the right way of handling these types of materials correctly while utilizing a hot runner for production.As you read through this article, they explain the relationship between particular resins (PEEK/PAEK) and the use C of hot runners versus cold runners. In many cases, the use of cold runner lead to materials being unable to be recycled or reground. In the end, hot runners are the best choice for small to medium sized part applications as long as the melt channel is maintained at a ±5ºC temperature to avoid any hot/cold spots for crystalline polymers.

High Growth Forecast for High Performance Plastics


		From Plastics Technology:High performance plastics are expected to grow at a pretty heftly annual rate. Dublin-based Market & Research (US location in NY) released a global forecast projected out to 2026. They think the market will reach $35.7 billion, with a CAGR of 9.3% from 2016 to 2026. This growth is expected due to the increased demand for manufacturing interior and exterior components for the automotive and aerospace industries. High performance plastics have superior mechanical properties, chemical resistance, and high-heat stability that cater to these specific market needs. The study identifies polyetheretherketone (PEEK), a material that Parkway utilizes in our High Performance Polymers Molding facility, as one of the top two fastest growing segments when considering volume and value in the high performance plastics market.

Parkway Stock Sees Short Interest Move 17.8% Lower
The most recent short interest data has been released for the 11/30/2016 settlement date, which shows a 264,081 share decrease in total short interest for Parkway Inc , to 1,221,070, a decrease of 17.78% since 11/15/2016. Total short interest is just one way to look at short data; another metric that we here at Dividend Channel find particularly useful is the "days to cover" metric because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares traded.
