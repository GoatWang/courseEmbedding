Barron's is an American weekly newspaper published by Dow Jones & Company, a property of News Corp. that covers US financial information, market developments, and relevant statistics. Each issue provides a summary of the previous week's market activity as well as news reports and an informative outlook on the week to come.  The Top 100 Independent Advisors as identified by Barron’s is published annually. Scoring for the publication reflects the assessment of data provided by the nation’s most productive advisors. Investment performance is not an explicit component because not all advisors have audited results and because performance figures often are influenced more by clients’ risk tolerance than by an advisor’s investment-picking ability.  Barron’s states that ranking reflects the volume of assets overseen by the advisors and their teams, revenues generated for the firms and the quality of the advisors' practices. Furthermore that the scoring systems assigns a top score of 100 and rates the rest by comparing them with the top-ranked advisor.

We Know the Ropes
Anchor’s rigorous process is designed to lower volatility while seeking long-term growth.










Institutions



Helping institutions keep their promises since 1983


Anchor’s Institutional Accounts division has more than 30 years of experience working with institutional programs. We offer eight distinct value-focused strategies that are designed to play specific roles in a total portfolio solution.
Our watchword is “no surprises.” This applies first to the lower relative volatility and downside protection that are the expected outcomes of our disciplined process. We also strive for full transparency: Clients can fully access information about their assets—in regular quarterly meetings and on an as-needed basis.









Your mission, first and foremost





Public & Multi-Employer Funds




Beneficiaries
Keep promises to public and union employees; ensure public institutions’ solvency; minimize burden on taxpayers




Fiduciaries
Asset allocation policy may be risk-averse; sensitive to downside events








Corporate Pensions




Beneficiaries
Keep promises to employees while managing pension expense and funding risk




Fiduciaries
Sensitive to equity market volatility since 2008; avoid consequences of underfunding imposed by PPA








Non-profits




Beneficiaries
Maintain educational/cultural mission — often major construction projects; support efforts for public good




Fiduciaries
Asset allocation for endowments may be more risk-tolerant; the focus of private foundations is adjusting to increased risk needed to meet the 5% annual spending hurdle








Consultants




Beneficiaries
Intermediary for all client types above: Fulfills “prudent expert” role for them




Fiduciaries
Key is predictable results while maintaining transparency, excellent communication — including detailed analytics





How We Invest







Core Principles





Philosophy
We believe history shows that disciplined value investing outperforms over time with relatively low risk.

Performance
Anchor strategies play a defined role: seeking to mitigate bear-market losses and achieve competitive growth over a full cycle.





People
Our teams are stable. We hire talented investors who are dedicated to your success.










We understand our role.You know what to expect.

“Price always matters.” 
—William P. Rice, Jr.






The goal at Anchor is to provide clients with a higher-than-average stream of current income, better returns in down markets, and competitive returns over the course of a market cycle.
 



OUR PHILOSOPHY


Traditional value investing based on meticulous research


We believe the best way to meet our clients’ goals is through traditional value investing that is based on meticulous research and picking individual stocks. Rather than try to match the performance of a benchmark, we build our portfolios from stocks whose prices we believe do not reflect our analysis of their intrinsic value.
The companies we invest in can be in any industry or market sector, as long as the stock is selling at a price that is attractive to us and has what we believe to be a well-defined path to reach fair value.
Anchor portfolios are diversified, but we view our rigorous security selection and monitoring discipline as our primary risk management tool.







Value vs. Growth
Growth of a Hypothetical $1 investment in 1927*



Academic research predicts that value will have a long-term structural advantage over Growth. Historical data confirm it.








*Source: The graph is based on the historical data for their “6 Portfolios Formed on Size and Book-to-Market”.
Data Source: http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html#Research
The information used in this presentation is based on a hypothetical account created by the source. The returns presented are exclusive of fees and are gross returns. The underlying historical market data is provided by the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP). Famma/French construct a vast library of research portfolios based on this data, six of which are “6 Portfolios formed on Size and Book to Market.” Price, dividend, shares, and volume data are historically adjusted for split events to make data directly comparable at different times during the history of a security.
Small Value, Small Growth, Big Value, and Big Growth represent four Famma/French Research Portfolios formed on Size and Book-to-Market. The “6 Portfolios formed on Size and Book-to-Market” are as follows: (1) Small Value; (2) Small Neutral; (3) Small Growth; (4) Big Value; (5) Big Neutral; (6) Big Growth. We exclude the two “Neutral” portfolios to focus on Big vs. Small, and Value vs. Growth. The portfolios, which are constructed at the end of each June, are the intersections of 2 portfolios formed on size (market equity, ME) and 3 portfolios formed on the ratio of book equity to market equity (BE/ME). The size breakpoint for year t is the median NYSE market equity at the end of June of year t. BE/ME for June of year t is the book equity for the last fiscal year end in t-1 divided by ME for December of t-1. The BE/ME breakpoints are the 30th and 70th NYSE percentiles. For more information, please visit http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/index.html.
The performance results are based upon a hypothetical model and may have inherent limitations. Hypothetical performance does not involve financial risk, and no hypothetical trading record can completely account for the impact of financial risks associated with actual market conditions. There are numerous other factors related to the markets in general, or to the implementation of any specific trading strategy, which cannot be fully accounted for, and all of which can adversely affect actual trading results.
No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown. The hypothetical results do not represent actual recommendations or trading by Anchor and should not be considered as indicative of the skills of the investment adviser. During the period shown, the Adviser was not managing client accounts according to the strategy depicted.
The information contained herein is based on sources we deem reliable, but is not guaranteed by Anchor. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Inherent in any investment is the possibility of loss. The returns presented are not directly representative of Anchor products. The information is for informational purposes only and should not be considered investment advice or a recommendation of any particular strategy or investment product. Anchor shall have no obligation to update this information, nor have liability for decisions based on this information.






ANCHOR’S VALUE PROCESS


At Anchor, we find value by scrutinizing each company’s fundamentals. In a world of indices, ETFs, and high-speed algorithm-driven trading, we determine a company’s value by inspecting the infrastructure, examining the books, and asking management the tough questions. From this data, we calculate an actual dollar figure for both the value of the company in the current market and the potential value assuming new product and management strategies are successful.


We continuously monitor our holdings and top candidates, and recheck our calculations to ensure our investment thesis remains valid. Although our process is price sensitive, our preference is to make long-term investments: owning companies whose growth potential consistently expands due to innovative management.







“We believe that the best form of risk management is careful security selection.”
William P. Rice, Jr.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.
