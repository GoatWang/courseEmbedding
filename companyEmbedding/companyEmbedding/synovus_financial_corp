    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

Data Format: CSV

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

The Synovus Financial Corporation is a financial services company with approximately $27 billion in assets based in Columbus, Georgia. This company began with its original name " Columbus Bank and Trust Company". Synovus’ divisions provide commercial and retail banking, investment, and mortgage services to customers through 29 locally branded divisions, 280 offices, and more than 400 ATMs in Georgia, Alabama, South Carolina, Florida, and Tennessee.[1]

Company history[edit]
The company began in 1888 with an encounter between a worker and an executive at a Columbus, Georgia textile mill.[2]
The worker’s dress became tangled in factory machinery, and money she had sewn into her hem spilled onto the floor. Explaining she felt this was the safest place to keep her savings, a mill executive offered instead to secure her money in the mill safe and pay her interest. That same service was soon offered to all the workers, and those deposits marked the beginning of Synovus.[2]
The company built a comprehensive financial services company that today operates in five states across the Southeast.[2]
Caught up in the financial crisis[edit]
In mid-August 2009 the bank was named as one of the biggest of more than 150 U.S. lenders which owned nonperforming loans equal to 5 percent or more of their holdings. Five percent is a threshold that former regulators have stated can wipe out a bank’s equity and threaten its survival.[3]
As a result of their financial troubles, Synovus laid off 850 employees and closed many bank branches in early 2011.[4] In July 2013, Synovus repaid the US government $967.9 million borrowed under TARP Troubled Asset Relief Program .[5]
Charter Consolidation[edit]
In early 2010, Synovus consolidated their thirty separate state charters into one Georgia state banking charter and is transitioning to operate as a more centralized single bank.[6]

Company history[edit]
The company began in 1888 with an encounter between a worker and an executive at a Columbus, Georgia textile mill.[2]
The worker’s dress became tangled in factory machinery, and money she had sewn into her hem spilled onto the floor. Explaining she felt this was the safest place to keep her savings, a mill executive offered instead to secure her money in the mill safe and pay her interest. That same service was soon offered to all the workers, and those deposits marked the beginning of Synovus.[2]
The company built a comprehensive financial services company that today operates in five states across the Southeast.[2]
Caught up in the financial crisis[edit]
In mid-August 2009 the bank was named as one of the biggest of more than 150 U.S. lenders which owned nonperforming loans equal to 5 percent or more of their holdings. Five percent is a threshold that former regulators have stated can wipe out a bank’s equity and threaten its survival.[3]
As a result of their financial troubles, Synovus laid off 850 employees and closed many bank branches in early 2011.[4] In July 2013, Synovus repaid the US government $967.9 million borrowed under TARP Troubled Asset Relief Program .[5]
Charter Consolidation[edit]
In early 2010, Synovus consolidated their thirty separate state charters into one Georgia state banking charter and is transitioning to operate as a more centralized single bank.[6]
