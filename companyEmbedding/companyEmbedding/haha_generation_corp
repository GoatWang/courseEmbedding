1.	Kinetic energy concept advocated zero pollution
2.	Main Concept －-“Electric Vehicle Auto Rechargeable Power Generation System” Extend the endurance
Basic accessories can extend the endurance of electric vehicles.

3.	The research of “Electric Vehicle Auto Rechargeable Power Generation System”means that when the electric vehicle is in the motion how to retrieve and transform the kinetic energy to the electronic power within the car.

2.	Each electric vehicle equipped with two sets of lithium iron battery (A)25AAnn and battery (B)25AAnn.
When the electric vehicle is in the motion it is first supply by the Battery (A) and when Battery (A) is dropped to 40% of its electric energy the system will automatically switch to Battery (B).At the same time	,all electric generators will recharge allocation of 6 in the group of 10 sets of electric powers (60%) of Battery (A).
3.	The 2 sets of elliptical tires both in the middle and the back will produce fixed vibration frequency while the car is in the motion. This vibration frequency can produce kinetic energy and will be transforming to the electric energy and continuous the recycle of the electric energy.
4.	Tire pressure generator:By using two sets of built-in interior sliding axis’s elasticity to activate the electric generator.When the electric vehicle is in the motion,the tires’ contact point to the road has the most pressure. By using this pressure to activate the electric generator to produce electricity and continues electricity cycle.
5.	The only way to resolve the environmental problem of global warming is to use electric car and electric auto rechargeable power generation and it is Pollution Free.

Note:
 
(1) Estimated expense related to compliance with reporting requirements pursuant 
    to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.                                      
  
The foregoing purposes represent our best estimate of the allocation of the
gross proceeds from this offering based upon the current state of our business
operations, current plans, and the current economic and industry conditions. The
amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous factors,
including the status of our development efforts, sales and marketing activities,
the amount of cash generated or used by our operations.

We planned our progress based on raising $200,000 from this offering. We have
taken careful consideration to determine that $200,000 is the amount we need to
sustain our operations for the next 12 months. In the event that we do not
realize the full proceeds from this offering, we will be forced to scale back
our efforts to accommodate for a reduced amount of funds. In this event, we will
be required to consider the then available options to determine how to fund the
shortfall. Those options include the private placement of our securities and
loans from third parties and/or Hsuan-Hsien Liao, our sole director and Chief
Executive Officer. Any interruption in our business will greatly reduce our
chances for success.

We reserve the right to change the use of these proceeds as a result of (a) the
need for more working capital. We may determine that we need more working
capital in order to implement the growth strategy and operations set forth
herein. The reallocation of any funds may necessitate an additional sale of our
equity securities. There are no assurances that we will be able to raise
additional capital from any institution or individual investors.


There are many barriers of entry in the clothing market and the level of
competition is extremely high. Examples of barriers of entry in this market
include brand loyalty, aggressive lower pricing tactics, and economies of scale.
Many of our established competitors have developed a brand following which would
make our potential customers prefer their clothing products to Shinin’s.
Aggressive lower pricing tactics implemented by our competitors would make it
difficult for us to enter and compete in this market. Economies of scale make it
easier for our larger established competitors to negotiate price discounts with
their suppliers of clothing products, which would leave us at a disadvantage.
 
The principal competitive factors in our industry are pricing and the quality of
our products. We will be in a market where we will be in direct competition with
many domestic and international companies offering competing products. Many
large companies will be able to provide more favorable services to the potential
customers. Many of these companies may have a greater and more established
customer base than us. We will likely lose prospective business to such
companies. Also, many of these companies will be able to afford to offer better
prices for competing products than us, which may also cause us to lose
prospective business. We also foresee challenges facing new market entrants.  We
may be unable to compete effectively with these existing or new competitors,
which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and
results of operations.
 
We have not yet entered the market. Once we enter the market, we will be one of
many participants in the business of distributing clothing products. Many
established and well-financed entities are currently active in the business of
distributing such products. Nearly all of our competitors have significantly
greater financial resources, technical expertise, and managerial capabilities
than us. We are, consequently, at a competitive disadvantage in the market.
Therefore, we may not be able to establish ourselves within the industry.


Company Description
The Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 10, 2014. We are a 
development stage company with a principal business of marketing and 
distributing in Taiwan silica energy clothing manufactured by Shinin Silica 
Corp., a Taiwanese corporation (“Shinin”). Generally, that clothing


 consists of
mens’ and womens’ undergarments and related apparel. That clothing is made from
an energy silicon fiber and yarn made from a fine nanoscale silicon powder and 
polymer materials which, together, result in a reactive energy material. 
Additionally, that clothing is bio-degradable and quick-drying.
                                                                           
We anticipate that we will receive revenue from the distribution and sale of 
that silicon energy clothing.

Our principal executive offices are located at 4F, No. 132, Songshan Rd., Xinyi
District, Taipei City, 110, Taiwan (Republic of China). Our phone number is 
886-227492597.
