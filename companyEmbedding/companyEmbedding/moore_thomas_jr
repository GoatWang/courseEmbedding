Our main service is providing  Illinois attorney referrals and legal guidance.  In addition to our personalized referrals, Illinoislawyers.com also provides a directory of almost all licensed attorneys in Illinois. The list, which we update daily, includes attorneys who are licensed in Illinois and who are physically in Illinois. The list does not include attorneys who have let their registration lapse or those who are out of state.
You can search by an attorney's first or last name, the name of a law firm, or their city. Each listing should include an attorney's name and the name of their firm, along with their address, phone number, fax number, e-mail address, website, and the year they were admitted to practice in Illinois. We also try to include, based on our research, the area of law in which the attorney practices.
The list is a good way to get the contact information for an Illinois attorney or law firm. We want to be clear that this list is completely different and separate from our attorney referral list. The network of attorneys we have created for referrals is a specific list of the Illinois attorneys we know and trust. Our network is made up of attorneys we would hire ourselves if we needed a lawyer. Basically, we have handpicked the attorneys we recommend to you.
If you have any questions related to this list, please do not hesitate to contact us.
Attorney Finder:
There are two ways to find contact information for Illinois lawyers:

Start typing the last name and click on the attorney when you find the one you are looking for.
Enter Attorneys Last Name





Suggestive Search:

Introducing the TMZ 2TPRG PC-Programmable MODBUS Temperature Transmitter and Signal Converter
 
The TMZ family of MODBUS temperature transmitters and signal converters now includes the 2TPRG model with two temperature inputs. The TMZ transmitters convert the inputs to the standard MODBUS RTU communication protocol ready for direct interface with MODBUS based monitoring and control systems. Double transmitter density with the new 2TPRG. Find out more here.








SPA2 is Now Available with New Alarms and Software 
 The SPA2 now offers versatile new alarm options that allow the user to set up more specific alarm functions. A Band Alarm, Stuck Input Alarm, and updated rate-of-change (ROC) alarm have all been added to the SPA2. The Fault alarm now includes Input Saturation that identifies when the input signal exceeds 110% of calibrated input range, an Out-of-Range alarm, and broken wire alarm. A new Copy Alarm setting allows the user to duplicate the exact setting of any other alarm. Find out more here.












MooreHawke, the company formed from a recent acquisition by Moore Industries of Hawke International's fieldbus products, provides FOUNDATION fieldbus ™/PROFIBUS PA Fieldbus Device Couplers and fieldbus power supplies that deliver industry-first advantages. This includes TRUNKGUARD®, the first fieldbus Device Coupler that provides fully automatic segment termination. This patented technology prevents fieldbus segment failure from under- or over-termination. Also featured are the patented ROUTE-MASTER™ I.S. Fieldbus Power Supplies. ROUTE-MASTER enables 350mA power per segment in intrinsically safe applications, which permits up to 16 fieldbus devices at 500 meters (1,500 feet) even in hydrogen-risk areas. Find out more about our fieldbus Device Couplers and fieldbus power supplies.
Moore Industries offers signal conditioners, temperature transmitters, temperature sensors and fieldbus products to fit a wide range of process control applications. Site-programmable, PC-programmable, and HART-programmable models of temperature transmitters with temperature sensors are available with one of the industry's most complete offerings of worldwide agency safety approvals. Isolated and RFI/EMI-protected, our temperature transmitters with temperature sensors can be easily programmed and installed on a DIN-rail, surface, relay track, pipe or in the field. We also offer complete temperature transmitters, temperature sensors and fieldbus assemblies. One simple model number is all it takes to order ready-to-install temperature transmitters with temperature sensors assembly. Find out more about our temperature sensors and fieldbus products.
Our signal conditioners are available in 2-wire (loop-powered) and 4-wire (line-powered) versions. These signal conditioners provide up to up to 1500Vrms signal isolation and RFI/EMI protection. Our signal conditioners can be quickly programmed using on-board controls or a PC, for a broad range of input and output configurations. Signal conditioners isolate signals to stop erratic measurements caused by ground loops. Use our signal conditioners to interface field instruments with the control room, or to split one signal to allow one primary measurement to be sent to two separate systems. To find out more about signal conditioners, visit our product pages.

Get product and application answers, installation assistance, technical information and quotes on distributed I/O, remote I/O, temperature sensors, temperature transmitters, signal conditioners, fieldbus products, process controllers and more at E-HELP EXPRESS.
