Exchange-Traded Funds' Features and Benefits
ETFs are baskets of securities designed to track various market indexes, and are traded on national stock exchanges.  The advantages of ETFs—low cost, diversification, transparency, liquidity/price efficiency, and tax efficiency—allow us to manage the portfolio’s risk and equity exposure with rigorous precision.

TRANSPARENCY

Each ETF’s “basket” of underlying securities is transparent and is published every day. An ETF either replicates its target index entirely or it invests in a representative sample of the stocks in the underlying index.  With ETFs, you know what you own on a real-time basis.
	
LOW COST

Most ETF investors pay low management and administrative fees that are lower than those of most actively managed mutual funds. According to Morningstar, the average expense ratio for equity mutual funds (both domestic and international) is 1.32%, while the average expense ratio for all exchange traded funds is .41%. This cost difference can have a significant impact on investor returns over the long term.
	
PRICING EFFICIENCY and LIQUIDITY

Like stocks, ETFs trade throughout the day and their prices fluctuate accordingly. The pricing of an ETF closely tracks the price changes in its underlying securities. For most ETFs there is a highly liquid market, making it possible for investment managers to execute buy or sell orders as soon as market conditions change. The pricing of an ETF is efficient because ETFs offer shares through a creation and redemption process. In other words, the number of outstanding shares may be increased or decreased daily as necessary to reflect demand.  This is known as an “in-kind” exchange.

DIVERSIFICATION with PRECISION

Using ETFs, shareholders can invest in asset classes or sectors of the market with pinpoint precision. ETFs allow for the creation of fully diversified portfolios in which equity exposure and risk are easily measured and managed.
	
TAX EFFICIENCY

Due to passive management, low turnover and the unique “in kind” redemption process of ETFs, capital gains tax exposure is minimized. When redeemed, ETF shares are simply sold on the open market and the tax liability is usually based on the seller’s original purchase price for the ETF. The ability to buy and sell on the open market avoids the problem that mutual fund shareholders experience when fellow shareholders redeem shares from a fund.  In order to redeem those shares, the mutual fund may have to sell some of the securities it holds and realize a capital gain which is allocated to all shareholders. In addition, mutual funds are required to pay out all dividends and capital gains annually. So even if the portfolio has lost value that is unrealized, there is still a tax liability on the capital gains that does have to be realized.
	
GENERALLY OUTPERFORM MOST ACTIVELY-MANAGED MUTUAL FUNDS

In any given year, only about one-third of actively-managed equity mutual funds match the performance of their benchmark indexes. Over time it is extremely difficult for active managers to produce alpha consistently. Add the higher fees for active management to the equation and the long-term performance results look even worse. Because ETFs are designed to simply track the performance of well-established indexes, investors are not subject to the risk of the “negative alpha” produced by most active managers.

Powering Financial Independence


Smart Portfolios offers the complete solution for financial advisors:

Uses best-of-breed science behind its Dynamic Portfolio Optimization™ to provide superior asset allocation models for investment professionals. 
More accurately measures risk and expected return of securities and markets.
Provides a deeper understanding of the interdependencies between securities when diversifying assets.
Strategies are executed mainly through index-based ETFs, they can be freely traded at known prices while the market is open, they are narrow enough to express views about market sectors, and their performance is not subject to arbitrary shifts in sentiment or strategy on the part of their managers.



 We will work with you and your investment advisor to
          help you navigate your way to financial freedom. 

 It’s all about risk versus reward. Big events are more common than standard statistics would have us believe. With Smart Portfolios’ advanced risk technology we can better assess risk and shift our investments to optimize risk-adjusted returns. 
 Smart Portfolios offers a variety of options to help you create the right portfolio to meet your individual needs.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).

Smart Portfolios, LLC
      Smart Portfolios began as a builder and manager of custom trading algorithms for hedge fund, mutual fund and registered investment advisory firms. In 2004, the company learned of an exciting new theoretical framework for understanding markets, called Extreme Value Theory, which offered new mathematical algorithms applicable to asset allocation. Smart Portfolios seized on this opportunity and pioneered the application of Extreme Value Theory (EVT) by developing its Dynamic Portfolio Optimization™ asset allocation system. This state-of-the-art asset allocation methodology gives Smart’s financial engineers a better understanding of risk and diversification while providing a superior tool for forecasting returns. The mathematical algorithms taken from Extreme Value Theory represent a significant upgrade to the math used in traditional asset allocation models and allow a more accurate assessment and projection of risk-adjusted returns.
      Smart Portfolios differentiates itself by creating investment models that dynamically optimize portfolios based on current market activity, instead of relying on passive models that follow long-term historical trends. 

Common portfolio management models are based on the belief and hope that the long-term historical averages will prevail over time. This simplistic mean-average approach was born in an era when data was hard to come by and harder to process.

Academically this concept makes sense but it ignores the fact that investors have different goals and objectives and that market and economic conditions can change for extended periods of time. 
Historically, bull markets last an average of 18 years, bear markets 17 years and the financial markets can be entirely different from one year to the next.

Today we have extensive current market information and better tools (computers and algorithms) to process it. Smart's financial engineers have upgraded asset allocation similar to how weather forecasters have upgraded from the Farmers Almanac to a Doppler radar system.
 
Smart’s investment methodology follows a scientific process which accepts the fact that markets, securities, risk, return and correlation change constantly, as do the objectives and risk profiles of investors.

Investment Process


Modern Portfolio Theory, developed by Harry Markowitz during the 1950’s, was the first quantitative approach to asset allocation. Since then, the advancements in technology, mathematical algorithms, and experience have led to today’s most advanced portfolio optimization methodology, EVT (Extreme Value Theory).  When frequent extreme events keep being described in news reports as “once-in-a-thousand-years”, or  “once-in-ten-thousand-years,” common statistical methods and a common understanding of markets seem to be  lacking.  EVT not only accepts that extreme events occur; EVT allows their frequency and severity to be modeled and their risk to be managed.  Fundamentally, traditional models assume that markets are static; EVT begins with the assumption that markets change and that today’s market information is more valuable than long-term average data.

Smart Portfolios’ state-of-the art optimization solution using EVT is called Dynamic Portfolio Optimization. DPO replaces traditional asset allocation models with advanced analytics resulting in superior performance and risk management. The complete Smart investment process includes:



RISK MANAGEMENT

Here’s a paradox: The investment management industry acts as if the most frightening decision to make is that assets should sometimes be converted to safe investments in Treasurys and cash.  Is it because a tactical retreat is an admission of fear?  Is it to keep that responsibility on the shoulders of the investor?  Is it simply because common analytical models are weak?  

A second paradox: Although it is the result of complex analysis using state-of-the-art analysis, Smart Portfolios delivers a large part of its value by the simplest asset allocation decision: increase the fraction of the portfolio invested in cash or Treasurys.  

Finally, a third paradox: Although it’s conventional wisdom that an investor needs to accept higher risk to get a higher return, the highest return through a market cycle may be achieved by reducing risk at the right times (when risk is not being adequately compensated).  Over the medium-to-long term, maximized risk-adjusted returns may also be maximized absolute returns.

Risk management is the primary focus of Smart Portfolios and is the only way to achieve superior risk-adjusted returns.  We use state-of-the-art mathematics to forecast overall market risk as well as the risk and expected returns of our managed portfolios.  Smart Portfolios recognizes the trade-off between risk and return. Our strategy allows for the portfolio mix to be adjusted to compensate for the increases or decreases in forecasted risk-adjusted return.   Smart Portfolios runs frequent (monthly or more often) diagnostics to measure the change in the portfolio’s risk and return balance. In addition, we schedule quarterly back-testing and stress-testing of the models to identify any need for changes to the portfolio universe and/or to recalibrate the models’ risk metrics. 



FUND UNIVERSE SELECTION

Smart Portfolios screens a broad range of competing funds in each specified asset class or sector to identify which of them are best suited for consideration in the asset allocation model. We refer to that narrower range of investment choices, composed of dozens instead of hundreds of potential choices, as the model’s “universe.”  Screening factors include liquidity, diversity, volatility and expense ratios.  In addition to the traditional analytical tools used to analyze securities, Smart Portfolios uses its advanced mathematics to compare funds for historical, current and forecasted risk and return.  
  

DPO™ PORTFOLIO OPTIMIZATION

Smart Portfolios initiates the Dynamic Portfolio Optimization (DPO) process with a pre-screened universe of funds representing various asset classes and sectors. Unlike other asset allocation models that select assets from the top-down (first asset class, then sector, then fund), Smart Portfolios’ bottom-up approach starts by analyzing each potential investment individually. That individual “univariate” modeling process analyzes the historical and forecasted risk and return of a security assuming a fat-tailed distribution to more accurately assess risk and substitutes GARCH modeling for traditional mean-variance analysis so that changes in economic and market conditions will be factored into the analysis (not just assumed away). 

The second step, known as bivariate modeling, compares the relationships between pairs of securities.  Traditional models compare securities using simple linear correlation, which describes the average relationship between two securities over an extended period of time. Those models’ assumption of constant correlation ignores the fact that correlation increases in volatile markets, which is why passive diversification strategies fail during big sell-offs.    The Smart DPO model’s bivariate step upgrades this process by integrating a dynamic correlation function, called Copula Dependency, to raise DPO’s sensitivity to increases in volatility and trigger reductions in portfolio exposure when higher volatility begins to be detected. 

The final step in the optimization process, multivariate modeling, models the behavior of an entire portfolio of securities.  Smart incorporates an advanced ranking system to create the optimal asset mix (the “efficient frontier”).  Many allocation models refer to the optimal mix as the “efficient frontier,” but Smart’s multivariate model, using the DPO process, understands that the efficient frontier is continuously changing and that it may be very different from what it was last year or even last month; DPO determines the optimal risk-adjusted portfolio under current economic and market conditions. This optimization process is run periodically (monthly) to maximize portfolio efficiency.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
