(OTCQX: STND) ("Standard Financial"), the parent holding company for Standard Bank, PaSB ("Standard Bank") and Allegheny Valley Bancorp, Inc. (OTCQX: AVLY) ("Allegheny Valley Bancorp"), the parent holding company for Allegheny Valley Bank of Pittsburgh ("Allegheny Valley Bank"), jointly announced today the completion of the previously announced partnership of their financial institutions.  Effective close of business on April 7, 2017, Allegheny Valley Bancorp merged into Standard Financial and Allegheny Valley Bank will merge into Standard Bank. "We are very pleased that our merger of equals is now official.  We are committed to making the operational conversion of the two banks seamless and hassle-free for our customers and employees," explains Timothy K. Zimmerman, who will lead the resulting company as Chief Executive Officer. "We believe the combined bank, with a laser-focus on our customers and the communities we serve, will make a noticeable and positive contribution to the region." "We are excited to join these two storied franchises into one dynamic community bank. Standard Bank is poised to deliver enhanced products and service to our customers and communities and, we look forward to building upon Allegheny Valley Bank's historical success, while creating significant value for our shareholders," added Andrew W. Hasley, who will lead the resulting bank as President.  The conversion and consolidation of data processing platforms, systems and customer files is expected to occur in August 2017. The closing will result in a community banking franchise with total assets of nearly $1.0 billion and 18 branches located throughout Southwestern Pennsylvania and Western Maryland.  The united company will operate under the Standard Bank name while incorporating the Allegheny Valley Bank logo to provide both banks' customers with a sense of familiarity.  The holding company will be re-branded as Standard AVB Financial Corp.  The combined bank will be headquartered in Monroeville and its primary commercial banking hub will be located in Lawrenceville.  Six members of the previous Allegheny Valley Bancorp board of directors will join the boards of Standard AVB Financial Corp. and Standard Bank, creating a board consisting of 13 members.

We want to allow our clients to continue working hard on building their nest egg, while we work hard at maintaining and growing it at a rate that is consistent with there overall risk tolerance. Our job is not to make our clients wealthy, it’s to keep them wealthy, which is why we consider each relationship to be a partnership.  We will work together on staying current with our clients’ financial situations.  We know it can rapidly change in a matter of days.   We want to provide as many possible solutions to assist in keeping them on there current road to retirement, within their desired timeframe.

That’s the way we’re different from the rest of the industry:  our key policy is to always do what is best for our clients, even when they’re not looking!
Serving Our Clients
We are in the business of maintaining financial well-being for you and your family, and we do not take that lightly.  Therefore, while in pursuit of our clients’ financial goals, we always keep their financial objectives first at hand.  When making investment recommendations, it is our belief that our clients are best served if we can help them understand much of what we do pertaining to each investment.  We feel that diversity*, flexibility, and educated risk are key elements of financial success.
*Diversification does not guarantee a profit or protection against a loss in a declining market. It is a method used to help manage investment risk.
