Q1 2017 gross margin of 39.6%, a 170 basis point increase over the prior year period of 37.9%, as production efficiencies favorably impacted our results.

Q1 2017 net loss of $(2.8) million, a $1.4 million increase in net loss over the prior year period of $(1.4) million due to an increase in interest expense, partially offset by higher sales and operational efficiencies.

Order backlog increased again to $181 million driven by diversification of sales efforts and strong order patterns. This is the highest company backlog in 5 years.

Forming Fabrics
Decades ago, Xerium introduced the industry to synthetic forming fabric technology at a time when bronze wires were the standard. Shortly after, we then pioneered "X-Weave" extra shute product technology. Xerium also invented and introduced "SSB" class triple layer technology known as Huytexx delivering unprecedented machine performance and sheet quality.
Press Felts
Xerium's ancestors manufactured metal wires and woolen press felts two centuries ago, and quickly established an excellent reputation in the paper industry. As a result of more demanding paper machines coming online in recent years Xerium has set entirely new standards as the market-leading innovator in endless and seam felt technology.  
Dryer Fabrics
Xerium offers a wide variety of dryer fabrics for every position on the machine covering all paper grades.  Our woven styles are provided with pin seams or pin-spiral seams to fit the position requirements. In addition, we offer an excellent portfolio of spiral dryer fabrics for those applications with special requirements. 
Roll Covers
Xerium's Stowe Woodward roll cover product portfolio includes premium performance rubber, polyurethane, and composite technology engineered specifically for each application. Our innovative products are the standard by which roll technology is measured!  
Spreader Rolls
Xerium's Stowe and Mount Hope bowed spreader rolls products provide high-performance web and fabric smoothing for the most demanding applications. In addition, our portfolio includes all metal rolls as well as specially engineered sleeves for high temperature and high speed applications.
SMART® Technology
Xerium's roll product portfolio includes Stowe roll covers, Stowe and Mount Hope bowed spreader rolls, and SMART® Technology. Our roll cover products are engineered for each papermaking machine.  Our patented SMART® Technology uses embedded sensors in roll covers to dynamically measure nip conditions across numerous sections of the machine.
Mechanical Services
Xerium offers a full range of roll-related repairs and upgrades from On-the-Run (OTR) Roll Analysis, vibration analysis, internal inspection & repair, optical & laser alignment, suction box overhauls, to new shell constructions and much more.

The Machine Clothing segment provides various types of industrial textiles used on paper-making machines and other industrial applications. It offers forming fabrics that are used at the beginning of paper-making machines; press felts for carrying the paper sheet through a series of press rolls that mechanically press water from the sheet under high pressure; and dryer fabrics that transport the paper sheet through the drying section of paper-making machines. This segment also provides other fabrics, which are used in other industrial applications, such as pulp, non-woven textiles, fiber cement, tannery sludge dewatering, and textiles manufacturing; and machine clothing products. The Roll Covers segment manufactures, refurbishes, and replaces roll covers, including suction rolls, lump breaker rolls, coater rolls, sizing rolls, calendar rolls, and conveying rolls used in paper-making machines. This segment also provides refurbishment services for previously installed roll covers; and mechanical maintenance and repair services for the internal mechanisms of rolls, as well as manufactures and repairs spreader rolls. The company markets its products to the paper industry worldwide through its direct sales force under the Huyck Wangner, Weavexx, Stowe Woodward, Mount Hope, Robec, IRGA, Xibe/Stowe, JJ Plank, and Spencer Johnston brands.

Xerium Technologies Inc. Reports Unaudited Consolidated Earnings Results for the First Quarter Ended March 31, 2017; Provides Earnings Guidance for the Year 2017
May 1 17
Xerium Technologies Inc. reported unaudited consolidated earnings results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. For the quarter, the company reported net sales of $119,866,000 against $114,965,000 a year ago. Income from operations was $14,260,000 against $11,537,000 a year ago. Loss before provision for income taxes was $153,000 against income before provision for income taxes of $1,220,000 a year ago. Net loss was $2,834,000 or $0.18 per basic and diluted share against $1,445,000 or $0.09 per basic and diluted share a year ago. Net cash used in operating activities was $7,223,000 against net cash provided by operating activities of $15,103,000 a year ago. EBITDA was $21,204,000 against $19,555,000 a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA was $26,573,000 against $23,935,000 a year ago. Net debt was $524.9 million at the end of first quarter of 2017 compared to $511.7 million at the end of fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in income from operations was driven by higher sales and operational efficiencies. In addition to interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted EBITDA excludes expenses related to the company’s restructuring activities, plant start-up costs, stock-based compensation, foreign currency gains and losses and non-recurring expenses.


With an improving market environment and the expected impact of repositioning programs, the company expects 2017 full-year adjusted EBITDA to approximate 2016 levels, or be modestly higher. In addition, the company expects 2017 free cash flow to be modestly lower than the prior year, as higher cash interest and negative currency impacts will not be fully offset by improved operational cash flow.
