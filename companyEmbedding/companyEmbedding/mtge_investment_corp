AGNC Investment's Q2 2017 And 7/21/2017 BV Projection (Includes MTGE And NLY BV Projection) - AGNC Investment Corp. (NASDAQ:AGNC) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»AGNC Investment's Q2 2017 And 7/21/2017 BV Projection (Includes MTGE And NLY BV Projection)Jul.24.17 | About: AGNC Investment (AGNC) Scott Kennedy Value, mREITs, BDCs, dividend investingSummaryI am projecting AGNC Investment Corp. will report a minor decrease in quarterly BV for the second quarter of 2017.This projection is mainly due to minor-to-modest net price increases in most fixed-rate agency MBS coupons offset by a modest net decrease in the company's derivatives valuation.My projections for AGNC's BV per common share as of 6/30/2017 and 7/21/2017 are stated in the "Conclusions Drawn" section of the article.My projection for MTGE Investment Corp.'s BV per common share as of 6/30/2017 is stated near the "Conclusions Drawn" section of the article. I also discuss Annaly Capital Management's estimated BV as of 6/30/2017.The continued neutral/muted relationship between MBS prices and derivative instrument valuations should be seen as a cautious catalyst/trend regarding mREIT book values and stock valuations.Focus of Article The focus of this article is to provide a detailed projection of AGNC Investment Corp.'s (NASDAQ:AGNC) book value (“BV”) per common share as of 6/30/2017. Prior to results being provided to the public on 7/26/2017 (via the company’s quarterly press release), I would like to analyze AGNC's BV as of 6/30/2017 and provide readers a general direction on how I believe this recent quarter has panned out. A previous three-part article I wrote laid the ground works for this BV projection. In that article, I projected/analyzed the company’s income statement (technically speaking, its “consolidated statement of comprehensive income") for the second quarter of 2017. The links to that three-part projection article are provided below: AGNC Investment Corp.'s Q2 2017 Income Statement Projection - Part 1 (Including Current Recommendation)  AGNC Investment Corp.'s Q2 2017 Income Statement and EPS Projection - Part 2 AGNC Investment Corp.'s Q2 2017 Income Statement and EPS Projection - Part 3 By understanding the trends that occurred within AGNC's operations during the second quarter of 2017, one can apply this information to sector peers as well. As such, the discussion/analysis below is not solely applicable to AGNC but to the fixed-rate agency mortgage real estate investment trust (mREIT) sector as a whole. This includes, but is not limited to, the following fixed-rate agency mREIT peers: 1) Arlington Asset Investment Corp. (NYSE:AI); 2) ARMOUR Residential REIT Inc. (NYSE:ARR); 3) Cherry Hill Mortgage Investment Corp. (NYSE:CHMI); 4) CYS Investments Inc. (NYSE:CYS); 5) Annaly Capital Management Inc. (NYSE:NLY); and 6) Orchid Island Capital Inc. (NYSE:ORC). Technically speaking, several years ago AI changed its “entity status" from a REIT to a C-Corp. per the Internal Revenue Code ("IRC"). However, AI still maintained many “mREIT-like" characteristics, including the type of investments held by the company and the amount of annual dividend distributions paid to shareholders. 
 In addition, the following hybrid mREIT companies had at least a modest portion of each company’s MBS portfolio in fixed-rate agency MBS (also typically having higher durations): 1) Dynex Capital Inc. (NYSE:DX); 2) Invesco Mortgage Capital Inc. (NYSE:IVR); 3) MFA Financial Inc. (NYSE:MFA); 4) AG Mortgage Investment Trust Inc. (NYSE:MITT); 5) MTGE Investment Corp. (NASDAQ:MTGE); 6) Two Harbors Investment Corp. (NYSE:TWO); and 7) Western Asset Mortgage Capital Corp. (NYSE:WMC). As such, the analysis below is not solely applicable to one company but more so the agency/hybrid mREIT sector as a whole. This article will also include a brief BV discussion/projection regarding AGNC's affiliate MTGE and the company’s sector peer NLY. Overview of AGNC's Projected BV as of 6/30/2017 Due to the fact that several figures needed to project/calculate AGNC’s BV as of 6/30/2017 come directly from its consolidated statements of comprehensive income, Table 1 is provided below. Table 1 shows the company’s consolidated statements of comprehensive income from a three months-ended time frame. Using Table 1 below as a reference, one must add certain account figures from the first and second quarters of 2017 for purposes of projecting a suitable BV as of 6/30/2017. Table 1 - AGNC Three Months-Ended Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income  



 (Source: Table created entirely by myself, partially using data obtained from AGNC's quarterly investor presentation slides)
 Having provided Table 1 above, we can now begin to calculate its projected BV as of 6/30/2017. This projection will be calculated in Table 2 below. There will not be an identical sheet AGNC provides that matches the data within Table 2. I have gathered specific information derived from multiple tables/charts for a more detailed analysis of the company's BV as of 6/30/2017. AGNC, through its quarterly investor presentation slides (see link above), only provides the public with a “Book Value Roll Forward” slide. This specific slide uses information based only on a quarterly time frame. I perform a more detailed quarterly BV calculation/analysis based on the entire year. Table 2 - AGNC Three Months-Ended BV Projection (BV as of 6/30/2017)  

 (Source: Table created entirely by myself, including all calculated figures and projected valuations) Using Table 2 above as a reference, let us take a look at the calculation for AGNC's projected BV as of 6/30/2017. Unless otherwise noted, all figures below are for the “six months ended” time frame. Let us take a look at the following figures in corresponding order to the “Ref.” column shown in Table 2 (next to the June 30, 2017 column): A) Operations; B) Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) (OCI/(OCL)); C) Stockholder Transactions; and D) Capital Share Transactions. A) Operations - Increase in Net Common Equity From Operations Estimate of $56 Million; Range ($194)-$306 Million  - Confidence Within Range = Moderate to High - See Red Reference “A” in Table 2 Above Next to the June 30, 2017, Column This “net increase (decrease) in net common equity from operations" figure consists of the following amounts that come directly from the company's consolidated statement of comprehensive income (see Tables 1 and 2 above): 1) net interest income; 2) total other income (loss); 3) total expenses; and 4) excise tax.
 Due to the fact I discussed these amounts in my previous three-part AGNC consolidated statement of comprehensive income projection article (see links near the top), further discussion of this figure is redundant/unwarranted. B) Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) (OCI/(OCL)) - Increase in Net Common Equity From Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) Estimate of $205 Million; Range $5-405 Million - Confidence Within Range = Moderate to High  - See Red Reference “B” in Table 2 Above Next to the June 30, 2017, Column This “net increase (decrease) in net common equity from OCI/(OCL)” figure consists of the following accounts that come directly from the company's consolidated statement of comprehensive income (see Tables 1 and 2 above): 1) unrealized gain (loss) on available-for-sale (“AFS”) securities, net; and 2) unrealized gain (loss) on derivative instruments, net (upon reclassification to interest expense). Due to the fact I also discussed these accounts in my previous three-part AGNC consolidated statement of comprehensive income article (see links near the top), further discussion of this figure is redundant/unwarranted as well. C) Stockholder Transactions - Decrease in Net Common Equity From Stockholder Transactions Estimate of ($381) Million; Range ($391)-($371) Million  - Confidence Within Range = High  - See Red Reference “C” in Table 2 Above Next to the June 30, 2017, Column This “net increase (decrease) in net common equity from stockholder transactions” figure is AGNC's dividend distributions for the first and second quarters of 2017. This figure includes activity in relation to the following types of outstanding shares of stock: 1) common; and 2) preferred. 1) Common Stock Prior to projecting AGNC's common stock dividend distributions for the second quarter of 2017, let us first discuss how the number of the company’s outstanding shares of common stock could change during any given quarter. AGNC has the following four events/programs which could impact the number of outstanding shares of common stock it has when monthly dividends are declared: 1) public offering of shares (“bulk” issuance); 2) at-the-market (“ATM”) offering program; 3) dividend reinvestment/direct stock purchase program; and 4) stock repurchase program.
 On 5/2/2017, the company priced its previously announced public offering of 24.5 million shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $503 million. In addition, AGNC granted the underwriters the option to purchase an additional 3.7 million shares of its common stock (within 30 days). I am projecting the underwriters' option was fully exercised. As such, I am projecting AGNC’s outstanding shares of common stock increased 28.2 million shares from its recent public offering of shares. Even though AGNC’s stock price throughout the quarter traded slightly-to-modestly above its “tangible" BV as of 3/31/2017 ($19.31 per share), I am making the assumption there was no activity within the company's ATM offering or dividend reinvestment/direct stock purchase programs during the second quarter of 2017. My reasoning is mainly due to the May 2017 equity offering described above. When it comes to AGNC’s repurchase program, this was created in October 2012 and was fairly recently amended in October 2016 to allow the company to repurchase up to $1 billion of its outstanding shares of common stock through 12/31/2017. As of 3/31/2017, the company had $1 billion remaining under its stock repurchase program. AGNC intends to buy back outstanding shares of common stock only when the repurchase price is materially accretive to CURRENT tangible BV. Since the stock price traded modestly-to-materially above the company’s “tangible” BV as of 3/31/2017 throughout the second quarter of 2017, I believe management did not repurchase any outstanding shares of common stock. The dividend declared on AGNC's common stock for the second quarter of 2017 totaled $0.54 per share. This was an unchanged dividend when compared to the prior quarter. When calculated, I am projecting AGNC had dividend distributions to common shareholders of ($189) million for the second quarter of 2017. When combined, I am projecting the company had dividend distributions to common shareholders of ($368) million for the six months ended 6/30/2017. Now let us project the preferred stock dividend distributions.
 2) Preferred Stock The dividend declared on AGNC’s “Series A Preferred Stock” (AGNCP) and “Series B Preferred Stock” (AGNCB) for the second quarter of 2017 was $0.50 per share and $0.484375 per depositary share, respectively. As such, this was an unchanged dividend when compared to the prior quarter. There were still 6.9 and 7.0 million outstanding shares of AGNCP and AGNCB as of 6/28/2017, respectively (ex-dividend date). When calculated, I am projecting AGNC had dividend distributions to AGNCP and AGNCB shareholders of ($3.5) and ($3.4) million for the second quarter of 2017, respectively. When combined, I am projecting the company had dividend distributions to preferred shareholders of ($13.7) million (rounded) for the six months ended 6/30/2017. After combining the common and preferred stock dividend distributions for the first and second quarters of 2017, I am projecting AGNC’s total “distributions to stockholders from estimated REIT taxable income/undistributed taxable income (“UTI”)” and decrease in net common equity from stockholder transactions was ($381) million (rounded) for the six months ended 6/30/2017 (see red reference “C” in Table 2 above). D) Capital Share Transactions - Increase in Net Common Equity From Capital Share Transactions Estimate of $555 Million; Range $475-575 Million - Confidence Within Range = High  - See Red Reference “D” in Table 2 Above Next to the June 30, 2017, Column As stated earlier, on 5/2/2017 AGNC priced its previously announced public offering of 24.5 million shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $503 million. In addition, the company granted the underwriters the option to purchase an additional 3.7 million shares of its common stock (within 30 days). I am projecting the underwriters’ option was fully exercised. This calculates to additional gross proceeds of approximately $75 million. After accounting for all offering costs and the underwriters’ discount, I am projecting AGNC’s net proceeds from its May 2017 equity offering was approximately $555 million.
 In addition, I am making the assumption no additional shares of common stock were issued under its ATM offering or dividend reinvestment/direct stock purchase programs during the second quarter of 2017. Also, since there were no additional preferred stock equity offerings during the second quarter of 2017, the following figures should have no activity: 1) issuance of preferred stock; and 2) preferred stock $25,000 per share liquidation preference.  Since AGNC officially internalized its management structure through its acquisition of American Capital Mortgage Management (“ACMM”) last year, management may be partially compensated through the issuance of common stock subject to certain vesting options. As such, the company may have some minor amount of equity issuance through the following accounts: 1) issuance of restricted stock; and/or 2) issuance of common stock under stock-based compensation program. However, due to the immaterial impact such restricted stock and/or stock-based compensation would represent, I have projected no amount within these two accounts during the second quarter of 2017. Any actual amount of restricted stock and/or stock-based compensation during the second quarter of 2017 (through the issuance of new shares) would only have a fractional per share impact on its BV as of 6/30/2017.   Regarding AGNC’s “repurchases of common stock” figure, as stated earlier, I am making the assumption management did not purchase any outstanding shares of common stock under its stock repurchase program during the second quarter of 2017. Therefore, I am projecting the company had a “net common equity from capital share transactions” figure of $555 million for the six months ended 6/30/2017 (see red reference “D” in Table 2 above). MTGE’s Projected BV as of 6/30/2017 When compared to AGNC, I am projecting MTGE had a slightly more favorable BV per share fluctuation (percentage-wise) for the second quarter of 2017. Each company’s agency MBS and derivatives portfolios as of 3/31/2017 had several similarities, which were discussed in my three-part AGNC income statement projection article (see links near the top). However, it should also be noted MTGE had a much larger non-agency MBS portfolio (with an attractive cost basis) and has recently “branched out” to invest in skilled nursing facilities and seniors housing. In comparison, AGNC has a very minor investment in AAA non-agency MBS and no exposure to the healthcare sector.
 When taking all quarterly activities into consideration (including additional data not discussed within this specific article), I am projecting MTGE will report the following BV per common share as of 6/30/2017: MTGE’s Projected BV as of 6/30/2017 = $19.55 Per Common Share (Range $19.05-20.05 Per Common Share) NLY’s BV as of 6/30/2017 As was highlighted in my three-part AGNC income statement projection article (see links near the top of this article), I discussed several differences between AGNC’s and NLY’s investment portfolio. Furthermore, it was discussed each company had a different strategy regarding derivative instruments going into the second quarter of 2017 (most notably the difference between each company’s hedging coverage ratio as of 3/31/2017). Simply put, NLY’s lower hedging coverage ratio at the start of the second quarter of 2017 was an advantage for the company when compared to AGNC. In addition, it should also be noted management has recently broadened NLY’s investment portfolio by allocating more capital into commercial debt/real estate, preferred equity, corporate debt, and most recently middle market (“MM”) lending. Furthermore, NLY recently acquired a variable-rate agency mREIT, Hatteras Financial Corp. (NYSE:HTS). Generally speaking these asset classes, when compared to fixed-rate agency MBS, performed similarly during the second quarter of 2017. On 7/17/2017, along with NLY’s announcement of a July 2017 equity offering, the company provided preliminary results to the public regarding its second quarter of 2017. Along with several other operating performance metrics, it announced an estimated BV as of 6/30/2017 of $11.19 per common share. Within the following MBS pricing article dated 6/20/2017, I projected NLY’s BV as of 6/16/2017 was $11.30 per common share (when INCLUDING the quarterly dividend accrual of $0.30 per common share, which had yet to occur as of 6/16/2017; the ex dividend date was 6/28/2017): Annaly Capital And CYS Investments: MBS Pricing For Q2 2017 (Includes Current BV Projections)
 Due to the negative relationship that existed between most MBS prices and derivative instrument valuations during the last two weeks of the quarter, I projected NLY’s BV as of 6/30/2017 was $11.20 per common share (prior to management providing quarterly results; several readers privately asked for my projection, which I provided as support). As such, I believe its preliminary estimated BV as of 6/30/2017 was basically an exact match to my projected BV. NLY’s Projected BV as of 6/30/2017 (Prior to Management’s Disclosure of Preliminary Results on 7/17/2017) = $11.20 Per Common Share (Range $10.80-11.40 Per Common Share) NLY’s Estimated BV as of 6/30/2017 Per Management’s Disclosure of Preliminary Results on 7/17/2017 = $11.19 Per Common Share Conclusions Drawn To sum up all the information discussed above, I am projecting AGNC will report the following BV per common share as of 6/30/2017: AGNC’s Projected BV as of 6/30/2017 = $20.72 Per Common Share (Range $20.22-21.22 Per Common Share)  This projection is a ($0.26) per common share decrease from its BV as of 3/31/2017. This minor decrease can be attributed to two factors. The first factor is in relation to the activity within the company's consolidated statement of comprehensive income. I am projecting AGNC will report a net loss of ($20) million for the second quarter of 2017, while reporting OCI of $159 million. When both figures are combined, I am projecting AGNC will report comprehensive income of $139 million for the second quarter of 2017. The second factor is in relation to the activity within AGNC’s equity section of the balance sheet. The company paid for/accrued dividend distributions totaling ($0.54) per common share during the second quarter of 2017. In addition, it paid for/accrued dividend distributions in regard to holders of the company's outstanding shares of preferred stock. Furthermore, AGNC's May 2017 equity offering resulted in some minor dilution. When combined, these two factors account for a projected quarterly BV decrease of ($0.26) per common share. When calculated, I am projecting AGNC’s BV per common share had a decrease of (1.24%) during the second quarter of 2017. I am also projecting the company generated an “economic return” (dividends paid/accrued for and net change in BV) of 1.37% for the second quarter of 2017. 
 Similar to the prior quarter, there was a more “neutral/muted” relationship between MBS prices and derivative instrument valuations during the second quarter of 2017 (“option adjusted spreads”, or OAS).  As such, I believe most mREIT peers will report only a minor (less than 5%) fluctuation in quarterly BV. With that being said, I believe most mREIT stock prices have already “priced in” this more neutral/muted relationship when it comes to sector valuations.  I believe four key factors to analyze within the fixed-rate agency mREIT sector this quarter are the following: 1) each company’s proportion of 15-year MBS holdings versus 30-year MBS holdings; 2) each company’s hedging coverage ratio; 3) each company’s proportion of long-term derivative instruments versus short-term derivative instruments; and 4) each company’s proportion of specified pools (for instance HARP and LLB securities). Dependent upon these factors, I believe results will slightly vary across most of the fixed-rate agency mREIT sector for the second quarter of 2017. Looking ahead to the third quarter of 2017, mortgage interest rates first increased and then recently have reversed course (through 7/21/2017). The fixed-pay rate on interest rate swaps and U.S. Treasury yields have also seen the same trend through 7/21/2017 (when compared to 6/30/2017) . However, the forward LIBOR curve has remained relatively unchanged.  In addition, it should be noted the relationship between agency MBS pricing and derivative instrument valuations has been slightly positive through the first three weeks of July (minor tightening of spreads).  Through a detailed analysis that will be omitted from this particular article, I am projecting AGNC’s BV as of 7/21/2017 has fluctuated between ($0.10) and $0.30 per common share when compared to the company’s BV as of 6/30/2017. This projection excludes the July 2017 monthly dividend of $0.18 per common share (ex-dividend is 7/27/2017). My BUY, SELL, or HOLD Recommendation From the analysis provided above, including additional catalysts/factors not discussed within this particular article, I currently rate AGNC as a SELL when I believe the company’s stock price is trading at less than a (2.5%) discount to my projected BV as of 6/30/2017, a HOLD when trading at or greater than a (2.5%) but less than a (10.0%) discount to my projected BV as of 6/30/2017, and a BUY when trading at or greater than a (10.0%) discount to my projected BV as of 6/30/2017. These ranges are unchanged when compared to PART 1 of my income statement projection article (approximately three weeks ago).
 Therefore, I currently rate AGNC as a SELL (however, fairly close to my HOLD range), since the stock is trading at less than a (2.5%) discount to my projected BV as of 6/30/2017. My current price target for AGNC is approximately $20.25 per share. This is currently the price where my recommendation would change to a HOLD. The current price where my recommendation would change to a BUY is approximately $18.65 per share.       Along with the data presented within this article, this recommendation considers the following mREIT catalysts/factors: 1) projected future MBS price movements; 2) projected future derivative valuations; and 3) projected near-term dividend per share rates. This recommendation also considers the high probability of multiple Federal (“Fed”) Funds Rate increases by the FOMC during 2017-2018 (this is a more hawkish view when compared to most of last year) due to recent macroeconomic trends/events. This also considers the eventual “wind-down” of the Fed’s balance sheet.   Final Note: Each investor's BUY, SELL, or HOLD decision is based on one's risk tolerance, time horizon, and dividend income goals. My personal recommendation will not fit each reader’s current investing strategy. The factual information provided within this article is intended to help assist readers when it comes to investing strategies/decisions.   During January-March 2014, I initiated (and subsequently add to) a position in MTGE at a weighted average purchase price of $18.47 per share. On 3/4/2016 and 4/8/2016, I directly increased my position in the stock at a weighted average purchase price of $14.36 and $14.47 per share, respectively. These two combined purchases had the same approximate monetary value of my combined 2014 purchases. My entire MTGE position had a weighted average purchase price of $16.443 per share. On 6/15/2017, I sold my entire MTGE position at a weighted average price of $19.09 per share, as my price target of $19.10 was met that day. My MTGE total return (when including change in stock price and dividends received/gains on reinvested dividends) was 45.4%. My 2016 purchases were disclosed, at the time, to readers in subsequent AGNC articles over the following several months. My 2017 sale was disclosed to readers in “real time” (that day) via the StockTalks feature of Seeking Alpha.
 On 11/27/2015, I initiated a position in AGNCB; Series B preferred stock. On 12/7/2015, 12/9/2015, 12/14/2015, 1/14/2016, and 1/20/2016 I selectively increased my position in AGNCB. When combined, my AGNCB position has a weighted average purchase price of $23.215 per share. This weighted average per share price excludes all dividends received/reinvested. I currently hold (personally and through affiliated entities) 0.71% of the outstanding shares of AGNCB. Each AGNCB trade was disclosed to readers in real time (that day) via the StockTalks feature of Seeking Alpha.     On 7/21/2017, I initiated a position in AGNCP; Series A preferred stock. My AGNCP position has a weighted average purchase price of $25.325 per share. I currently hold (personally) 0.35% of the outstanding shares of AGNCP. This AGNCP trade was disclosed to readers in real time (that day) via the StockTalks feature of Seeking Alpha. All trades/investments I have performed over the past few years have been disclosed to readers in real time (that day at the latest) via the StockTalks feature of Seeking Alpha.

				 25 July, 2017,  15:04 | Author: Terri Saunders			













AGNC Investment Corp. - Cumulat declared a dividend that was paid on Monday the 17th of July 2017. The real estate investment trust reported $0.63 EPS for the quarter, topping the Thomson Reuters' consensus estimate of $0.49 by $0.14.

Equities research analysts anticipate that American Capital Agency Corp. will post $2.43 EPS for the current year. Short shares fell from 5,232 to 4,063 over that timeframe. Keefe, Bruyette & Woods reissued a "buy" rating and set a $18.00 price objective on shares of American Capital Mortgage Investment Corp.in a research report on Monday, April 10th.

MTGE Investment Corp. Declares First Quarter Dividend On Its Series A Preferred Stock


Mar 16, 2017 5:00 PM EDT









This Stock Has A 9.82% Yield, Sells For Less Than Book, and Insiders Have Been Buying

The officers and directors of a company tend to have a unique insider's view of the business, and presumably the only reason an insider would choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money — maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/26/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Preferred securities are subject to interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, preferred securities prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Preferred securities also have credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties, liquidity risk, and if callable, call risk. Dividend or interest payments on preferred securities may be variable, suspended or deferred by the issuer at any time, and missed or deferred payments may not be paid at a future date.  If payments are suspended or deferred by the issuer, the deferred income may still be taxable. See your tax advisor for more details.  Most Preferred securities have call features which allow the issuer to redeem the securities at its discretion on specified dates as well as upon the occurrence of certain events.  Other early redemption provisions may exist which could affect yield.  Certain preferred securities are convertible into common stock of the issuer, therefore, their market prices can be sensitive to changes in the value of the issuer's common stock.  Some preferred securities are perpetual, meaning they have no stated maturity date.  In the case of preferred securities with a stated maturity date, the issuer may, under certain circumstances, extend this date at its discretion.  Extension of maturity date would delay repayment of principal on the securities.  Please read the prospectus, which may be located on the SEC's EDGAR system, to understand the terms, conditions and specific features of the security prior to investing.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity. Fidelity does not endorse or adopt their content. Fidelity makes no guarantees that information supplied is accurate, complete, or timely, and does not provide any warranties regarding results obtained from their use.Any data, charts and other information provided on this page are intended for research purposes to help self-directed investors evaluate many types of securities including, but not limited to common stocks, American Depository Receipts, Master Limited Partnerships, real estate investment trusts. traditional preferred stock, trust preferred securities, third-party trust certificates, convertible securities, mandatory convertible securities and other exchange-traded equity and/or debt securities.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
