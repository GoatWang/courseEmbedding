 April 11, 2017Northern Dynasty: State of Alaska approves Pebble Project land use permit
 April 11, 2017, Vancouver, BC - Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd. (TSX: NDM; NYSE MKT: NAK) ("Northern Dynasty" or the "Company") announces that its 100%-owned US subsidiary Pebble Limited Partnership ("Pebble Partnership") has received notice of approval of a Miscellaneous Land Use Permit ("MLUP") from the Alaska Department of Natural Resources ("DNR") for its ongoing activities at the Pebble Project in southwest Alaska.

"The Alaska Department of Natural Resources and other state agencies have had an active oversight presence at the Pebble Project site for more than a decade, and have confirmed that Pebble is a well-managed exploration project," said Tom Collier, Pebble Partnership CEO. "We will continue our site operations in 2017 in full compliance with the State's permit conditions, and in a manner that protects the broader public interest in the lands and resources surrounding the Pebble property."

The Pebble Partnership is in the process of reviewing in detail the state land use permit received today. However, Collier confirmed Pebble will be advancing a program of work in Alaska in 2017 to prepare the project to initiate permitting under the Clean Water Act and National Environmental Policy Act.

Given the extensive work undertaken at the Pebble Project over the past decade or more, and anticipated future activity, the 2017 MLUP includes a requirement for a performance guaranty in the amount of $2 million related to any potential reclamation liability.

The Pebble Partnership maintains an operations base in Iliamna, Alaska with full-time staff responsible for care and maintenance of Pebble Project equipment, facilities and installations. Each year, Pebble staff undertake a program of inspections, and where necessary make repairs to ensure public safety and enhance reclamation, at the 1,300+ borehole sites on the property.

Chief Financial OfficerForward Looking Information and other Cautionary FactorsThis release includes certain statements that may be deemed "forward-looking statements". All statements in this release, other than statements of historical facts, that address exploration drilling, exploitation activities and events or developments that the Company expects are forward-looking statements. Although the Company believes the expectations expressed in its forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, such statements should not be in any way construed as guarantees of the ultimate size, quality or commercial feasibility of the Pebble Project or of the Company's future performance or the outcome of litigation. Assumptions used by the Company to develop forward-looking statements include the following: the Pebble Project will obtain all required environmental and other permits and all land use and other licenses, studies and development of the Pebble Project will continue to be positive, and no geological or technical problems will occur.  The likelihood of future mining at the Pebble Project is subject to a large number of risks and will require achievement of a number of technical, economic and legal objectives, including obtaining necessary mining and construction permits, approvals, licenses and title on a timely basis and delays due to third party opposition, changes in government policies regarding mining and natural resource exploration and exploitation, the final outcome of any litigation, completion of pre-feasibility and final feasibility studies, preparation of all necessary engineering for surface or underground mining and processing facilities as well as receipt of significant additional financing to fund these objectives as well as funding mine construction. Such funding may not be available to the Company on acceptable terms or on any terms at all. There is no known ore at the Pebble Project and there is no assurance that the mineralization at the Pebble Project will ever be classified as ore. The need for compliance with extensive environmental and socio-economic rules and practices and the requirement for the Company to obtain government permitting can cause a delay or even abandonment of a mineral project. The Company is also subject to the specific risks inherent in the mining business as well as general economic and business conditions. For more information on the Company, Investors should review the Company's filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and its home jurisdiction filings that are available at www.sedar.com.

Why Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd Stock Jumped 12% This Morning


July 12, 2017, 01:06:00 PM EDT
By Rich Smith, Motley Fool










































 What happened Shares of would-be goldminer   Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd    (NYSEMKT: NAK) , the company that is hoping to open up a "Pebble"   goldmining project in Alaska, surged more than 12% in early   Wednesday trading, before settling down to enjoy a more muted   gain of 4.1% as of 11:45 p.m. EDT. So what On Tuesday, after close of trading, Northern Dynasty announced   that the US Environmental Protection Agency has agreed to   withdraw its 2014 Clean Water Act Proposed Determination. If left in place, this determination would have restricted   Northern Dynasty's ability to develop its Pebble Project.   Removed, however, it now permits Northern Dynasty to proceed with   obtaining a final Environmental Impact Statement for the Pebble   Project from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Assuming a   positive finding from the Corps, Northern Dynasty will be able to   proceed with obtaining a permit to begin mining, according to the   "normal course" for obtaining such permits.   Image source: Getty Images. Now what Although this is good news for Northern Dynasty,   it was hardly unexpected    . It has been known as far back as May that Northern Dynasty had   a settlement agreement in place with the EPA that would permit   this. What remains unknown is whether the Corps will indeed give   Northern Dynasty a positive environmental impact statement. And   even if the Corps gives it the all clear, we also don't know   whether Northern Dynasty will be able to attract the kind of   funding it will need to make the Pebble Project a success.   Northern Dynasty said in its statement on Tuesday that it "is now   focused on qualifying and securing a new major funding partner   for the Pebble Project" -- meaning it does not yet have one in   hand. For that matter, even assuming everything else works out   right, there's still no guarantee Northern Dynasty will find   enough gold, and be able to extract it profitably enough, to make   the Pebble Project a success. Profitless, revenue-less, and with only $42 million in cash in   the bank, Northern Dynasty Minerals stock remains a speculative   investment.   10 stocks we like better than Northern Dynasty     Minerals       When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip,     it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run     for over a decade,     Motley Fool Stock Advisor      , has tripled the market.* David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the      10 best stocks       for investors to buy right now... and Northern Dynasty Minerals     wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks     are even better buys.

Written by SmallCapPower.com
Shares of Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd. (TSX:NDM), which explores one of the world’s largest copper-gold resource at its Pebble project in Alaska, have been seen in a more favourable light recently on positive developments related to the settlement with the EPA.

Northern Dynasty Minerals' stock had been on an upward trend in anticipation of favorable news going back to March, 2017.
Then on April 12,  2017, its share price zoomed nearly 32% to reach $1.89 on news that the Alaska Department of Natural Resources issued a notice of approval of Miscellaneous Land Use Permit for the Pebble Project.
In the run up to the settlement, the shares surged nearly 28% on May 8 and 9 to close at $2.84 but had been on a gradual decline due to the “buy on rumor” and “sell on news” behaviour of investors.
Northern Dynasty Minerals' stock gained 8% post the July 11 news of the EPA beginning the process to withdraw its earlier restriction under the CWA.

Investment Thesis 

On May 12th, Northern Dynasty Minerals announced the legal settlement with EPA, which should pave the way for the development of the Pebble project
The Pebble copper-gold hosts contained resources of 57 billion pounds of copper and 70 M ozt of gold
Balance sheet is healthy with $54.7 million of cash equivalents and no debt

Legal settlement with EPA clears obstacles for Pebble mine development
After nearly a decade of litigations with regulators, Northern Dynasty Minerals announced on May 12 2017, that it reached a settlement agreement with the U.S. EPA that allows the Pebble Project to proceed into normal course permitting under the CWA and National Environmental Policy Act.
On July 11, 2017, consequent to the settlement agreement, the EPA began a process to withdraw a Proposed Determination it issued under the Clean Water Act in 2014, which paves the way for the normal development of the large copper and gold Pebble Project.

Hope Continues to Drive Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd. Stock Higher
The gold-mine developer is up again today.











                Matthew DiLallo
            

                (TMFmd19)



            
            May 9, 2017 at 4:29PM
            
            





What happened
Shares Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd. (NYSEMKT:NAK) popped again on Tuesday and were up 12% at 2:45 p.m. EDT. That continued the gold-mine developer's recent string of rallies that have taken the stock up 27% over the past week.
So what
Today's rally, like the ones over the past week, is directly related to last week's announcement that the company's wholly-owned U.S. subsidiary Pebble Limited Partnership has signed a deal with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. For a refresher, it filed a Joint Motion in federal court to "extend a stay of proceedings in the parties' long-standing legal dispute over the federal agency's pre-emptive regulatory action under Section 404(c) of the Clean Water Act to May 11, 2017." With that deadline drawing closer, investors are getting increasingly optimistic that the company will finalize a settlement so it can take the next step toward developing its Alaskan Pebble Deposit, the world's largest undeveloped copper and gold resource.

That said, the resolution with the EPA is just one step in a long process before the company can ever turn Pebble's mineral riches into cash flow for shareholders. Northern Dynasty Minerals also would need to re-partner the project, so it has the money to help finance development. Furthermore, it needs to reposition the project to regain public support. In the meantime, it has a slew of permits, studies and other agreements to complete before it can start construction -- which, if everything goes according to plan, wouldn't begin until 2020. That would put the company on pace to start producing from the mine in 2024.





Now what
Northern Dynasty Minerals believes it is sitting on the largest untapped deposit of copper and gold in the world. However, getting to that buried treasure has proven to be excruciatingly challenging. While the project is starting to move in the right direction, it will be years before investors see tangible value in the form of production and cash flow. This stock remains nothing more than a vehicle for traders hoping to earn a big payday should the company finally get the green light to develop this project.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
