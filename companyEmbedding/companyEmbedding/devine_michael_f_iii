Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/23/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

If an executives employment agreement is terminated by Coach without Cause, or by the executive for Good Reason, then the executive will be entitled to receive severance payments equal to 12 months (for Mr. Krakoff, Mr. Tucci and Mr. Devine) or 24 months (for Mr. Frankfort) annual base salary plus 75% of maximum annual bonus, as well as a pro-rated annual bonus for the year of termination, subject to certain exceptions described in the Agreements, payable in equal monthly installments between six and 12 months (for Mr. Krakoff, Mr. Tucci and Mr. Devine) or six and 24 months (for Mr. Frankfort) from the executives termination
date. In addition, if the executives employment is terminated without Cause or for Good Reason, all unvested stock options and restricted stock units would continue to become vested on the dates described above and the stock options will remain exercisable for the remainder of the 10-year term. If the termination occurs within six months before or 12 months after a change of control of 20% or more of the combined voting power of the Company, then the options and restricted stock units granted in connection with the employment agreement will become fully vested immediately prior to such termination and will remain vested for the remainder of their 10-year term. Finally, if the executives employment is terminated without Cause or for Good Reason, Coach will continue to provide the executive with specified health and welfare benefits for 12 months (for Mr. Krakoff, Mr. Tucci and Mr. Devine) or 24 months (for Mr. Frankfort) after the executives termination. The foregoing
does not apply to Mr. Mondas Transition Employment Agreement, which does not contain comparable provisions. 
The Company has Cause to terminate an executive under his employment agreement upon: (i) the executives failure to attempt in good faith to substantially perform his duties (other than any such failure resulting from the executives physical or mental incapacity) which is not remedied within 30 days after receipt of written notice from the Company specifying such failure; (ii) the executives failure to attempt in good faith to carry out, or comply with, in any material respect any lawful and reasonable directive of the Board, which is not remedied within 30 days after receipt of written notice from the Company specifying
such failure; (iii) the executives commission at any time of any act or omission that results in, or may reasonably be expected to result in, a conviction, plea of no contest or imposition of unadjudicated probation for any felony (or any other crime involving fraud, embezzlement, material misconduct or misappropriation having a material adverse impact on the Company); (iv) the executives unlawful use (including being under the influence) or possession of illegal drugs on the Companys premises or while performing the executives duties and responsibilities; or (v) the executives willful commission at any time of any act of fraud, embezzlement, misappropriation, misconduct or breach of fiduciary duty against the Company (or any predecessor thereto or successor thereof), having a material adverse impact on the Company.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
An executive has Good Reason to resign his employment upon the occurrence of any of the following: (i) failure of the Company to continue the executive in the position stated in his agreement (or any other position not less senior to such position); (ii) a material diminution in the nature or scope of the executives responsibilities, duties or authority; (iii) relocation of the Companys executive offices more than 50 miles outside of New York, New York or relocation of executive away from the executive offices; (iv) failure of the Company to timely make any material payment or provide any material benefit under the agreement
or the Companys material reduction of any compensation, equity or benefits that the executive is eligible to receive under the Agreement; or (v) the Companys material breach of the agreement; provided, however, that an executive may not resign his employment for Good Reason unless: (x) the executive provides the Company with at least 30 days prior written notice of his intent to resign for Good Reason (which notice is provided not later than the 60th day following the occurrence of the event constituting Good Reason) and (y) the Company does not remedy the alleged violation(s) within such 30-day period; and, provided, further, that executive may resign his employment for Good Reason if in connection with any Change in Control (as defined in the agreement) the surviving entity does not assume the agreement (or, with the written consent of the executive, substitute a substantially identical agreement) with respect to the executive in writing delivered to the
executive prior to, or as soon as reasonably practicable following, the occurrence of such Change in Control. 
The agreements contain covenants that prohibit the executives from competing with the business of Coach, soliciting Coachs employees, vendors or wholesale customers, disclosing Coachs confidential information or violating Coachs intellectual property rights during their employment with us and for a period of 12 months (for Mr. Krakoff, Mr. Tucci, Mr. Devine) or 24 months (for Mr. Frankfort) afterward. If an executive violates these covenants, he will forfeit any remaining unexercised stock options, unvested restricted stock units, cash payments and health and welfare benefits under his agreement. In addition, he may be required to
forfeit any gains on stock options or restricted stock units granted in connection with his employment agreement that the executive realized during a period of 12 months (for Mr. Krakoff, Mr. Tucci, Mr. Devine) or 24 months (for Mr. Frankfort) prior to violating these covenants; in addition, Mr. Krakoff may be required to repay any retention bonuses that he received during such 12-month period. Mr. Monda is also subject to these same restrictions pursuant to his Transition Employment Agreement until August 10, 2010.
