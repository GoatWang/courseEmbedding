By 2006, Jay Grinney had gotten used to constantly putting out fires at HealthSouth. The depths of the problem with HealthSouth's corporate office were far greater than he had anticipated. That's the nature of accounting fraud: It's difficult to know which numbers to trust, and which numbers are fabricated.
Today's HealthSouth is largely unrecognizable from its past. Grinney is only the company's second CEO, and he announced last month that at 65, he will retire at the end of this year. The company has returned to normal - a feat that, when Grinney entered the picture, very few thought was possible.
Grinney had left his job at competing Hospital Corporation of America in Nashville in 2004. He was President of the healthcare company's Eastern Group, managing some 100 hospitals. He knew of HealthSouth's problems: in 2003, the company's founder and CEO Richard Scrushy had been fired after regulators had charged him with sweeping accounting fraud.
HealthSouth was among the largest publicly traded healthcare companies in the country at the time, and while working for a direct competitor he saw that HealthSouth's hospitals were really very good. So he saw the company as fixable: the problems were isolated to the corporate headquarters. There was a product worth saving.
But upon starting work at HealthSouth, Grinney learned that the problems at the headquarters ran far beyond fraud - the company that had grown largely through acquisitions had never been streamlined into a company that could run well, and it largely lacked any disciplinary controls.
He was living in temporary housing in Inverness, and was working so much he rarely saw any part of Birmingham that wasn't in that three-mile stretch of U.S. 280.
He was having problems with his then-wife - the pair divorced in 2005.
In 2006, he was diagnosed with cancer.
A 'Herculean' task
The cancer isn't what Grinney remembers most about 2006. In fact, he recalls only missing maybe two days of work as a result of it. He had surgery to remove the tumor, and was advised to do radiation and possibly chemotherapy. He chose instead to only get the surgery and rigorously monitor for resurgences, which never came.
"It never really occurred to me that it would be worse than that," Grinney said. "There was a lot going on and I didn't really have time to think about it, I guess."
HealthSouth was still in crisis, and he didn't have the energy to spare for chemotherapy.
That same year, Grinney had just achieved what he had called a "Herculean" task - HealthSouth had fixed problems discovered as a result of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, a federal act designed to prevent accounting fraud passed largely in response to recent accounting scandals at companies like Enron and Worldcom. The law required publicly traded companies to do assessments of internal controls and look for any weaknesses, the most severe of which was called a "material weakness." Grinney expected to find several such weaknesses at HealthSouth in 2004, especially within the accounting department.
Grinney did not expect to find several dozen material weaknesses, many of which were completely unrelated to fraud. Most companies only had two or three of these weakness, many had none at all.
"We had more material weaknesses than any other company I had heard of," Grinney said. "We had dozens and dozens."
Fixing those weaknesses went largely unnoticed by shareholders at the time, Grinney said. In some ways that makes sense - HealthSouth was dealing with many higher profile issues, like paying down the $4.2 billion in debt. Most of that debt was taken out under Scrushy to pay for expansions, and federal prosecutors said those expansions were really a ruse to hide accounting fraud. Grinney lists fixing those material weaknesses as among his proudest achievements in his 12 years as CEO.
It was earlier this year that Grinney was told he no longer had to have his annual evaluations to see if the cancer has returned; he's as in the clear as one can be as a cancer survivor.
Declining to declare
If you ask Grinney what he's proudest of in his 12-year tenure at HealthSouth, he'll tell you it's the team he put together.
Birmingham attorney John Somerville represented HealthSouth shareholders in a derivative suit and won a $2.8 billion judgment against Scrushy on behalf of the company. Somerville worked closely with Grinney in that suit, and he'll tell you Grinney leaves behind a legacy far greater than just his staff.
"The survival of HealthSouth is Jay Grinney's legacy," Somerville said.
Somerville also represented Sterne Agee's former Chief Financial Officer in an unrelated lawsuit against the financial company and its CEO James Holbrook Jr., alleging fraud, breach of contract, conversion and defamation. Somerville's client was fired in 2012 for what Sterne Agee called accounting mistakes, while his client holds that it was because he attempted to stop Holbrook's fraud; in 2014, it was reported that the U.S. Department of the Treasury was investigating Holbrook for fraud.
Sterne Agee, which was headquartered in Birmingham and was one of the nation's largest and oldest privately-owned financial services companies outside Wall Street, announced in early 2015 it would be sold to Stifel, a St. Louis-based company. And that provides a perfect example of what could have happened to HealthSouth, Somerville said.
"Frequently, what's best for the company and the employees and what's best for the shareholders may be the hardest route. An easy way out would have been to declare bankruptcy or to sell at some discounted price. Honestly, in my opinion, we have an example of that very recently with Sterne Agee," Somerville said. "The [HealthSouth] board of directors, to its credit, picked someone who was equal to the task of taking the hard way for the benefits of the employees, the shareholders, and the community - for that, we owe a debt of gratitude to Jay Grinney. He did it, and he defied the odds."
What happened at HealthSouth was not an isolated incident. It followed the Enron scandal of 2001, where shareholders lost $74 billion, thousands of employees lost their retirement funds, and the company filed for bankruptcy. Then in 2002, it came out that WorldCom had inflated its assets by $11 billion, leading it to file what was at the time the largest bankruptcy in the country's history.
HealthSouth's story had a lot in common with these predecessors. The main difference being that it survived. Protective Life's CEO Johnny Johns said he expected HealthSouth to declare bankruptcy in the early 2000s, and that largely everyone in the Birmingham community did.
If it had declared bankruptcy, Birmingham would have moved on, just as Houston did after Enron. But it would have remained a black spot on the city's reputation, another Larry Langford cautionary tale. Instead, HealthSouth is today a pride of Birmingham, said Johns, who is a close personal friend of Grinney's.
Falling for Birmingham
You can imagine a Birmingham without HealthSouth. You can imagine the jobs that aren't there, the ghosts would inhabit the 200,000-square-foot headquarters Scrushy built off of U.S. 280.
But it's hard to account for all the small ways having a publicly traded company affects the community, said Ralph Smith, a Birmingham attorney who taught a class at the University of Alabama School of Law on the accounting scandals of the early 2000s, including HealthSouth.
"Having a corporate headquarters of a successful company is an important ingredient in the success of a community. You have corporate citizenship opportunities when you have a Regions headquartered here, or a Protective Life Insurance headquartered here, even though Protective is now owned in Japan, their U.S. operations are headquartered right here and they're an important part of the corporate culture," Smith said. "Birmingham has benefited from great corporate leadership and also from time to time has suffered from the absentee ownership syndrome. I'm just so pleased that HealthSouth has remained, remained strong, and continues to grow."
Grinney shaped more than just HealthSouth. He serves on the boards of major Birmingham companies like Coca-Cola Bottling Company UNITED and Energen Corp., and has served in the past on the board for staples like the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute. He was active in forming Blueprint Birmingham, the Birmingham Business Alliance's comprehensive economic development plan.
Today, HealthSouth is one of only three Fortune 1000 companies that remain in the state, along with Regions Financial Corp. and Vulcan Materials.
After Scrushy was fired, there was doubt about whether HealthSouth would survive. But even when it became clear that HealthSouth would survive the scandal, many worried the company could still leave Birmingham - including Johns.
Grinney said HealthSouth never seriously entertained the idea of leaving Birmingham. But plenty outside of the community wanted it to. Executives and economic development agencies courted Grinney to encourage him to move HealthSouth's corporate headquarters to Charlotte, Richmond, and especially Nashville, he said.
"There certainly was a full-court press applied to me by the people in the Nashville business community and the Nashville Chamber of Commerce," Grinney said. "You're in a crisis mode, and there's something to be said about new beginnings. My thought, on the other hand, was because we were in a crisis, to ask so many people to relocate would be an undue and unnecessary burden to place on people you were depending on to get help get the company turned around."
Johns' anxiety wasn't unfounded. To raise money to pay down its massive debt, HealthSouth sold Surgical Care Affiliates in 2007 for $920 million. That company's corporate headquarters is now in Illinois.
Johns' anxieties were eased in 2009, when Grinney married Melanie Parker. A Birmingham native, Parker had travelled around the world to places like New York, London and Paris before returning home, where she worked for a while as the Director of Marketing for the Birmingham Museum of Art. Johns knew, when they married, Grinney wasn't going anywhere. The couple now lives in Mountain Brook.
"I started to really enjoy being here and fell in love with the city," Grinney said. "It wasn't soon thereafter that I concluded I would never want to relocate the corporate office."
HealthSouth, all grown up
By 2007, the company had completed its turnaround: it had settled all the outstanding litigation and paid all of its settlements.
"That's when we really started thinking about what we wanted to be when we grew up," Grinney said.
The company began an aggressive growth strategy that led to more than 40 acquisitions, including the massive $730 million purchase of Reliant Hospital Partners and the $170 million purchase of Georgia's CareSouth.
On Monday, HealthSouth broke ground on its new corporate headquarters on 20 acres of land in Liberty Park.
The lease on the current building ends in 2018. HealthSouth used to own the corporate campus, but sold it for $60 million in 2007 to help pay down the debt.
Grinney has said in the past the lease ending provided HealthSouth with the opportunity to move into a building that better suited with what the company is now: open and collaborative. The old building, he has said, was overbuilt, with a layout created to keep departments from interacting with one another.
The new space, he said, will be open, with natural sunlight hitting the offices. It will have common areas the current campus lacks that will encourage different departments to work together and communicate.
Grinney will never work out of the new building. His last day as CEO is Dec. 31, though he'll stay on as a consultant through the spring of next year.
Chief Operating Officer Mark Tarr, who has been second in command for nearly a decade of his 23 year career at the company, will succeed Grinney.
HealthSouth announced his retirement the same day the company announced something that seemed impossibly far away at the time he was hired: a strong third quarter, with revenues topping $926 million.
"I cannot envision a better scenario to step aside from," Grinney said.

Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."


Rhonda, Missouri
Caring Mom
"I'm a single mother dating online and I use BeenVerified to help protect my family!"









More Testimonials





From the Press

From the Press
U.S. News & World Report
