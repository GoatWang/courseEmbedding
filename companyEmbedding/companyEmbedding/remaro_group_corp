offering price per share is $0.01. The following table sets forth the uses of
proceeds assuming the sale of 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%, respectively, of the
securities offered for sale by the Company. There is no assurance that we will
raise the full $80,000 as anticipated and there is no guarantee that we will
receive any proceeds from the offering.

The above figures represent only estimated costs. The estimated cost of this
registration statement is $8,000 which will be paid from offering proceeds. If
the offering proceeds are less than registration costs, Marina Funt, our
president and director, has verbally agreed to loan the Company funds to
complete the registration process. Ms. Funt’s verbal agreement to provide us
loans for registration costs is non-binding and discretionary. Also, these loans
would be necessary if the proceeds from this offering will not be sufficient to
implement our business plan and maintain reporting status and quotation on the
OTC Electronic Bulletin Board when and if our common stocks become eligible for
trading on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. Ms. Funt will not be paid any
compensation or anything from the proceeds of this offering. There is no due
date for the repayment of the funds advanced by Ms. Funt. Ms. Funt will be
repaid from revenues of operations if and when we generate sufficient revenues
to pay the obligation.

The current use of proceeds tables provides us with the capital we believe it
will take for us to reach a level of development that we can begin acquiring
clients and actually provide a service to these clients that is satisfactory at
minimum. Each table represents a different level of funds that would result in
increased or decreased customers and services provided as a result. However, we
cannot say with any certainty exactly how substantially, or to what effect, the
following values will materially alter the results of our future business
operations.


The tour related industry may look difficult to enter as there are many
companies which provide a wider range of services. We see our competitive
advantage in focusing on only one niche with a specific offer. We intend to hire
guides from the local people who wish them to perform such services. We do not
charge for transfers nor housing (as we do not provide them) or any hidden
services or taxes. We seek people willing to get the most from their tours and
skip regular or mass-touristic attractions. Our services are for those who want
to explore new places in a way that locals know them, which we believe is a
unique experience.


Company Description
We are a touristic agency, currently located in Ecuador, that seeks tour guides
for individual or group tours in particular localities. We aim to offer services
of a freelance local guide, known also as a pointman (hereinafter referred as
‘guide’ or ‘local guide’) around the vicinities of our


 customers’ choice. The
services are aimed at private persons, or groups of them on a collective voyage.
The customers (to whom we may refer as “tourists”) are assigned to a particular
guide once they complete their request, receive and sign the contract.

We plan to operate our tours exclusively in Ecuador. Ecuador is a land of rich
cultural and historical attractions such as: City of Quito, City of Cuenca, El
Cajas National Park, Pailon Del Diablo Waterfall, Cotopaxi Summit, The Galapagos
Islands, Tena Jungles, Cuyabeno Wildlife Reserve etc.

The guide’s duties are to take the customers into the requested locality,
deliver touristic services properly and provide safety to the tourist. We plan
to explain the rules and safety precautions before the tour. We plan to explain
the safety rules before the tour. These rules include general requirements which
can be helpful during the tour, a list of the necessary things (for example type
of clothes or personal care products) that are recommended to take, an overview
of major issues related to safety. We require to have health insurance and
accident insurance for the whole tour from the tourists. After the service is
delivered, the tour guide may receive a review, which we plan to attach to this
guide’s profile. As a developing company we are interested in finding people,
preferably with the experience in services of a guide, who can organize for our
customers’ various itineraries (hereinafter referred also as ‘tours’) of
different types and of good quality. We expect the tours range from city tours
around famous places, or simply showing from the airport to the train station,
to tours around locations relevant to modern pop, rock or urban culture, as well
as tours relevant to culinary arts or cuisine history, or tours around places of
our customers’ interest. As business develops we hope to find professional
guides to take our customers to mountains, forests and other locations in the
wilderness.

We have portfolios of local tour guides that wish to work with us on a freelance
basis. According to customers’ request to visit a particular place, or
experience a particular tour we offer a few candidates capable of satisfying
their needs. We charge a fee for our services. The rest of the payment is due to
occur when customers and their guides meet to receive and deliver services
correspondingly. No payments or money transfers between customers and guides
shall occur if the services are cancelled due to unexpected changes of weather
conditions, or sudden illness of a tour guide or tourists, or of any other
obstacles of unpredictable nature. In case the tour guide is incapable of
delivering a service for known or unknown reason, we take responsibility to find
a substitute guide. We also take a responsibility to be a mediator between
customers and guides in case any dispute over our services arises. Provided that
business expands, we may think of taking it to a new level and introduce our
customers and guides to a web platform where guides can promote their services.

We plan to obtain a website to promote our guides by showing their portfolios:
photos, service description, the price of services, and job achievements. To set
up their profiles, we request credentials to verify identity and by doing so we
expect to lower the possibility of scams and frauds. Also it can make payment
for the service easier. The customers can check to see if the guide resides in
the location they are seeking, what other services this guide delivers or how
this guide is rated by the customers.

A private person, or a group of tourists, intending to set off for a voyage
(hereinafter referred as our ‘customers’) fill out a question form and post
their request online, or answer to our offer. A sample request might be as
follows, “Need a guide for places related to the history of rock-n-roll in
London”. Customers may apply directly, by phone or via the web platform.
Customers may choose a particular guide or we may search our database and offer
a few candidates. Prior to the contract we inform the customers about prices,
payment details and what exactly the service includes. The customers might
discuss the time of their arrival, the longevity of their tour or any
peculiarities of it, and the total cost. The customers may request to find
another guide if, for some reason, the recommended one proves dissatisfying. We,
as a company, would inquire their reasons to do so because we are interested in
guides who can provide decent services and communication, thus promoting a good
image of the company they work for. We also think of collecting the feedbacks of
our customers to improve and develop our services. We may develop a system of
reviewing both guides and customers to pursue two goals: 1) improving the
services 2) reduce chances of fraud.

Once both parties agree, they meet for the service delivery to occur. After the
customers receive their services they may leave their feedback regarding the
quality of the service. We also expect to make it possible that during their
tours, customers can share their photo or video, concerning the tour, in a form
of short journal entries at our web platform. We plan to attach links to those
entries to the profiles of the corresponding guides.

In order to bring down possible negative reviews that may affect the reputation
of the company, we plan to work with those customers who can prove insurance
upon registration with the platform (The same applies to when we only provide
guides searching services). In ?ase of serious injuries the company might take
responsibility after an investigation takes place to prove that customers were
properly informed of possible consequences and they did not violate the safety
regulations delivered by their guide, prior to the tour. Operations might be
suspended during the time of such claims against the company. We also don’t take
any responsibility in case an accident happens to a guide. There is no assurance
that accidents will not take place further.

Our principal office address is located at Calle Robles, Casa 25, Quito,
Ecuador. Our telephone number is +56-2-2979-1247. Email: remarogroup@yandex.com.

minimum. Each table represents a different level of funds that would result in
increased or decreased customers and services provided as a result. However, we

Company Description
We are a touristic agency, currently located in Ecuador, that seeks tour guides
for individual or group tours in particular localities. We aim to offer services
of a freelance local guide, known also as a pointman (hereinafter referred as
‘guide’ or ‘local guide’) around the vicinities of our


 customers’ choice. The
services are aimed at private persons, or groups of them on a collective voyage.
The customers (to whom we may refer as “tourists”) are assigned to a particular
guide once they complete their request, receive and sign the contract.

We plan to operate our tours exclusively in Ecuador. Ecuador is a land of rich
cultural and historical attractions such as: City of Quito, City of Cuenca, El
Cajas National Park, Pailon Del Diablo Waterfall, Cotopaxi Summit, The Galapagos
Islands, Tena Jungles, Cuyabeno Wildlife Reserve etc.

The guide’s duties are to take the customers into the requested locality,
deliver touristic services properly and provide safety to the tourist. We plan
to explain the rules and safety precautions before the tour. We plan to explain
the safety rules before the tour. These rules include general requirements which
can be helpful during the tour, a list of the necessary things (for example type
of clothes or personal care products) that are recommended to take, an overview
of major issues related to safety. We require to have health insurance and
accident insurance for the whole tour from the tourists. After the service is

as tours relevant to culinary arts or cuisine history, or tours around places of
our customers’ interest. As business develops we hope to find professional
guides to take our customers to mountains, forests and other locations in the
wilderness.

We have portfolios of local tour guides that wish to work with us on a freelance
basis. According to customers’ request to visit a particular place, or
experience a particular tour we offer a few candidates capable of satisfying
their needs. We charge a fee for our services. The rest of the payment is due to
occur when customers and their guides meet to receive and deliver services
correspondingly. No payments or money transfers between customers and guides
shall occur if the services are cancelled due to unexpected changes of weather
conditions, or sudden illness of a tour guide or tourists, or of any other
obstacles of unpredictable nature. In case the tour guide is incapable of

a substitute guide. We also take a responsibility to be a mediator between
customers and guides in case any dispute over our services arises. Provided that
business expands, we may think of taking it to a new level and introduce our
customers and guides to a web platform where guides can promote their services.

We plan to obtain a website to promote our guides by showing their portfolios:

their request online, or answer to our offer. A sample request might be as
follows, “Need a guide for places related to the history of rock-n-roll in
London”. Customers may apply directly, by phone or via the web platform.
Customers may choose a particular guide or we may search our database and offer
a few candidates. Prior to the contract we inform the customers about prices,
payment details and what exactly the service includes. The customers might
discuss the time of their arrival, the longevity of their tour or any
peculiarities of it, and the total cost. The customers may request to find
another guide if, for some reason, the recommended one proves dissatisfying. We,
as a company, would inquire their reasons to do so because we are interested in
guides who can provide decent services and communication, thus promoting a good
image of the company they work for. We also think of collecting the feedbacks of
our customers to improve and develop our services. We may develop a system of
reviewing both guides and customers to pursue two goals: 1) improving the
services 2) reduce chances of fraud.

Once both parties agree, they meet for the service delivery to occur. After the
customers receive their services they may leave their feedback regarding the
quality of the service. We also expect to make it possible that during their
tours, customers can share their photo or video, concerning the tour, in a form
of short journal entries at our web platform. We plan to attach links to those
entries to the profiles of the corresponding guides.

In order to bring down possible negative reviews that may affect the reputation
of the company, we plan to work with those customers who can prove insurance
upon registration with the platform (The same applies to when we only provide
guides searching services). In ?ase of serious injuries the company might take
responsibility after an investigation takes place to prove that customers were
properly informed of possible consequences and they did not violate the safety
regulations delivered by their guide, prior to the tour. Operations might be
suspended during the time of such claims against the company. We also don’t take
any responsibility in case an accident happens to a guide. There is no assurance
that accidents will not take place further.

Our principal office address is located at Calle Robles, Casa 25, Quito,
Ecuador. Our telephone number is +56-2-2979-1247. Email: remarogroup@yandex.com.
