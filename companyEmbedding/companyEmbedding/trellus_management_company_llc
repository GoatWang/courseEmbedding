Product Management Assessments 

Our Product Management Assessments can help take your company or team to the next level!
Get A Free Estimate
Product Management is one of the most important strategic functions in a company. Great Product Management leads to more successful and more profitable products, happier customers and long-term winning strategies to conquer markets. It also ensures that your company doesn’t waste money developing, marketing and selling products that don’t meet customer needs and should not have been built in the first place.
Optimal Product Process Assessment
Our Product Management Assessments ensure that you have the following elements in place:

An effective product process (as lightweight as possible for your culture)
A great team who understands their role and is trained to perform at a high level of competence
Excellent standardized tools and templates to ensure that deliverables can be created quickly
Systems in place for ongoing company improvements/learning and leveraged collaboration

The 280 Group Product Management Assessments are a service where we do an in-depth analysis of the Product Management function at your company (process, people and tools), provide concrete recommendations for dramatically improving its effectiveness, and assist you with implementing key changes. By working with the 280 Group, you can ensure that you are implementing best practices and that product management will help drive your company’s overall success.
To perform the Product Management Assessments, the 280 Group assigns a team of senior consultants to work with your company. Our rapid and thorough assessment will provide you with a plan to dramatically improve Product Management at your company in a short period of time.
Let the 280 Group help you build a plan to optimize your company’s Product Management function
The deliverable for the assessment is:

Presentation to stakeholders and/or executive staff
Summary of findings
Recommendations
In-depth plans for additional work to execute the recommendations.

          Jul 15, 2017                         - RelSci Data Update                

          Institutional Holdings Changes      




Background Information:


Trellus Management Co. LLC »
Trellus utilizes a bottom-up and opportunistic investment approach. They typically focus on small- and mid-cap US companies that are less intensively followed by Wall Street that may offer superior returns for the firm's proprietary research approach. The strategy combines core positions - short or long - both for alpha generation and that appear to be under/over valued together with tactical positions along with a proprietary matrix that combines three investment approaches: value, growth and event-driven.Research on each company consists of fundamental analysis with proprietary trading and technical analysis. The aim is to monitor a company's margins, growth rates, use of leverage and various financial ratios to detect significant changes in the business model or to detect superior or failing business models. Technical analysis is used to identify high/low risk entry points. Money flow is continuously assessed, and management principles are implemented via option strategies.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).

Product Management Assessments 

Our Product Management Assessments can help take your company or team to the next level!
Get A Free Estimate
Product Management is one of the most important strategic functions in a company. Great Product Management leads to more successful and more profitable products, happier customers and long-term winning strategies to conquer markets. It also ensures that your company doesn’t waste money developing, marketing and selling products that don’t meet customer needs and should not have been built in the first place.
Optimal Product Process Assessment
Our Product Management Assessments ensure that you have the following elements in place:

An effective product process (as lightweight as possible for your culture)
A great team who understands their role and is trained to perform at a high level of competence
Excellent standardized tools and templates to ensure that deliverables can be created quickly
Systems in place for ongoing company improvements/learning and leveraged collaboration

The 280 Group Product Management Assessments are a service where we do an in-depth analysis of the Product Management function at your company (process, people and tools), provide concrete recommendations for dramatically improving its effectiveness, and assist you with implementing key changes. By working with the 280 Group, you can ensure that you are implementing best practices and that product management will help drive your company’s overall success.
To perform the Product Management Assessments, the 280 Group assigns a team of senior consultants to work with your company. Our rapid and thorough assessment will provide you with a plan to dramatically improve Product Management at your company in a short period of time.
Let the 280 Group help you build a plan to optimize your company’s Product Management function
The deliverable for the assessment is:

Presentation to stakeholders and/or executive staff
Summary of findings
Recommendations
In-depth plans for additional work to execute the recommendations.
