Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Lawson Products (NASDAQ:LAWS) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Buy RatingConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 3.00)Consensus Price Target: $25.00 (11.61% upside)

Zacks Investment Research cut shares of Avon Products, Inc. (NYSE:AVP) from a hold rating to a strong sell rating in a research report sent to investors on Tuesday. 
According to Zacks, “Avon has lagged the broader industry in the last six months, largely due to its dismal surprise history. The company has posted lower-than-expected bottom-line results for three straight quarters now, with a loss in the last quarter. Avon continues to face lower Active Representatives, though it is on track to improve the same. Estimates have been going down ahead of the second quarter release. The company remains prone to stiff competition, and other macroeconomic hurdles. Further, management expects the second quarter to remain troubled. However, we remain impressed with Avon’s progress with its Transformation Plan, which started its second year, this quarter. The company is on track to generate targeted savings of $230 million in 2017. Also, it is confident of achieving its long-term goals of low-double digit operating margin growth, Active Representatives growth of 1–2% and constant-dollar revenue growth in the mid-single digits.”
A number of other equities research analysts have also weighed in on AVP. DA Davidson began coverage on shares of Avon Products in a research note on Thursday, July 6th. They set a neutral rating and a $4.25 target price for the company. ValuEngine lowered shares of Avon Products from a hold rating to a sell rating in a research note on Friday, June 2nd. Finally, Royal Bank Of Canada  reiterated a hold rating and set a $4.00 target price on shares of Avon Products in a research note on Friday, March 24th. Three equities research analysts have rated the stock with a sell rating, three have issued  a hold rating and two have given a buy rating to the company. Avon Products currently has a consensus rating of Hold and a consensus target price of $5.54.
