Cloverpop Privacy Policy















Last Modified: July 21, 2016

Cloverpop is a product of Cloverpop, Inc. We are committed to protecting the privacy of our users. This privacy policy describes how we will protect your personal and business information.

Plain English – Why do we care so much about privacy?
We are a values-driven company that helps with decisions at work. Many of these decisions are sensitive and involve private information. In order for us to help you, we have to earn and keep your trust. For you to trust us, we have to keep your information private and confidential. So it is not just the law that compels us to protect your privacy, it is also core to our values and our service.
Plain English – What you should know about the risks of using Cloverpop and how we reduce them.

We ask a lot of questions about your decisions. By policy and through technology described below, we protect that information and do not share it with any third parties without your explicit consent.
We encourage you to invite colleagues to weigh in on your decisions. Cloverpop is a collaborative app that depends in large part on teams of stakeholders weighing in with their perspectives. In order to maintain your privacy when you invite colleagues to weigh in on decisions, we only allow people to see decisions that: (1) they were specifically invited to weigh in on, or (2) are made by Teams that they are Members of. That also means that if you invite a colleague to one of your decisions, or make a decision on a Team that then they are Members of, they will know that you are the person making the decision, will be able to see certain information about that specific decision, and will know the identity and opinions of other colleagues who have also weighed in on it.
We analyze and publish aggregate information about the decisions in our Database. By policy and through technology described below, we protect that information and do not associate it with any information that could identify you, your company or specific information about your decisions.
We encourage you to ask us questions and give feedback via our customer support site. When you contact us via chat or email, we will know who you are and will ask questions as needed to respond to any concerns or feedback you give. Information from such inquiries is kept private unless you give us explicit permission to share it.
We encourage you to tell other people about Cloverpop. We post nothing about your decisions to Facebook, LinkedIn, Google+ or other social media services. But if you love your Cloverpop experience, we want to you tell everyone else about it. What you say is up to you.

To provide the Subscription Service to you – it is the nature of the app to collect information about your decisions, use that information to help you analyze and communicate about your decision, and provide a service based on the information you provide.
To improve our understanding of decisions – we are building the world’s largest database of business decisions, and using that information to improve the Cloverpop Subscription Service, provide data for scientific research and help you make such decisions more wisely.
To improve our website experience – we continually strive to improve our website offerings based on the information and feedback we receive from you.
To improve customer service – your information helps us to more effectively respond to any problems you find or needs you may have.
To process transactions – your information will not be sold, exchanged, transferred, or given to any other company for any reason whatsoever, without your consent, other than for the express purpose of delivering the purchased product or service requested.

How do we protect your information?
We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you enter, submit, or access your personal information or complete a transaction.
You may invite other people to weigh in on your decisions. Those people must verify their identity by demonstrating they own the email address you used when you invited them. There is no public view of Cloverpop Users or their decision information.

Check your inbox for next steps to get started with our decision-making platform.

FEATURED ON





















Decision making drives 95% of business performance.
It drives growth and profitability. It’s the heart of employee engagement, the engine of innovation and the key to competitiveness. Decision making is the most important thing your company does.

Cloverpop is the first enterprise decision-making platform based on behavioral science.
Enterprises run on software platforms, yet there was no platform for decision making. Until now.









Clear Framing, Fast Collaboration
With Cloverpop, decision makers use a smart Decision Flow to frame their decisions, then invite stakeholders to weigh in using a collaborative process based on behavioral science.
The result? Just 20 minutes in the Decision Flow brings new ideas, clarity and better buy-in while eliminating 20 hours of meetings and 4 weeks of delays.




Complete Visibility, Real Engagement
With Cloverpop, decisions are automatically and clearly communicated up, down and across the enterprise via colorful dashboards showing the status of every decision.
When every decision is clearly communicated, employee engagement skyrockets and decision execution accelerates.










From Delayed Decisions to Accountability and Action
Cloverpop’s powerful decision database tracks critical details of the decision-making process and its results.
By measuring the decision-making process, enterprises can gain insights to take charge of the most important business activity, getting better results, faster.









“This was very simple and fast. After it was finished I was able to quickly see where we stood as a group. People could give their real opinions.”


“This is an awesome tool! I have never experienced more ease making such a decision. And it's especially effective when your colleagues are more difficult than the decision you're making!”


“We had been discussing this decision for months without making headway. Using Cloverpop enabled me to glean the proper knowledge to make an informed decision. This was an effective, efficient way to make a very tough decision.”


“I like the fact that you could basically hold a business meeting where everyone can attend on their own time.”


“I felt much more confident making the decision using Cloverpop. I wasn’t sure where everyone stood and what they thought was best. Being able to see everyone’s feelings and thoughts when making the decision was invaluable.”


“Cloverpop really gave me insight into where everyone else was with this decision. When you are just discussing something in a meeting it is easy to not remember someone’s concerns or misinterpret how much a certain concern means to someone.”


“I like how Cloverpop  flows and how easy it is to use. It is a simple and straightforward system to help make business decisions easier, and to get the input of your team.”


“While I expected Cloverpop might help to brainstorm and call up concerns that may not be particularly obvious, what it can also do is show just how much consensus actually exists for a particular solution.”


“Making this decision had become stressful, and was putting a strain on interpersonal relationships in the office. Using Cloverpop allowed me to step away from the emotional, and look solely at the logic.”


“I think some of the team do a better job when they are not face to face with everyone else. It is easier for them to let everyone know pros and cons without feeling pressured. It also helps them brainstorm their ideas and keeps them focused.”


“Cloverpop helped to crystallize my decision. I tend to stew on decisions. I try to look outwardly confident and put out an attitude of not looking back...but I kind of do. I'm not looking back on this decision at all. I'm really confident that this is the right thing to do.”


“I like how the Cloverpop system flows. I added my decision and it helps me go through the pros and cons, how I feel about them, and what alternatives may exist. It is easy to understand, as well as being well designed.”









15 Reasons Cloverpop is for you


Sometimes people disagree with you.
Approximately 107 percent of managers think disagreements are a problem, although 140 percent disagree about the right solution. Luckily, 96 percent agree on Cloverpop.



You want to make better decisions than Einstein.
Daniel Kahneman proved that even Nobel Prize winners like him take biased shortcuts when making decisions. Yes, even Einstein. Cloverpop helps you make better decisions than Einstein. How cool is that?



It’s Monday morning.
The business week is about making things happen. Decisions make things happen. Get in the habit of using Cloverpop to make things happen. Or procrastinate until Wednesday.



Sometimes decisions take too long.
We know you don’t want to judge. But seriously, they’re dragging their feet, they’re pushing their own agendas, they’re not seeing things objectively. What is it with these people?



You value input from other people.
Humans are social. We cooperate to get bigger things done than we can do alone. Humans are smart. We see things from different perspectives. None of us are smarter than many of us.



It’s Wednesday.
It’s hump day, there’s still time to salvage your week by making something happen. Think of it like skiing, surfing or doing yoga - it’s fun to do, looks cool, and good for you, too!



You create presentations.
Presentations actually eat our brains. They are digitized zombie spawn. They use brainwashing techniques to convince people to do our bidding. Only brainwash people if you know you are right.



You create a lot of presentations.
Look, we get it, presentations are cool. It’s just that they eat our brains. At least use Cloverpop to unscramble everyone’s brains before feeding them to the zombies. Scrambled brains taste awful.



You schedule meetings.
Meetings waste like $110B every year! Stop having meetings to talk past each other. Use Cloverpop to get the full picture, then decide...maybe without any meetings at all!



You send emails.
OK, so maybe you are a social person and like decision meetings. But emails are not social. Email addiction shrinks our brains. Help your brain grow. Use Cloverpop.



You send a lot of emails.
Don’t let emails suck the fun out of work. They trick you into taking positions and advocating for decisions before you know what’s right. And then there’s unread emails, cc-ing people...ugh.



You do yoga.
Yoga is like Cloverpop for your body. We don’t know what that means, but yoga is blowing up right now, so we want to associate our product with yoga.



Sometimes you’re not sure what to do.
Believe it or not, almost 99.99999 percent of rational people face business decisions that have a high degree of uncertainty. Never let them see you sweat...but remember they are sweating, too.



You are busy.
Cloverpop is easy. It takes about 10 minutes to save you from 10 hours of disagreement and speed up decisions by 10 days. You are frickin’ busy! You should do it.



You want better performance reviews and higher raises.
Most managers ignore decision best practices. Chumps! Don’t they realize they could boost their performance 20%, and increase their pay 15%? Hint: Multiply your salary by 1.15.

15 Reasons Cloverpop is NOT FOR YOU


No one disagrees with you. Ever.
If you don’t listen to other people, do they really exist? There’s a fine line between absolute power and always being right. And you live on both sides of the line.



Nobel Prize winners don’t impress you.
Sure, some guy won an award in Sweden after spending sixty years proving people take too many biased decision shortcuts. What does he know that your gut doesn’t? Your gut is awesome.



It’s the weekend.
Decisions are awesome. But who wants to build yet another business product that screws up our weekends? Go do yoga, play with your kids, take a nap, eat a salad, pet a dog.



Stakeholders never slow you down.
Some people call it leaping to conclusions. You ask what’s wrong with jumping off cliffs. Alone. While everyone else watches from a safe distance.



You like giving advice off the top of your head.
You thought about it for a second and vaguely remember a situation in your past that might be relevant. No reason to clear your head and look at things objectively. Just start talking.



It’s Friday.
When it comes to business decisions,Fridays are basically the weekend. Not the best day to make decisions. A pretty good day to do other stuff. Online shopping anyone? Office football pool?



You never make rationalizations.
What’s the fun in telling stories that make it sound like you’re always right?



You are eating.
Stop deciding and pay attention to what you’re shoving in your mouth! Savor your meals. Take small bites. Eat superfoods. How many times do you have to be told this!?!



You are playing with kids.
Kids know more about iPads than you do. They know how to use crafting tables in Minecraft. Just hand Cloverpop over and put them in charge.



You feel like taking a nap.
Naps are awesome. They make you smarter. They make you better looking. They make you live longer, happier lives. Please don’t let Cloverpop keep you from taking a nap.



You are petting your dog.
Dogs are pleasers. They reduce stress and anxiety. They don’t cc people, and they don’t care if you mess up and crater your company. Just throw the ball and rub the belly.



You are washing your cat.
You’ve already got your hands full. Seriously, those things are razor-clawed, arm-shredding hissing hair bombs.



You’ve had a few drinks.
Six words that should never be trusted after a six pack: “I know what we should do.”



You don’t like people.
There is nothing better than using work decisions to torture people. Arguments, confusion, uncertainty, really well crafted flame emails - the spice of life!



You are a post-economic hermit.
Once you have f*** you money, who really gives a s***, right? Or you could decide to peel off those PJs and do something useful with the rest of your life. Just sayin’.
