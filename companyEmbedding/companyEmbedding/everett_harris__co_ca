What are analysts saying about CA stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about CA stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "CA is a leading information technology (IT) management software company. We are optimistic about CA’s acquisition strategy, which has enhanced its IT management, software and services portfolio. Moreover, we believe that the diversity of its products and the increased efficiency offered by them will attract customers across sectors, lending stability to its business model. Additionally, CA’s “go to market” sales strategy integrates the commercial functions of sales, marketing, brand management, pricing and consumer insight, which helps it in lowering costs, thereby improving the bottom line. Nonetheless, intensifying competition from peers, an uncertain economic environment, currency headwinds and the weak IT spending forecast by Gartner are other concerns. Notably, shares of the company has underperformed the broader market over the last one year period." (7/17/2017)
2. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "CA announced the acquisition of privately held Veracode for $614M in cash. Veracode provides SaaS-based application security for integration across the software development lifecycle. The deal value represents about 6.0-8.0x NTM revenue, which we view as reasonable, and discuss in more detail below. We believe providing security at the application level will become even more important over time given the ever increasing distributed nature of IT infrastructures." (3/7/2017)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for CA (NASDAQ:CA) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 3 Sell Ratings, 7 Hold Ratings, 5 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.13)Consensus Price Target: $34.85 (1.26% upside)
