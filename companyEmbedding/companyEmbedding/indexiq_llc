The Index is comprised of highly rated stocks derived using the CPG, and has the potential to outperform market-weighted products and active strategies. CPG was developed by Marc Chaikin, an investment strategist with 50 years of experience.  Chaikin's methodology, using sophisticated market-based indicators—combining value, growth, technical and sentiment—have become industry standard1 among asset managers and institutional investors. Chaikin Analytics recently won the 2017 Benzinga Global Fintech Award for Best Trading Idea Platform, Tool or App2.   "We're very excited to be using the approach pioneered by Marc Chaikin and his colleagues in bringing CSML to market as our first domestic equity, strategic beta ETF," said IndexIQ's Chief Executive Officer Adam Patti.   Added IndexIQ's Chief Investment Officer Salvatore Bruno, "Small-cap stocks have historically outperformed their large-cap counterparts over the long-term, and rebounded from market downturns at a quicker pace. Small-caps also tend to be more domestically focused when compared to their multi-national large-cap counterparts, allowing them to be insulated from issues that impact revenues from overseas, such as a rising dollar. Therefore, we believe CSML will fit well as a core U.S. small-cap equity position, as part of the science behind building smarter portfolios for investors.""We are thrilled to be collaborating with IndexIQ and bringing our Chaikin Power Gauge stock rating approach to the ETF marketplace for the first time," said Marc Chaikin, Founder and CEO of Chaikin Analytics, LLC. "By combining proven, market-based factors, as we've done with our Nasdaq Chaikin Power Indexes, it's now possible for ETF investors to build smarter stock portfolios with the potential to enhance returns across various market cycles."  CSML joins a growing family of factor-based ETF offerings from IndexIQ, including three first of their kind fixed income offerings: the IQ Enhanced Core Bond U.S. ETF (NYSE Arca: AGGE) and IQ Enhanced Core Plus Bond U.S. ETF (NYSE Arca: AGGP), which were launched in May of 2016, and the IQ S&P High Yield Low Volatility Bond ETF (HYLV), the first high yield low volatility fixed income ETF, which launched in February of 2017.For more information about CSML, please visit IQetfs.com.About IndexIQIndexIQ is a pioneer and leading provider of innovative investment solutions focused on absolute return, real assets, international and fixed income strategies.
