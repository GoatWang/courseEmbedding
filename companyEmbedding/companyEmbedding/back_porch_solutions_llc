Our account managers are happy to help tailor a SurveyGizmo solution for your project or your entire organization. Let us show you how.




By accessing and using this page, you agree to the
Terms of Use.
    			Your information will never be shared.




Master the Product Lifecycle

Continuous product improvement begins with continuous user feedback.

					Product feedback has long been disjointed, anecdotal, and difficult to use for data-driven decision making. Lack of mechanisms to collect feedback, complex workflows, and difficulty quantifying any collected data has created the inability to optimize individual products and create innovative product strategies. How can your products be the best if you don't know what they need to truly delight users?
				

					SurveyGizmo's product feedback management solution allows your team to collect, analyze, and take action on product feedback to continuously improve your products to meet and exceed your goals. Complex and disorderly feedback processes can be cleaned, structured, and automated to allow you to not only react to product feedback, but also stay one step ahead of your competition to release impactful products and enhancements.
				
 
 









What can you do with our Product Feedback Management solution?
Just about anything.







Powerful Integration
Capture customer feedback across all channels to get an integrated view of customer activity.  Analyze data in real-time and provide role-based dashboards.





Key Data Management
Run multiple surveys, generate a variety of reports and manage alerts regarding at-risk customers.


 



Multi-Channel Customer Feedback
Capture feedback across every channel of business operations: the web, social, email, call center and physical locations.


 



Case Management
Take action on feedback with integrated case management that closes the loop on customer issues.


 



Post-Interaction Rating
Improve contact center agent performance by providing customers with the ability to rate agents post-interaction.









 
 












"When it comes to making big decisions about our brand and product, we take data collection and analysis very seriously. That's why we built SurveyGizmo to be powerful, flexible and reliable... because we use it, too!"
—
Christian Vanek, SurveyGizmo, CEO





Keep getting better with continuous user feedback.

Porch ServicesThe Porch Company offers three different services: design, construction and products.
We provide design and construction services to the middle Tennessee area.
Additionally, we sell porch and deck products anywhere we can ship them.





Design
The Porch Company designs porches and outdoor structures for The Greater Nashville area. All designs are custom as we aim to make the porch addition look original to and appropriate for your home. For a very reasonable fee, we provide concept drawings with the intent to build the projects we design. Our proprietary construction details are what make our projects not only beautiful, but functional with a minimum of maintenance.
Whether you have an entire design scheme in mind or have no idea where to start, The Porch Company can create a plan that meets your unique needs while blending with your home. Visit our portfolio to see previous designs and give us a call for your custom plan.

Construction
Building structures that must withstand rain, wind,  sun and anything else Mother Nature decides to bless us with is just different than traditional home building and remodeling.  The Porch Company carpenters know how to build structures to handle the weather. We are familiar with the traditional products while also keeping informed of new and innovative materials that are always evolving.
The Porch Company prides itself on providing you with the best solutions and products for your individual project. There are no “perfect” materials for all situations. We try to educate you on the pros and cons of different building products. We do not push specific brands or materials, but instead inform you of your options and help you compare the different alternatives. With the right people and the right products, The Porch Company can build you a porch that is as lasting and functional as it is beautiful.

The Ultimate Feedback Management Solution for Business - SurveyGizmo

Our account managers are happy to help tailor a SurveyGizmo solution for your project or your entire organization. Let us show you how.




By accessing and using this page, you agree to the
Terms of Use.
    			Your information will never be shared.




Master the Product Lifecycle

Continuous product improvement begins with continuous user feedback.

					Product feedback has long been disjointed, anecdotal, and difficult to use for data-driven decision making. Lack of mechanisms to collect feedback, complex workflows, and difficulty quantifying any collected data has created the inability to optimize individual products and create innovative product strategies. How can your products be the best if you don't know what they need to truly delight users?
				

					SurveyGizmo's product feedback management solution allows your team to collect, analyze, and take action on product feedback to continuously improve your products to meet and exceed your goals. Complex and disorderly feedback processes can be cleaned, structured, and automated to allow you to not only react to product feedback, but also stay one step ahead of your competition to release impactful products and enhancements.
				
 
 









What can you do with our Product Feedback Management solution?
Just about anything.







Powerful Integration
Capture customer feedback across all channels to get an integrated view of customer activity.  Analyze data in real-time and provide role-based dashboards.





Key Data Management
Run multiple surveys, generate a variety of reports and manage alerts regarding at-risk customers.


 



Multi-Channel Customer Feedback
Capture feedback across every channel of business operations: the web, social, email, call center and physical locations.


 



Case Management
Take action on feedback with integrated case management that closes the loop on customer issues.


 



Post-Interaction Rating
Improve contact center agent performance by providing customers with the ability to rate agents post-interaction.









 
 












"When it comes to making big decisions about our brand and product, we take data collection and analysis very seriously. That's why we built SurveyGizmo to be powerful, flexible and reliable... because we use it, too!"
—
Christian Vanek, SurveyGizmo, CEO





Keep getting better with continuous user feedback.
When you’re committed to continuous improvement, the product development journey never ends. And with our Feedback Management solution, neither do the insights.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
