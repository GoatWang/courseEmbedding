WISErg Corporation

WISErg creates premium organic fertilizers using local compostable waste. Grocers and commercial kitchens realize compostable waste reduction of 60-80%, reducing hauling costs and carbon footprint.  Fertilizer customers are offered a competitive, sustainable product.
In 2010, Americans discarded an astounding 34 million tons of food scraps as waste. WISErg’s mission is to empower grocers and communities to rethink sustainability through the prevention of waste generation and better upcycling of unavoidable excess.
WISErg is committed to innovating with technology and changing the perception of waste. In 2012, they debuted the Harvester™, which grocers and food service providers use to discard food scraps with no mess, no odor, no pests and rodents, and no sewage output. WISErg then uses a patent-pending oxidative conversion process to intercept nutrients from food scraps and refine this waste into a liquid fertilizer approved for organic crop production.
The Harvester™ usage data is captured and processed, which enables the Harvester™ customer to assess the disposal of food scraps and receive regular usage and analytical reports – providing key insights used to reduce unnecessary inventory loss.

All you need to do in order to keep not being laid off, is to go drinking and play cards with the main investor, and you are in. This main investor will eliminate experienced and qualified people so he can keep his favorite social group and all the while putting out the lame excuse he has to get rid of people because he has to change the business model. The CEO is so weak he let's this main investor strip the company of dedicated, experienced, and well meaning personnel, and let's him keep his favorite Microsoft group and his personal social group of drinkers and card players. Stay away from this company. They are not fair. They are secretive and sneaky.Advice to ManagementWake up to the fact this main investor is ruining this company and the CEO is standing by letting him do it.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (7) WISErg Response seconds agoEdit • Delete WISErg 2016-09-04 09:07 PDT Jul 23, 2016 Helpful (6)"Rotten in bits"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Production Department in Redmond, WAFormer Employee - Production Department in Redmond, WADoesn't RecommendNeutral OutlookI worked at WISErg full-time (Less than a year)ProsIn your first month, you will experience some of that crazy, zippy energy that is ... a Startup. The grating of the under-oiled gears will be expected white noise. There is growth! Green growth. Opportunity! Free Pizza!?  The office staff and HR personnel are blissfully helpful. The engineers and the lab techs all seem very happy and intelligent, and qualified and bona fide.It is largely a pleasant space to work in, surrounded by beautiful Redmond, and the Burke-Gilman trail right out back. Some people ride their bikes to work every day, and it is always sunny, but not too sunny.ConsEmpty promises.Retention rate of production staff: under 40%.Uncapitalized company culture standards.Ineffectual / Draconic mid-level leadership.Dangerous / unpleasant working conditions.Pathetic pay increases, and no sign of actual promotions, even when open positions exist.Unfounded, unscheduled and arbitrary performance assessment. (Never positive)Lack of accountability for command decisions, imperative improvements, and process codification.Abysmal downstream communication.Much of this list speaks poorly of the broader company, though it is primarily specific to the Production/Operations department.Only one individual has been promoted significantly from the bottom rung. This company is hiring externally.Advice to ManagementWhat happens if you run out of people who want to make your product? Your operators are not happy, and nobody cares.What your operators know:They are the least important cohort in the company.It has been said, how you treat the least of the people in your care is who you truly are. And a house divided cannot stand. Your foundation is moldy, sirs.If you do not take proactive measures to retain the quality employees who are struggling against the strong backflow current [insert flushing sound] to create your flouted company culture from scratch, with zero encouragement or sense of esprit de corps--you will find all that remains are the cutthroat, the squeaky-wheel-gossips, and those too witless and ignorant to be innovative or more-than-slaves driven along by a standard of mediocrity.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (6) WISErg Response seconds agoEdit • Delete WISErg 2016-07-23 03:28 PDT Jul 27, 2016 Helpful (9)"Horrible company to work for.
