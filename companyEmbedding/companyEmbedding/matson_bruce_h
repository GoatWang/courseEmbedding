Biography

Mr. Matson's practice involves bankruptcy, debt restructuring, and creditors’ rights, generally.  More specifically, this practice includes (i) the representation of official committees of unsecured creditors in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, (ii) the restructuring of financially distressed companies, including business reorganizations under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, and (iii) the representation of financial institutions and other lenders in troubled loan workouts and recovery in chapter 11 and other insolvency proceedings.  In addition, Mr. Matson serves as a trustee in bankruptcy cases and insolvency proceedings, including Chapter 11 liquidations, SEC receiverships, CFTC receiverships, and state court assignments for benefit creditors.  Finally, his practice also includes representation of a wide range of creditors in Chapter 11 and other insolvency matters, including vendors, landlords, and utilities. Mr. Matson also regularly handles bankruptcy litigation matters involving the prosecution and/or defense of fraudulent conveyance, preference and other avoidance claims, claims relating to the fiduciary and other duties of directors, officers and professionals, lien priority disputes, and complex claim litigation. 
Mr. Matson is an adjunct professor and frequently teaches continuing legal education seminars and produces articles on Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code, troubled loan workouts, creditors’ rights and bankruptcy. He regularly serves as a member of the panel of bankruptcy trustees for the Eastern District of Virginia.
