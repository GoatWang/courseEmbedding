Sentinel closes oversubscribed fourth lower middle market buyout fund with $765 millionSentinel to Continue Focus on Building Lower Middle Market Companies in Partnership with Management





NEW YORK, July 16, 2008 - Sentinel Capital Partners, a private equity firm that invests in promising, lower middle market companies, announced today the final closing of Sentinel Capital Partners IV, L.P. at $765 million. The fund, which initially targeted $600 million, was more than two times oversubscribed and closed within six months of its launch.Sentinel will continue to focus on the same investment strategy it has successfully employed in previous funds—partnering with talented management teams to acquire businesses with $5–25 million of EBITDA and solid fundamentals in industries where the firm has significant experience and can bring valuable business insights. Sentinel invests in businesses in the consumer products, food and restaurants, franchising, manufacturing and service sectors. In addition to platform acquisitions, Fund IV will pursue transformational, like-size add-on acquisitions for its portfolio companies.The placement agent for Fund IV was the Private Fund Group of Credit Suisse Securities (USA) Inc. Commenting on Sentinel's successful six-month fundraising in a challenging and uncertain market environment, John Robertshaw, Managing Director and Co-head of the Private Fund Group said, "Private equity firms like Sentinel are able to efficiently raise new funds for five key reasons. First, they have superior investment records, and in most cases, generate top-quartile performance. Second, the track record includes many realizations. Third, the investment team is stable and has been responsible for the firm's long-term track record. Fourth, the firm has had a consistent focus, which investors believe will not change going forward. And last, the firm receives very strong support from its existing investors.""We are extremely pleased to have surpassed our expectations for Fund IV by such a wide margin and with the market's strong reception," said David S. Lobel, founder and managing partner of Sentinel. "We received very strong support from our existing limited partners and from a highly regarded group of new global investors. The fact that we completed the entire fundraising process in less than six months is a credit to the hard work and commitment of our team and to Credit Suisse, our placement agent.""Sentinel's ability to navigate complex and relationship-intensive situations is greatly valued by corporate sellers, small business owners, and management teams alike, and we believe this puts Fund IV in a position to excel," said John F. McCormack, Sentinel's co-founder. "Small businesses outnumber large businesses 10 to 1, and as Baby-Boomer entrepreneurs continue to reach retirement age, we expect a strong, steady flow of very attractive deals in our strike zone for many years to come."Sentinel's investors include some of the most sophisticated institutions in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Australia. Investors in Fund IV include college and university endowments, corporate pension plans, diversified financial institutions, foundations, insurance companies, investment advisors, state and government retirement systems, and Taft Hartley plans.

Our Investment Philosophy
Our Story



Our Investment Philosophy
One size does not fit all. We create individually customized solutions designed to meet your specific needs. For example:

Are we managing all or only a portion of your overall assets?
What are we looking to specifically accomplish?
Where are you in life, accumulation or distribution of assets?
Income needs?
Tax situation?
Are we working with concentrated stock and/or legacy stock positions?
Willingness and ability to take risk?
Liquidity needs, liquidity sources?

Based on our initial conversations we focus on our role and work towards creating unique solutions. It is important for you to understand what you own and the potential volatility and risk you could be exposed to. We listen to our clients and make subsequent asset class and security selections with their preferences in mind. Relative value between asset classes and the corporate credit cycle help guide us through these decisions. When deemed appropriate and after consulting with you, options may be recommended as part of an overall strategy.
We focus on long term wealth creation and encourage you to commit to a plan. Extreme volatility should be embraced and not feared. It is often an opportunity to enhance long term returns and the willingness to remain disciplined is often rewarded.
As fee only advisors commissions are neither earned nor accepted.
 

Our Story
After extensive industry experience at national investment management firms, both JJ and Jason arrived at the following important conclusions:
1. The best and the brightest minds in the business tend to migrate to the institutional side, as opposed to the individual or retail division — as the potential rewards are much greater.
2. Wall Street creates products for individuals that are then distributed and sold through their brokers or sales representatives — hence a product driven, not performance driven marketplace.
Brokers are expected to create profits for their employers, and the hierarchy at brokerage firms is based on who sells the most — not who does the best job managing portfolios. We believe this is a major conflict. In our opinion, the above conclusions meant that there was an opportunity for a completely different model to serve the high net worth individual investor. This model is based on complete independence with no financial ties to any brokerage firm, mutual fund or insurance company. We offer comprehensive customized portfolio management based on individual client needs and tolerances. This allows for a solution based model, rather than a product driven model. We have a compensation model where the client’s financial well being comes first. If it is in the best interest for a client to use portfolio money to pay off their mortgage, then it should be encouraged – even though the size of portfolio and thus fees, will decline.
Both Jason and JJ had ambitions to pursue Wall Street careers, which would have taken us to New York or another major financial center. However, independently both of our families decided that the southwest is a great place to live, and where we wanted to stay. Quality of life became a higher priority than potential future financial rewards. This created the opportunity to work directly with individual investors in the southwest area and offer them professional investment management and service.
We would appreciate the opportunity to work with you.
