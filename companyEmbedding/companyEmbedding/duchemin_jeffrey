Welcome to the Q1 2017 Harvard Bioscience Incorporated Earnings Conference Call. My name is Nicole and I will be your operator for today’s call. And at this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Corey Manchester. Mr. Manchester, you may begin.
Corey Manchester
Thank you, Nicole, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us for the Harvard Bioscience first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Leading the call today will be Jeffrey Duchemin, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Robert Gagnon, Chief Financial Officer of Harvard Bioscience.
Before I turn the call over to Jeff, I will read our Safe Harbor statement. In our discussion today, we may make statements that constitute forward-looking statements. Our actual results and performance may differ materially from what we have projected due to risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2016 and our other public filings. Any forward-looking statements, including those related to the Company's future results and activities, represent our estimates as of today and should not be relied upon as representing our estimates as of any subsequent date.
Also, much of today’s call will focus on our non-GAAP quarterly results, which we believe better represents the ongoing economics of the business reflects how we set and measure our incentive compensation plans and how we manage the business internally. The differences between our GAAP and non-GAAP results are outlined in the earnings release we issued today which can be found on our website under Press Releases. 
Additionally, any material financial or other statistical information presented on the call which is not included in our press release will be archived and available in the Investor Relations section of our website. A replay of this call will also be available for one week at the same location on our website at harvardbioscience.com. 
I will now turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff, please go ahead.
Jeffrey Duchemin
Thanks, Corey. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On today’s call, I will start with a brief review of Q1 results as well as an overall business update. Our CFO, Rob Gagnon, who will provide details on our financial results and our 2017 outlook. And after that, we look forward to taking your questions.
During the first quarter, we continued to produce solid operation results against a challenging funding environment. As a result, we are reiterating our 2017 revenue expectations to be flat to slightly down compared to 2016 and adjusted 2017 EPS expectations in the range of $0.15 to $0.17. 
First quarter revenues were $24.2 million, down 10% compared to first quarter 2016. Excluding currency translation, revenues decreased 8% or $2.1 million. Additionally, included in the organic revenue decline for the quarter, there is a decrease in revenue of approximately $660,000, which is a result of the AHN disposition in October 2016. 
Excluding the impact of those two items, our revenues declined approximately 6%. As a reminder, our Q1 results from last year were unseasonably high due to certain factors including the timing of a few large distributor orders in Asia. In comparison to Q1 of 2015, our business was flat on an organic basis. In addition, as we discussed and we’ve provided guidance on our last earnings call, we were experiencing a slow start to the year.

But on a positive note, we experienced an acceleration in the month of March which has continued into April. We are pleased to see more predictability in our business on the top-line as well as continued solid leverage to the bottom-line. 
Net income, on a non-GAAP basis, was $0.6 million or $0.02 per diluted share. The benefits of cost containment coupled with gross profit expansion from our site consolidation efforts continue to produce positive results. Our Q1 gross profit margins were 47.7% or 180 basis points sequential improvement over Q4 of last year.
The gross profit margin we reported today is the second highest quarter reported in the last two years. Only outpaced by 48.1% we reported in Q1 of 2016. We are making meaningful progress on our strategic initiatives in operational efficiency against this challenging funding environment. 
In the mean time, and as I stated on previous calls, we will continue to be prudent stewards of capital with a disciplined approach in managing our bottom-line until clarity in certainty occur. When the certainty to our end-customers return, our commercial teams are positioned to reap the benefits. 
Looking at our revenues from a geographic standpoint, our US market business is down 3% in the first quarter, while we have not yet realized the full benefit of incremental funding, we are continuing to see signs of changing tides with increased funding outlays from the NIH to academic labs. 
For the quarter ended March 31, 2017, NIH outlays are up almost 6% compared to the same period in 2016. As has mentioned in the past, we believe there is a natural lag between funding of labs and the purchase of consumables and bench top instrumentation. 
While we haven’t reflected it in our guidance, we continue to be optimistic that the second half of 2017 will experience a sustained acceleration of academic funding from the NIH based on last year’s improved budgets and as of this point Bipartisan Congressional support for funding increases from the government going forward. We remain cautiously optimistic that our customers’ confidence will be restored when funding certainty resumes. 
Europe continues to be a soft end-market due to currency translation and weakness in the funding environment. Excluding the impact of foreign currency and the impact of AHN disposition, our European revenues were down approximately 7% quarter-over-quarter. Looking ahead in 2017, we expect currency translation to continue to pressure our business results while the macro environment faces these challenges, we have taken initiatives to improve our operational performance. 
The biggest impact in the unseasonably high quarter-over-quarter comparison was seen in China and the rest of the world where we declined approximately 30% and 5% respectively. Our results in China were impacted by its timing and equipment orders this quarter as compared to last year. We are confident this trend will reverse based on visibility into order trends and backlog. 
Our team is working extremely hard to drive meaningful growth in this important region and we believe we have a line of sight to achieve year-over-year growth in China. We do believe there have been any significant changes in the business environment in China and we are keenly focused on our execution in the region. 
In terms of the rest of the world, we remain well positioned to capitalize on expansion into complementary territories including Japan, Korea, and Southeast Asia. 
In closing, we believe we are well positioned to continue to strengthen our operational performance and financial profile while executing our strategy to strengthen our market position and ultimately accelerating top-line growth. Namely our commercial resource allocation is aimed at expanding in complementary territories including Japan, Korea, and Southeast Asia, as well as a huge focus on growing product candidates and brands. 

We are unwavering in the strategic vision of our organization and believe it will drive top-line growth, improved profitability through operational performance and ultimately create shareholder value.
With that, I will turn the discussion over to Rob Gagnon who will provide more insights into our financials. Rob?
Robert Gagnon
Okay, thanks, Jeff. Beginning with the top-line, revenues in the first quarter were $24.2 million, a decrease of $2.8 million or 10% compared with revenues of $27 million for the first quarter of last year. Excluding the negative impact of the strengthening US dollar, revenues in the first quarter would have decreased 8% or by $2 million compared with the first quarter of last year. 
And as Jeff mentioned included in that decline is the revenue impact from the divestiture of AHN which took place in October 2016, which accounted for approximately $660,000. Excluding the negative impact of currency translation in AHN, the revenue decline is 6% in the quarter. 
As Jeff mentioned, our Q1 results from last year were unseasonably high due to certain factors including the timing of a few large distributor orders in Asia.
Now turning to cost and expenses. Cost of revenues in on a non-GAAP basis were $12.6 million for Q1 compared to $14 million for Q1 of last year. As a result our non-GAAP gross profit was $11.5 million this quarter compared with $13 million for last year’s first quarter. Gross profit margin was 47.7% in Q1, down from 48.1% in Q1 of last year. This 40 basis point decrease in gross margin is primarily attributable to lower volumes.
As Jeff mentioned, however despite revenues being down this quarter, our gross profit margin was the second highest quarterly margin we reported in the last two years. Our non-GAAP operating expenses for Q1 were $10.3 million, a decrease of $222,000, compared to $10.6 million in Q1 of last year and operating income on a non-GAAP basis in Q1 decreased to $1.2 million as compared to $2.4 million in Q1 of last year. 
Our non-GAAP operating margin in Q1 was approximately 5% on a non-GAAP basis which compares to an operating margin in Q1 of last year of about 9% on a non-GAAP basis. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 27.1% in Q1 compared to 27.9% in Q1 of last year and the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to lower earnings in the quarter.
Our non-GAAP net income in Q1 was $620,000 or $0.02 per diluted share, compared with $0.05 per diluted share in Q1 of last year. Weighted average shares outstanding was $34.6 million compared to $34 million in Q1 of last year. 
I’ll turn to the balance sheet. We finished Q1 with approximately $4.6 million of cash, a decrease of approximately $1 million, compared to $5.6 million from Q4 of last year. The decrease is timing-related. Our accounts receivable were $15.5 million compared to $15.7 million. Of those Q4 last year, decrease was $267,000 and inventories were $20.3 million compared to $20 million at the end of Q4 last year.
For capital expenditures, they were $200,000 for both Q1 this year and last year. In terms of guidance, we expect to spend approximately $1.5 million in CapEx over the course of the year. Debt at the end of Q1 was $13.7 million, compared to $13.9 million at the end of Q4 last year. 
Our available borrowing capacity subject to covenants and working capital restrictions at the end of the quarter was approximately $5 million and we expect that borrowing capacity to grow throughout the year with earnings expectations. 
I’ll turn to financial guidance. Today we are reaffirming our full year 2017 guidance which we issued on March 9 of this year. We continue to expect 2017 revenues to be flat to slightly down compared to 2016 revenues on a constant currency basis and excluding the decline in revenues from the sale of AHN. And just to clarify, flat revenues would be approximately $100 million excluding foreign currency in AHN.

As a result of our increased operating leverage and expected modest acceleration of our top-line, we continue to expect 2017 non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.15 to $0.17 or up to a 13% increase compared to 2016 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. 
We will now open the call to questions from participants. Operator?
Question-and-Answer Session 
Operator 
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Paul Knight from Janney Montgomery. Your line is open. Please go ahead. 
Paul Knight 
Hi, Jeff. Can you talk to the academic market, I mean, it’s in top – top on the outlook for that and what you see going on with academia right now?
Jeffrey Duchemin
Hey, Paul. Yes, I think, what we saw was a carryover of Q4 into Q1. I think trends are consistent early in the quarter. But as I mentioned in my script, we actually started to see the trend turn in March and we like what we are seeing right now. I think what’s happening is the outlay of funds that has increased since October from the NIH. 
We’ve always known that there has been a lag or a delay and I think what we are seeing is, is spend actually start to happen for small instrumentation and that’s a good sign. So our bookings were up. We like the trend that we see going into Q2. We are into Q2 and so I think that’s what happened, we start carryover from Q4, things started to pick up in the quarter and we like the position we are in right now for Q2. 
And I think if you look at Q1 overall, we finished right where we thought we finish. I think we did a little bit better on the bottom-line, but in terms of revenues, we knew there were going to be some timing delays coming from some distributors in Asia and that happened. But overall, we are pretty confident with where we are and what the outlook for the year is. 
Paul Knight 
On the International side, are you trying to sign more distributors? What can you do to build up the China business and the rest of Asia in particular?
Jeffrey Duchemin
Yes, I think we are positioned well in China. I think, in terms of distribution expansion, that will come from Japan this year and Southeast Asia. I would say, our distribution partnerships is solid in China and Korea and we are building in Japan and Southeast Asia.
Paul Knight 
So you did a lot of facility consolidations over the prior year-and-a-half, two years, is there any more work do you want to do there on the operating margin side for Harvard Bioscience? 
Jeffrey Duchemin
I think, ERP has led to efficiencies, operational efficiencies for us and we just completed phase two of our ERP initiative with our German facility, our multi-channel facility. That implementation went really well and what I believe it will do is it will provide our ability to become more efficient from an operation standpoint moving forward. In terms of site consolidation, the heavy lifting is over. 
There is always room for improvement moving forward, but I believe we are well positioned in terms of continuing to add to the bottom-line through these efficiencies led by ERP. 
Paul Knight 
And then my last question is this, that the NIH, we can achieve a 0% growth rate on that budget line, what do you Harvard Bioscience’s organic growth could be?
Jeffrey Duchemin
Well, I don’t think we’ve built anything from the NIH into our budget. So our budget is set right now to flat to a slight decline without anything coming from the NIH and once again the outlay of funds has been positive. So we feel confident that if this continues, it could lead to organic growth for this business. But as of today, I think we are going to stick with our feeling on a flat guidance for the year.
Paul Knight 
Okay, thank you. 
Jeffrey Duchemin
Thanks, Paul.
Operator 
And our next question comes from Raymond Myers from Benchmark. Your line is open sir.

Raymond Myers 
Great, thank you. Jeff, maybe you could start by discussing what drove the strong sequential gross margin in the first quarter and discuss were there was any seasonality to this or it just happened to be strong in the first quarter lately?
Jeffrey Duchemin
Well, I mean, I think if you look at Q4’s results, we – the trend was starting to turn. I think the site consolidation in operational improvements that we’ve been working on for a couple of years now are starting to pay off. And so that transitioned into Q1. Product mix always plays into that, but really what’s leading this Ray, is just the efficiencies of the organization and the heavy lifting that has been completed and we knew the turnaround would happen from a bottom-line standpoint. 
Really what the organization’s focus right now on is organic growth and we need to get the top-line growing. That where we are focused. We’ve got some great sales and marketing initiatives in place and that will also lead to improved gross margins moving forward. 
Robert Gagnon
And Ray, hi, it’s Rob. I just wanted to add, there is a little bit of timing and there could be mix there. We still expect margins to be in the 46% to 47% range throughout the course of the year.
Raymond Myers 
But that’s still higher than it was for the balance of last year. So, is that due to these efficiencies that you was discussing, Jeff?
Jeffrey Duchemin
I believe so, yes, absolutely, absolutely. 
Raymond Myers 
But, okay, good. As you look across the range of businesses worldwide, which product lines are performing relatively better? And then, what can you do shore up the laggers?
Jeffrey Duchemin
Well, I mean, you know this business, Ray. There is some product lines that performed really well and are market leaders. There is other legacy product lines that are not performing well and what we are focused on right now is accelerating the growth of our top performance, our top performing brands, our top performing product lines. 
We have some exciting technology and I think, I talked a little bit about it last quarter. I’ll talk about it again now, but how can we accelerate our growth in China? How can we accelerate our growth around our BTX product lines? Things like that and what we are doing is, we are adding resources. We are implementing sales and marketing activities around these growing brands and products for Harvard Bioscience and they are going to be the leader to turn this business around. 
The lagging products unfortunately, sometimes you have to put all your resources into focusing on what’s going to drive the growth of the business and the lagging product lines, there is different things we can do with different programs we can run. But we are really – at this point in time, more focused on the growth drivers for the business and there is several major product categories, our electrophysiology product lines, our BTX product lines, that’s where the focus is right now from a sales and marketing standpoint.
Raymond Myers 
Okay, that’s great. I would afford that focus. You touched on electrophysiology, that’s where I was going next. You’ve done a three large – or you made three EP acquisitions. They weren’t large, but in total they were large. About few years ago, how are those businesses performing now? And what have you learned about your acquisitive strategy vis-à-vis their performance? 
Jeffrey Duchemin
They performed well and we integrated the three companies into Harvard Bioscience. They were three very good acquisitions. One of the business units was slightly down last year, but what we did was, we added some sales capabilities to that business and what we are seeing is the book of business increase already through the end of Q1 this year. 
So the outlook for that business that was down last year is going to be positive this year. So now you have three acquisitions that are leading the way for Harvard Bioscience and back to your last question, where we are focused as an organization? 

We are focused on these three acquisitions because they are going to help turn this business around. So the electrophysiology business is really the leading product lines and brands that will transform this business moving forward.
Raymond Myers 
Okay, that sounds good. One question I had is, has there been any change in the proportion of sales made under direct distribution versus distributorship in this mix of the business? 
Jeffrey Duchemin
That’s a good question. I think the resources that we’ve added recently have been more on the direct side. Last year, we did add a Channel Manager in Asia to manage our Japanese business. But right now, the resources that we are discussing internally are more direct than they are for distribution management. 
Raymond Myers 
And I presume that’s at higher margin and maybe is that supporting why you are having higher gross margins?
Jeffrey Duchemin
Yes, our direct business is a higher margin business for us and obviously that would lead, if they are successful in their roles, that would lead to increased margin.
Raymond Myers 
Okay, good, good. I guess, lastly, we’ve talked on other calls about the opportunities for further tuck-in acquisitions. Where does that stand and do you still see that as a fund burner item?
Jeffrey Duchemin
It’s still part of our strategy. We still continue to review a pipeline of very interesting companies. But we are disciplined in our approach and unfortunately sometimes, some of these companies, their valuations are a little bit out of line from what we’d be willing to pay, but we are active as part of our strategy and we will continue to focus on that moving forward.
Raymond Myers 
Okay, sounds good. I look forward to your next update. Thank you.
Jeffrey Duchemin
Thanks, Ray.
Robert Gagnon
Thanks, Ray.
Operator 
And our last question comes from Lisa Springer from Singular Research. Your line is open.
Lisa Springer
Thank you. Hi Rob and Jeff.
Jeffrey Duchemin
Hi, Lisa.
Lisa Springer
My question concerns to markets in Japan and Korea, we’ve talked about the opportunities there. Could you give us a sense of the scope of those markets and what are the characteristics of those markets?
Jeffrey Duchemin
Well, I have more information in Korea than I do in Japan, only because I’ve been to Korea. I was in Korea back in February. The Korean market is a strong life science market overall. It’s been a very good market for us. We have excellent distribution partners there. Our physiology business is strong. Our molecular business is also very good in Korea. 
The Japan market though is a market that we just entered last year. We have a spectrophotometer market that we are trying to increase in Japan and we have a sales – actually a Channel Manager did a real nice job last year growing that small base of business. We expect to see that base of business continue to grow this year. 
But our strategy in Japan is to really start to pull some of the other high value products into that market. Our molecular – overall molecular products, our physiology products and electrophysiology products into that market. So that’s the goal in Japan this year. But the Korean market is a strong market. We have great distribution partners and we believe we will continue to see growth in 2017.
Lisa Springer
Okay, out of those markets compare in size to - say for example of the US market?
Jeffrey Duchemin
Well, they are much smaller. The Asian market as a whole is about 15% of our total revenue. I don’t think we’ve ever broken down each individual country in Asia. But the US is 50% of our revenue and the entire Asian market is 15%. So much smaller market.
Lisa Springer
Okay. And the next thing I wanted to ask you about is just, if you could update us on the ERP implementation, how that’s going globally? 

Jeffrey Duchemin
It’s gone very well. As I mentioned, couple of minutes ago, phase two is complete. It actually exceeded our expectations in terms of the team that was put in place to manage and integrate AX into our German facility. Now we move on to, I guess, you would call phase three and there is some other German facilities along with some US facilities that we are looking at right now for phase three. So there is no timeline on that. 
Lisa Springer
Okay. Okay, thank you guys. 
Jeffrey Duchemin
Thank you.
Operator 
We have no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Jeff Duchemin for final remarks.
Jeffrey Duchemin
Thank you everyone for calling in this afternoon. We appreciate it and we look forward to speaking to all of you on our Q2 earnings call. Thank you.

I will now turn the call over to Corey Manchester, Director of Finance and Investor Relations. Corey Manchester, you may begin.
Corey Manchester
Thank you, Adrian, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us for the Harvard Bioscience second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Leading the call today will be Jeffrey Duchemin, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Robert Gagnon, Chief Financial Officer of Harvard Bioscience.
Before I turn the call over to Jeff, I will read our Safe Harbor statement. In our discussion today, we may make statements that constitute forward-looking statements. Our actual results and performance may differ materially from what we have projected due to risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2016 and our other public filings. Any forward-looking statements, including those related to the Company's future results and activities, represent our estimates as of today and should not be relied upon as representing our estimates as of any subsequent date. 
Also, much of today’s call will focus on our non-GAAP quarterly results, which we believe better represents the ongoing economics of the business, reflects how we set and measure our incentive compensation plans and how we manage the business internally. The differences between our GAAP and non-GAAP results are outlined in the earnings release we issued today which can be found on our website under Press Releases.
Additionally, any material financial or other statistical information presented on the call which is not included in our press release will be archived and available in the Investor Relations section of our website. A replay of this call will also be available for one week at the same location on our website at harvardbioscience.com.
I will now turn the call over to Jeff Duchemin. Jeff, please go ahead.
Jeffrey Duchemin
Thanks, Corey. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us for our Q2 earnings call. On today’s call, I will start with a brief review of Q2 results, as well as an overall business update. Our CFO, Rob Gagnon will provide details on our financial results and our 2017 outlook. And after that, we look forward to taking your question s. 
During the second quarter, we produced solid business results and continued to execute our strategic objectives. Second quarter revenues were $25.2 million reflecting 1% organic growth excluding the impact of currency translation, and the disposition of AHN. We are encouraged by these results and believe we will continue this progress with 1% to 2% organic growth expected in the back half of the year. 
As a result, we expect 2017 revenue to be flat compared to 2016, which equates to the high end of our previously issued guidance range. Taking a look at our revenues from a geographic standpoint, our U.S. business grew approximately 3% in the second quarter. As I stated on our Q1 call, we are beginning to see positive signs of change with increased funding outlays from the NIH to academic labs.

NIH outlays are approximately 7% year-to-date. We continue to be optimistic that the second half of 2017 will experience a sustained acceleration of academic funding from the NIH. While funding outlays don’t immediately translate to increased academic spending, we are encouraged by the directional shift and are optimistic that spending will increase with the sustained acceleration of academic funding from the NIH. 
Although a quarter or two of positive numbers does not yet demonstrate a trend, we believe that the U.S. result this quarter is an encouraging indicator that certainty and optimism maybe returning to our end-customers. We are confident that our commercial organization will continue to execute the plan and is well positioned to benefit from these tailwinds. We believe our U.S. business is poised for continued top-line growth. 
Revenues in China increased approximately 56% in the second quarter. As you may remember, our Q1 results in China declined due to the impact of timing of instrumentation orders and on our call, we indicated that we anticipated a rebound. This quarter shows that rebound, as well as a continued strong execution by our commercial team. 
Overall, we continue to be pleased with our performance in China, which is one of the fastest growing lab, products, and service markets globally. We are also working with our team to further expand our reach and to capitalize on expansion into complementary territories including Japan, Korea and Southeast Asia. 
Europe continues to be a soft end-market due to foreign currency headwinds and weakness in the funding environment. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, and the impact of AHN, our Q2 European revenues were down approximately 10% year-over-year. We are focused on improving results in the second half of the year based on a number of initiatives, including the launch of two new products in our electrophysiology product portfolio. 
Overall, we are encouraged to see some acceleration in our business following a slower start to the year. And I would like to highlight one of our product lines. Our BTX product line continues to be a growth driver for the company. BTX, which is our legacy electroporation product line is experiencing growth due to its application in the rapidly growing gene editing market as a result of CRISPR. 
Although BTX sales makes up approximately 6% of our consolidated revenues, the strong growth we are experiencing is an example of our positioning in a new and exciting innovative life science market. 
In sum, we are pleased by our results in the second quarter and encouraged about our prospects for the back half of the year. More specifically, U.S. revenues grew 3% during the quarter. Revenues in China grew almost 60% and our BTX product line continues to make solid gains. In addition to these top-line highlights, gross margins expanded and operating expenses declined in the quarter. 
We remain focused on the strategic vision of our organization and believe that we will continue to drive top-line growth, improved profitability through operational performance and ultimately create shareholder value. 
With that, I will turn the discussion over to Rob Gagnon, who will provide more insight into our financials. Rob?
Robert Gagnon 
Okay, thanks, Jeff. Beginning with the top-line, revenues for the second quarter were $25.2 million, a decrease of 4% year-over-year as reported, revenues were down 1% year-over-year in constant currency. 
Second quarter revenues were also impacted by the divestiture of AHN in October 2016, which included approximately $620,000 of non-recurring revenue during the second quarter of 2016. Excluding the negative impact of currency translation and AHN, revenues on an organic basis grew 1% in the quarter.

Revenues year-to-date were $49.4 million, a decrease of $3.7 million or 7% compared with revenues of $53.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016. Revenues on a constant currency basis were $50.6 million, a decreased of $2.5 million or 5%. 
Included in that decline is the revenue impact from the prior year divestiture of AHN, which accounted for approximately $1.3 million. Excluding the negative impact of currency translation and AHN, revenues are down 2% year-to-date. 
Now turning to costs and expenses. Cost of revenue on a non-GAAP basis were $13.8 million for Q2, compared to $14.4 million for Q2 last year. As a result, our non-GAAP gross profit was $11.4 million this quarter, compared with $11.7 million for the second quarter of 2016. Gross profit margin was 45.1% in Q2, up from 44.7% in Q2 of last year. 
This 40 basis point increase in gross profit margin was partially muted by a few non-cash charges at some of our sites related to inventory write-downs. During our site consolidations in 2015, we increased levels of safety stock inventory to ensure a smooth transition. Most of that safety stock inventory has sold through to end-customers. 
However, some surplus inventory has remained on our books namely at our Coulbourn subsidiary. Through that amount we have on hand certain levels of reserve for as part of our own ongoing analysis of inventory. Excluding this item, which amounted to approximately $200,000 for the quarter, our gross profit margin would have increased over 100 basis points compared to Q2 of last year. 
And year-to-date, our gross profit margin was 46.4% essentially flat compared to the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating expenses for Q2 were $9.7 million, a decrease of $770,000 compared to $10.4 million in Q2 of last year. The decrease is due to the realization of continued cost containment measures as well as foreign currency favorability and the disposition of AHN. 
Year-to-date, non-GAAP operating expenses were $20 million, a decrease of $1 million compared to the same period last year. Operating income on a non-GAAP basis in Q2 increased to $1.7 million as compared to $1.2 million in Q2 of last year. Year-to-date, our operating income on a non-GAAP basis was $2.9 million as compared to $3.6 million for the same period last year.
Our non-GAAP operating margin in Q2 was 6.7%, this compares to an operating margin in Q2 of last year of 4.8% and year-to-date our operating margin was 5.8%, compared to 6.8% for the same period of last year. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was approximately 30% in Q2 compared to 25% in Q2 of last year. The increase in effective tax rate was primarily the result of jurisdictional mix of income and to a lesser extent changes in R&D tax credits. 
Our non-GAAP net income for Q2 was $870,000 or $0.03 per diluted share, compared with $0.03 per diluted share in Q2 of last year. And year-to-date, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.04 compared with $0.08 per diluted share in the same period of 2016. 
Before moving on, I’d like to highlight one below the line fluctuation that had an impact on our quarterly profitability. Due to changes in currency exchange rates, and the functional currency in which certain working capital balances are recognized, we reported a $270,000 currency loss in the quarter. This compares to a $280,000 currency gain in Q2 of last year. 
That swing, based on current shares and tax rate impacted our earnings by approximately a penny. Although we don’t have control over fluctuations in currency exchange rates, we are actively reviewing our working capital and the functional currencies in which they are held to identify steps to minimize the impact of future fluctuations. 
Weighted average shares outstanding was 34.7 million in Q2 as compared to 34.1 million in Q2 of last year. I will now turn to the balance sheet. We finished the quarter with approximately $4.7 million of cash accounts receivables were $16 million as compared to $15.7 million as of Q4 last year, an increase of $230,000. 

Inventory at the end of Q2 was $20.4 million compared to $20 million at the end of Q4 of last year. And our capital expenditures were $240,000 for Q2 compared to $200,000 for Q2 of last year. Debt at the end of Q2 was $13.3 million, compared to $13.9 million at the end of Q4 last year. 
Turning now to our financial outlook, we expect to report 1% to 2% organic revenue growth for Q3 and Q4 which equates to the high end of our previously issued full year revenue guidance. In terms of dollars, 1% to 2% represents third quarter revenue of $24.6 million to $24.8 million and fourth quarter revenue of $26.5 million to $26.8 million. 
On the bottom-line, we are updating our full year 2016 earnings per share guidance to reflect current expectations including foreign currency rates as well as the negative impact of the non-cash inventory charge that we incurred in Q2. 
As a result, we now expect 2017 non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.13 to $0.15. From a quarterly standpoint, we expect to report $0.03 to $0.04 in the third quarter and $0.05 to $0.06 in the fourth quarter. 
We will now open the call to questions from participants. Operator?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from William March from Janney. Please go ahead, your line is open.
William March 
Hey guys. How are you?
Jeffrey Duchemin
Hey, Bill.
Robert Gagnon
Hey, Bill. Good, how are you?
William March 
Doing well. First question, Jeff, you called out the BTX product segment. This is the first time you are talking about it, maybe could you just give us a little more detail on the application and is it for clinical research kind of where, who is behind it? 
And then maybe a bigger picture, just in terms of your different product segment, if you could give us a sense of where you are seeing growth coming from, whether it’s cell analysis, lab equipment, molecular analysis, just kind of an underlying growth trend for each of the segments?
Jeffrey Duchemin
BTX is a product family that has been part of Harvard Bioscience for several years. It’s a legacy product. And it’s used in gene editing, transfections, it’s an electroporation device and because of the CRISPR transfection application that the industry is seeing the increase in gene editing. This product has been also increasing with the demand of this type of application. 
It’s one of the faster growing product families that we have in Harvard Bioscience today. One of the things that we’ve done this year is added resources to accelerate that growth over the years – over the last several years, we have increased our capabilities in Asia and we’ve seen very good results as you saw this quarter with 56% increase in sales. 
And one of things we’ve done is we’ve added a resource in China for our BTX product line. So we expect continued growth in this area. We will continue to add resources where needed. But BTX has been a fantastic product for us and we got a great commercial and marketing team executing to our plan this year around this family. In regard to some of the other product families, we have acquired three companies over the last couple of years in electrophysiology, our Multi Channel Systems business, Triangle BioSystems and HEKA Electronik. 
In electrophysiology, one of the things that we’ve done is we’ve added resources in the U.S. One of the opportunities for us when we bought Multi Channel Systems was taking advantage of their market presence in Europe, but lack of market presence here in the U.S. by adding resources and building an electrophysiology sales team we’re actually starting to see positive results come from that. 
It’s taken about a year to get our resources in place and trained and on the ground running, but here in the U.S. we saw positive results in the quarter from electrophysiology. In our Denville business, our lab products and supply business, we’ve added some new people in that business and we are actually seeing nice turnaround there. 

Bookings are increasing. We have a new Director of Operations in our Charlotte facility who has done a great job. And our sales and marketing teams are putting in new initiatives to help drive the growth of Denville. So, I think that really covers our three basic product families. 
William March 
Got it. And then, in terms of capital deployment, you made a slew of acquisitions a few years ago, and in the past couple of years, you’ve been taking the cash flow and paying down debt. Maybe just where are you in terms of strategy on M&A and what areas are you looking for to maybe add products to your portfolio?
Jeffrey Duchemin
Yes, Bill, let me take a step back on this question, add a little color to it. Where we were, where we are today and where we expect to go? So, as you remember, three or four years ago, this was a very fragmented business. We had ten plus manufacturing facilities. We’ve reduced that in half. We had ten plus legacy systems – computer systems with our new ERP implementation, we’ve cut that in half. 
We had an outdated product portfolio. We’ve implemented new product development processes. There was a need for geographic expansion in our business. We’ve added a sales team in China in seeing the results that we’ve had in China over the last couple of years. Along with that, we faced some challenging headwinds. 
Foreign currency, devaluations has had an impact on this business. GE exited the spectrophotometer business. In the funding landscape specifically the NIH has been very difficult over the last years, but we are seeing a rebound this year. With all of that, with all of the work that’s been done internally, I think we are at a point right now, we are actually starting to see the benefits of building this foundation. But we knew we had to do this all along. 
We knew it would be difficult. We knew we would not be rewarded for it. But by building this foundation it’s allowed us now to grow organically and we believe we will continue to see organic growth moving forward and then also it puts us in a great position to start making acquisitions. And so that’s where we are today and we feel very positive about the position we are in today and where we are going in the future. 
William March 
Got it. And then, just one last one. Rob, maybe more so, just if you could help walk us through the update for the back half of the year in terms of it seems like the one-off inventory thing was impact to gross margins, kind of how do you see margins playing out in the back half of the year both in terms of gross margin and then operating expenses? Thanks guys.
Robert Gagnon
Yes, thanks, Bill. Let me – I want to go back and just repeat some of the guidance that we covered a few minutes ago just to make sure it’s clear to folks. On the top-line we are expecting 1% to 2% organic revenue growth. That means, for the third quarter $24.6 million to $24.8 million, that’s 1% to 2% organic growth. 
For the fourth quarter, it would be $26.5 million to $28. - $26.8 million, excuse me, $26.5 million to $26.8 million. So I want to make sure that that’s clear what the organic numbers are and what that growth would look like. On the EPS side, $0.13 to $0.15, you are correct, revised because of the inventory charges that we took in the second quarter relating to those site consolidations that we initiated back at the end of 2014 into 2015, we wanted to make sure that we had ample safety stock and over shot the market I think on a few of the markets. 
In terms of what that breaks down to on a quarterly basis, the fourth quarter always being the – typically being the strongest quarter of the business, so it’s going to have higher EPS. So for the third quarter, it’s $0.03 to $0.04, in the fourth quarter it’s $0.05 to $0.06. In terms of gross margins, so, Q2 last year was our lowest quarter in the year. 

We are certainly down sequentially in gross margins. But we are still expecting over the long run that gross margins will be in the range of 46% to 47%, sorry, 47% to 48%. And on operating expenses, we were favorable almost $800,000 in the quarter , real good result this quarter, any time we are below $10 million I think is good for our business. Wouldn’t expect that to repeat in the back half of the year, but we are certainly seeing good favorability around operating expenses. So hope that helps. 
William March 
Yes, thanks guys. 
Jeffrey Duchemin
Thanks, Bill.
Operator 
And our next question comes from Raymond Myers from Benchmark. Please go ahead. 
Raymond Myers 
Yes, thank you. Rob, let me just clarify what you said, you don’t expect the really nice decline in Q2 operating expense to continue in the second half. You don’t expect the $800,000 sequential decline to repeat again or the rate of $11.3 million of operating expense. Will that return back to a higher rate in the second half?
Robert Gagnon
No, no. I wouldn’t expect that to happen again. I would expect that this level of $9.7 million for the quarter would be a good level in terms of projecting forward for the next couple of quarters. Probably, actually slightly higher than that, but in that range of sort of probably $9.8 million to $10 million as an estimate. 
Raymond Myers 
Okay, great. That’s excellent cost control. Congratulations on achieving the positive organic revenue growth. That’s a real accomplishment. What are the factors that most contributed to that improvement now?
Robert Gagnon
Ray, as you know, we put a lot of time and effort into many initiatives into our commercial teams globally in all three of our major product categories. Everything from continuing our geographic expansion and building up our capabilities in Asia, building electrophysiology sales team here in the U.S. and now, more than ever really adding some exciting initiatives and new product launches in Europe to help drive and offset the decline we are seeing in Europe, that’s really where the focus has been over the last couple of years. 
Raymond Myers 
Okay, great. Let me touch on that. You mentioned adding two electrophysiology products in Europe. Can you elaborate on those and what opportunity they create?
Jeffrey Duchemin
Yes, the two products there is, what we call an ME2100 and an MEA2100. One is an in vivo the other one is an in vitro system. And what this allows us to do is, obviously bringing incremental sales revenue for the back half of the year in Europe, but it also allows us to continue the growth that we’ve seen in the U.S. in the first half of the year. 
And really differentiate ourselves among some of our competitors. We are excited about this and one of the great aspects of acquiring a company like Multi Channel Systems was their ability to innovate and develop new products and launch new products and we are starting to see that now, not only with our electrophysiology business, but throughout the entire company. 
Raymond Myers 
That’s great. I’ve got an accounting question for Rob. These inventory charges in the second quarter that affect your full year guidance. Have you’ve given any thought to excluding them on a non-GAAP basis? Or are you just being conservative?
Robert Gagnon
Yes. Hey, Ray, thanks. I am not sure that it’s - yes, I would, it’s probably some level of conservatism. But inventory reserves and write-offs come up from time-to-time, certainly not at this magnitude. So I think it’s more of a consistency thing. We have treated write-offs in the past this way and so we thought the best thing to do was to be consistent, but highlighted for folks that they were aware of what was driving that lower margin and the EPS charge. 
Raymond Myers 

Okay, great. Like the conservatism. Let me touch again on the pipeline for acquisitions. Do you have a robust pipeline to identify potential acquisitions? And would you still expect to be able to finance these with other cash or low cost debt?
Robert Gagnon
Ray, we have a robust portfolio of companies that strategically make a lot of sense for Harvard Bioscience. But at this point in time, the focus of this company has been gaining organic growth. We will get to a point sometime hopefully in the near future where we will start to acquire companies again. But right now, I would say the focus of the organization is on organic growth and that’s where we are dedicating our time and resources. 
Jeffrey Duchemin
And Ray, just in terms of capital available to us, to the extent we do execute on tuck-in acquisition s, we are going to look to cash on the balance sheet as well as that credit facility we have through Bank of America, which you know is a commercial rate facility 4%, 4.5%, very attractive yields. That’s what we would look to in terms of financing those acquisitions. 
Raymond Myers 
Okay, great. And thank you and congratulations for restoring the organic growth. 
Jeffrey Duchemin
Thanks, Ray.
Robert Gagnon
Thanks, Ray.
Operator 
And your next question comes from Lisa Springer from Singular Research. Please go ahead. 
Lisa Springer 
Hello, Rob and Jeff. I wanted to ask a couple more questions about Europe. You mentioned new products is something that’s going to help shore up that business. Could you give us – or first of all are those products available right now? Or are they going to start selling in Europe in the third quarter? 
And secondly, could you give us a little bit of a big picture overview of Europe? What would it take for that market to become attracting? How low was the dollar has to go before you would start to see some meaningful sales growth there?
Jeffrey Duchemin
The new products will be launched this quarter and we are actually taking orders for those new products now. So, we will generate revenue in Q3 for these new products. In regards to get Europe to be a growth driver for Harvard Bioscience, I think we need a couple things to happen. Number one, we need currency to stabilize. 
We need the academic investment community to basically see, compete with what we are seeing here in the U.S. with the NIH and what we are seeing in China. I believe that will happen. I believe we will see a turnaround in Europe. The question is timing, when that will happen. But in the mean time, what we are doing is, we are installing many different initiatives that weren’t in place in the past to help drive and grow business and offset anything we are seeing in the lack of funding on the academic environment in Europe. 
So, right now, there are many sales marketing initiatives in place for our cell and animal physiology business, for our electrophysiology business that we believe will help reduce the decline we’ve seen in Europe over the last couple quarters. 
Lisa Springer 
Okay, thank you. 
Operator 
And our next question comes from [Indiscernible] Please go ahead. 
Unidentified Analyst
Yes, it’s [Indiscernible] Capital. Good afternoon gentlemen and it’s a nice quarter. Congratulations there. 
Jeffrey Duchemin
Thank you. 
Unidentified Analyst
Could you guys just go over your CapEx for the back half of the year? And, just a little more granularity on your – taking your computer systems from ten down to five, where are you going to take that? What’s the goal there?
Robert Gagnon
Hi, Matt. It’s Rob. Yes, so in terms of CapEx, we expect between $1.5 million and $2 million for the year. The business requires about $1 million of maintenance capital. And so it’s really that strategic capital that makes up the difference. In terms of ERP, the infrastructure is in place. The licenses are acquired. 

They were acquired a few years ago. So lot of that spend is behind us. There is certainly some cap out on our consulting dollars and service spend as we continue to wrap up the ERP program But we are not expecting them to be significant relative to capital and where it’s headed to next couple of years. 
Unidentified Analyst
Great. Thank you very much and good work. 
Robert Gagnon
Thanks, Matt. 
Jeffrey Duchemin
Thanks, Matt. 
Operator 
And our next question comes from Jon McCullough from Glacier Peak. Please go ahead. 
Jon McCullough
Thanks for taking my call or my question. I know you might have dived into this in the past, and I have missed it. But I know currency has been a headwind, but we’ve kind of to the end of June had a pretty good move in the dollar/euro or the dollar has weakened. Should so, could we see the headwind either subside or reverse going forward? Just any clarity there would be helpful.
Robert Gagnon
Yes, thanks for the question. So in terms of the back half of the year, we – currency is no longer a headwind. And so, as of the end of the quarter, June 30 and for the first couple of weeks of June, I would have said, if rates stay where they are, it’s actually somewhat neutralized in this and there is essentially no impact to the business, or very little impact to the business. 
But just over the last week or so, the euro has really strengthened from about the 112 level up to 117, 118, somewhere around there. So it is – still it’s very volatile, challenging to predict. 117 is still an awful far cry from 135 where it was two years ago. But certainly if it continues to strengthen would help with our European businesses. But difficult to quantify, those are long ways to go. 
Jon McCullough
All right. And then it sounds like you guys are again doing great in China. I know you mentioned in the last quarter about starting to roll out or get going in Japan, possibly Korea, kind of any color there of how it’s going or just?
Jeffrey Duchemin
Yes, more Japan and I think Korea has been a great market for us for many years and we have great distribution partners there. But in Japan, we added a resource last year. We are building up our distribution network there. Things are progressing forward. We like what we see and I think there is a bright future for us there. So, we are still in the beginning stages of building up our business in Japan. But, we are moving forward with it. 
Jon McCullough
Got it. And then, I know it’s always it’s a wildcard with political environment changing every minute. But, I guess with the budget NIH the whole nine yards, which is how you guys are looking at, thinking about it going into next year or sort of do you still feel that Bipartisan will still kind of protect NIH?
Jeffrey Duchemin
Yes, I mean, we like what we see with the NIH. Year-to-date, funding outlays is up 7%. Right now, there is a proposal for about $1 billion increase for the 2018 budget. So, yes, I mean, things are moving forward with the NIH. I think this Bipartisan’s support there and we like the position we are in moving forward because of that. 
Jon McCullough
Perfect. Thank you so much guys. 
Jeffrey Duchemin
Thanks a lot.
Operator 
That concludes the question answer session. And I will turn the call back over to Jeff for final remarks. 
Jeffrey Duchemin
Thank you, everyone and thanks for your continued support around Harvard Bioscience. We look forward to talking to all of you in the October timeframe. So thank you very much. I appreciate it.
