NEW YORK, March 30, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Silvercrest Asset Management Group Inc. (NASDAQ:   SAMG) (the "Company") today announced that Silvercrest Asset Management Group LLC ("Silvercrest") has signed a definitive agreement to acquire certain assets of Jamison, Eaton & Wood, Inc. ("Jamison") for approximately $12 million in cash, notes, stock and deferred consideration in the form of a cash earnout. With offices in Bedminster and Princeton, NJ, Jamison is a registered investment advisor that oversees nearly $1 billion in total assets, primarily on behalf of high-net-worth families. The firm also advises on sizeable non-discretionary assets for private and public institutions.
The acquisition is expected to close during the second quarter of this year. The combined firm will have nearly $19 billion of assets under management.
According to Richard R. Hough III, CEO and president of Silvercrest, "Jamison has a proud 40-year history as an investment boutique, and is well-regarded for its client service and dedication to sound financial management." He noted that the strategic acquisition will strengthen Silvercrest's presence in the greater New York market.
Keith H. Wood, CEO and a founder of Jamison, said, "We sensed from the outset of our conversations with Silvercrest that combining forces could create meaningful benefits for clients of both organizations. Our shared values make this an unusually good fit, and we are genuinely excited about working together in ways that can enhance the future for all clients, employees and stockholders."
Mr. Hough added, "Our new partners and colleagues from Jamison share Silvercrest's vision to deliver excellent investment performance and superb client service, within a work environment that prizes integrity and collegiality."
About Jamison
Jamison is an independent, owner-managed registered investment advisor, founded in 1972. On behalf of its clients, the firm seeks to construct diversified portfolios of securities designed to mitigate risk and generate above average returns.
About Silvercrest
Silvercrest was founded in April 2002 as an independent, employee-owned registered investment adviser. With offices in New York, Boston and Virginia, Silvercrest provides traditional and alternative investment advisory and family office services to wealthy families and select institutional investors.

silvercrest




Silvercrest Asset Management Group is a registered investment advisor that provides asset management and family office services to families and select institutional investors. Clients choose Silvercrest for our integrity, consistency and proven record of success in the financial services industry. Unfettered by affiliations with any bank, broker-dealer or investment bank, Silvercrest is positioned to put our clients' goals first. 
 

It is our goal to provide an unparalleled level of quality advice to every one of our clients. In addition to our modern approach to portfolio construction, we offer a level of personalized service and open communication not found at larger organizations that ensure our clients feel comfortable and secure with choosing Silvercrest.





client focus




Attention to detail, transparency and uncompromising quality of service are paramount in how we manage the wealth of our clients. We listen and help define objectives for the short- and long-term, never employing a cookie-cutter approach, but customizing every portfolio to the specific needs of each client. Silvercrest’s portfolio managers also conduct regular peer reviews to assure that each client is receiving the firm’s best thinking at all times.

 

Additionally, because each senior portfolio manager is a Silvercrest shareholder, each is highly motivated to go the extra mile on behalf of our clients.Finally, beyond our proprietary investment capabilities, we strive to offer our clients greater levels of portfolio diversification through trusted outsourced investment interests.





integrity





In an era of unprecedented consolidation within the financial services industry, many of the great names in private banking and investment counseling have either vanished or sacrificed their independence to become global consolidators. With asset growth and product placement as the main drivers of success among the financial service supermarkets, private-client professionals and their clients alike have been victimized by the consolidators’ business goals of greater scale, enhanced market share and global reach.

  

Silvercrest is home to a dynamic, open business environment where sound ethics, mutual respect and deep integrity are the status quo. Free from the conflicts of interest and office politics of larger corporations, we are better able to guide our clients to their financial goals. We enjoy working with each other and we enjoy working with our clients. The quality, integrity and independence of our advice, coupled with our unwavering commitment to client service, sets us apart in a crowded field.

NEW YORK, May 4, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Silvercrest Asset Management Group Inc. (NASDAQ:    SAMG) (the "Company" or "Silvercrest") today reported the results of its operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.
Business Update








Silvercrest has begun 2017 by continuing its history of strong organic growth by adding $230 million in new assets, primarily from ultra-high net worth families. The first quarter of 2017 was one of the strongest quarters for new commitments over the past few years.
Beneficial market conditions, combined with Silvercrest's organic growth, increased discretionary assets by approximately $537 million during the first quarter of 2017 to a total of $14.3 billion as of March 31, 2017, representing a 17% increase in discretionary assets under management since the first quarter of 2016, and a new high for discretionary assets at the firm. Importantly, the firm achieved this growth while maintaining its fee basis for assets under management, bucking industry trends. The firm also has maintained its Adjusted EBITDA margins while continuing to invest in the business for future growth and to better serve our clients.
Silvercrest's proprietary value equity strategies continue to perform well and we maintain our optimism about growing our high quality institutional relationships, in contrast to many competitors who actively manage assets on behalf of their clients.
Finally, Silvercrest and its partners celebrated 15 years as an independent firm last month. We are extraordinarily proud of the legacy we are building; we are grateful for the long trust placed in our firm by our clients; and we are as excited about our firm's future growth as at any point in our history.
On May 2, 2017, the Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share of Class A common stock.  The dividend will be paid on or about June 20, 2017 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on June 13, 2017.
First Quarter 2017 Highlights

Total Assets Under Management ("AUM") of $19.3 billion, inclusive of discretionary AUM of $14.3 billion and non-discretionary AUM of $5.0 billion at March 31, 2017. 
Revenue of $22.0 million. 
U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") consolidated net income and net income attributable to Silvercrest of $3.3 million and $1.7 million, respectively. 
Basic and diluted net income per share of $0.21. 
Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("Adjusted EBITDA")1 of $6.5 million 
Adjusted net income1 of $3.0 million. 
Adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share1 of $0.23 and $0.22, respectively.

 Adjusted measures are non-GAAP measures and are explained and reconciled to the comparable GAAP measures in Exhibits 2 and 3. 


 2 
 Adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share measures for the three months ended March 31, 2017 are based on the number of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock outstanding as of March 31, 2017.  Adjusted diluted earnings per share are further based on the addition of unvested restricted stock units to the extent dilutive at the end of the reporting period. 


 3 
 We have computed average AUM by averaging AUM at the beginning of the applicable period and AUM at the end of the applicable period. 




AUM at $19.3 billion
Silvercrest's discretionary assets under management increased by $2.1 billion, or 17.2%, to $14.3 billion at March 31, 2017 from $12.2 billion at March 31, 2016.  Silvercrest's total AUM increased by $2.3 billion, or 13.5%, to $19.3 billion at March 31, 2017 from $17.0 billion at March 31, 2016.  The increase in total AUM was attributable to net client inflows of $1.6 billion and market appreciation of $0.8 billion.
Silvercrest's discretionary assets under management increased by $0.5 billion, or 3.6%, to $14.3 billion at March 31, 2017 from $13.8 billion at December 31, 2016.  Silvercrest's total AUM increased by $0.7 billion, or 3.8%, to $19.3 billion at March 31, 2017 from $18.6 billion at December 31, 2016.  The increase in total AUM was attributable to market appreciation of $0.5 billion and net client inflows of $0.2 billion. 
Our total assets under management exclude approximately $16.6 billion of non-discretionary assets of a public treasurers' office for which we became advisor in connection with the acquisition of Jamison, Eaton & Wood, Inc. (the "Jamison acquisition"), which closed on June 30, 2015.  Silvercrest provides advisory services to this office with a fee cap of $825 thousand per annum. We exclude these assets because they are related to a unique client relationship for which the fee cap is significantly disproportionate to the related assets under management. This fee arrangement is not indicative of our average fee rate.
First Quarter 2017 vs. First Quarter 2016
Revenue increased by $2.7 million, or 14.0%, to $22.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, from $19.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. This increase was driven by growth in our management and advisory fees as a result of increased assets under management.
Total expenses increased by $1.6 million, or 10.0%, to $17.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 from $15.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. Compensation and benefits expense increased by $1.7 million, or 14.3%, to $13.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 from $11.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the accrual for bonuses of $1.3 million, an increase in salaries expense of $0.3 million primarily as a result of merit-based increases and an increase in equity-based compensation of $0.1 million due to the granting of restricted stock units in August 2015 and May 2016.  General and administrative expenses decreased by $0.1 million, or 1.7%, to $4.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 from $4.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in investment research costs of $0.1 million mainly due to a reduction in accrued soft dollar-related research costs, a decrease in sub-advisory and referral fees of $0.1 million due to a decrease in sub-advisory revenue, a decrease in telephone expense of $0.1 million and a decrease in client reimbursements of $0.1 million, partially offset by an increase in professional fees of $0.1 million mainly due to an enhanced documentation project related to our operations group.  
Consolidated net income was $3.3 million.  Net income attributable to Silvercrest was $1.7 million, or $0.21 per basic and diluted share for the three months ended March 31, 2017.  Our Adjusted Net Income1 was $3.0 million, or $0.23 per adjusted basic share and $0.22 per adjusted diluted share1, 2 for the three months ended March 31, 2017.
Adjusted EBITDA1 was $6.5 million or 29.6% of revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2017 as compared to $5.3 million or 27.3% of revenue for the same period in the prior year.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash and cash equivalents were approximately $22.7 million at March 31, 2017, compared to $37.5 million at December 31, 2016. Silvercrest L.P. had notes payable of $2.4 million at March 31, 2017 and $2.5 million at December 31, 2016.  As of March 31, 2017, no amount had been drawn down on our term loan and there was nothing outstanding on our revolving credit facility with City National Bank.  
Total stockholders' equity was $48.1 million at March 31, 2017.  We had 8,100,205 shares of Class A common stock outstanding and 4,840,295 shares of Class B common stock outstanding at March 31, 2017.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To provide investors with additional insight, promote transparency and allow for a more comprehensive understanding of the information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making, we supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a basis consistent with GAAP with Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Earnings Per Share which are non-GAAP financial measures of earnings.  These adjustments, and the non-GAAP financial measures that are derived from them, provide supplemental information to analyze our operations between periods and over time. Investors should consider our non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

EBITDA represents net income before provision for income taxes, interest income, interest expense, depreciation and amortization. 
We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA without giving effect to the Delaware franchise tax, professional fees associated with acquisitions or financing transactions, gains on extinguishment of debt or other obligations related to acquisitions, impairment charges and losses on disposals or abandonment of assets and leaseholds, client reimbursements and fund redemption costs, severance and other similar expenses, but including partner incentive allocations, prior to our initial public offering, as an expense. We feel that it is important to management and investors to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis with Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure of earnings, as this measure provides a perspective of recurring earnings of the Company, taking into account earnings attributable to both Class A and Class B shareholders. 
Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by total revenue. We feel that it is important to management and investors to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis with Adjusted EBITDA Margin, a non-GAAP financial measure of earnings, as this measure provides a perspective of recurring profitability of the Company, taking into account profitability attributable to both Class A and Class B shareholders. 
Adjusted Net Income represents recurring net income without giving effect to professional fees associated with acquisitions or financing transactions, losses on forgiveness of notes receivable from our principals, gains on extinguishment of debt or other obligations related to acquisitions, impairment charges and losses on disposals or abandonment of assets and leaseholds, client reimbursements and fund redemption costs, severance and other similar expenses, but including partner incentive allocations, prior to our initial public offering, as an expense. Furthermore, Adjusted Net Income includes income tax expense assuming a blended corporate rate of 40%. We feel that it is important to management and investors to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis with Adjusted Net Income, a non-GAAP financial measure of earnings, as this measure provides a perspective of recurring income of the Company, taking into account income attributable to both Class A and Class B shareholders. 
Adjusted Earnings Per Share represents Adjusted Net Income divided by the actual Class A and Class B shares outstanding as of the end of the reporting period for basic Adjusted Earnings Per Share, and to the extent dilutive, we add unvested deferred equity units, restricted stock units and performance units to the total shares outstanding to compute diluted Adjusted Earnings Per Share. As a result of our structure, which includes a non-controlling interest, we feel that it is important to management and investors to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis with Adjusted Earnings Per Share, a non-GAAP financial measure of earnings, as this measure provides a perspective of recurring earnings per share of the Company as a whole as opposed to being limited to our Class A common stock.

 Returns are based upon a time weighted rate of return of various fully discretionary equity portfolios with similar investment objectives, strategies and policies and other relevant criteria managed by Silvercrest Asset Management Group LLC ("SAMG LLC"), a subsidiary of Silvercrest. Performance results are gross of fees and net of commission charges. An investor's actual return will be reduced by the advisory fees and any other expenses it may incur in the management of the investment advisory account. SAMG LLC's standard advisory fees are described in Part 2 of its Form ADV. Actual fees and expenses will vary depending on a variety of factors, including the size of a particular account. Returns greater than one year are shown as annualized compounded returns and include gains and accrued income and reinvestment of distributions. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

HIGH RISK INVESTMENT WARNING:

                End-users of the NetDania software that make use of the trading integration features as direct clients of integrated brokers, should be aware of the level of risk carried by trading in financial markets.

You should be aware of all the risks associated with trading, and seek advice from your broker and or an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts. Anyone opening a live trading account needs to adhere to the laws of their local country as such laws may differ from country to country.
