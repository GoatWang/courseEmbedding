Why you are getting so many unwanted calls

					Most legitimate companies will not call you if your phone number is on the Do Not Call Registry. However, scammers do not adhere
					to this rule and will relentlessly call as many phone numbers as possible. Current technology also makes it easy for them to “spoof”
					or fake the caller ID.
				

					The best practice is to simply Not Answer calls from numbers you do not recognize and let it go to voicemail. Although that may not
					be practical for some, legitimate callers will usually leave a message and you can return those specific calls. You can
					read more here from the FTC.
