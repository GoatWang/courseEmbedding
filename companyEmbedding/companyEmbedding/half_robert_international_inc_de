History[edit]





This section needs expansion with: information on the company's products, performance, leadership, and status, in particular, for years other than 1948 and 1986-2003. You can help by adding to it. (February 2017)


The company's founding was in 1948,[5] in New York City,[1][self-published source] with its original name being variously reported as being Robert Half Inc., Robert Half Finance & Accounting,[5] and Robert Half Personnel Agency.[1][self-published source] The founding, in any case, is reported to have been of two separate business entities, the Robert Half (RH) portion as "an employment agency for accountants," and the Accountemps portion "to supply accountants and other financial professionals… on a temporary basis."[5] Founder Robert Half had previously managed the hiring of accounting staff for a sizeable textile manufacturing concern, and saw an opportunity as no placement agency had been focusing on this sector of the market.[1][self-published source]
In the mid- to late-1980s, Robert Half (RH) altered its prior focus—which had been like that of the field in general—from relatively undifferentiated temporary clerical and light industry staffing, to providing temporary workers at higher skill levels via new "professional staffing divisions".[6][self-published source] Having grown to over 150 locations in the United States and launched an aggressive campaign to re-purchase many of the separate franchises, the firm went public in 1987, then expanded its operations into Europe in 1993.[5] In addition to their Accountemps brand, the firm expanded to include specialty groups focusing on technology, legal and creative services personnel.[5] Inroads into the legal sector began with the company's 1991 acquisition of "The Affiliates, a firm in Southern California that placed temporary and permanent paralegal, legal administrative, and other legal support personnel," with it being renamed as Robert Half Legal.[5]
Robert Half went on to establish itself as a key information provider for government agencies and others seeking statistics and trends regarding employment,[when?] with its market-specific salary guides being used as a resource by the U.S Department of Labor in the preparation of their own forecasts.[5]
In addition to their main staffing line of business, RH also provides independent risk consulting, internal audit and information technology consulting services via its Protiviti subsidiary, which was founded in 2002 with the acquisition of former employees of Arthur Andersen.[5][7] Since then, the group has grown from 700 to over 2,900 staff,[8][self-published source] and continues to be led by Andersen alumni.[citation needed]
In 2003, the company was finally able to buy back the last of the few remaining independent franchise operations.[5]
Published works[edit]
Founder Robert Half's tradition of authoring books on the industry—such as Making It Big in Data Processing[full citation needed] and How to Get a Better Job in This Crazy World[full citation needed]—was continued by the CEO of this date,[when?] Harold M. "Max" Messmer,[citation needed] in the form of works like Job Hunting for Dummies.[full citation needed][5]

History[edit]





This section needs expansion with: information on the company's products, performance, leadership, and status, in particular, for years other than 1948 and 1986-2003. You can help by adding to it. (February 2017)


The company's founding was in 1948,[5] in New York City,[1][self-published source] with its original name being variously reported as being Robert Half Inc., Robert Half Finance & Accounting,[5] and Robert Half Personnel Agency.[1][self-published source] The founding, in any case, is reported to have been of two separate business entities, the Robert Half (RH) portion as "an employment agency for accountants," and the Accountemps portion "to supply accountants and other financial professionals… on a temporary basis."[5] Founder Robert Half had previously managed the hiring of accounting staff for a sizeable textile manufacturing concern, and saw an opportunity as no placement agency had been focusing on this sector of the market.[1][self-published source]
In the mid- to late-1980s, Robert Half (RH) altered its prior focus—which had been like that of the field in general—from relatively undifferentiated temporary clerical and light industry staffing, to providing temporary workers at higher skill levels via new "professional staffing divisions".[6][self-published source] Having grown to over 150 locations in the United States and launched an aggressive campaign to re-purchase many of the separate franchises, the firm went public in 1987, then expanded its operations into Europe in 1993.[5] In addition to their Accountemps brand, the firm expanded to include specialty groups focusing on technology, legal and creative services personnel.[5] Inroads into the legal sector began with the company's 1991 acquisition of "The Affiliates, a firm in Southern California that placed temporary and permanent paralegal, legal administrative, and other legal support personnel," with it being renamed as Robert Half Legal.[5]
Robert Half went on to establish itself as a key information provider for government agencies and others seeking statistics and trends regarding employment,[when?] with its market-specific salary guides being used as a resource by the U.S Department of Labor in the preparation of their own forecasts.[5]
In addition to their main staffing line of business, RH also provides independent risk consulting, internal audit and information technology consulting services via its Protiviti subsidiary, which was founded in 2002 with the acquisition of former employees of Arthur Andersen.[5][7] Since then, the group has grown from 700 to over 2,900 staff,[8][self-published source] and continues to be led by Andersen alumni.[citation needed]
In 2003, the company was finally able to buy back the last of the few remaining independent franchise operations.[5]
Published works[edit]
Founder Robert Half's tradition of authoring books on the industry—such as Making It Big in Data Processing[full citation needed] and How to Get a Better Job in This Crazy World[full citation needed]—was continued by the CEO of this date,[when?] Harold M. "Max" Messmer,[citation needed] in the form of works like Job Hunting for Dummies.[full citation needed][5]

History[edit]





This section needs expansion with: information on the company's products, performance, leadership, and status, in particular, for years other than 1948 and 1986-2003. You can help by adding to it. (February 2017)


The company's founding was in 1948,[5] in New York City,[1][self-published source] with its original name being variously reported as being Robert Half Inc., Robert Half Finance & Accounting,[5] and Robert Half Personnel Agency.[1][self-published source] The founding, in any case, is reported to have been of two separate business entities, the Robert Half (RH) portion as "an employment agency for accountants," and the Accountemps portion "to supply accountants and other financial professionals… on a temporary basis."[5] Founder Robert Half had previously managed the hiring of accounting staff for a sizeable textile manufacturing concern, and saw an opportunity as no placement agency had been focusing on this sector of the market.[1][self-published source]
In the mid- to late-1980s, Robert Half (RH) altered its prior focus—which had been like that of the field in general—from relatively undifferentiated temporary clerical and light industry staffing, to providing temporary workers at higher skill levels via new "professional staffing divisions".[6][self-published source] Having grown to over 150 locations in the United States and launched an aggressive campaign to re-purchase many of the separate franchises, the firm went public in 1987, then expanded its operations into Europe in 1993.[5] In addition to their Accountemps brand, the firm expanded to include specialty groups focusing on technology, legal and creative services personnel.[5] Inroads into the legal sector began with the company's 1991 acquisition of "The Affiliates, a firm in Southern California that placed temporary and permanent paralegal, legal administrative, and other legal support personnel," with it being renamed as Robert Half Legal.[5]
Robert Half went on to establish itself as a key information provider for government agencies and others seeking statistics and trends regarding employment,[when?] with its market-specific salary guides being used as a resource by the U.S Department of Labor in the preparation of their own forecasts.[5]
In addition to their main staffing line of business, RH also provides independent risk consulting, internal audit and information technology consulting services via its Protiviti subsidiary, which was founded in 2002 with the acquisition of former employees of Arthur Andersen.[5][7] Since then, the group has grown from 700 to over 2,900 staff,[8][self-published source] and continues to be led by Andersen alumni.[citation needed]
In 2003, the company was finally able to buy back the last of the few remaining independent franchise operations.[5]
Published works[edit]
Founder Robert Half's tradition of authoring books on the industry—such as Making It Big in Data Processing[full citation needed] and How to Get a Better Job in This Crazy World[full citation needed]—was continued by the CEO of this date,[when?] Harold M. "Max" Messmer,[citation needed] in the form of works like Job Hunting for Dummies.[full citation needed][5]

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

Robert Half International Inc. (RHI) reaches -0.77% down to its SMA-50

By Andrew Carr -   July 25, 2017 0 57

Robert Half International Inc. (RHI) stock price traded with dropping change along with the volume 1.52 million shares in Friday trading session. Shares are trading price at $47.17 with move of -2.58%. The company’s 3-months average volume stands at 0.9 million. When we divide the last trade volume by the 3-month average volume, we found out a relative volume of 1.68. Current trade price levels places RHI’s stock about -7.47% away from the 52-week high and closed 37.04% away from the 52-week low. The total dollar value of all 127.81 million outstanding shares is 6.03 billion.
Moving averages Indicator Signals: Trend Direction of Robert Half International Inc. (RHI)
Traders will often use multiple moving averages to analyze a single security. Moving averages are a very simple tool to use, like most technical indicators, different traders will focus on different ways to use them. A longer-term moving average may be used to identify the primary price trend, a shorter moving average period to identify the secondary, price trend, and an even shorter moving average period to identify the minor price trend.
Typically 20-day simple moving average is useful at identifying swing trading trends lasting 20 days. Shorter moving average timeframes are more sensitive to price fluctuations and can pick up on trend changes more quickly than longer-term moving averages. However, these more frequent signals may also result in more “whipsaws”, resulting in erroneous trade signals. Robert Half International Inc. (RHI) recently closed with fall of -2.59% to its 20-Day Simple Moving Average. This short time frame picture represents a downward movement of current price over average price of last 20 days. Now moving toward intermediate time frame, 50-day Moving average is more useful at showing position trading trends lasting 50 days. Shares of RHI moved downward with change of -0.77% to its 50-day Moving average. This falling movement shows negative prices direction over last 50 days.
Finally observing long term time frame, 200-day simple moving average is more helpful at telling general investing trends lasting 200 days. Longer moving average timeframes are less sensitive to price fluctuations than shorter term timeframes and will generate far few signals. This will reduce the number of “whipsaws”, which is good, but will also generate signals later than when using shorter term averages. RHI stock price revealed optimistic move of 2.03% comparing average price of last 200 days. This comparison showed up direction of price above its 200-SMA.
The beta factor is 1.23.Volatility shows sense of how far the stock will fall if the market takes a dive and how high stock will rise if the bull starts to climb. A stock with a beta more than 1 means high volatile and less than 1 means low volatile. The PE ratio of 17.82 helps investors explore how much they should pay for a stock based on its current earnings. High ratio reveals positive future performance and investors are willing to pay more. Low ratio discloses poor current and future performance.
Common shareholders want to know how profitable their capital is in the businesses they invest it in. The company gives a ROE of 31.30%. The higher the ROE, the better the company is at generating profits. Return on Assets (ROA) ratio indicates how profitable a company is relative to its total assets. The ROA is 18.80%. A company that manages their assets well will have a high return, while if manages their assets poorly will have a low return. ROI is 31.50%. A positive result means that returns exceed costs. Analysts therefore consider the investment a net gain. The opposite kind of result, a negative means that costs outweigh returns. Analysts therefore view the investment as a net loss.

MENLO PARK, Calif., July 26, 2017/PRNewswire / -- Corporate retreats - offsite events where employees, commonly executives, meet to discuss the business - offer organizations numerous benefits, with increased teamwork and employee morale chief among them, according to CFOs whose companies engage in them. But those organizations are in the minority: Four in five companies (80 percent) don't hold annual gatherings, a recent survey by Robert Half Management Resources found.
      

        CFOs were asked, 'Does your company offer an annual corporate retreat?' Their responses:
      

        CFOs whose companies offer these meetings also were asked, 'What is the single greatest benefit of having a corporate retreat?' Their responses:
      



Increases teamwork and morale




40%




Provides an environment that stimulates new ideas and perspectives




20%




Is a way to share the corporate vision and align teams around business strategies




19%




Offers additional professional development opportunities




12%




Enhances cross-departmental collaboration




9%






100%




        Additional research findings include:
      

          The smallest (20 to 49 employees) and largest companies (1,000 or more employees) are equally likely (19 percent) to offer an annual corporate retreat.
        

          While CFOs from both groups cited increased teamwork as the top advantage of corporate retreats, this is a greater emphasis for large organizations. The research also suggests small businesses more often benefit from new ideas from these events than the biggest companies.
        

          Among industries, professional services firms most commonly hold these sessions, while financial services institutions offer them the least, according to CFOs interviewed.
        

          The survey found businesses in Phoenix, Salt Lake Cityand San Franciscooffer these events most often. Organizations in Des Moines, New Yorkand Cincinnaticonduct them least frequently.
        

        'The opportunity to go off-site, away from the day-to-day norm, to strategize for the company and connect with team members can yield significant business benefits,' said Tim Hird, executive director of Robert Half Management Resources. 'Events don't need to be elaborate, they just need to provide a dedicated forum for open discussion and team-building.'
      

        Hird noted that due to factors such as cost or time away from the office, corporate retreats may not be for everyone, but the value they provide applies to all organizations. 'Companies that don't offer retreats should look for other opportunities to build teamwork, enhance innovation and align employees with business goals,' Hird said.  
      

        Robert Half Management Resources highlights alternatives to traditional corporate retreats:
      

Innovation days: Invite groups to develop and pitch ideas to help the business. Executives can review the proposals and guide teams in implementing them.
        

Staycation-style retreats: Managers can take their teams to a local offsite venue to brainstorm and connect.
        

Top-performer celebrations: In addition to recognizing their great work, invite star employees to submit their ideas for helping the organization grow. 
        

Town halls: These regular or semiregular gatherings provide an opportunity to share updates with staff. Serve food or otherwise dress up the event to emphasize its importance.
        

Quarterly strategy sessions: Gather department leaders or task forces to talk shop in a formal setting.
        

About the ResearchThe survey was developed by Robert Half Management Resources and conducted by an independent research firm. It is based on telephone interviews with more than 2,200 CFOs from a stratified random sample of companies in more than 20 of the largest U.S. metropolitan areas.
