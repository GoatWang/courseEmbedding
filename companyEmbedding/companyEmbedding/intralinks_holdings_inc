History[edit]
In 1996, John Muldoon and Mark Adams founded Intralinks. Major banks began using its product for loan syndication in 1997. In 2002, the firm created the world’s first virtual data room (VDR), enabling businesses to share information during the due diligence process in a secure space. In 2004, companies completed over $5 trillion in syndicated loan transactions with its products. Intralinks was acquired by TA Associates in 2007, and became a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange in 2010. In 2011, Ron Hovsepian, previously CEO of Novell, Inc. joined Intralinks as Chief Executive Officer, President and Director.. Under his leadership, Intralinks developed Intralinks VIA and Intralinks DealNexus.[4]
Intralinks claims that more than 2.7 million professionals at 988 of the Fortune 1000 companies use their products.[5]
Initial Public Offering[edit]
The company's initial public offering of stock on the NYSE occurred on August 6, 2010. Its initial price range is $14–$16, but the stock priced at $13. The company sold 11,000,000 shares and raised $146M.[6] The lead underwriter were Deutsche Bank AG and Credit Suisse Group. The firm had approximately $152M in debt at the time of the IPO and expects to use the vast majority of the returns from the offering to repay its obligations.
The company has 570 employees worldwide and its global headquarters are in New York City. In 2013 Intralinks launched morethanavdr [7] a website that specifically targets investment bank strategic advisors, legal advisors and corporate advisors.
Recent Developments[edit]
docTrackr[edit]
On April 23, 2014, Intralinks acquired docTrackr,[8] a document security company. docTrackr’s information rights management (IRM) technology enables users to protect and track PDF, Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents wherever those files are stored or shared. docTrackr combines analytics, audit trails and policy management of all document activities in a plug-in free deployment.
Intralinks VIA[edit]
Released in April 2013, Intralinks VIA enables users to share information outside of the network firewall.[9] VIA encrypts every file shared within the platform and allows users to designate permissions. With the proper permission, users can download documents and collaborate freely together. VIA also includes an UNshare feature allowing admins to withdraw information at any time, with an encryption that corrupts the files (and any copies) sent or saved.[10] In January 2014, Intralinks announced a new version[11] of its Intralinks VIA product, Intralinks VIA Enterprise, which supports complete content lifecycle management for the extended enterprise. It also has Intralinks Dealspace.[12]
Dealnexus[edit]
In 2013, Intralinks acquired PE-Nexus and MergerID. Each of these offered clients a platform to find partners for mergers and acquisitions. Intralinks merged the two firms and renamed the newly created platform DealNexus, the largest global deal sourcing network.[13] DealNexus’ client portfolio offers businesses a network to find partners. Once engaging in a deal, the Intralinks VDR allows parties to conduct due diligence.
Headquarters[edit]
Intralinks maintains its corporate headquarters on the east side of Manhattan in New York City. Other offices include: Boston, San Francisco, São Paulo, London, Bucharest, Milan, Frankfurt, Hong Kong and Sydney.[14]

History[edit]
In 1996, John Muldoon and Mark Adams founded Intralinks. Major banks began using its product for loan syndication in 1997. In 2002, the firm created the world’s first virtual data room (VDR), enabling businesses to share information during the due diligence process in a secure space. In 2004, companies completed over $5 trillion in syndicated loan transactions with its products. Intralinks was acquired by TA Associates in 2007, and became a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange in 2010. In 2011, Ron Hovsepian, previously CEO of Novell, Inc. joined Intralinks as Chief Executive Officer, President and Director.. Under his leadership, Intralinks developed Intralinks VIA and Intralinks DealNexus.[4]
Intralinks claims that more than 2.7 million professionals at 988 of the Fortune 1000 companies use their products.[5]
Initial Public Offering[edit]
The company's initial public offering of stock on the NYSE occurred on August 6, 2010. Its initial price range is $14–$16, but the stock priced at $13. The company sold 11,000,000 shares and raised $146M.[6] The lead underwriter were Deutsche Bank AG and Credit Suisse Group. The firm had approximately $152M in debt at the time of the IPO and expects to use the vast majority of the returns from the offering to repay its obligations.
The company has 570 employees worldwide and its global headquarters are in New York City. In 2013 Intralinks launched morethanavdr [7] a website that specifically targets investment bank strategic advisors, legal advisors and corporate advisors.
Recent Developments[edit]
docTrackr[edit]
On April 23, 2014, Intralinks acquired docTrackr,[8] a document security company. docTrackr’s information rights management (IRM) technology enables users to protect and track PDF, Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents wherever those files are stored or shared. docTrackr combines analytics, audit trails and policy management of all document activities in a plug-in free deployment.
Intralinks VIA[edit]
Released in April 2013, Intralinks VIA enables users to share information outside of the network firewall.[9] VIA encrypts every file shared within the platform and allows users to designate permissions. With the proper permission, users can download documents and collaborate freely together. VIA also includes an UNshare feature allowing admins to withdraw information at any time, with an encryption that corrupts the files (and any copies) sent or saved.[10] In January 2014, Intralinks announced a new version[11] of its Intralinks VIA product, Intralinks VIA Enterprise, which supports complete content lifecycle management for the extended enterprise. It also has Intralinks Dealspace.[12]
Dealnexus[edit]
In 2013, Intralinks acquired PE-Nexus and MergerID. Each of these offered clients a platform to find partners for mergers and acquisitions. Intralinks merged the two firms and renamed the newly created platform DealNexus, the largest global deal sourcing network.[13] DealNexus’ client portfolio offers businesses a network to find partners. Once engaging in a deal, the Intralinks VDR allows parties to conduct due diligence.
Headquarters[edit]
Intralinks maintains its corporate headquarters on the east side of Manhattan in New York City. Other offices include: Boston, San Francisco, São Paulo, London, Bucharest, Milan, Frankfurt, Hong Kong and Sydney.[14]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

History[edit]
In 1996, John Muldoon and Mark Adams founded Intralinks. Major banks began using its product for loan syndication in 1997. In 2002, the firm created the world’s first virtual data room (VDR), enabling businesses to share information during the due diligence process in a secure space. In 2004, companies completed over $5 trillion in syndicated loan transactions with its products. Intralinks was acquired by TA Associates in 2007, and became a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange in 2010. In 2011, Ron Hovsepian, previously CEO of Novell, Inc. joined Intralinks as Chief Executive Officer, President and Director.. Under his leadership, Intralinks developed Intralinks VIA and Intralinks DealNexus.[4]
Intralinks claims that more than 2.7 million professionals at 988 of the Fortune 1000 companies use their products.[5]
Initial Public Offering[edit]
The company's initial public offering of stock on the NYSE occurred on August 6, 2010. Its initial price range is $14–$16, but the stock priced at $13. The company sold 11,000,000 shares and raised $146M.[6] The lead underwriter were Deutsche Bank AG and Credit Suisse Group. The firm had approximately $152M in debt at the time of the IPO and expects to use the vast majority of the returns from the offering to repay its obligations.
The company has 570 employees worldwide and its global headquarters are in New York City. In 2013 Intralinks launched morethanavdr [7] a website that specifically targets investment bank strategic advisors, legal advisors and corporate advisors.
Recent Developments[edit]
docTrackr[edit]
On April 23, 2014, Intralinks acquired docTrackr,[8] a document security company. docTrackr’s information rights management (IRM) technology enables users to protect and track PDF, Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents wherever those files are stored or shared. docTrackr combines analytics, audit trails and policy management of all document activities in a plug-in free deployment.
Intralinks VIA[edit]
Released in April 2013, Intralinks VIA enables users to share information outside of the network firewall.[9] VIA encrypts every file shared within the platform and allows users to designate permissions. With the proper permission, users can download documents and collaborate freely together. VIA also includes an UNshare feature allowing admins to withdraw information at any time, with an encryption that corrupts the files (and any copies) sent or saved.[10] In January 2014, Intralinks announced a new version[11] of its Intralinks VIA product, Intralinks VIA Enterprise, which supports complete content lifecycle management for the extended enterprise. It also has Intralinks Dealspace.[12]
Dealnexus[edit]
In 2013, Intralinks acquired PE-Nexus and MergerID. Each of these offered clients a platform to find partners for mergers and acquisitions. Intralinks merged the two firms and renamed the newly created platform DealNexus, the largest global deal sourcing network.[13] DealNexus’ client portfolio offers businesses a network to find partners. Once engaging in a deal, the Intralinks VDR allows parties to conduct due diligence.
Headquarters[edit]
Intralinks maintains its corporate headquarters on the east side of Manhattan in New York City. Other offices include: Boston, San Francisco, São Paulo, London, Bucharest, Milan, Frankfurt, Hong Kong and Sydney.[14]

06/09/2017 | News release | Distributed by Public on 06/12/2017 01:17
Intralinks Dealnexus® Shortlisted as Product/Service of The Year for 9th Annual...








        For the second year in a row, Intralinks Dealnexus, an online deal origination and buyer identification platform, has been named a finalist for M&A Advisor's 9 Annual International M&A Awards. The awards serve as a benchmark for international dealmaking excellence, and celebrate the accomplishments of the year's top performers.
      

        The deal business can be tough, and the success or failure of a deal, whether it be large or small, heavily depends on whether the two organizations that are a best fit for each other can be identified. In order to do this successfully, advisors need to securely and discretely share just enough information about their deals to allow the platform's buyer-matching algorithm to connect them with private equity firms and corporations seeking the types of deals they're working on.
      

        The platform is the world's largest deal sourcing network, hosting live, actionable M&A deals from more than 4,500 registered investment banks and M&A advisory firms. In 2016 alone, 2,100 vetted dealmakers joined the network, a year-over-year increase of 17%. Over that time period, Intralinks Dealnexus welcomed an additional 825 new investment banks, advisory firms, private equity groups and family offices - serving as a testament to the platform's effectiveness in sourcing M&A deals and assisting in finding the right buyers.
      

        Today, the platform intelligently connects dealmakers with the network's base of over 4,000 acquisitive corporations and private equity groups. More than 14,500 vetted dealmakers in over 100 countries around the world rely on Intralinks Dealnexus' proprietary deal-matching and deal marketing engine to find and engage the perfect deal, buyer or investor.
      

        By using Intralinks Dealnexus, corporate M&A departments and private equity groups can actively, passively and confidentially source actionable deal opportunities within a gated community. On the sell-side, advisory professionals can create a blind deal profile and instantly generate an intelligent buyers' list based on user-submitted (and maintained) investment criteria of private equity groups, family offices, lenders and many more.
      


        Removing the traditional grunt work out of taking a deal to market allows member firms to save both time and money, freeing up precious resources for additional deal work. Intralinks has also recently initiated a phased, end-to-end UX overhaul of the entire Intralinks Dealnexus platform, starting with a redesign of the homepage. Now, when users login, the homepage offers a significantly cleaner, yet more powerful, set of dashboards.
      

        Since the product's launch in 2010, it has hosted more than 21,000 deals. While the network's base of registered firms spans the entire spectrum size-wise - from boutique M&A firms to multinational conglomerates and everything in between - its sweet spot is middle market firms seeking greater visibility, intelligence and efficiency for their deal process.
      

        The finalists of the 9 Annual International M&A Awards have been selected from the nominees in the first stage of evaluation, and the independent panel of judges will announce winners at the awards gala on June 12 at the New York Athletic Club.

History[edit]
In 1996, John Muldoon and Mark Adams founded Intralinks. Major banks began using its product for loan syndication in 1997. In 2002, the firm created the world’s first virtual data room (VDR), enabling businesses to share information during the due diligence process in a secure space. In 2004, companies completed over $5 trillion in syndicated loan transactions with its products. Intralinks was acquired by TA Associates in 2007, and became a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange in 2010. In 2011, Ron Hovsepian, previously CEO of Novell, Inc. joined Intralinks as Chief Executive Officer, President and Director.. Under his leadership, Intralinks developed Intralinks VIA and Intralinks DealNexus.[4]
Intralinks claims that more than 2.7 million professionals at 988 of the Fortune 1000 companies use their products.[5]
Initial Public Offering[edit]
The company's initial public offering of stock on the NYSE occurred on August 6, 2010. Its initial price range is $14–$16, but the stock priced at $13. The company sold 11,000,000 shares and raised $146M.[6] The lead underwriter were Deutsche Bank AG and Credit Suisse Group. The firm had approximately $152M in debt at the time of the IPO and expects to use the vast majority of the returns from the offering to repay its obligations.
The company has 570 employees worldwide and its global headquarters are in New York City. In 2013 Intralinks launched morethanavdr [7] a website that specifically targets investment bank strategic advisors, legal advisors and corporate advisors.
Recent Developments[edit]
docTrackr[edit]
On April 23, 2014, Intralinks acquired docTrackr,[8] a document security company. docTrackr’s information rights management (IRM) technology enables users to protect and track PDF, Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents wherever those files are stored or shared. docTrackr combines analytics, audit trails and policy management of all document activities in a plug-in free deployment.
Intralinks VIA[edit]
Released in April 2013, Intralinks VIA enables users to share information outside of the network firewall.[9] VIA encrypts every file shared within the platform and allows users to designate permissions. With the proper permission, users can download documents and collaborate freely together. VIA also includes an UNshare feature allowing admins to withdraw information at any time, with an encryption that corrupts the files (and any copies) sent or saved.[10] In January 2014, Intralinks announced a new version[11] of its Intralinks VIA product, Intralinks VIA Enterprise, which supports complete content lifecycle management for the extended enterprise. It also has Intralinks Dealspace.[12]
Dealnexus[edit]
In 2013, Intralinks acquired PE-Nexus and MergerID. Each of these offered clients a platform to find partners for mergers and acquisitions. Intralinks merged the two firms and renamed the newly created platform DealNexus, the largest global deal sourcing network.[13] DealNexus’ client portfolio offers businesses a network to find partners. Once engaging in a deal, the Intralinks VDR allows parties to conduct due diligence.
Headquarters[edit]
Intralinks maintains its corporate headquarters on the east side of Manhattan in New York City. Other offices include: Boston, San Francisco, São Paulo, London, Bucharest, Milan, Frankfurt, Hong Kong and Sydney.[14]

	Recently, Intralinks conducted a follow-up survey to measure how attitudes towards, and adoption of, these technologies have shifted over the last two years. Over 700 dealmakers from around the world participated in the survey.

    Deal Networks and the Evolution of Getting M&A Deals Done  








	New research reaffirms growing influence of social media and deal sourcing networks on the M&A industry.


	In 2013, Intralinks conducted a global survey of M&A dealmakers to understand how technology and specialized deal networks influence M&A deal sourcing.


	Recently, Intralinks conducted a follow-up survey to measure how attitudes towards, and adoption of, these technologies have shifted over the last two years. Over 700 dealmakers from around the world participated in the survey.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

              Red Lion Hotels            









	Red Lion Hotels turned to Intralinks® to securely and easily share deal-critical information with internal and external parties, while simultaneously accelerating the deal process. 



	Since its founding in 1937, Red Lion Hotels Corporation has grown to 52 properties and 9,014 guest rooms. The company has relied on strategic transactions to fuel its growth and support its financial performance since its 1998 IPO on the NYSE. 


	Situation


	Red Lion Hotels regularly evaluates acquisition and divestiture opportunities. In the past, sensitive financial and legal documents related to these transactions sometimes had to be scanned and emailed – an exercise that was time-consuming and inefficient. If files were too large to be emailed, Red Lion would upload them to Dropbox or physically mail them on a USB flash drive. Each of these options presented real security concerns, and did little to help streamline or organize the process.


	Solution


	Red Lion’s strategic counsel, decided to try Intralinks. Intralinks is an advanced VDR that gives deal professionals – buyers, sellers, and advisors – the ability to easily and instantly share sensitive documents digitally with both external and internal parties, while maintaining physical control and ensuring the security of all information. At Red Lion, this meant that participants in the deal process could also conveniently access information without suffering through the delays introduced by physically shipping materials around or having emails with large file attachments blocked by firewalls. In addition, deal participants were instantly and automatically informed when new information was added to Intralinks, which helped keep all parties engaged. 


	As a member of the legal department for Red Lion, Julie Langenheim, Director, Corporate Services, Legal & Asset Management was charged with uploading documents and maintaining and tracking usage of Intralinks.


	Intralinks enabled Red Lion to see when groups logged in and which documents they were accessing – insight that allowed the Red Lion team to manage the process more deftly. “Once we used Intralinks, it was easy to organize all our information in Intralinks and give access to people to view files at their leisure – to look at what they wanted, when they wanted to,” explained Langenheim.


	Benefits


	As a result of using Intralinks, Red Lion was able to accelerate the due diligence process because the team spent significantly less time on deal administration – the prepping, sharing, and managing of documents and information related to a transaction. Not only did the deal process get faster with an easy-to-use, secure environment, but the experience also helped Red Lion organize its financial and legal documents to facilitate future needs.


	“Like a lot of companies, Red Lion got to the point where we became so big, we needed a better way to manage our documents,” Langenheim said. “The long term benefit of using Intralinks is that it made us think about that and be proactive about how we were managing sensitive documents.” 










		I saved a significant amount of my time by using Intralinks instead of other VDR providers.

Press Release | Intralinks®
Synchronoss Technologies to Acquire Intralinks Holdings Accelerating Strategic Transformation
 Tuesday, December 6, 2016













SYNCHRONOSS TECHNOLOGIES TO ACQUIRE INTRALINKS HOLDINGS ACCELERATING STRATEGIC TRANSFORMATION


		Synchronoss to acquire Intralinks Holdings, Inc. for $13.00 per share or $821 million in equity value
	

		Intralinks will be a major step towards significantly expanding the scale and scope of Synchronoss’ transformation to attack the multi-billion dollar enterprise market opportunity
	

		Ron Hovsepian, Chief Executive Officer of Intralinks, is expected to be appointed as Chief Executive Officer of Synchronoss upon closing of the transaction with Synchronoss
	

		Stephen G Waldis, Founder and current Chief Executive Officer, will remain active in the company serving as Executive Chairman of the Board, driving strategy, product innovation and oversight for the transformation
	

		Synchronoss to divest a portion of its activation business to Sequential Technology International for $146 million; strategic alternatives being pursued for remaining activation assets
	

Synchronoss Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNCR) and Intralinks Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:IL) today announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement for Synchronoss to acquire Intralinks for approximately $821 million in equity value. Under the terms of the agreement, Synchronoss will commence a cash tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding common stock of Intralinks for $13.00 per share. The transaction, which was unanimously approved by the board of directors of both companies, is expected to close late in the first calendar quarter of 2017, subject to customary closing conditions. Ron Hovsepian, Chief Executive Officer of Intralinks, is expected to be appointed Chief Executive Officer of Synchronoss and join the Synchronoss Board of Directors upon closing of the transaction with Synchronoss’ Founder and current Chief Executive Officer, Stephen G. Waldis will move into the role of active Executive Chairman of the Board.


	In Intralinks’ 20-year history, over 4.1 million business users across the world have used its secure, cloud-based platform, and it counts 99% of Fortune 1000 companies among its customers. To date, Intralinks has supported over $31 trillion in high-stakes transactions, making the company a leader in the enterprise content collaboration market.


	“Intralinks has established itself as a household name in the financial services world over the past 20 years, with a keen focus on growing its presence into the next generation secure content collaboration market over the coming years,” said Stephen Waldis, Synchronoss’ CEO. “This acquisition marks another major step in the transformation of Synchronoss to significantly expand the scale and scope of the company’s enterprise initiatives and strong carrier relationships in attacking this multi-billion dollar market opportunity. Ron brings significant leadership experience and a history of successfully integrating companies into a single portfolio. I intend to stay active in the company, driving growth opportunities and continued developments on new product innovation. I am excited to be working closely with Ron to bring Synchronoss into its next chapter of growth”.


	“Our board of directors unanimously concluded that Synchronoss is the ideal strategic partner for Intralinks and also gives our employees and customers the opportunity to leverage Synchronoss’ deep relationships across the carrier space, cloud expertise, and strong partnerships in the financial services vertical,” said Ron Hovsepian, CEO of Intralinks. “Together with Synchronoss, we believe we can deploy enhanced enterprise and mobile solutions to our customers while opening up new enterprise distribution channels across the world.”


	In conjunction with today’s announcement Synchronoss is also announcing an agreement to divest a portion of its activation business to Sequential Technology International, LLC for a total purchase price of $146 million. As part of this transaction, Sequential Technology will purchase 70% of Synchronoss’ carrier activation business that is being divested, with Synchronoss retaining a 30% ownership piece which could be reduced during the course of 2017. Synchronoss is in the process of pursuing strategic alternatives for the remaining activation business assets.


	Synchronoss expects to finance the Intralinks acquisition with its existing cash, proceeds from the Sequential Technology transaction, and $900 million of new debt.


	Given the expected closing in the first calendar quarter of 2017, Synchronoss expects the Intralinks transaction to have no impact to its fourth quarter financials. With the impact from the Sequential Technology divestiture and assuming a late first quarter 2017 close on the Intralinks deal, Synchronoss is giving initial 2017 revenue guidance of between $810 million and $820 million with pro forma EPS of between $2.45 and $2.60 for the combined entity. We are targeting $40 million of combined synergies within the first year of closing the Intralinks deal.


	The Intralinks transaction is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including regulatory approval in the United States. Until the transaction closes, each company will continue to operate independently.


	PJT Partners is serving as lead financial advisor. Goldman Sachs & Co. and Credit Suisse are providing debt financing commitments to Synchronoss and Goldman Sachs & Co. is also serving as financial advisor to Synchronoss. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC is serving as a financial advisor to Intralinks. Gunderson Dettmer Stough Villeneuve Franklin & Hachigian, LLP is acting as legal advisor to Synchronoss in connection with the Intralinks acquisition, and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP is acting as legal advisor in connection with the debt financing to Synchronoss. Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, LLP is acting as legal advisor to Intralinks in connection with the acquisition.


Conference Call


	In conjunction with this announcement, Synchronoss will host a conference call on Tuesday, December 6, 2016, at 8:30 a.m. (ET) to discuss the company’s financial results.

	Who We Are



	When secure, productive collaboration really matters – there’s Intralinks.














	About Us


Intralinks, a Synchronoss business*, helps enterprises extend business processes and high-value content across traditional organizational, corporate and geographical boundaries.


	Only Intralinks provides a cloud-based Content Collaboration Network™ where sensitive information can move freely around the globe while maintaining security and compliance, enabling safe and productive work with anyone, anytime and anywhere. Rather than building point integrations or having to rip-and-replace existing content systems, Intralinks customers can connect to the network to confidently and productively control the sharing, distribution and management of their high-value content – regulated, IP-intensive or simply important data. More than 90,000 clients – 99% of the Fortune 1000 companies – have depended on Intralinks to digitally transform and simplify critical business processes while meeting the most stringent governance and regulatory requirements.


	A 20-year track record of enabling high-stakes transactions and business collaborations valued at more than $30 trillion have made Intralinks the preferred source of easy-to-use, enterprise-strength cloud-based collaboration technology.


*In January of 2017, Intralinks Holdings, Inc. was acquired by Synchronoss Technologies, Inc., the leading global provider of essential cloud-based mobility solutions that allow customers to connect, synchronize and activate devices and services, empowering enterprises and consumers to live in a connected world.
