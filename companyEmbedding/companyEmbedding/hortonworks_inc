Cornerstone of Hortonworks Data Platform
YARN and Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) are the cornerstone components of Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP) for data-at-rest. While HDFS provides the scalable, fault-tolerant, cost-efficient storage for your big data lake, YARN provides the centralized architecture that enables you to process multiple workloads simultaneously. YARN provides the resource management and pluggable architecture for enabling a wide variety of data access methods.

More Info:

HDFS
YARN







Data streaming, processing and analytics engines for a variety of workloads
Hortonworks Data Platform includes a versatile range of processing engines that empower you to interact with the same data in multiple ways, at the same time. This means applications for big data analytics can interact with the data in the best way: from batch to interactive SQL or low latency access with NoSQL. Emerging use cases for data science, search and streaming are also supported with Apache Spark, Storm and Kafka.

Load and manage data according to policy
HDP extends data access and management with powerful tools for data governance and integration. They provide a reliable, repeatable, and simple framework for managing the flow of data in and out of Hadoop. This control structure, along with a set of tooling to ease and automate the application of schema or metadata on sources is critical for successful integration of Hadoop into your modern data architecture. 
Hortonworks has engineering relationships with many leading data management providers to enable their tools to work and integrate with HDP.

Authentication, authorization, and data protection
Security is woven and integrated into HDP in multiple layers. Critical features for authentication, authorization, accountability and data protection are in place to help secure HDP across these key requirements. Consistent with this approach throughout all of the enterprise Hadoop capabilities, HDP also ensures you can integrate and extend your current security solutions to provide a single, consistent, secure umbrella over your modern data architecture.

REAL-TIME RESPONSE TO DATA-IN-MOTION
With HDF, data collection is no longer a tedious process. You can manage data in full flight with a visual control panel to adjust sources, join and split streams, and prioritize data flow. HDF also can add contextual data to your streams for more complete analysis and insight. The always-on data provenance and audit trails provide security and governance compliance and troubleshooting as necessary in real-time. Integrated with Apache NiFi, MiNiFi, Kafka and Storm, HDF is ready for high volume event processing for immediate analysis and action. Kafka allows differing rates of data creation and delivery while Storm provides streaming real-time data analytics and immediate insights at a massive scale.

FULLY SECURE FROM SOURCE TO DESTINATION 
HDF secures end-to-end data flow and routing from source to destination with discrete user authorization and detailed, real-time visual chain of custody. Use the visual user interface of HDF to encrypt streaming data, route it to Kafka, configure buffers and manage congestion so that data can be dynamically prioritized and securely sent. HDF enables role-based data access that allows enterprises to dynamically and securely share select pieces of pertinent data. HDF can easily deploy flow management and streaming applications in a Kerberized environment without much operational overhead.

BUILD STREAMING ANALYTICS APPLICATIONS WITHOUT CODE
HDF includes a complete streaming analytics module, Streaming Analytics Manager (SAM), to build streaming analytics applications that do event correlation, context enrichment, complex pattern matching, analytical aggregations and create alerts/notifications when insights are discovered. SAM makes building streaming analytics easy for application developers, DevOps and business analysts to build, develop, collaborate, analyze, deploy, and manage applications in minutes without writing a single line of code. Analysts use pre-built charts to quickly build analysis and create dashboards, while DevOps can manage and monitor the applications performance right out of the box.

MORE EFFICIENT OPERATIONS WITH SCHEMA REGISTRY
HDF includes, Schema Registry, a central schema repository that allows analytics applications to flexibly interact with each other. This enables users to save, edit, or retrieve schemas for the data they need. This also allows easy attachment of schemas to each data without incurring additional overhead for greater operational efficiency. With schema version management, data consumers and data producers can evolve at different rates. And, through schema validation, data quality is greatly improved. A central schema registry also provides for greater governance of how data is used. Schema Registry is integrated with Apache Nifi and HDF Streaming Analytics Manager.

New revenue rules mean more work for companies, big revenue for consultants and auditors
Who is doing the heavy lifting to get companies ready to report revenue under new rules? The usual suspects are cashing in, including auditors

Hortonworks price target raised at Wunderlich after IBM partnership
Wunderlich analysts raised their price target on Hortonworks Inc.  to $18 from $15 Wednesday after the company expanded its partnership with International Business Machines Corp.  on machine learning. The partnership will extend machine learning capabilities to more designers using Apache Hadoop, the software used by Hortonworks. This should strengthen its competitive position against Cloudera Inc. , which recently went public. Additionally, the analysts say the fact that HortonWorks remains 100% open-source gives it an edge over the competition in terms of partnerships. The analysts estimate that Hortonworks will have revenue of at least $20 million in 2018. They reiterated a buy rating on the stock. Shares of Hortonworks were falling 2% Wednesday morning. Shares of Hortonworks have gained 40% in the past three months, compared to the S&P 500's  gain of 3%.

Cornerstone of Hortonworks Data Platform
YARN and Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) are the cornerstone components of Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP) for data-at-rest. While HDFS provides the scalable, fault-tolerant, cost-efficient storage for your big data lake, YARN provides the centralized architecture that enables you to process multiple workloads simultaneously. YARN provides the resource management and pluggable architecture for enabling a wide variety of data access methods.

More Info:

HDFS
YARN







Data streaming, processing and analytics engines for a variety of workloads
Hortonworks Data Platform includes a versatile range of processing engines that empower you to interact with the same data in multiple ways, at the same time. This means applications for big data analytics can interact with the data in the best way: from batch to interactive SQL or low latency access with NoSQL. Emerging use cases for data science, search and streaming are also supported with Apache Spark, Storm and Kafka.

Load and manage data according to policy
HDP extends data access and management with powerful tools for data governance and integration. They provide a reliable, repeatable, and simple framework for managing the flow of data in and out of Hadoop. This control structure, along with a set of tooling to ease and automate the application of schema or metadata on sources is critical for successful integration of Hadoop into your modern data architecture. 
Hortonworks has engineering relationships with many leading data management providers to enable their tools to work and integrate with HDP.

Authentication, authorization, and data protection
Security is woven and integrated into HDP in multiple layers. Critical features for authentication, authorization, accountability and data protection are in place to help secure HDP across these key requirements. Consistent with this approach throughout all of the enterprise Hadoop capabilities, HDP also ensures you can integrate and extend your current security solutions to provide a single, consistent, secure umbrella over your modern data architecture.

The Quality Issue
Big Data is growing at a rapid pace. According to IBM, 90% of the world’s data has been created in the past 2 years.  And with Big Data comes bad data.

Analyst firm Gartner says the average organization loses $14.2 million annually through poor Data Quality.
Experian Data Quality report states 99% of organizations have a data quality strategy in place. 

This is disturbing in that these Data Quality practices are not finding the bad data that exists in their Big Data.

“70% of enterprises have either deployed or are planning to deploy big data projects and programs this year”
– Analyst firm IDG


“75% of businesses are wasting 14% of revenue due to poor data quality”
– Experian Data Quality


“19.2% of big data app developers say quality of data is the biggest problem they consistently face.”
– Evans Data Corporation


“Data quality costs (companies) an estimated $14.2 million annually”
– Gartner




Current Data Quality & Testing Trends in Big Data
According to Gartner’s Magic Quadrant on Data Quality Tools, characteristics of these tools are: profiling, parsing cleansing, masking, matching, and monitoring of big data. None these characteristics deal with data validation in your Big Data store.
Big Data testing is completely different. The primary goals of data testing your Big Data are verifying data completeness, ensure data transformation, ensure data quality, automate the regression testing. But the 2 main methods, Sampling (also known as “stare and compare”) and Minus Queries, have major flaws.

History[edit]





This section reads like a press release or a news article and/or is entirely based on routine coverage. Please expand this article with properly sourced content to meet Wikipedia's quality standards, event notability guideline, and/or encyclopedic content policy. (February 2017)


Hortonworks was formed in June 2011 as an independent company, funded by $23 million venture capital from Yahoo! and Benchmark Capital. Its first office was in Sunnyvale, California.[2] The company employs contributors to the open source software project Apache Hadoop.[3] The Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP) product includes Apache Hadoop and is used for storing, processing, and analyzing large volumes of data. The platform is designed to deal with data from many sources and formats. The platform includes Hadoop technology such as the Hadoop Distributed File System, MapReduce, Pig, Hive, HBase, ZooKeeper, and additional components.[4]
Eric Baldeschweiler (from Yahoo) was initial chief executive, and Rob Bearden chief operating officer, formerly from SpringSource. Benchmark partner Peter Fenton was a board member.The company name refers to the character Horton the Elephant, since the elephant is the symbol for Hadoop.[2][5] Additional investors included a $25 million round led by Index Ventures in November 2011.[6]
In October 2011 Hortonworks announced Microsoft would collaborate on a Hadoop distribution for Microsoft Azure and Windows Server.[7] On February 25, 2013, Hortonworks announced availability of a beta version of the Hortonworks Data Platform for Windows.[8] In November 2011 it announced HParser software from Informatica would be available for free download by its customers.[9]
In February 2012 Teradata announced an alliance.[10] In October 2012 Teradata's Aster Data Systems division announced an appliance supporting Hortonworks' distribution,[11][12] and Impetus Technologies announced a partnership.[13]
In June 2013 Hortonworks announced another $50 million in financing, from previous investors and adding Tenaya Capital and Dragoneer Investment Group.[14] In September 2013 SAP AG announced it would resell the Hortonworks distribution (as well as one from Intel).[15] By the end of 2013, Bearden, who had become chief executive by 2012, denied rumors the company would soon go public or be acquired.[16]
In March 2014, another $100 million investment was announced, led by BlackRock and passport capital.[17] In May 2014, Hortonworks acquired XA Secure, a small data security company founded in January 2013, for undisclosed terms.[18] The company used a provision of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act to avoid disclosing registration forms with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission in June 2014.[19][20] The filings showed about $37 million lost in 2013, and $87 million in the first half of 2014.[21] In December 2014, Hortonworks had their initial public offering, listed on the NASDAQ as HDP. Almost $100 million was raised.[22]
In August, 2015, Hortonworks announced it would acquire Onyara, Inc., the creator of Apache NiFi, a top-level open source project. Apache NiFi was made available through the NSA technology transfer program in 2014. Over eight years, Onyara’s engineers were the key contributors to the U.S. government software project that evolved into Apache NiFi.[23] [24] [25] When a secondary share offering was announced in January 2016, the share price dropped to about half of what it was at the IPO.[26] After operating losses deepened through 2015 and 2016, Herb Cunitz (who had been president since 2012) left the company in August 2016.[27] After a round of layoffs, Raj Verma was named the new president and chief operating officer in January 2017.[28]
Hortonworks hosts the Hadoop Summit community trade show, along with Yahoo!.[29] Hortonworks is a sponsor of the Apache Software Foundation.[30]
Partnerships[edit]
Hortonworks partners with software-related companies, including BMC Software for business service management and automation,[31] Attunity[32] and Cleo for data integration,[33] and SAP and VMware for cloud, database and other virtualization infrastructure, and with Stratoscale.[34] In 2015 Hortonworks started partnering with ManTech Commercial Services and B23 to develop OpenSOC.[35]

New revenue rules mean more work for companies, big revenue for consultants and auditors
Who is doing the heavy lifting to get companies ready to report revenue under new rules? The usual suspects are cashing in, including auditors

Hortonworks price target raised at Wunderlich after IBM partnership
Wunderlich analysts raised their price target on Hortonworks Inc.  to $18 from $15 Wednesday after the company expanded its partnership with International Business Machines Corp.  on machine learning. The partnership will extend machine learning capabilities to more designers using Apache Hadoop, the software used by Hortonworks. This should strengthen its competitive position against Cloudera Inc. , which recently went public. Additionally, the analysts say the fact that HortonWorks remains 100% open-source gives it an edge over the competition in terms of partnerships. The analysts estimate that Hortonworks will have revenue of at least $20 million in 2018. They reiterated a buy rating on the stock. Shares of Hortonworks were falling 2% Wednesday morning. Shares of Hortonworks have gained 40% in the past three months, compared to the S&P 500's  gain of 3%.
