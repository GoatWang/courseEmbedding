About Blanco

	      Blanco has been family-owned since 1925 when they began producing copper galvanized parts for cookers and hot water bottles with a team of 30 employees. Over 85 years later, the company has produced 40 million sinks and has become one of the most recognized leaders in quality, service, and innovation. The company believes a sink isn't merely about function, but also about its style, performance, and that it should be the inspiration for the entire kitchen.

Over 85 years later, the company has produced 40 million sinks and has become one of the most recognized leaders in quality, service, and innovation.  The company believes a sink isn't merely about function, but also about its style, performance, and that it should be the inspiration for the entire kitchen.  Blanco Silgranit II Sinks: Blanco's Silgranit II sinks are ultra-durable because they are made of 80% granite and also feature 7 patents. They come in 21 shapes and 6 colors that will never fade to ensure that they match the décor of any kitchen. They are super easy to clean, resistant to acids and alkalis, and can resist heat up to 536°F. Blanco Stainless Steel Sinks: Blanco stainless steel sinks are made of surgical grade stainless steel to create a sink that will last a lifetime. These sinks are made to Blanco's specifications which are higher than industry standards, ensuring that you get a quality sink that is non-porous, hygienic, durable, and rust free.

Narrow Your Results



MaterialThere are many materials to choose from, each with their own attributes.  Some of the more common materials used in Faucets and Accessories are Brass, Stainless Steel, Metal and Zinc Alloys. These offer excellent corrosion and tarnish resistance while allowing many finish options.

Others found in many fixtures such as Sinks, Tubs, and Toilets are various materials such as Vitreous China, Enameled Steel, Cast Iron, and various Acrylics. A few examples are of materials you will find on FaucetDirect:

-Brass is derived from alloys of copper and zinc in 
a solid solution. In comparison to bronze which 
is principally an alloy of copper and tin. Despite this 
distinction, some types of brasses are called bronzes.

-Stainless Steel is one of the most hygienic surfaces and very easy to clean. The unique surface is non-porous which will not harbor dirt, grime or bacteria. Stainless Steel has a high tolerance to corrosion while offering a useful life expectancy of over 100 years!

-Vitreous China offers a long lasting, sparkling surface that resists scratches, fading, and will provide a long lasting finish.

-Enameled Steel is less expensive but very durable and easy to clean. Enameled Steel is the choice when economy is required.

-Various Acrylics are used for most specialty baths. for its forgiving nature and flexibility. The non-rusting surface also allows the inclusion of whirlpool or therapeutic jets as the material can be easily modified.

Why don't we show the price?

					Like many retailers, FaucetDirect.com can choose to set its own prices independently. And even though manufacturers require FaucetDirect.com and other retailers to display a product's "minimum advertised price" (or MAP), the retailer can choose to sell for less than that. But the price must be conveyed in other ways, and each individual manufacturer's MAP policy determines where the price can be seen.
				

					To see the price for this product at FaucetDirect.com, you'll need to place it in your shopping cart, and maybe even proceed to final checkout. If you're not ready to buy the product, simply remove it from the cart.
				

					FaucetDirect.com apologizes for any inconvenience. We'd just like to offer you the chance to save extra money while we adhere to manufacturers' MAP policies. FaucetDirect.com is also working to educate manufacturers on how their policies impact customers and their buying behavior.

About Blanco

	      Blanco has been family-owned since 1925 when they began producing copper galvanized parts for cookers and hot water bottles with a team of 30 employees. Over 85 years later, the company has produced 40 million sinks and has become one of the most recognized leaders in quality, service, and innovation. The company believes a sink isn't merely about function, but also about its style, performance, and that it should be the inspiration for the entire kitchen.
