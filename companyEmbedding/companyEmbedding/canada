GENTLEMEN:
What is erectile dysfunction?






Erectile dysfunction is when a man has difficulty getting an erection. Or keeping it long enough for sex. It’s also known as ED or impotence. It happens when not enough blood flows to the penis, preventing an erection. It affects about 30 million men in the U.S. Some guys with ED find it difficult to either get or keep an erection every time they try to have sex. For others, ED symptoms can happen just once in a while. Either way, you should know that you’re not alone.
 ABOUT

1.1-50-percent.png




ED is not all in your head. It’s not just a part of aging that you have to accept. It’s a real medical condition, so it should be addressed like one. If you think you have ED symptoms, talk to a doctor.
*Data taken from the Massachusetts Male Aging Study. Of 1,290 respondents, 52% stated that they had some degree of ED.
 



What can cause ED?


ED is often caused by something physical, such as a disease, injury, or side effects from other drugs.
Medical Conditions





      
          Depression    

      
          Diabetes    

      
          Heart disease    

      
          High blood pressure    

      
          High cholesterol    

      
          Obesity    

      
          Prostate cancer treatment    

      
          Spinal cord injury    

 


Although most cases of ED have a physical cause, thoughts that lead to depression, worry, or anxiety can also cause ED.
Even when ED has a physical cause, it can be made worse if it leads to depression and worry.
 

Diabetes is a condition where there is too much sugar, or glucose, in the blood. Over time, high blood sugar levels can damage nerves and blood vessels—like the ones that produce erections. When this occurs, diabetes can lead to ED.
In a study, up to 83% of men with diabetes had some form of ED.
 

Heart disease can clog or narrow the arteries. This can stop blood from flowing to the penis, and may cause ED. Talk to your doctor to make sure your heart is healthy enough for sex.
 

High blood pressure makes the heart work harder. This puts strain on the blood vessels, which then harden and narrow. This can prevent blood from getting to the penis and lead to ED. In a study, more than 65% of men with high blood pressure also had ED.
Additionally, some medications used to treat high blood pressure can lead to ED. Make sure your doctor is aware of all medications you are taking.
 

High cholesterol can clog your arteries. This can slow blood flow to the penis. The result? It can affect the quality of your erections.
In a study, high cholesterol raised men's risk of erectile dysfunction by 80%.
 

Obesity can cause real harm to your health. For example, it's associated with medical conditions that can affect blood flow. And when blood flow is affected, it can cause ED.
 

The prostate is a small gland near your bladder. It's next to the nerves that are necessary for an erection to happen. For men with prostate cancer, surgical removal of the prostate can lead to ED.
 

An injury to the spine can affect many functions in the body. Erectile function is no exception.
Due to nerve damage, some men with spinal cord injuries can't get erections. Others can—but can't keep them hard enough or long enough for sex.
 


Medications
In some men, ED is a side effect of some medications. These medications might include drugs used to treat:
High blood pressure
Heart disease
Depression
 





Can your lifestyle have something to do with it?
 Yes. Some lifestyle and psychological factors can play a role in causing ED, such as smoking, drinking, and stress because they may lead to conditions that affect blood circulation. 
There are things you can do each day to improve your circulation and avoid some of the conditions that can lead to ED:
Find ways to stay more active (mowing the lawn, walking the dog)
Help manage your weight by eating healthy and watching your portion size
Drink less alcohol
Quit smoking. The results can be significant
Look for ways to reduce stress in your daily life
 





GENTLEMEN:
VIAGRA helps guys with ED get and keep an erection.

And it’s been shown to effectively treat ED in guys who have certain other medical conditions. So be sure to tell your doctor about your medical conditions and medications so he can choose the right dose for you.
 
 
 
 















          NEXT:        
Learn how VIAGRA works. 





















 
GENTLEMEN:
How does VIAGRA work?






VIAGRA works for men with erectile dysfunction (ED) by increasing blood flow to the penis so you can get and keep an erection hard enough for sex. Individual results may vary. It’s been proven to help guys with all degrees of ED. VIAGRA usually starts to work within 30–60 minutes. And you only take it when you need it.

1.1-watch-1.png




VIAGRA works only when you are sexually stimulated. You may take it up to 4 hours before sexual activity. So don’t worry. There's no need to rush.
After sex? Your erection should go away. In the rare event of an erection lasting more than 4 hours, seek immediate medical help to avoid long-term injury.
 APPROXIMATELY

1.2-four-fifths.png




†Seventy-two percent, 80%, and 85% of the patients on 25 mg, 50 mg, and 100 mg of VIAGRA, respectively, achieved erections hard enough for sex, compared to 50% on placebo. Also, men taking VIAGRA showed an improvement in their ability to get and keep an erection versus those who took placebo.
 












          NEXT:        
Is VIAGRA right for me? 





















 
GENTLEMEN:
Want to know if it's right for you?






Only your doctor can decide if VIAGRA is right for you. VIAGRA isn't right for everyone. If you have trouble getting or keeping an erection hard enough for sex, VIAGRA may help.

 VIAGRA and drug interactions.
Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements.

Alpha-blockers are sometimes prescribed for prostate problems or high blood pressure. In some patients, the use of VIAGRA with alpha-blockers can lead to a drop in blood pressure or to fainting
medicines called HIV protease inhibitors, such as ritonavir (Norvir), indinavir sulfate (Crixivan), saquinavir (Fortovase or Invirase), or atazanavir sulfate (Reyataz)

Possible side effects of VIAGRA. 





















 
Wondering about possible side effects?






Safety is important. And it helps to know about possible side effects. 
VIAGRA can cause serious side effects. Rarely reported side effects include: 
an erection that will not go away (priapism). If you have an erection that lasts more than 4 hours, get medical help right away. If it is not treated right away, priapism can permanently damage your penis. 
sudden vision loss in one or both eyes. Sudden vision loss in one or both eyes can be a sign of a serious eye problem called non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION). Stop taking VIAGRA and call your healthcare provider right away if you have sudden vision loss in one or both eyes. 
sudden hearing decrease or hearing loss. Some people may also have ringing in their ears (tinnitus) or dizziness. If you have these symptoms, stop taking VIAGRA and contact a doctor right away.
Other important information:

VIAGRA can help a man get and keep an erection when he becomes sexually stimulated. It’s not right for everyone. Here are some other things you should know:
Do not take VIAGRA if you:

take any medicines called nitrates, often prescribed for chest pain, or guanylate cyclase stimulators like Adempas (riociguat) for pulmonary hypertension. Your blood pressure could drop to an unsafe level.
are allergic to sildenafil, as contained in VIAGRA and REVATIO, or any of the ingredients in VIAGRA. 
Discuss your health with your doctor to ensure that you are healthy enough for sex. If you experience chest pain, dizziness, or nausea during sex, seek immediate medical help.
 The most common side effects of VIAGRA are:
headache
flushing
upset stomach
abnormal vision, such as changes in color vision (such as having a blue color tinge) and blurred vision
stuffy or runny nose
back pain
muscle pain
nausea
dizziness
rash
In addition, heart attack, stroke, irregular heartbeat and death have happened rarely in men taking VIAGRA. Most, but not all, of these men had heart problems before taking VIAGRA. It is not known if VIAGRA caused these problems.
Tell your healthcare provider if you have any side effect that bothers you or does not go away.
These are not all the possible side effects of VIAGRA. For more information, ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist.
 





Talk to your doctor.
Discuss your general health and ED symptoms with your doctor to see if VIAGRA is right for you.

You can expect that once you bring up the topic of ED, your doctor can take it from there. So here are some ways to break the ice when he asks how everything’s going: 
1. "I have trouble sometimes in bed. Could it be ED?"
2. "I think I might have ED. What can I do about it?"
3. "Could VIAGRA work for me?" 
Help make the most of your VIAGRA Talk.
By asking questions about VIAGRA and ED, you can help your doctor get the information he needs to find out if you have ED and to decide if VIAGRA is right for you.
Print a list of questions or have them sent to you by e-mail.

Watch out for VIAGRA offers with “no prescription.”  





















 
Don't be fooled by counterfeit VIAGRA.






Counterfeits aren’t just a cheap knock-off of a proven product; they’re illegal, potentially harmful fakes. It’s hard to tell where or how they were made—or even what’s inside them.
 









WATCH:
A counterfeit epidemic
 










VIAGRA is one of the most counterfeited drugs in the world. 
In March 2011, Pfizer Global Security studied the search results for the term "buy VIAGRA" to see how many online pharmacies were selling counterfeit VIAGRA. 
The study was conducted using the top 2 search engines over a 5-day period. During this time, 22 unique sites consistently appeared among the top search results claiming to sell VIAGRA manufactured by Pfizer. Pfizer Global Security then ordered VIAGRA from these sites and tested the chemical composition of the pills.

Warning: Counterfeit medications can be dangerous.

Blue printer ink
Amphetamines, also known as “speed”
Metronidazole, a powerful antibiotic that could cause an allergic reaction, diarrhea, or vomiting
Too much active ingredient (or not enough), which may cause you harm
Binding agents, such as drywall, that prevent the tablet from breaking down in your system



3.2-warning-2.png



 
Toxic ingredients, such as boric acid, floor wax, brick dust, rat poison, and road paint
Ingredients that can have dangerous interactions with other medications you may be taking
A completely different medication with potentially harmful side effects

Learn how to safely buy online.
Make sure that when you buy VIAGRA online, you get real VIAGRA. Many of the sites that claim to sell VIAGRA online are actually selling potentiallydangerous counterfeits.


3.2-watch-online-scams.jpg





 Follow these steps: 
1 Make sure the website requires a valid prescription. It’s illegal to sell VIAGRA without a prescription from a qualified healthcare professional.
2 Make sure you see a U.S. address and phone number. This can help you make sure the website is not selling unregulated medication from overseas.
3 Check if they claim to sell “generic VIAGRA” for ED. The FDA has never approved the so-called “generic VIAGRA” for ED you see for sale online. It could be counterfeit and may cause you harm.
4 VIAGRA only comes in 3 doses. 25 mg, 50 mg, and 100 mg. VIAGRA is a tablet. Any other form, like “fast-dissolving,” “extra-strength,” “soft-tab,” or “VIAGRA for Women” is not FDA-approved.
5 Look for Verified Internet Pharmacy Practice Sites® (VIPPS®). A VIPPS® accreditation ensures the website you are purchasing from is secure and reliable.

Preface
The Competition Bureau ("Bureau") is an independent law enforcement agency that contributes to the prosperity of Canadians by protecting and promoting competitive markets and enabling informed consumer choice.
Headed by the Commissioner of Competition, the Bureau is responsible for the administration and enforcement of four federal statutes:

The Competition ActFootnote 1 contains provisions against false or misleading representations;
The Consumer Packaging and Labelling ActFootnote 2 requires that consumer products bear accurate and meaningful labelling information. The Bureau only enforces this Act as it relates to non‑food products;
The Textile Labelling ActFootnote 3 requires that consumer textile articles bear accurate and meaningful labelling information; and,
The Precious Metals Marking ActFootnote 4.

The Competition Act, the Consumer Packaging and Labelling Act and the Textile Labelling Act (collectively the "Acts") do not require that the country of origin of a product be identifiedFootnote 5. The Acts address and prohibit the making of false or misleading representations. Accordingly, the Acts do not require, for instance, that businesses make a "Made in Canada" claim with regard to their products; however, if they choose to make such a claim, the Bureau will apply the approach described in these enforcement guidelines to assist in determining when it will investigate a claim for non‑compliance or undertake an appropriate enforcement action under the false or misleading representations provisions in the statutes under its responsibility.
The Bureau's Guide to "Made in Canada" Claims was introduced in the early 1980s as a means of identifying Canadian content, and to assist in evaluating "Made in Canada" claims against the false or misleading representations provisions contained in the Acts.Footnote 6
As noted above, the Bureau enforces the Consumer Packaging and Labelling Act ("CPLA") only as it relates to non‑food products; the Canadian Food Inspection Agency ("CFIA") enforces the CPLA as it relates to food products. Until December 31, 2008, the CFIA chose to rely on the Bureau's Guide to "Made in Canada" Claims to enforce the CPLA in relation to food products. After this date, the CFIA introduced its own guide for the use of "Made in Canada" and "Product of Canada" claims in the labelling of food products sold in Canada.
In light of, among other developments, the distinction that has been created in CFIA's Guide between "Made in Canada" and "Product of Canada" claims in labelling of food products, the Bureau has reviewed its Guide to "Made in Canada" Claims for non‑food products and has adopted new guidelines, called "Product of Canada" and "Made in Canada" Claims (the "Guidelines"). These Guidelines describe the Bureau's approach to assessing "Made in Canada" and "Product of Canada" claims under the false or misleading representations provisions of the Acts, and supersedes the previous Guide to "Made in Canada" Claims.
The new Guidelines introduce a distinction between "Product of Canada" and "Made in Canada" claims. "Product of Canada" claims will be subject to a higher threshold of Canadian content (98%), while "Made in Canada" claims will remain subject to a 51% threshold of Canadian content but should be accompanied by a qualifying statement indicating that the product contains imported content. In both cases, the last substantial transformation of the product must have occurred in Canada.
The Bureau recognizes the need for transparency and predictability regarding its assessment of "Product of Canada" and "Made in Canada" claims. These Guidelines are intended to provide businesses and industry groups with information that will help them develop strategies to ensure compliance with the false or misleading representations provisions of the Acts with respect to such claims. Significantly, the Guidelines, and industry compliance with them, will promote clarity and assist consumers in understanding the meaning of "Product of Canada" and "Made in Canada" claims, and in making informed purchasing decisions.
If businesses follow these Guidelines when making representations that their products are "Product of Canada" or "Made in Canada", it is unlikely that they will raise concerns under the statutes administered by the Bureau.
It should also be pointed out that a mere deviation from these Guidelines might not, in and of itself, represent a contravention of any one or more of those statutes. Each situation will be evaluated on a case by case basis.

Interpretation
These Guidelines describe the general approach of the Bureau to assessing "Made in Canada" and "Product of Canada" claims under the false or misleading representations provisions of the Acts.
These Guidelines are not intended to restate the law or to constitute a binding statement of how the Commissioner of Competition or the Director of Public Prosecutions ("DPP") will exercise discretion in a particular situation. They do not replace the advice of legal counsel. Guidance regarding future business conduct can be obtained by requesting a binding written opinion from the Commissioner of Competition under section 124.1 of the Competition Act ("CA"). The respective enforcement and prosecutorial decisions of the Commissioner of Competition and the DPP, and the ultimate resolution of issues, will depend on the particular circumstances of the matter in question. Final interpretation of the law is the responsibility of the Competition Tribunal ("Tribunal") and the courts.

1. Introduction

1.1 Scope and purpose of the guidelines
These Guidelines discuss the Bureau's interpretation of "Product of Canada" and "Made in Canada" claims under the Competition Act ("CA"), the Consumer Packaging and Labelling Act ("CPLA") and the Textile Labelling Act ("TLA") as they relate to non‑food products as defined in section 2 of these Guidelines. The CA, the CPLA and the TLA (collectively the "Acts") do not require that the country of origin of a product be identified.Footnote 7 Rather, the Acts prohibit the making of false or misleading representations. The Acts do not require, for instance, that businesses make a "Made in Canada" claim with regard to their products. If however they choose to make such a claim, the Bureau will apply the approach described in these enforcement Guidelines to assist in determining when it will investigate a claim for non‑compliance or undertake an appropriate enforcement action under the false or misleading representations provisions in the statutes under its responsibility. These Guidelines do not address other statutory or regulatory requirements regarding country of origin identification, including "Product of Canada" and "Made in Canada" claims with respect to food and non‑food productsFootnote 8 included in statutes other than the Acts.
These Guidelines are intended to provide businesses and industry groups with information that will help them develop strategies to ensure compliance with the false or misleading representations provisions of the CA, the CPLA, and the TLA with respect to "Product of Canada" and "Made in Canada" claims. Significantly, these Guidelines, and industry compliance with them, will assist consumers in understanding the meaning of "Product of Canada" and "Made in Canada" claims, and in making informed purchasing decisions.
If businesses follow these Guidelines when making representations that their products are "Product of Canada" or "Made in Canada", it is unlikely that they will raise concerns under the statutes administered by the Bureau; moreover, a mere deviation from these Guidelines might not, in and of itself, represent a contravention of any one or more of those statutes. Each situation will be evaluated on a case by case basis.


1.2 Overview of the legislation
While country of origin labelling is not a requirement under the CA, the CPLA or the TLA, each statute contains provisions prohibiting false or misleading representations; such provisions can apply to false or misleading country of origin claims. The purpose of the false or misleading representations provisions of the Acts is to promote fair competition in the marketplace by discouraging deceptive business practices, and by encouraging the provision of truthful and accurate information to enable informed consumer choice.

1.2.1 The Competition Act
The CAFootnote 9 contains provisions that prohibit false or misleading representations for the purpose of promoting a product or any business interest. Two of these provisions (sections 52 and 74.01) can be applied to country of origin claims made by businesses.
Subsection 52(1) of the CA is a criminal provision that prohibits anyone, for the purpose of promoting the supply or use of a product or business interest from knowingly or recklessly making a materially false or misleading representation to the public that is false or misleading in a material respect. Any person who contravenes this subsection is guilty of an offence and liable to a fine and/or imprisonment and can be ordered to pay restitution if the conditions set out in the Criminal CodeFootnote 10 are metFootnote 11.
Paragraph 74.01(1)(a) of the CA is a civil provision that provides that anyone who makes a materially false or misleading representation to the public to promote the supply or use of a product or a business interest engages in "reviewable conduct". When the Competition Tribunal, on application by the Commissioner of Competition, finds that a person has engaged in reviewable conduct, it may order the person not to engage in such conduct, to publish a corrective notice, to pay an administrative monetary penalty and/or to pay restitution.Footnote 12
Most cases are taken under the civil provision of the CA. Criminal prosecution is only undertaken when the false or misleading representations are made knowingly or recklessly, and when the Director of Public Prosecutions is of the view that it is in the public interest to proceed criminallyFootnote 13.


1.2.2 The Consumer Packaging and Labelling Act
The CPLAFootnote 14 requires that consumer products bear accurate and meaningful labelling information to help consumers make informed purchasing decisions. The CPLA sets out specifications for mandatory label information, such as product identity, product net quantity and the dealer's name and principal place of business.Footnote 15 Section 7 of the CPLA also contains a provision prohibiting false or misleading representations on a pre‑packaged product, which covers country of origin claims made by businesses.
The Bureau enforces the CPLA as it relates to non‑food products. The enforcement of the CPLA as it relates to food products is the responsibility of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency ("CFIA").


1.2.3 The Textile Labelling Act
The TLAFootnote 16 requires that consumer textile articles bear accurate and meaningful labelling information to help consumers make informed purchasing decisions. The TLA sets out specifications for mandatory label information, such as information on fibre content and dealer identification. Section 5 of the TLA also contains a provision prohibiting false or misleading representations on a textile article, which covers country of origin claims made by businesses.

2. Definitions
For the purpose of these Guidelines, the following definitions apply:

2.1 Cost of production/manufacturing
Cost of production/manufacturing that would be taken into account by the Bureau when assessing a "Product of Canada" or "Made in Canada" claim are:

expenditures on materials incurred by the producer/manufacturer in the production or manufacturing of the goods; and
expenditures on labour incurred by the producer/manufacturer that relate to the production or manufacturing of the goods and can reasonably be allocated to the production or manufacturing of the goods.

General overhead is not usually included in the calculation of the cost of production and manufacturing; however, overhead expenditures incurred by the producer/manufacturer may be eligible if they relate directly to the production or manufacturing of the goods in question and if they can reasonably be allocated to the production or manufacturing of the goods.


2.2 Food
"Food", as defined in section 2 of the Food and Drugs ActFootnote 17, includes any article manufactured, sold or represented for use as food or drink for human beings, chewing gum, and any ingredient that may be mixed with food for any purpose whatever.


2.3 Non‑food product or good
Non‑food products or goods means products or goods that are not food as defined in section 2 of the Food and Drugs Act.


2.4 Substantial transformation
Goods are substantially transformed where they undergo a fundamental change in form, appearance or nature such that the goods existing after the change are new and different goods from those existing before the change.

3. "Product of Canada" and "Made in Canada" claims

3.1 The Bureau's enforcement approach — General principles
The Acts enforced by the Bureau do not require that the country of origin of a product be identifiedFootnote 18. The Acts do prohibit the making of false or misleading representations. As such, the Acts do not require, for instance, that businesses make a "Made in Canada" claim with respect to their products; however, if they choose to make such a claim, the Bureau will apply the approach described in these enforcement Guidelines to assist in determining when it will investigate a claim for non‑compliance or undertake an appropriate enforcement action under the false or misleading representations provisions included in the statutes under its responsibility.
The approach outlined in these Guidelines is applied by the Bureau on a case‑by‑case basis. The Guidelines are used to assist in interpreting whether a representation, either implicit or explicit, that a product is a "Product of Canada" or "Made in Canada" may be false or misleading to prospective purchasers of the product.

3.1.1 General impression test
When determining whether a "Product of Canada" or "Made in Canada" declaration has been made that is false or misleading, the CA requires that the general impression conveyed by a representation, as well as its literal meaning, be taken into account. Thus, when examining a particular representation, the Bureau will consider the general impression conveyed through a combination of words, visual elements, illustrations and overall layout that may alter the plain meaning of a representation.
As such, any country of origin claim or representation, including any pictorial representation, will be evaluated in its entirety to establish whether the representation creates the general impression that the product was made in Canada.
If the Bureau concludes that the general impression given by a representation is that the product was made in Canada, the Bureau will assess these representations under the criteria for "Product of Canada" and "Made in Canada" claims set out in section 3.2 of these Guidelines to assist in interpreting whether the representations may be false or misleading.


3.1.2 Medium of the representations
The false or misleading representations provisions of the CA and TLA cover all forms of representation regardless of the medium used, including print or broadcast media, Internet and oral representationsFootnote 19.


3.1.3 Proof of deception not required
Subsections 52(1.1) and 74.03(4) of the CA clarify that it is not necessary to prove that anyone was actually deceived or misled in order to prove that a representation has contravened the provisions for criminal or civil false or misleading representations in the CA.


3.1.4 Goods wholly obtained or produced in Canada
Goods that are wholly obtained or produced in Canada (for example: mineral goods extracted in Canada or goods harvested in Canada), will be considered to have undergone their last substantial transformation in Canada.



3.2 Types of claims

3.2.1 "Product of Canada" claims
The Bureau generally will not challenge a representation that states that a good is a "Product of Canada" under the false or misleading representations provisions of the Acts if these two conditions are met:

the last substantial transformation of the good occurred in Canada; and
all or virtually all (at least 98%) of the total direct costs of producing or manufacturing the good have been incurred in Canada.



3.2.2 "Made in Canada" claims
The Bureau will generally not challenge a representation that a good is "Made in Canada" under the false or misleading representations provisions of the Acts if these three conditions are met:

the last substantial transformation of the good occurred in Canada;
at least 51% of the total direct costs of producing or manufacturing the good have been incurred in Canada; and
the "Made in Canada" representation is accompanied by an appropriate qualifying statement, such as "Made in Canada with imported parts" or "Made in Canada with domestic and imported parts". This could also include more specific information such as "Made in Canada with 60% Canadian content and 40% imported content".



3.2.3 Other claims
If a product does not meet either of the criteria for a "Product of Canada" or "Made in Canada" claim, the Bureau recommends the use of a more specific term that more accurately reflects the limited production or manufacturing activity that took place in Canada. For example, "Assembled in Canada with foreign parts" or "Sewn in Canada with imported fabric"Footnote 20. The Bureau encourages the use of qualified claims where the additional information provided is accurate, relevant and useful, and does not give a false or misleading impression.
More general terms, however, such as "produced", or "manufactured" in Canada, are likely to be understood by consumers as synonymous with a "Made in Canada" claim and should therefore comply with the requirements for "Made in Canada" claims. To increase clarity for consumers, the Bureau recommends the use of "Made in Canada" claims with a qualifying statement, over more general terms such as "produced" or "manufactured" in Canada with a qualifying statement.
A marketer may represent that a particular manufacturing or other process was performed in Canada, such as "Designed in Canada". Similarly, a marketer may represent that a particular part was manufactured in Canada, such as that the motor in a lawnmower was made in Canada from domestic and imported parts. Such a claim is acceptable, provided it is accurate and that consumers would understand it to refer to a specific process or part, and not to the general manufacturing of the product.


3.2.4 Implicit declarations
A representation may be made by either express or implied claims. Depending on the context, pictorial representations (e.g., logos, pictures, or symbols such as the Canadian flag or maple leaf) may by themselves be just as forceful as an explicit "Made in Canada" written representation. Any text that attempts to qualify a pictorial representation must be sufficiently prominent to ensure that consumers notice it and understand the significance. If a reasonable conclusion from the use of a pictorial representation is that the goods are made in Canada, when that is in fact not the case as per the requirements noted above, there is a risk of misleading consumers, and the Acts may come into play.
Implicit declarations of domestic origin will be interpreted by the Bureau as giving the same general impression to the public as an explicit "Made in Canada" claim and should therefore meet the conditions for this type of claim, as set out in section 3.2.2 of these Guidelines. In identifying implied claims, the Bureau focuses on the overall general impression of an advertisement, label or other promotional material. This requires an examination of both the representation and the overall context including the positioning of phrases and images.

4. Penalties and remedies
If the Bureau believes that a representation is false or misleading in a material respect, it will look to its Conformity Continuum Information BulletinFootnote 21 in choosing the appropriate enforcement approach for achieving conformity with the legislation. The Bureau has several instruments at its disposal to promote and achieve compliance with the Acts. The Conformity Continuum Information Bulletin explains how the Bureau will select and use each tool and sets out the considerations influencing the Bureau's discretionary enforcement decisions. In prioritizing enforcement activity, the Commissioner of Competition reviews matters in relation to criteria such as economic impact and the Bureau's enforcement policies and priorities.
Under the CA, a corporation found to have engaged in conduct described in the civil false or misleading representations provision (s. 74.01(1)(a)) can be ordered to pay a maximum administrative monetary penalty of $10,000,000 for a first order and $15,000,000 for any subsequent order. In the case of an individual, the maximum administrative monetary penalty is $750,000 for a first order and $1,000,000 for any subsequent order. A corporation or an individual can also be ordered to pay restitution to purchasers of a product in respect of which a false or misleading representation was made. The amount of restitution may be up to the total amount paid to the corporation or individual for the products in respect of which the false or misleading representation was made. A corporation or an individual can also be ordered not to engage in similar conduct for a specified period, and/or to publish a corrective notice.
A person found to have breached the criminal false or misleading representations provision of the CA (s. 52) is subject, on summary conviction, to a maximum fine of $200,000 or to a maximum term of imprisonment of one year, or both. On conviction on indictment, the person is subject to a fine in the discretion of the court or to a maximum term of imprisonment of 14 years, or both. In both cases, the Criminal Code provides that the person could also be ordered to pay restitution if the conditions are met.
Under the CPLA and TLA, a dealer found to have contravened the false or misleading representations provisions is subject, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding $5,000, or on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding $10,000. In both cases, the Criminal Code provides that the person could also be ordered to pay restitution if certain conditions are met.

Origin Claims 

Guidelines for "Product of Canada" and "Made in Canada" Claims 


This page is part of the Guidance Document Repository (GDR).
Looking for related documents?

	Search for related documents in the Guidance Document Repository










The guidelines for "Product of Canada" and "Made in Canada" claims promote compliance with subsection 5.(1) of the Food and Drugs Act and subsection 7(1) of the Consumer Packaging and Labelling Act, which prohibit false and misleading claims.
The use of "Product of Canada" and "Made in Canada" claims is voluntary. However, once a company chooses to make one of these claims, the product to which it is applied should meet these guidelines.
The guidelines for "Product of Canada" and "Made in Canada" claims apply to foods sold at all levels of trade, including bulk sale or wholesale foods for further processing. They also apply to claims made in advertising and by restaurants.
These guidelines do not apply to:

Products destined for export markets: These products must continue to meet the requirements of the importing country. This could result in different labels for domestic and exported products.
Other consumer goods such as animal feed, agricultural seed or plants that are not food products: These products may be assessed under the Competition Bureau's Guide to Made in Canada Claims.
Content claims regarding regional or provincial content, such provinces, cities, towns, etc. 
Terms or references that have regulated requirements and are not subject to the guidelines (e.g. grade names, references to Canada Organic or mandatory country of origin labelling).

All ingredients and their components that contribute to the food, regardless of their generation when they were added, must be considered when assessing "Product of Canada" and "Made in Canada" claims.



"Product of Canada" Claims 

A food product may use the claim "Product of Canada" when all or virtually all major ingredients, processing, and labour used to make the food product are Canadian. This means that all the significant ingredients in a food product are Canadian in origin and that non-Canadian material is negligible.
The following circumstances would not disqualify a food from making a "Product of Canada" claim:

Very low levels of ingredients that are not generally produced in Canada, including spices, food additives, vitamins, minerals, flavouring preparations, or grown in Canada such as oranges, cane sugar and coffee. Generally, the percentage referred to as very little or minor is considered to be less than a total of 2 per cent of the product. 
Packaging materials that are sourced from outside Canada, as these guidelines apply to the Canadian content and production or manufacturing of the food product and not the packaging itself.
The use of imported agricultural inputs such as seed, fertilizers, animal feed, and medications.

For example, a cookie that is manufactured in Canada from oatmeal, enriched flour, butter, honey and milk from Canada, and imported vanilla, may use the claim "Product of Canada" even if the vitamins in the flour and the vanilla are not from Canada.
The claim "Canadian" is considered to be the same as a "Product of Canada" claim and any product carrying this claim must meet the criteria for a "Product of Canada" claim described above.
Generally, products that are exported and re-imported into Canada would not be able to make a "Product of Canada" claim.
The only exception would be if the product:

meets the "Product of Canada" criteria, and;
is ready for sale when it leaves Canada (fully packaged and labelled) and is subsequently returned to Canada without undergoing any processing, repackaging or re-labelling (e.g. perhaps because of an ordering error).

This is because all content, processing and labour still occurred in Canada.





"Made in Canada" Claims with a Qualifying Statement

A "Made in Canada" claim with a qualifying statement can be used on a food product when the last substantial transformation of the product occurred in Canada, even if some ingredients are from other countries. 
Substantial Transformation
A substantial transformation occurs when a food product undergoes processing which changes its nature and becomes a new product bearing a new name commonly understood by the consumer.
For example, the processing of cheese, dough, sauce and other ingredients to create a pizza would be considered a substantial transformation.
Processes which result in a substantial transformation may be outlined in more specific legislation, such as the Meat Inspection Regulations and Processed Products Regulations.
Qualifying Statement
If the "Made in Canada" claim is used, it must also include a qualifying statement to indicate that the food product is made in Canada from imported ingredients or a combination of imported and domestic ingredients. The qualifying statements that can be used include "Made in Canada from domestic and imported ingredients" or "Made in Canada from imported ingredients".
All variations of "Made in Canada" claims must include a qualifying statement.
For example, a claim such as "Proudly Made in Canada" would need a qualifying statement if the product contains imported ingredients as this claim includes the phrase "Made in Canada".
Made in Canada from imported ingredients
When a food is made with ingredients that are all sourced from outside of Canada, the label would state "Made in Canada from imported ingredients".
For example, a cookie manufactured in Canada from imported flour, oatmeal, shortening and sugar may be labelled or advertised with the claim "Made in Canada from imported ingredients".
Made in Canada from domestic and imported ingredients
When a food contains both domestic and imported ingredients, the label would state "Made in Canada from domestic and imported ingredients". This claim may be used on a product that contains a mixture of imported and domestic ingredients, regardless of the level of Canadian content in the product.
For example, a cookie manufactured in Canada using Canadian flour, oatmeal and shortening and imported sugar may be labelled or advertised with the claim "Made in Canada from domestic and imported ingredients".
To provide clarity and consistency for consumers, when a company chooses to use the Made in Canada claim, the qualifying statement should be presented in a standard format: "from domestic and imported ingredients". However, it would be considered acceptable if the order were reversed, if there were a higher proportion of imported ingredients than domestic ingredients.
The claim "Made in Canada from domestic and/or imported ingredients" is not permitted as it does not provide meaningful information to the consumer about the Canadian content.





Other Domestic Content Claims 

The use of "Product of Canada" and the qualified "Made in Canada" claims are encouraged to ensure clarity for the consumer and to enhance their ability to identify Canadian made foods. However, other more specific statements or claims that describe the Canadian value added may be used without further qualification, provided they are truthful and not misleading for consumers.
Examples of these types of domestic claims include:

"Roasted and blended in Canada" to describe coffee since the coffee beans are always imported; 
"Distilled in Canada" to describe bottled water that was distilled in Canada; 
"Canned in Canada" to describe green beans that were canned in Canada;
"Refined in Canada" to describe imported cane sugar which has been refined in Canada;
"Processed in Canada" to describe a food which has been entirely processed in Canada;
"Prepared in Canada" to describe a food which has been entirely prepared in Canada;
"Packaged in Canada" to describe a food which is imported in bulk and packaged in Canada.

Guidance on other types of commonly used domestic content claims can be found below:
Claims Identifying a Canadian Food or Canadian Ingredients
The claim "Canadian" is considered to be the same as a "Product of Canada" claim. As such, all or virtually all major ingredients, processing, and labour used to make the food product must be Canadian. For example, the claim "Canadian" on a container of frozen lasagna would mean that the food meets the "Product of Canada" criteria.
This criteria also applies when the claim is used to describe an ingredient within the food. For example, if the claim "Canadian cheddar cheese" is used on a package of cheddar cheese sauce, all or virtually all major ingredients, processing, and labour used to make the cheddar cheese in the sauce must be Canadian.
When this type of claim is used to describe a single component ingredient within the food, all of the ingredient(s) and, if any, derivatives of that ingredient in the food, must be Canadian. For example, if the claim "Contains Canadian blueberries" is used on a prepackaged blueberry pie, all of the blueberries, as well as any blueberry juice concentrate or derivative, must be Canadian.
"100% Canadian" Claims on Foods or Ingredients
When the claim "100% Canadian" is used on a label, the food or ingredient to which the claim applies must be entirely Canadian rather than "all or virtually all" Canadian.
For example, if the claim "100% Canadian" was used on a pot pie, all of the ingredients, processing, and labour used to make that product must be Canadian.
This would be the same case for a food with a claim which refers to the origin of a particular ingredient, whether single or multi-component, as being "100% Canadian".
For example, if the claim "Made with 100% Canadian Wheat" is used on a bag of dry pasta, all of the wheat, and its derivatives, used in that product must be Canadian.
Additional guidance on the use of the claim "100% Canadian Milk" can be found in the Guidelines for the Acceptable Use of "100% Canadian Milk" Claims on Dairy Products.
Multiple Country of Origin Claims That Reference Canada
The use of a voluntary multiple country of origin statement that references Canada (e.g. "Product of Canada and United States") would not be acceptable. Products that contain foreign ingredients, regardless of their source, are not eligible to bear a "Product of Canada" claim.
Declaring multiple countries of origin on the label could result in false information and, as such, could be considered false and misleading.
Although products that contain foreign ingredients are not eligible to bear a Product of Canada claim, they may be eligible to make a qualified Made in Canada claim, provided that the last substantial transformation of the product occurred in Canada.
A blended claim, such as "A blend of Canadian (naming the product) and [Naming the country] (naming the product)", may be considered acceptable (e.g. "A blend of Canadian and American soybean oil").
Separate requirements may exist for commodities that require a country of origin statement. These are summarized in the Food-Specific Labelling Requirements of the Industry Labelling Tool.





Commodity Specific Information 

Meat and Poultry
"Product of Canada" claims can be applied to meat from Canadian animals that are slaughtered in Canada. Animals are considered Canadian if they are born or hatched, raised and slaughtered in Canada or, in the case of feeder cattle, if they have spent a period of at least 60 days in Canada prior to slaughter in Canada. The 60-day residency period is based on international animal health standards. Such animals are fed, raised and slaughtered in Canada according to Canadian requirements.
The The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) is currently reviewing how these guidelines can be best applied to meat products from live animals imported into Canada. This review will determine how to apply the Product of Canada claim to meat products while respecting the principles of the "Product of Canada" guidelines and not disrupting international commerce or be contrary to trade rules.
Meat from imported hatching eggs, including those hatched in transit, would meet the "Product of Canada" guidelines provided that the chick was raised, slaughtered and processed in Canada.
Fish and Seafood
Wild fish and seafood products can be labelled Product of Canada when caught by vessels in Canadian waters (or adjacent waters as per Canadian regulatory fishing quotas) and the products from the fish and seafood are processed in a Canadian establishment using Canadian ingredients.
In the case of farmed fish and seafood, the farm must be located in Canada, and the processing must occur in a Canadian establishment with the use of Canadian ingredients.
Dairy and Eggs
Eggs from imported hens and milk from imported cows would qualify for the Product of Canada claim provided that the hen laid its eggs in Canada, and the cow is milked in Canada.





National Symbols

The use of the Canadian Coat of Arms and the Canadian Flag are both protected under the Trade-marks Act, subsection 9(1). See Government of Canada trade-marks for more information.
Coat of Arms
The Canadian Coat of Arms cannot be used, unless permission is granted by the Department of Canadian Heritage. Requests for permission may be made to:
Federal Identity ProgramTreasury Board of Canada SecretariatOttawa, Ontario K1A 0R5Tel: (613) 957-2533Fax: (613) 946-5187information@fip-pcim.gc.ca
National Flag
The national flag with the 11-point maple leaf and one or two bars cannot be used unless permission for its use is granted by the Department of Canadian Heritage. There is however, no objection to the use of an 11-point maple leaf without bars. The maple leaf should not be used on an imported food product since it may give the consumer the false impression that the product is of domestic origin. Requests for permission may be made to:
State Ceremonial and Canadian SymbolsDepartment of Canadian HeritageGatineau, Quebec K1A 0M5Tel: (819) 934-9048Fax: (819) 997-8550CeremonialetSymboles_CeremonialandSymbols@pch.gc.ca
Maple Leaf
The use of the maple leaf or other similar symbol may be used on food products without further permission. The use of these vignettes on their own does not always imply that the product is wholly or partially Canadian (e.g. maple leaves as part of a fall scene on a product's label).
However, depending on how the maple leaf is used, it could imply a "Product of Canada" claim and in such situations, the product must follow the criteria for a "Product of Canada" claim. In order to ensure that the use of the maple leaf or other similar symbol will not mislead the consumer, it is recommended that an accompanying domestic content statement be placed in close proximity to the vignette.





Terms Not Subject to the Guidelines 

The following terms or references have regulated requirements and, as such, are not subject to the guidelines for Product of Canada claims:
Grade names incorporating the term Canada (e.g. Canada Fancy)

The guidelines will not affect the regulated Canada grade name requirements or the Meat Inspection Legend.The "Canada Organic" logo or references to Canada Organic
The Canada Organic logo is an indication of certification to the Organic Products Regulations and standards. On imported products that are qualified to use the Canada organic logo, a country of origin statement or the statement "Imported" is required to be in close proximity to the logo, to avoid misleading consumers.
Mandatory Country of Origin Labelling (COOL) StatementsThe guidelines do not apply to mandatory country of origin statements. In addition, the use of a qualified Made in Canada claim or any alternate claim, such as "Packaged in Canada" does not trigger the need for the country of origin declaration unless otherwise specified in regulations. For more information, refer to Country of Origin Labelling.

15 Products You Can (Usually) Only Buy in Canada

Canada is widely known for its hockey, maple syrup, and brutally cold winters. But you can bet your back bacon that Canadians also enjoy some special products only available in the Great White North, many of which are completely unknown to its neighbors to the south, at least outside of specialist importers. Here’s a salute to some of the items that are usually only available on Canadian soil.
1. CANADIAN MILK CHOCOLATE
Crispy Crunch, Smarties (the Canadian kind), Aero, Wunderbar, Caramilk—while the names and textures of these candy bars may differ, they all contain the same unique “Canadian” chocolate taste. Apparently, there is a Canadian preference for a sweeter, creamier milk chocolate, as opposed to the gritty, bitter taste of American chocolate. In 2013, The Hershey Company changed its formula to develop a milkier, creamier chocolate “that is unique to Canadian chocolate.” Even Canadian versions of popular American chocolate bars, such as Kit Kat and Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups, taste completely different, as documented in a 2009 Food Network survey.
2. KRAFT DINNER (NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH KRAFT MACARONI AND CHEESE)

Kraft Dinner, or “KD” as it’s affectionately (and now formally) known in Canada, is the country’s unofficial official food. It been reported that Canadians consume 1.7 million boxes of the neon-colored pasta tubes a week, out of the 7 million sold globally. Yes, you can get similar pasta-and-powdered cheese concoctions in the United States, but you can’t find the “KD” packaging anywhere in the U.S., and there tend to be more varieties of the pasta in Canada as well.
3. BUTTER TARTS

These yummy desserts—pastry tart shells filled with maple or corn syrup, sugar, butter, and raisins—are a distinctly Canadian treat. Some articles have traced their origins to pioneer cookbooks published in the early 1900s. However, a 2007 Toronto Star article suggests they date back to the mid-1600s and the arrival of the filles de marier, or imported brides, from France. Regardless, these desserts are a seasonal staple at the Canadian Christmas snack table. And while some small American bakeries might offer butter tarts, in Canada processed, pre-packaged versions are found at most convenience stores around the country. 
4. MILK BY THE BAG

Yes, that’s really a thing. You may think milk in a bag defies the laws of physics come pouring time, but the bags are smartly placed in a pitcher container and the corner is snipped off at an angle for easy pouring. Bags of milk are still popular in Ontario, Quebec, and Eastern Canada, but have been phased out in other parts of the country. Some American states have flirted with the idea of bringing bagged milk to the masses, but the practice doesn’t look like it’s catching on.
5. MOUNTAIN EQUIPMENT CO-OP

Similar to the U.S.-based REI, Mountain Equipment Co-op was founded in 1971 by four mountaineering friends who wanted to offer Canadians a low-cost way to purchase outdoor equipment without having to go to the States. Today, MEC still runs as a co-op offering memberships for $5 (you need one to purchase anything at the store). It’s found in 18 cities across the country and boasts 4.5 million members from Canada and around the world. 
6. HICKORY STICKS
Picture julienned thick-cut potato chips with a tangy, smoky flavoring and you have Hickory Sticks. They're also one of the few remaining products under the Hostess name in Canada, as Hostess was bought out by Lays in the 1990s (the Canadian potato chip brand is completely unrelated to the Twinkie hawker). These products have survived the test of time … as has the decidedly unglamorous brown packaging.
7. SWISS CHALET

Mention the words “Quarter Chicken Dinner” to any Canuck and the words “Swiss Chalet” will immediate come to mind. The restaurant is known for chicken, ribs, and one-of-a-kind dipping sauce. Bonus point for anyone who remembers the cheesy Swiss Chalet TV commercials of the 1980s with iconic images of those juicy succulent chickens rotating on skewers.
8. CAESARS

Americans may have their Bloody Marys, but the Canadian hangover cure (and cause) has always been found in a Caesar. Similar to a Bloody Mary but with a kick, the recipe typically calls for 1-2 ounces of vodka, two dashes of hot sauce (Tabasco is commonly used), four dashes of Worcestershire sauce, and 4 to 6 ounces of Clamato juice. Don’t forget the celery salt and pepper on the rim! The crowning glory are the stalks of celery, olives, limes, and other greenery that may accompany it. Serve over ice and enjoy. 
9. RED RIVER CEREAL

Who would have thought that a blend of wheat, rye, and flaxseed mixed with boiling water would be such a hit? Named after the iconic Red River that flows north into Winnipeg from the U.S., the hot cereal has been a staple in many homes since 1924. Red River Cereal was once imported into the U.S. by Smuckers foods of Canada, but it appears to have been discontinued.
10. MCCAIN DEEP N’ DELICIOUS CAKE
McCain Deep n’ Delicious cakes are a fixture in Canadian freezers around the country. The moist cake is available in vanilla, marble, chocolate, and other flavors, topped with a sweet icing. The treat comes in a metallic aluminum foil tray with re-sealable plastic dome lid that is often superfluous, as the cake is usually eaten entirely in one sitting. Pass the fork, please! 
11. PRESIDENT’S CHOICE PRODUCTS 





Enokson, Flickr // CC BY-NC 2.0
What started out as a desire to make top-quality generic-brand products in the 1980s has since grown into a best-selling national empire. The President’s Choice line was spearheaded by the late Dave Nichol for the Loblaw chain of stores in 1984 as way to bring a “higher end” generic brand of products to consumers. Some of the first items included PC Beer and The Decadent Chocolate Chip Cookie, which hit the shelves in 1988 and is still one of its top-selling products today. While the company did expand to selling some of its products in select grocery stores around the U.S., the PC brand has largely been phased out of the United States, save for a few stores in the Chicago area.
12. LAURA SECORD CHOCOLATES





antefixus21, Flickr // CC BY-NC-ND 2.0
Take the name of a Canadian war hero and mix in some cocoa, sugar, and butter, and you have a recipe for national chocolate-making success. Laura Secord was an American-born pioneer woman in what was then Upper Canada (the forerunner of Ontario), who successfully warned the Canadian and British forces of an impending Yankee attack during the War of 1812. To the delight of many sweet-toothed Canadians, her legacy did not stop there. In 1913, Frank P. O’Connor opened the first Laura Secord candy shop on Toronto’s Yonge St. Today, over 100 stores are found across Canada—boasting more than 400 products, including the marshmallow Santa Claus, a seasonal favorite stocking-stuffer. The chain does deliver to the U.S., but there are no locations south of the border.
13. DUNK-A-ROOS

The Betty Crocker kangaroo-shaped cinnamon-flavored graham cookies dunked in sweet, sweet icing are still sold in grocery stories in Canada despite being discontinued in the United States. Americans will either need to cross the border to pick them up, pay at least five times the retail price for the product on sites like Amazon.com, or come up with their own homemade remedy for their sugar fix.
14. HAWKINS CHEEZIES

The original Canadian Cheezie was actually created in Chicago after the Second World War by James Marker and W.T. Hawkins. According to the product’s website, the duo perfected their recipe by extracting cornmeal into finger-like shapes, frying them in shortening, and then dusting them with aged cheddar cheese. The plant moved to Ontario, Canada, in the 1950s and the product has remained north of the 49th parallel ever since. Some have said the snack is similar to a Cheetos Crunchy, but others claim there is only one Cheezies.
15. LE CHÂTEAU





bargainmoose, Flickr // CC BY-NC-ND 2.0
Long before U.S. chains such as H&M and Forever 21 graced the storefronts of Canadian malls, Le Château was the go-to store for affordable, Euro-chic clothing and accessories. The Canadian clothier first got its start in 1959 as a family-run store in downtown Montréal. Today there are more than 200 retail locations across Canada. In the late ‘80s, Le Château opened more than 20 stores in the U.S., but closed them about a decade later after reporting significant losses in those markets. The company boasts a small international presence in countries such as Dubai and Saudi Arabia, but the name recognition of Le Château in Canada is as Canadian as poutine. (Le Château founder Herschel Segal is also co-founder of another Canadian business, David’s Tea, but that one is now widely found in certain parts of the U.S.)

                                    A Brief History of Poutine
                                



BY Sean Hutchinson July 1, 2017



 



istock












Walk down a street after a hard night of drinking in Montréal and you’d be hard-pressed not seeing someone gorging themselves on poutine, a high-calorie classic staple of Québécois casse-croûtes—or “greasy spoon”—cuisine.
Just what is poutine, you ask? The delicious Canadian dish is comprised of a holy-hoser trinity of ingredients: French fries, cheese curds, and gravy. Try some yourself and you’ll be hooked. It’s become so popular that it’s readily available at certain restaurants in the U.S. (Lucky New Yorkers can get their hands on some traditional poutine at Brooklyn restaurant Mile End.) Otherwise, the dish has become so ubiquitous in its home province that even McDonald’s and Burger King sell it as a side.
Much like the debate in the U.S. about the origins of the hamburger, poutine has similarly unclear beginnings. The most widespread claim for inventing poutine comes from the small dairy-farming town of Warwick, Québec, where, in 1957, a customer asked restaurateur Fernand Lachance to throw cheese curds and French fries—items the owner sold separately at his restaurant L’Idéal (later renamed Le lutin qui rit, or “The Laughing Elf”)—together in one bag because the customer was in a rush. Legend has it when Lachance peered into the bag after the two ingredients were mixed together, he remarked, “This is a ‘poutine,’” using the joual—or Québécois slang—for a "mess.”
Noticeably absent from Lachance’s cobbled-together recipe is the gravy ingredient, which was added to the mix in 1964 when a restaurant-owner in nearby Drummondville, Quebec named Jean-Paul Roy noticed a few of his diners ordering a side of cheese curds to add to the patented gravy sauce and fries dish at his restaurant, Le Roy Jucep. Roy soon added the three-ingredient item on his menu and the rest is delicious, gravy-soaked history.
Eventually, poutine spread across the province and throughout Canada—with different combinations added to the fries, curds, and gravy recipe—but the original remains the most recognized and honored. It even initially made its way to the United States by way of New Jersey, where an altered recipe known as “Disco Fries” substitutes shredded cheddar or mozzarella cheese for the Canadian curds.
But if you ever find yourself in Montréal and have a hankering for greasy food, be sure to order it correctly. Anglophones usually pronounce the word as “poo-teen,” but if you want to pass for a real Québécois, it’s pronounced “poo-tin.”

Americans looking to take a trip across their country's northern border might find themselves bewildered by some Canadian turns of phrase. It is, after all, a place where people go out for a rip to the beer store and plunk down their loonies to pick up a two-four. Pretty confusing, eh? But fear not. For all you keeners who want to learn how to speak like a Canuck, here’s a handy chart to help you master Canadian slang, courtesy of Expedia.ca.

Need help starting the conversation?


You can expect that once you bring up the topic of ED, your doctor can take it from there. So here are some ways to break the ice when he asks how everything’s going: 
1. "I have trouble sometimes in bed. Could it be ED?"
2. "I think I might have ED. What can I do about it?"
3. "Could VIAGRA work for me?" 
Help make the most of your VIAGRA Talk.
By asking questions about VIAGRA and ED, you can help your doctor get the information he needs to find out if you have ED and to decide if VIAGRA is right for you.

Watch out for VIAGRA offers with “no prescription.”  





















 
Don't be fooled by counterfeit VIAGRA.






Counterfeits aren’t just a cheap knock-off of a proven product; they’re illegal, potentially harmful fakes. It’s hard to tell where or how they were made—or even what’s inside them.
 









WATCH:
A counterfeit epidemic
 










VIAGRA is one of the most counterfeited drugs in the world. 
In March 2011, Pfizer Global Security studied the search results for the term "buy VIAGRA" to see how many online pharmacies were selling counterfeit VIAGRA. 
The study was conducted using the top 2 search engines over a 5-day period. During this time, 22 unique sites consistently appeared among the top search results claiming to sell VIAGRA manufactured by Pfizer. Pfizer Global Security then ordered VIAGRA from these sites and tested the chemical composition of the pills.

Warning: Counterfeit medications can be dangerous.


3.2-warning-1.png



 
Blue printer ink
Amphetamines, also known as “speed”
Metronidazole, a powerful antibiotic that could cause an allergic reaction, diarrhea, or vomiting
Too much active ingredient (or not enough), which may cause you harm
Binding agents, such as drywall, that prevent the tablet from breaking down in your system



3.2-warning-2.png



 
Toxic ingredients, such as boric acid, floor wax, brick dust, rat poison, and road paint
Ingredients that can have dangerous interactions with other medications you may be taking
A completely different medication with potentially harmful side effects

 
 









WATCH:
Recipe for a fake
 










Learn how to safely buy online.
Make sure that when you buy VIAGRA online, you get real VIAGRA. Many of the sites that claim to sell VIAGRA online are actually selling potentiallydangerous counterfeits.


3.2-watch-online-scams.jpg





 Follow these steps: 
1 Make sure the website requires a valid prescription. It’s illegal to sell VIAGRA without a prescription from a qualified healthcare professional.
2 Make sure you see a U.S. address and phone number. This can help you make sure the website is not selling unregulated medication from overseas.
3 Check if they claim to sell “generic VIAGRA” for ED. The FDA has never approved the so-called “generic VIAGRA” for ED you see for sale online. It could be counterfeit and may cause you harm.
4 VIAGRA only comes in 3 doses. 25 mg, 50 mg, and 100 mg. VIAGRA is a tablet. Any other form, like “fast-dissolving,” “extra-strength,” “soft-tab,” or “VIAGRA for Women” is not FDA-approved.
5 Look for Verified Internet Pharmacy Practice Sites® (VIPPS®). A VIPPS® accreditation ensures the website you are purchasing from is secure and reliable.

GENTLEMEN:
What is erectile dysfunction?






Erectile dysfunction is when a man has difficulty getting an erection. Or keeping it long enough for sex. It’s also known as ED or impotence. It happens when not enough blood flows to the penis, preventing an erection. It affects about 30 million men in the U.S. Some guys with ED find it difficult to either get or keep an erection every time they try to have sex. For others, ED symptoms can happen just once in a while. Either way, you should know that you’re not alone.
 ABOUT

1.1-50-percent.png




ED is not all in your head. It’s not just a part of aging that you have to accept. It’s a real medical condition, so it should be addressed like one. If you think you have ED symptoms, talk to a doctor.
*Data taken from the Massachusetts Male Aging Study. Of 1,290 respondents, 52% stated that they had some degree of ED.
 



What can cause ED?


ED is often caused by something physical, such as a disease, injury, or side effects from other drugs.
Medical Conditions





      
          Depression    

      
          Diabetes    

      
          Heart disease    

      
          High blood pressure    

      
          High cholesterol    

      
          Obesity    

      
          Prostate cancer treatment    

      
          Spinal cord injury    

 


Although most cases of ED have a physical cause, thoughts that lead to depression, worry, or anxiety can also cause ED.
Even when ED has a physical cause, it can be made worse if it leads to depression and worry.
 

Diabetes is a condition where there is too much sugar, or glucose, in the blood. Over time, high blood sugar levels can damage nerves and blood vessels—like the ones that produce erections. When this occurs, diabetes can lead to ED.
In a study, up to 83% of men with diabetes had some form of ED.
 

Heart disease can clog or narrow the arteries. This can stop blood from flowing to the penis, and may cause ED. Talk to your doctor to make sure your heart is healthy enough for sex.
 

High blood pressure makes the heart work harder. This puts strain on the blood vessels, which then harden and narrow. This can prevent blood from getting to the penis and lead to ED. In a study, more than 65% of men with high blood pressure also had ED.
Additionally, some medications used to treat high blood pressure can lead to ED. Make sure your doctor is aware of all medications you are taking.
 

High cholesterol can clog your arteries. This can slow blood flow to the penis. The result? It can affect the quality of your erections.
In a study, high cholesterol raised men's risk of erectile dysfunction by 80%.
 

Obesity can cause real harm to your health. For example, it's associated with medical conditions that can affect blood flow. And when blood flow is affected, it can cause ED.
 

The prostate is a small gland near your bladder. It's next to the nerves that are necessary for an erection to happen. For men with prostate cancer, surgical removal of the prostate can lead to ED.
 

An injury to the spine can affect many functions in the body. Erectile function is no exception.
Due to nerve damage, some men with spinal cord injuries can't get erections. Others can—but can't keep them hard enough or long enough for sex.
 


Medications
In some men, ED is a side effect of some medications. These medications might include drugs used to treat:
High blood pressure
Heart disease
Depression
 





Can your lifestyle have something to do with it?
 Yes. Some lifestyle and psychological factors can play a role in causing ED, such as smoking, drinking, and stress because they may lead to conditions that affect blood circulation. 
There are things you can do each day to improve your circulation and avoid some of the conditions that can lead to ED:
Find ways to stay more active (mowing the lawn, walking the dog)
Help manage your weight by eating healthy and watching your portion size
Drink less alcohol
Quit smoking. The results can be significant
Look for ways to reduce stress in your daily life
 





GENTLEMEN:
VIAGRA helps guys with ED get and keep an erection.

And it’s been shown to effectively treat ED in guys who have certain other medical conditions. So be sure to tell your doctor about your medical conditions and medications so he can choose the right dose for you.
 
 
 
 















          NEXT:        
Learn how VIAGRA works. 





















 
GENTLEMEN:
How does VIAGRA work?






VIAGRA works for men with erectile dysfunction (ED) by increasing blood flow to the penis so you can get and keep an erection hard enough for sex. Individual results may vary. It’s been proven to help guys with all degrees of ED. VIAGRA usually starts to work within 30–60 minutes. And you only take it when you need it.

1.1-watch-1.png




VIAGRA works only when you are sexually stimulated. You may take it up to 4 hours before sexual activity. So don’t worry. There's no need to rush.
After sex? Your erection should go away. In the rare event of an erection lasting more than 4 hours, seek immediate medical help to avoid long-term injury.
 APPROXIMATELY

1.2-four-fifths.png




†Seventy-two percent, 80%, and 85% of the patients on 25 mg, 50 mg, and 100 mg of VIAGRA, respectively, achieved erections hard enough for sex, compared to 50% on placebo. Also, men taking VIAGRA showed an improvement in their ability to get and keep an erection versus those who took placebo.
 












          NEXT:        
Is VIAGRA right for me? 





















 
GENTLEMEN:
Want to know if it's right for you?






Only your doctor can decide if VIAGRA is right for you. VIAGRA isn't right for everyone. If you have trouble getting or keeping an erection hard enough for sex, VIAGRA may help.

Who should not take VIAGRA?
Do not take VIAGRA if you:
Take medicines called “nitrates” (such as nitroglycerin)
Use street drugs called “poppers” such as amyl nitrate or amyl nitrite, and butyl nitrate
Take medicines called guanylate cyclase stimulators such as Adempas (riociguat)
Are allergic to sildenafil, as contained in VIAGRA and REVATIO, or any of the ingredients in VIAGRA. See the Patient Information for a complete list of ingredients in VIAGRA
 VIAGRA and drug interactions.
Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements.

Possible side effects of VIAGRA. 





















 
Wondering about possible side effects?






Safety is important. And it helps to know about possible side effects. 
VIAGRA can cause serious side effects. Rarely reported side effects include: 
an erection that will not go away (priapism). If you have an erection that lasts more than 4 hours, get medical help right away. If it is not treated right away, priapism can permanently damage your penis. 
sudden vision loss in one or both eyes. Sudden vision loss in one or both eyes can be a sign of a serious eye problem called non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION). Stop taking VIAGRA and call your healthcare provider right away if you have sudden vision loss in one or both eyes. 
sudden hearing decrease or hearing loss. Some people may also have ringing in their ears (tinnitus) or dizziness. If you have these symptoms, stop taking VIAGRA and contact a doctor right away.
Other important information:

VIAGRA can help a man get and keep an erection when he becomes sexually stimulated. It’s not right for everyone. Here are some other things you should know:
Do not take VIAGRA if you:

take any medicines called nitrates, often prescribed for chest pain, or guanylate cyclase stimulators like Adempas (riociguat) for pulmonary hypertension. Your blood pressure could drop to an unsafe level.
are allergic to sildenafil, as contained in VIAGRA and REVATIO, or any of the ingredients in VIAGRA. 
Discuss your health with your doctor to ensure that you are healthy enough for sex. If you experience chest pain, dizziness, or nausea during sex, seek immediate medical help.
 The most common side effects of VIAGRA are:
headache
flushing
upset stomach
abnormal vision, such as changes in color vision (such as having a blue color tinge) and blurred vision
stuffy or runny nose
back pain
muscle pain
nausea
dizziness
rash
In addition, heart attack, stroke, irregular heartbeat and death have happened rarely in men taking VIAGRA. Most, but not all, of these men had heart problems before taking VIAGRA. It is not known if VIAGRA caused these problems.
Tell your healthcare provider if you have any side effect that bothers you or does not go away.
These are not all the possible side effects of VIAGRA. For more information, ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist.
 





Talk to your doctor.
Discuss your general health and ED symptoms with your doctor to see if VIAGRA is right for you.

Just what's in Essiac
        The four main botanicals in Essiac tea - sheep sorrel, burdock root, the inner bark of the slippery elm and Indian Rhubarb - are each believed by herbalists to have beneficial effects.* Sheep sorrel is believed to  support the endocrinal system.* Burdock root is believed to eliminate free radicals and purifies the blood.* Slippery elm is believed to help maintain a healthy inflammatory balance in membranes and organs.* And Indian rhubarb is believed to help the body, especially the liver, rid itself of wastes and toxins.*    	



Rene M. Caisse R.N.(1888-1978)
Rene Caisse passed away on December 26th, 1978 at the age of ninety years.  Her gravestone in the Bracebridge cemetery reads:

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
