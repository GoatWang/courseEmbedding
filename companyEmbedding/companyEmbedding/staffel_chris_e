I got these to match the blue with towels in my bathroom for an added pop of color. Could not be more pleased with the quality!

Exactly as I expected!












Verified Purchase


After reading other reviews, I was aware that the 'Spa Daisies" canvas prints could vary in color (a lot).  I first purchased  the set of three from another site, and, sure enough, they were entirely different shades of blue and didn't even come close to matching.  Only one was true to the color shown online.  I decided to take a chance and order them from Overstock in hope that they would match this time, and they did!  I'm glad I tried a second time because they were worth the effort!

It Truly is Beautiful!












Verified Purchase


I love this painting! I ordered it for our tv room which has too many natural tones. I have a few blue accents but needed one big thing to tie everything together. This was the perfect painting. I was worried the colors would be too bright but they were more on the pale side, which was perfect. I only wish I had a larger wall to put the rest of the collection.

Great "art"












Verified Purchase


We bought this one and one other in the set for over our mantel.  I think they look great.  They do look a little more blue and a little less teal in real life but they still fit well with our space.

Selling other people's products


 























































 







ChrisLema.comHelping businesses leverage WordPress and helping WordPress businesses find leverage.

January 20, 2014   /   eCommerce, WordPressSelling other people's products
Chris LemaThere’s a great way to make money selling other people’s products.
If you’re not a developer, but you’re good at marketing, then creating a marketplace may be right for you.
A marketplace looks like a normal eCommerce store but there’s a single difference: the products aren’t your own.
It used to be difficult to create these kinds of marketplaces, but today it’s ridiculously easy because of a combination you may not know about – a plugin, a few extensions, and a theme.

Easy Digital Downloads
EDD Extension: Commissions
EDD Extension: Frontend Submissions
WordPress Theme: Marketify

The Marketplace Bundle
The good news, when it comes to the EDD extensions is that Pippin and the good folks working on EDD have created a Marketplace bundle – giving you the two extensions above, along with several others that will round out some nice functionality.
Commissions
The reason I say this is a great way to do it is because you can work with a variety of vendors to convince them to sell their products in your store (after all, what’s wrong with another channel?) and use Commissions to provide them the right incentives. More channels means more broader market, which leads to greater profits (for everyone involved).
Frontend Submissions
And Frontend Submissions gives product owners control over adding their own products, the copy that shows up on product pages, images, and more. It reduces your need to do a lot to build the store (other than recruiting sellers).
Marketify
When I said you were good at marketing, I meant you would need to be good at getting the word out (as well as getting more sellers). But notice I didn’t say you had to be a great developer. Because this new theme, Marketify, will make your site look beautiful.
To recap:

Install EDD & extensions.
Install Marketify.
Recruit sellers.
Launch & Market.

That’s the right way to create a marketplace.
Is there a wrong way to sell other people’s products?
Yes, my friends. Yes there is.
Now in the WordPress world, you should know that most of the plugins and themes are licensed under GPL. It’s a license that allows anyone to freely use, enhance or distribute the code without any requirement of paying for license fees.
If this is the first time you’ve heard about the GPL, I know how weird it can sound. But the results have proven it to be a model that works well to increase community participation in the development of fantastic software.
But that same freedom to distribute can lead to people taking premium products (like iThemes Builder, Headway Themes, the Genesis Framework, and Gravity Forms) and re-distributing them on their own sites for their own gain.
Now, I know, given the paragraph above – you’re going to ask me if it’s legal. And the truth is that it is. 100% lega. If the code is licensed under GPL it is free to be distributed.
But if you’re going to do that, you can’t infringe on their trademarks and copyrights.
And that’s where things come falling apart. They highlight the wrong way to do it. Because the only reason people would even spend $5 on these products is if they thought they were the real ones – coded and supported by the real companies that produced them.
So imagine your surprise, were you to buy Gravity Forms for $5 and install it, when you realized you couldn’t get any support for it at all. What a waste!
And that’s because this marketplace isn’t a legit marketplace, it’s a fake. As fake as the guys on the street corner in NYC selling fake Guci bags (and yes, there’s a “c” missing).
There’s never been a better time..
Fortunately, you have at least two legit ways to sell other people’s code without infringing on their rights.
The first is to use affiliate links (like those in this article). I only recommend products that

I own
I use
I trust

You can read more about my policy on affiliate recommendations and why, even though I get offers to write reviews for tons of products every day, over 95% never show up on this site.
The second way is to build a marketplace. And as you’ve seen above, between the Marketplace bundle and  Marketify, you could have a marketplace built for less than $200. That’s seriously an amazing deal.
By the way, if you do create a new marketplace, come back and tell me about it. I want to know about it.

I’m thinking of creating one. Still need to come up with a good name (who’s URL isn’t taken) for it first though. I might do some searching when I have more cash to spend on this idea. Bit it’s what my company does – create websites around ideas or themes. Just wish we had more cash to hire a developer or two so we could finish some of the ideas.

Great post.
>> Because the only reason people would even spend $5 on these products is if they thought they were the real ones
Premium plugin developers (like me) wish this were true. But it isn’t.
Also, the “you’re really paying for support” argument people often put forth is also bs… if the products are easy to use do you really need support? Most people aren’t paying for support. Most people are paying for the product.

Yeah, a lot of people know they are getting “just the code” from someone other than the original plugin developer. I assume there might be some confusion with some customers or some of the leech sites, but I think a lot of people know what they are purchasing.
IMO, $5 is about right to pay for someone to package up otherwise paywalled GPL code, make sure it’s up to date, and free of malware, etc, and offer it up for download.

If only it were that simple.  But the code is GPL so we can do whatever we want? Right?
Not quite.  Not when there are companies with well established brands and trademarks involved.  The GPL only applies to the code.  It does not apply a companies brand or trademarks.
The simplest explanation i’ve seen on this matter is on the Wikipedia page that discusses Red Hat Linux redistributions.  Red Hat Linux being an open source version of Linux released under the GNU GPL license, specifically the section on “Legal Aspects” found here:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux_derivatives#Legal_aspects
“However, to avoid misrepresentation of Red Hat’s trademark, material in the original distribution covered by the trademark must be stripped off or removed from the redistribution.”
Red Hat must protect it’s trademarks.  Legally you have to or risk losing it.  In this case that means stripping out every instance of “Red Hat” or any other Red Hat related trademarks from the redistributed code.
Nothing is ever as simple as we may believe it to be.

People need to remember to keep in mind that Companies like Headway got around the GPL issue by creating their own Javascript and CSS which they can copyright and so even though the code is GPL because it’s derivative from WordPress, they can still sue due to copyrighted images, and content if someone tries to resell their theme etc. Very important for anyone looking into doing this to remember. So do what you want with the code, but pay attention to the copy written content visible to the user.

Good post Chris. I’ve had very good luck with people (mostly companies) paying for support but I know that isn’t everyone. I would be curious if there is any actual data from the WordPress community as to what the customer thinks they’re paying for, support or product.

Hi Chris,
Can a marketplace like this be used to sell physical products only?

Great post Chris.. and it all makes sense… common sense. And there is always people who ruin it for other people : /
And so with you on affiliates… I also get requests for numerous ones daily, but stick to what I know, trust and use myself. I have found some so-called reputable people in the WordPress community who have affiliate links, and when I have shared them with clients and readers, because I thought they would only have them on the site because they trusted them also, that was a mistake. One particular instance the client had a horrible experience. I when I contacted the person whose site share it, she totally ignored me. Ugh….
Thanks for the post!

One could argue that blogging about this practice and using it as an opportunity to use affiliate links all throughout is equally “wrong”. Excessively blogging on topics framed in such a way that everything is always about affiliate links does call into question the sincerity and purpose of the blogger.

I would suggest that they’re worlds apart. The links in this post model an alternative that doesn’t take money out of a developers hand and doesn’t hurt a customer at all.
As for my sincerity and integrity, you’d have to read a few posts to come to a rational conclusion – one that many have done and decided the posts were worth reading. But that’s a personal choice.

Hi Chris, thanks so much for this article! It gave me the info I needed to create (and getting ready to launch soon) a marketplace of classes, consultations and creative services for women entrepreneurs! I used the theme, plugins and extensions you talked about. It has been amazingly easy to do. I am still “tweaking” it, getting ready for the launch but would love for you to see it: http://www.thewomenentrepreneursacademy.com – Thank you!!!! – Di Ana

Well, i’m in the process of creating one but for the core of it, still comparing an EDD approach to a woocommerce approach. What do you think of ?

Hi. I’m wondering if anyone knows of any profitable sites built with the EDD marketplace bundle. I have purchased the bundle and am trying to configure everything and it is far from straightforward. In fact there are some missing functionalities that are pretty much unforgiveable (from the point of view of website visitiors). I’m wondering if anyone has actually made money using this bundle or if there are just hundreds (perhaps thousands) of hopefuls that have bought it and are doing nothing because it’s hard to work with.

Hi Chris,
Wonderful article! I did my bit of research on Marketify and the EDD plugin package. I could not figure out the admin level access & controls on my website. Features like approving or revoking membership, products etc and other standard features of the admin dashboard.
How wonderful will it be if you could help out on that.
Cheers!
