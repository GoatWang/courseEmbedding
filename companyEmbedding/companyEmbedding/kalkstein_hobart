BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Cabot 
      Corporation (NYSE: CBT) appointed Hobart C. Kalkstein as

      President and Chief Executive Officer Sean D. Keohane.
    


      Mr. Kalkstein joined Cabot in 2005. Since joining the company, Kalkstein 
      has held several key management positions within the company, most 
      recently as vice president of corporate strategy and development. He was 
      also vice president of global business operations and general manager of 
      global emission control solutions for the Purification Solutions 
      segment, vice president of business operations and executive director of 
      marketing and business strategy for the Performance Chemicals segment, 
      and general manager of the aerogel business. Prior to joining Cabot, 
      Kalkstein worked for Boston Consulting Group. Kalkstein earned his MBA 
      from Harvard University and a BSE in civil engineering and operations 
      research at Princeton University.
    

      Mr. Doubman joined Cabot in 2006, and his most recent position was as 
      vice president and general manager of the tire and elastomer composites 
      product lines within the Reinforcement Materials segment. Since joining 
      the company, he has held several commercial and business positions 
      including vice president of the Europe, Middle East and Africa region 
      for the Reinforcement Materials segment, director of corporate strategy, 
      and commercial director for the inkjet business. Prior to joining Cabot, 
      he worked for Saint Gobain, as well as Bain and Company. Doubman earned 
      his MBA from The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania and has a BS 
      in Mechanical Engineering from Bucknell University.
    

      "Bart has held a variety of commercial, leadership and strategy roles at 
      Cabot. Bart's commercial experience and his depth of understanding of 
      how to lead and develop businesses will be a strong advantage to the 
      Reinforcement Materials segment," Keohane said. "Jay's experience in a 
      number of business and strategy roles positions him well to lead our 
      corporate strategy and development efforts. I have full confidence that 
      both Bart and Jay will be successful in their new roles and I am pleased 
      to have them as members of our management executive committee."
