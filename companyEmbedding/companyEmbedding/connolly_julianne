Kevin Connolly sure treats his “friends” well.    
The Entourage star, 33, recently stopped by Los Angeles’s Tracy Allen Fine Jewelry and plunked down several thousand dollars on a diamond and18-karat, white-gold ring for Dancing with the Stars beauty Julianne Hough.
Hough’s rep confirms to PEOPLE that the 19-year-old professional dancer did indeed receive a ring from the star, but insists that they two are “just friends” and “not dating.”  
A store patron says Connolly “knew exactly what he was going to get her and was clear about who it was for.”  
Hough even wore the ring on Monday’s performance show, when she and partner Helio Castroneves did the paso doble and the fox trot.  
Connolly (who previously dated Nicky Hilton and was briefly linked to Hayley Duff) recently admitted to Howard Stern that he was “actively pursuing” Hough.

Dancing with the Stars pro Julianne Hough shot down rumors Monday night that she and Entourage star Kevin Connolly are dating. 
“No, no, no” Hough adamantly told PEOPLE. “We’re just friends.”  The blonde-haired season four Dancing champ says she and Connolly met and “talk on the phone a lot. But we’re just friends.” 
Connolly, 33, confirmed this to Howard Stern Monday, though he couldn’t help but gush about the 19-year-old beauty. Connolly was on Stern’s radio show with Entourage costar Adrian Grenier to promote the new Entourage coffee table book. The two met, Connolly says, at L.A. hot spot Hyde. Since then, Connolly told Stern he’s “actively pursuing” Hough and talks to her practically every day.  He even went to see her perform at a DWTS taping. 
Connolly says he considers Hough “a 15” on his scale, a score that takes into account her flawless looks and infectious personality.  Connolly encouraged Stern’s listeners to vote for Julianne. 
Upon hearing Connolly’s remarks, Hough told PEOPLE, “Aw. That’s really sweet. That’s very flattering. But we’re just friends.” –Monica Rizzo

               Unity is a worldwide organization more than a century old. We are Christian yet accepting and honoring of all the world's religions. Unity was founded in the early 1900s by Charles and Myrtle Fillmore. Unity is based on prayer and healing. Mr. and Mrs. Fillmore both demonstrated the power of prayer in healing their bodies, Myrtle of Tuberculosis, and Charles of a withered leg. Unity is a positive approach to life, seeking to accept the inherent good in people and all of life. Unity proclaims and lives diversity. We are blessed by people of many ages, races, physical abilities, sexual orientation and even creeds! A healthy diversity of opinions also exists. Unity stresses that God is not a physical man in the sky, for that limits our understanding. God is Spirit, everywhere present, the one and only Spirit behind, in and through all things, visible and invisible. Unity denies the existence of any power or presence opposed to God. It sees that there are evil appearances and suffering in the world, but attributes these to ignorance and erroneous use of God's laws of life. Unity proclaims the divinity of Jesus, but goes further and assures that you, too, are a child of God and therefore divine in nature. Jesus expressed His divine potential and sought to show us how to express ours, as well. The direction then is to expand the understanding of one's innate divinity and through living the life demonstrated and taught by Jesus. Unity explains the mind as your connecting link with God or Divine Mind, and shows how the action of your mind affects your body and circumstances. Much emphasis is placed on the effective power that your thoughts, feelings, words, and acts have upon your life. Unity relates its teachings to daily needs, affirming that for every need there is God's perfect answer. Our primary textbook is The Bible, and Unity relates its lessons to your life and everyday experiences. We study and read contemporary spiritual writings frequently. Unity sees prayer and meditation, not as a technique for changing God, but for expanding and transforming our mind, and thus changing us. Unity has no creed, dogma, or ritual requirements. Unity chooses to believe that there is good in every religion. Different religions are like spokes on a wheel with the hub being God. They may be set apart by variances of beliefs and approaches, but they are all seeking the one God as the hub of all life. Consequently, Unity does not deny anyone the right to have their own beliefs. Unity sees worship as serving God by uplifting and glorifying God's spirit in all people in positive, joyous ways. It seeks not to emphasize one's sins of the past, but instead gives attention to the good that exists in every person and what can be done with the now to transform one's self and life. Unity's main concern is not so much a future life, but with teaching people how to live fully in the present, seeing the good in all things. Unity also believes in eternal life and views the present moment as part of eternal life. Unity does not impose any financial burdens or pressure on people. It believes the desire for giving should be initiated from within the giver to reap the joys of sharing. Consequently, all support is by free will offerings. Unity is nondenominational and welcomes, in dignity and love, people of all races, colors, religious and social backgrounds, and economic levels. Because of similarity in names, Unity has on occasion been confused with other organizations. However, there is no connection between Unity and Unitarianism or the Unification Church. At Unity everyone is recognized as a spiritual being, awakening to the Truth that makes them free. People are given the tools that enable them to construct more joyous, fulfilling and meaningful lives in partnership with God. In summary, Unity emphasizes the divine potential within every child of God and teaches that through a practical understanding and application of what Jesus taught, every person can realize and express his or her divine potential for a happier, fuller and more successful life.
Title: Secretary
               Company: Unity
Job Details
               Unity is a worldwide organization more than a century old. We are Christian yet accepting and honoring of all the world's religions. Unity was founded in the early 1900s by Charles and Myrtle Fillmore. Unity is based on prayer and healing. Mr. and Mrs. Fillmore both demonstrated the power of prayer in healing their bodies, Myrtle of Tuberculosis, and Charles of a withered leg. Unity is a positive approach to life, seeking to accept the inherent good in people and all of life. Unity proclaims and lives diversity. We are blessed by people of many ages, races, physical abilities, sexual orientation and even creeds! A healthy diversity of opinions also exists. Unity stresses that God is not a physical man in the sky, for that limits our understanding. God is Spirit, everywhere present, the one and only Spirit behind, in and through all things, visible and invisible. Unity denies the existence of any power or presence opposed to God. It sees that there are evil appearances and suffering in the world, but attributes these to ignorance and erroneous use of God's laws of life. Unity proclaims the divinity of Jesus, but goes further and assures that you, too, are a child of God and therefore divine in nature. Jesus expressed His divine potential and sought to show us how to express ours, as well. The direction then is to expand the understanding of one's innate divinity and through living the life demonstrated and taught by Jesus. Unity explains the mind as your connecting link with God or Divine Mind, and shows how the action of your mind affects your body and circumstances.
