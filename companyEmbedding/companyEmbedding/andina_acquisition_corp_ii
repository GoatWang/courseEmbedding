Andina Acquisition Corporation II (AAC II) is a U.S. publicly traded company (NASDAQ: ANDAU). In November 2015, we raised $40 million in equity through the sale of 4.0 million units for the purpose of making a minority investment in a private company.
We aim to find and invest in a fast-growing private company in the
                        Andean region and help it unlock unrealized growth potential via a listing on the NASDAQ. For the target company, a NASDAQ listing will open up broad new sources of capital at a reduced cost, and can facilitate geographic expansion and consolidation strategies.
AAC II seeks to repeat the successful business combination between
                        Andina Acquisition Corporation I (AAC I) and Tecnoglass Inc, which was executed in 2013. (NASDAQ: TGLS). As a public entity, Tecnoglass has outperformed its initial growth objectives and was the best performing SPAC in the world in the 2010-2015 period.

Target
Andina Acquisition Corporation II is a Special Purpose Acquisition Company SPAC. We raised $40 million in equity in November 2015 via an initial public offering (“IPO”) to invest and enter into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or similar business combination with a target company chosen by the management team.
                            







Ideal Target Company

                            Due to the public nature of our investment approach, we are seeking out companies in the region that will maximize value to shareholders. Key criteria for selection include:
                        



Double-digit revenue growth over the last 3 years and robust projections for long-term growth



EBITDA greater than $20 million



Equity value size between US $100-$300 million



International presence, or strong interest in international expansion




Benefits

                            For private companies in the region, a merger with Andina Acquisition Corporation II can deliver a range of benefits:
                        


Access to new sources of capital and public currency (listed stock) to fund expansion and acquisitions


Exposure to public investor community via a NASDAQ listing


Potential for company value appreciation due to public market valuation metrics


Original shareholders retain majority ownership and control of their company


Enhanced liquidity for company and partners


International visibility and recognition







Portfolio

Andina Acquisition Corporation II (AAC II) is the second operation of this management team. In March 2012, we raised USD42mn from the sale of 4.2 million units under Andina Acquisition Corporation I (AAC I) and signed a definitive agreement to merge with Tecnoglass (TGLS) in August 2013. The business combination was valued at approximately $313million on a pro forma fully diluted basis (9X 2013E adjusted EBITDA).
 The merger with Tecnoglass has been highly successful both for investors (see TGLS stock price) as well as for the company. In specific, benefits to the company have included:

US public listing increased ten times TGLS US performance bonding capacity
LTM adjusted EBITDA jumped from USD27m as of June 2013 to USD52m in June 2015
US revenues rose from c30% of total revenues in fiscal year 2012 to c60% by June 2015

(1) Approximately $165,000 of the offering expenses, including the SEC
    registration fee, the FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the
    Nasdaq listing fee and a portion of the legal and audit fees, have been paid
    from the funds we borrowed from B. Luke Weil described below. These funds
    will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us. If we
    determine not to proceed with the offering, such amounts would not be
    repaid.

(2) No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of the
    private rights.

(3) The funds held in the trust account will be used to acquire a target
    business, to pay holders who wish to convert or sell their shares for a
    portion of the funds held in the trust account and potentially to pay our
    expenses relating thereto, including a fee payable to EarlyBirdCapital equal
    to 4.0% of the gross proceeds raised in this offering upon consummation of
    our initial business combination for assisting us in connection with our
    initial business combination. Our expenses relating to the acquisition of a
    target business would either come from the funds held in the trust account
    or additional funds otherwise available to us outside of the trust account,
    including cash held by the target business. Any remaining funds will be
    disbursed to the combined company and be used as working capital to finance
    the operations of the target business.

(4) The amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at $750,000
    even if the over-allotment is exercised. In addition, interest income
    earned on the amounts held in the trust account (after payment of taxes owed
    on such interest income) will be available to us to pay for our working
    capital requirements. We estimate the interest earned on the trust account
    will be approximately $35,525 over a 21-month period assuming an interest
    rate of approximately 0.05% per year.

(5) These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these
    items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we may
    incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in
    connection with negotiating and structuring our initial business combination
    based upon the level of complexity of that business combination. We do not
    anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific
    category of expenses, would be deducted from our excess working capital.

Our initial shareholders and EarlyBirdCapital have agreed that they and their
respective designees will purchase an aggregate of 310,000 private units at a
price of $10.00 per unit ($3,100,000 in the aggregate) in a private placement
that will occur simultaneously with the closing of this offering. They have
further agreed that if the over-allotment option is exercised by the
underwriters, they will purchase from us at a price of $10.00 per unit an
additional number of private units (up to a maximum of 28,500 private units) pro
rata with the amount of the over-allotment option exercised so that at least
$10.15 per share sold to the public in this offering is held in trust regardless
of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full or part. All of the
proceeds we receive from these purchases will be placed in the trust account
described below.

$40,600,000, or $46,690,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private rights will be
placed in an account at UBS Financial Services in the United States, maintained
by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee.
Pursuant to the investment management trust agreement that will govern the
investment of such funds, the trustee, upon our written instructions, will
direct UBS Financial Services to invest the funds as set forth in such written
instructions and to custody the funds while invested and until otherwise
instructed in accordance with the investment management trust agreement. The
funds held in trust will be invested only in United States government treasury
bills, bonds or notes having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market
funds meeting the applicable conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 and that invest solely in United States
government treasuries, so that we are not deemed to be an investment company
under the Investment Company Act. Except with respect to (i) interest earned on
the funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our income
or other tax obligations and (ii) any remaining interest earned on the funds
held in the trust account that may be released to us for our working capital
requirements, the proceeds will not be released from the trust account until the
earlier of the completion of a business combination or our liquidation. The
proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay the
sellers of a target business with which we complete a business combination. Any
amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target business may be
used to finance operations of the target business.

Other than the payment of consulting fees to our officers, directors,
shareholders or their affiliates for assisting us in consummating our initial
business combination in an amount not to exceed an aggregate of $500,000, no
compensation of any kind (including finder’s, consulting or other similar fees)
will be paid to any of our existing officers, directors, shareholders, or any of
their affiliates, prior to, or for any services they render in order to
effectuate, the consummation of the business combination (regardless of the type
of transaction that it is). However, such individuals will receive reimbursement
for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on
our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses, performing business
due diligence on suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as
traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective
target businesses to examine their operations. Since the role of present
management after a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to
determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a
business combination.

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our working capital
requirements in searching for a business combination will be approximately
$750,000, of which $250,000 will be paid by us on closing of this offering to B.
Riley & Co. as described herein. In addition, the interest earned on the funds
held in the trust account (after payment of taxes owed on such interest income)
may be released to us to fund our working capital requirements in searching for
a business combination. We intend to use the excess working capital available
for miscellaneous expenses such as paying fees to consultants to assist us with
our search for a target business and for director and officer liability
insurance premiums, with the balance being held in reserve in the event due
diligence, legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating
business combinations exceed our estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our initial shareholders, officers and
directors in connection with activities on our behalf as described above. We
will also be entitled to have interest earned on the funds held in the trust
account released to us to pay any tax obligations that we may owe. We intend to
use the after-tax interest earned for miscellaneous expenses such as paying fees
to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business and for
director and officer liability insurance premiums, with the balance being held
in reserve in the event due diligence, legal, accounting and other expenses of
structuring and negotiating business combinations exceed our estimates, as well
as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our initial
shareholders, officers and directors in connection with activities on our behalf
as described below.

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account,
along with the available interest earned on the funds held in the trust account,
represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the event
that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of such
proceeds within the above described categories. If our estimate of the costs of
undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating our initial business
combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, or the amount of
interest available from the trust account is insufficient as a result of the
current low interest rate environment, we may be required to raise additional
capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from members of our management team, but such
members of our management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

We will likely use a substantial portion of the net proceeds of this offering,
including the funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business, to
pay holders who wish to convert or sell their shares to us for a portion of the
funds held in the trust account and to pay our expenses relating thereto,
including a fee payable to B. Riley & Co. of $250,000 upon consummation of this
offering to provide us with certain advisory services in connection with our
initial business combination and a fee payable to EarlyBirdCapital equal to 4.0%
of the gross proceeds raised in this offering (exclusive of any applicable
finders’ fees which might become payable) upon consummation of our initial
business combination for assisting us in connection with our initial business
combination, as described under the section titled “Underwriting — Business
Combination Marketing Agreement.” If the payment of our liabilities, including
the fee payable to EarlyBirdCapital, were to reduce the amount available to us
in trust necessary to pay all holders who wish to convert or sell their shares
to us for a portion of the funds held in the trust account, we would not be able
to consummate such transaction. To the extent that our share capital is used in
whole or in part as consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds
held in the trust account which are not used to consummate a business
combination, to pay holders who wish to convert their shares into a portion of
the funds held in the trust account or pay our expenses relating thereto (which
could include the up to $1,840,000 payable to EarlyBirdCapital described above
if the over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be disbursed to the
combined company and will, along with any other net proceeds not expended, be
used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business. Such
working capital funds could be used in a variety of ways including continuing or
expanding the target business’ operations, for strategic acquisitions and for
marketing, research and development of existing or new products.

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of liquidating our trust account from our remaining assets outside of
the trust account. If such funds are insufficient, B. Luke Weil has agreed to
advance us the funds necessary to complete such liquidation (currently
anticipated to be no more than $15,000) and has agreed not to seek repayment of
such expenses.

As of August 21, 2015, B. Luke Weil had advanced to us an aggregate of $30,000
to be used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the
line items above for a portion of the legal expenses. The advances are payable
without interest on the date on which we consummate our initial public offering.
The advances will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us
for payment of offering expenses. If we determine not to proceed with the
offering, such amounts would not be repaid.

In order to meet our working capital needs following the consummation of this
offering until completion of an initial business combination, our initial
shareholders, officers and directors or their affiliates may, but are not
obligated to, loan us funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever
amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion. The notes would either be
paid upon consummation of our initial business combination, without interest,
or, at the lender’s discretion, up to $500,000 of the notes may be converted
upon consummation of our business combination into additional private units at a
price of $10.00 per unit (which, for example, would result in the holders being
issued 57,142 ordinary shares if $500,000 of notes were so converted as the
rights included in the units would result in an additional 7,142 shares being
issued, as well as 50,000 warrants to purchase 25,000 shares). Our shareholders
have approved the issuance of the units and underlying securities upon
conversion of such notes, to the extent the holder wishes to so convert them at
the time of the consummation of our initial business combination. If we do not
complete our initial business combination, the loans would not be repaid.

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account to
the extent not previously released to us) only in the event of (i) our
liquidation if we have not completed a business combination within the required
time period or (ii) if that public shareholder converts such public shares or
sells them to us in a tender offer in each case in connection with a business
combination which we consummate or in connection with an amendment to our
memorandum and articles of association prior to the consummation of an initial
business combination. In no other circumstances will a public shareholder have
any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.


In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we may encounter
intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to
ours. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience
identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates.
Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources
than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted
with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there may be numerous
potential target businesses that we could acquire with the net proceeds of this
offering, our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses
may be limited by our available financial resources.

The following also may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses:

• our obligation to seek shareholder approval of a business combination or
  obtain the necessary financial information to be sent to shareholders in
  connection with such business combination may delay or prevent the completion
  ofa transaction;

• our obligation to convert public shares held by our public shareholders may
  reduce the resources available to us for a business combination;

• Nasdaq may require us to file a new listing application and meet its initial
  listing requirements to maintain the listing of our securities following a
  business combination;

• our outstanding rights, warrants and unit purchase options, and the potential
  future dilution they represent;

• our obligation to pay EarlyBirdCapital a fee of 4.0% of the gross proceeds of
  this offering upon consummation of our initial business combination;

• our obligation to either repay or issue private rights upon conversion of up
  to $500,000 of working capital loans that may be made to us by our initial
  shareholders, officers, directors or their affiliates;

• our obligation to register the resale of the insider shares, as well as the
  private rights (and underlying securities) and any securities issued to our
  initial shareholders, officers, directors or their affiliates upon conversion
  of working capital loans; and

• the impact on the target business’ assets as a result of unknown liabilities
  under the securities laws or otherwise depending on developments involving us
  prior to the consummation of a business combination.

Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully
negotiating a business combination. Our management believes, however, that our
status as a public entity and potential access to the United States public
equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privately-held entities
having a similar business objective as ours in acquiring a target business with
significant growth potential on favorable terms. Furthermore, the fact that we
will not be required to pay our underwriters any deferred compensation upon
consummation of an initial business combination may give us a competitive
advantage over other similarly structured blank check companies.

If we succeed in effecting a business combination, there will be, in all
likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target business. We
cannot assure you that, subsequent to a business combination, we will have the
resources or ability to compete effectively.


Company Description
We are a Cayman Islands company incorporated on July 1, 2015 as an exempted
company with limited liability. Exempted companies are Cayman Islands companies
wishing to conduct business outside the Cayman Islands and, as such, are
exempted from complying with certain provisions of the Companies Law.


 As an
exempted company, we have applied for and received a tax exemption undertaking
from the Cayman Islands government that, in accordance with section 6 of the Tax
Concessions Law (2011 Revision) of the Cayman Islands, for a period of 20 years
from the date of the undertaking, no law which is enacted in the Cayman Islands
imposing any tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations shall
apply to us or our operations and, in addition, that no tax to be levied on
profits, income, gains or appreciations or which is in the nature of estate duty
or inheritance tax shall be payable (i) on or in respect of our shares,
debentures or other obligations or (ii) by way of the withholding in whole or in
part of a payment of dividend or other distribution of income or capital by us
to our shareholders or a payment of principal or interest or other sums due
under a debenture or other obligation of us.

We were formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset
acquisition, share purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or similar
business combination with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to
as a “target business.” Our efforts to identify a prospective target business
will not be limited to a particular industry or geographic location, although we
intend to focus our search for target businesses in the Andean region of South
America and in Central America. We do not have any specific business combination
under consideration and we have not (nor has anyone on our behalf), directly or
indirectly, contacted any prospective target business or had any substantive
discussions, formal or otherwise, with respect to such a transaction.

The Andean region is comprised of Colombia, Chile, Peru, Ecuador and Venezuela.
Within this group, we are focusing on Colombia, Chile and Peru, which offer
growth rates that are above average in South America as well as stable political
and macro-economic frameworks. We intend to capitalize on opportunities
presented by high growth rates within these countries, as well as in neighboring
Panama and other countries in Central America.
