I first met Stephen Key in 2001.  Two months later, I used a few recommendations of his — shared over the customary gin tonic — to help a friend double overseas sales in less than two weeks in New Zealand and Australia.
How?  Licensing.  It can be a beautifully elegant model.
Stephen is somewhat famous in inventing circles for two reasons.  First, he consistently earns millions of dollars licensing his ideas to companies like Disney, Nestle, and Coca-Cola.  Second, he is fast.  It seldom takes him more than three weeks to go from idea to a signed deal.
He is not high-tech.  There are no multi-year product development cycles.  He specializes is creating simple products or improving upon existing products, often using nothing more than a single-sided drawing or photograph.  Coupled with refined cold-calling skills, Stephen meets with some of the most influential marketing executives in the world.  In this interview, we’ll explore how this advisor to American Inventor rents his ideas to Fortune 500 companies.
1- What exactly is licensing, and why is it a good option for people with ideas but little time or patience?

I think licensing is a bit of mystery to many people. It really doesn’t have to be.
Licensing is renting your idea to a manufacturer.  The manufacturer handles the marketing, manufacturing, distribution and basically everything else required to bring the product to market.
Usually quarterly (four times a year), the manufacturer pays you a royalty on every unit they sell. This royalty—generally a percentage of the total wholesale price—is your payment for bringing them a new product idea that they can sell to their customers.
It’s an attractive low-risk alternative to manufacturing products and taking them to market yourself.
Using licensing, I can spend my time coming up with new product ideas instead of worrying about balance sheets, cash flow, employees and all the other hassles of running a company.  I might pitch three ideas one month and no ideas for the next two months. You can have total flexibility with your work schedule.
Here’s one tip on how to make sure you get paid a certain amount four times a year.
Minimum Guarantees – So here’s why I use the term “renting” when describing licensing your idea to a manufacturer. It’s very important to make sure the manufacturer performs. You need a performance clause in the licensing contract. Without a performance clause, the manufacturer could just sit on the idea and do nothing with it. I’ve seen it happen.
Ensure you have a “Minimum Guarantee” clause in the contract. A minimum guarantee clause basically says the manufacturer needs to perform and sell a specified number of units every quarter or every year. Otherwise, you get your idea back and you can license your idea to another manufacturer.
It isn’t usually necessary to call in [enforce] the minimum guarantee clause. Most of the time you want to give the manufacturer a chance to perform. After all, you are partnering with them and they’ve spent big money on setting up their facilities to manufacture your new product.
Here’s another tip: Don’t front load the deal. I see many people with ideas doing this. They ask for large up front fees and make it to hard for the manufacturer to say yes to the deal. Instead ask only a small amount of money up front and scale up the minimum guarantees each quarter.
An example of minimum guarantees:
100,000 units quarter one
200,000 units quarter two
300,000 units quarter three
Let’s say the manufacturer sells 110,000 units quarter one. You would get paid a royalty on each of the 110,000 units sold.
Then let’s say the manufacturer only sells 190,000 units quarter two. The manufacturer can choose to pay you the royalty for the minimum 200,000 units they guaranteed you they would sell and they would retain the rights to manufacture your idea.
You should be OK with these “Minimum Guarantee” numbers since you set them up when you negotiated the contract. Set up numbers you think the manufacture can meet and that you’ll be OK with if the manufacture just meets the agreed upon “Minimum Guarantee”.
Of course you would prefer to earn royalties on 600,000 units every quarter, but you know you are guaranteed at least a certain “Minimum Guarantee” every quarter. This makes it nice when budgeting to buy that new sports car you’ve had your eye on.
2- I’ve heard you say that the most important thing you can do when licensing an idea is to spend as little time and money on the project before you get feedback from a manufacturer. Why?
Yes, that’s true. Unfortunately, it’s the exact opposite of what most people do. Most people go out and spend $3k to $20k or more on a patent and a few grand or more on a prototype first.
Time is the enemy in this process.
I’ve talked to inventors who have been contemplating or working on ideas for years. That’s not me. When I have an idea, it only takes me three days to three weeks to find out if the idea has legs.
On average, I recommend that my students take no longer than three weeks to three months before they make the decision to keep working on the project or dump the idea and move onto the next one.
Spend very little time or money on a project before you get feedback from manufacturers. The reason for this is simple: You’re not going to hit every idea out of the ballpark. Sometimes the benefits of the idea just aren’t intriguing enough. Maybe the idea has some manufacturing problems. Maybe the idea has been tried before and you didn’t find it with your research. There can be many reasons why manufacturers decide not to move forward with an idea.
You need to call a handful of potential manufacturers that might sell your idea. It takes very little time and next to no money to make the calls, and it’s the only way you’ll get the critical early-stage feedback.
File a provisional patent application ($100), create your sell sheet ($0-$80) and start making phone calls as soon as possible. That’s totally the opposite of what most people do. Most people dream or plan and research the idea to death.
The reality is that you will never be as knowledgeable about a particular industry as a manufacturer that been in the business for thirty years. They’ve seen everything imaginable in their product area. Their opinion is the only one that matters.  Get your idea in front of them as soon as possible and get the feedback you need to pursue it or kill it.
Here’s a summary of my solution to the patent and prototype hang ups many people seem to have.
PATENTS:
PROBLEM (What most people do):
The majority of people I talk to think the first thing they need to do is go out and spend money to have an expensive patent filled by a patent attorney. Here’s why that’s wrong: Many times you’re going to get complaints from manufacturers that your idea needs to be fixed in one way or another. No problem. You’re creative and they aren’t. Go back to the drawing board and fix the problems the manufacturer presented.
The only problem is that if you’ve wasted $3k to $20k on a patent, now your going to need to file another patent covering the new features of your product. Another $3-20k? I don’t think so. There is a better way.
SOLUTION (My method for you):
Instead, spend $100 on a Provisional Patent Application (PPA). A PPA gives you one year to fish of the end of the pier to see if anyone is interested in your idea.
A PPA also allows you to say “patent pending.” It’s a huge benefit to the small guy!  If you come up with a new version of your invention, just file another PPA with the additional features. With my approach, you should be able to get a “go” or “no go” in three weeks to three months.
Make sure to put another one to five months aside for negotiations and you’ll still have many months left on your twelve month PPA.
Then when you license your idea to a manufacturer, you’ll put in the contract that the manufacturer is responsible for paying your attorney to upgrade your PPA to a full patent and put it in your name!  This is how I get multiple patents, in my name, paid for by manufacturers.
PROTOTYPES
PROBLEM (What most people do):
People think you need to have a polished and perfect prototype in order to sell an idea. I have sold many ideas with very simple prototypes and many without prototypes at all .
What people don’t understand is that you are not selling your prototype or your patent. I’ll say that again. You’re not selling your prototype or patent. You are selling the benefits of your idea.
SOLUTION (My method for you):
Create a sell sheet. What the heck is a “sell sheet”? It’s a regular 8 ½” x 11” piece of paper. It’s like an ad for your idea. It has the big benefit of your product in one sentence at the top, maybe a few sub benefits or features in bullets below and a picture or drawing of your idea. “Oh, but I have to build a prototype,” many will say. No, you don’t.
You don’t need a prototype until you get some interest. If you don’t get any interest, you haven’t wasted time on a prototype.
Your sell sheet should be like a billboard on the freeway. People should be able to glance at it for a few seconds and understand the benefit of buying your invention. They don’t need to understand every feature or hear you make clichéd statements like, “if we only sell this to 1% of all households in the country, this new idea will make millions”.
My one line benefit statement for one of my biggest ideas was, “I have a new label innovation that ads 75% more space to your container.”  That’s it. I didn’t need to explain how when I called on the phone, they just wanted to know more.
Benefits, benefits. That’s what you are selling. Not your patent or prototype.

Early life[edit]
Ferriss grew up in East Hampton, New York and graduated from St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire. He received a degree in East Asian Studies from Princeton University in 2000.[15] After graduation, Ferriss worked in sales at a data storage company.[16] Ferriss began building his own Internet business, BrainQUICKEN, while still employed at the company.[16]
Career[edit]
BrainQUICKEN[edit]
In 2001, Ferriss founded BrainQUICKEN, an online nutritional supplements company which made a product that was marketed as both BodyQuick and Brain Quicken.[17] It was claimed that this product would dramatically increase short term memory and reaction speed, taking effect within 60 minutes.[18] In 2010, he sold the company to a London-based private equity firm.[19] It was the experiences Ferriss had running BrainQUICKEN that led him to write The 4-Hour Workweek.[3]
Television[edit]
In December 2008, Ferriss had a pilot on the History Channel called Trial by Fire, where he had one week to attempt to learn a skill normally learned over the course of many years. In the pilot episode he practiced yabusame, the Japanese art of horseback archery.[20] In December 2013, his television series The Tim Ferriss Experiment debuted on HLN. Although there were 13 episodes shot, only a portion of those were shown on television.[21] The show was released in its entirety on iTunes.[22]
Publishing[edit]
In November 2013, Ferriss began an audiobook publishing venture, Tim Ferriss Publishing.[23] The first book published was Vagabonding by Rolf Potts.[23] Other books include The Obstacle Is The Way by Ryan Holiday, Daily Rituals by Mason Currey, and What I Learned Losing A Million Dollars by Jim Paul and Brendan Moynihan.[24]
Investor and advisor[edit]
Ferriss is an angel investor and advisor to startups.[25] He has invested or advised in startups such as StumbleUpon, Posterous, Evernote, DailyBurn, Shopify, Reputation.com, Trippy, and TaskRabbit.[26] He is a pre-seed money advisor to Uber, a company co-founded by Garrett Camp, the founder of StumbleUpon, which Ferriss also advises.[27][28] In September 2013, Ferriss raised $250,000 in under an hour to invest in Shyp by forming a syndicate on AngelList.[29] Ferriss ended up raising over $500,000 through his backers and Shyp raised a total of $2.1 million.[30] The New York Times listed Ferriss among their "Notable Angel Investors" while CNN said he was "one of the planet's leading angel investors in technology."[31][32]
Author[edit]
Ferriss is the author of four books, The 4-Hour Workweek, The 4-Hour Body, The 4-Hour Chef, and Tools of Titans; the first two were No. 1 New York Times bestsellers and the third was a No. 1 Wall Street Journal bestseller.[4][9][33]
The 4-Hour Workweek[edit]
Main article: The 4-Hour Workweek
Ferriss developed the ideas present in The 4-Hour Workweek while working 14-hour days at BrainQUICKEN.[3][34]
The 4-Hour Workweek was rejected by 25 publishers.[35] In 2007, Random House, the 26th publisher, released the book through its Crown imprint.[36] Before release, Ferriss was an unknown.[37] He marketed the book heavily through bloggers with whom he created personal relationships.[37][37][38][39] The 4-Hour Workweek would reach No. 1 on the New York Times bestseller list, No. 1 on the Wall Street Journal bestseller list, and No. 1 on the BusinessWeek bestseller list.[40] It has currently sold over 1,350,000 copies and has spent nearly 4 years on the New York Times bestseller list.[4][5][41][42]
The book received both positive and negative reviews. Leslie Garner of The Telegraph noted that, "With a punchy writing style and a higher literacy level than most flash-in-the-pan gurus, Ferriss has struck a chord with his critique of workers's slavish devotion to corporations... Ferriss' book skillfully compartmentalises, then pathologises, workers's unhealthy relationships with office life."[43] Dylan Tweney of Wired wrote, "Nearly every idea taken to extreme. No sense of work being anything more than a paycheck."[44]
In 2009, The 4-Hour Workweek, Expanded and Updated was released by Random House and included multiple case studies authored by people who have utilized Ferriss's methods.[45]
The 4-Hour Body[edit]
Main article: The 4-Hour Body
In December 2010, Ferriss's second book, The 4-Hour Body: An Uncommon Guide to Rapid Fat-Loss, Incredible Sex, and Becoming Superhuman, was published by Crown.[46] The book covers more than 50 topics, including rapid fat loss, increasing strength, boosting endurance, and polyphasic sleep.[47] Ferriss also introduces his version of the Slow-Carb Diet, which involves the elimination of starches and anything sweet (including fruit and all artificial sweeteners) and a strong preference for lean protein, legumes, and vegetables.[48]
For the book, Ferriss interviewed more than 200 experts over a three-year period. The experts ranged from doctors to athletes to black-market drug salesmen.[49] He said that he had recorded every workout he had done since the age of 18, and from 2004 (three years before his first book was published) he had tracked a variety of blood chemistry measurements, including insulin levels, hemoglobin A1c, and free testosterone.[46] In the book, Ferriss wrote about using anabolic steroids, specifically "a number of low-dose therapies, including testosterone cypionate," under medical supervision following shoulder surgery, as well as using "stacks" consisting of testosterone enanthate, Sustanon 250, HGH, Deca-Durabolin, Cytomel, and other unnamed ingredients while training.[50]
The 4-Hour Body debuted at No. 1 on The New York Times Best Seller list.[9] It peaked at No. 4 on both the Wall Street Journal and USA Today's lists, and was one of Amazon.com's top 5 bestselling books for December 2010 and January 2011.[51][52][53] As part of the press for the book, Ferriss appeared as a guest on The Dr. Oz Show and ABC's The View.[54][55]
The 4-Hour Chef[edit]
Main article: The 4-Hour Chef
Ferriss's third book, The 4-Hour Chef: The Simple Path to Cooking Like a Pro, Learning Anything, and Living the Good Life was released by Amazon Publishing in November 2012.[56]The 4-Hour Chef contains practical cooking and recipe tips and uses the skill of cooking to explain his methods for accelerated learning, which he calls "meta-learning".[57][57][58]
The book reached No. 1 on the Wall Street Journal bestseller list in its first week of issue.[11] However, many brick and mortar bookstores including independents and Barnes & Noble chose to not stock the book due to their objections to the business practices of Amazon Publishing.[59] This required Ferriss to make arrangements with non-conventional partners, including BitTorrent, Panera Bread, and TaskRabbit in order to distribute the book.[60][61][62] In particular, Ferriss teamed up with BitTorrent to distribute an exclusive bundle of 4-Hour Chef content including excerpts from the book, photos, interviews and unpublished content,[63] which was downloaded over 300,000 times the first week after release.[64][65] The audiobook featured guest narration by Neil Gaiman.[61][66][67][68][69][70]
Tools of Titans[edit]
Ferriss' fourth book Tools of Titans was released on December 6, 2016 by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.[71] The book's content consists of tactics and routines from some of the most popular guests on The Tim Ferriss Show podcast.[72]
Tools of Titans debuted at #1 on the New York Times Bestseller list.[73][74] The book was the first podcast-based book to debut on the New York Times list.[75]
The Tim Ferriss Show[edit]
Ferriss has been called the "Oprah of Audio" due to the influence and reach of his podcast "The Tim Ferriss Show" which as of 2016 had over 80 million downloads.[71][76] It covers topics ranging from personal and character development, to exercise routines, acting, venture capital and metaphysics.[77] The show was voted “Best Podcast Episode of 2015” by users of Product Hunt in their "Golden Kitty Awards."[78]
Influence[edit]
The New Yorker described Ferriss as this generation's self-help guru, comparing Ferriss and his books to authors of similar influence of previous generations—Napoleon Hill, Norman Vincent Peale, Stephen Covey, and Spencer Johnson.[79] Wired called Ferriss “The Superman of Silicon Valley”.[80] The New York Times said Ferriss was "somewhere between [retired General Electric chairman and CEO] Jack Welch and a Buddhist monk."[16] In 2011, Newsweek declared Ferriss "The World's Best Guinea Pig".[81]
He has been named among Newsweek's Digital Power Index 100 as the seventh most powerful online personality, Fortune's "40 Under 40", one of Fast Company's "Most Innovative Business People of 2007", and a Henry Crown Fellow by the Aspen Institute.[82][83][84][85]
Both The 4-Hour Body and The 4-Hour Workweek are in the "10 Most Highlighted Books of All Time" on Amazon Kindle.[86][87]
In 2008, he was named Wired's "Greatest Self-Promoter of All Time."[88]
"The Tim Ferriss Effect"[edit]
In 2012, author Michael Ellsberg coined the phrase "The Tim Ferriss Effect" in a Forbes profile.[89] The phrase was used to describe the influence a blog post on Ferriss' site had on the sales of Ellsberg's book.[89][90] Ellsberg found that his post on Ferriss' blog sold more books than a piece in The New York Times and a three-minute segment on CNN.[89] Ryan Holiday, who had previously been hired by Ferriss to assist with the promotion of The 4-Hour Body and The 4-Hour Chef,[91] said this effect helped to sell 30,000 copies of his own book in the weeks following its release.[92] The clothing brand Mizzen+Main wrote about the effect on their clothing sales, stating that a mention on the podcast boosted exposure and sales for the brand more than a profile in The New York Times, an announcement in The Wall Street Journal, or a full page ad in Esquire.[93]
Philanthropy[edit]
Ferriss is a charity advocate and a member of the National Advisory Council of the public school nonprofit DonorsChoose.[94][95] His projects and donations have raised more than $250,000 for underfunded public school teachers and classroom projects, and his campaigns, such as dedicating his birthday to raising funds and heading LitLiberation to increase literacy worldwide, have impacted more than 60,000 students.[96][97][98][99] In March 2016, Ferriss flash funded 145 school projects posted on DonorsChoose.org in coordination with Stephen Colbert.[100][101]
In October 2014, BUILD Boston, a not-for-profit organization that uses entrepreneurship to equip Boston youth for high school and college success, honored Ferriss with the annual BUILDer Award for Innovation and Entrepreneurship for his work in education reform.[102][103]
Ferriss is also on the advisory board of the non-profit QuestBridge, along with LinkedIn Founder Reid Hoffman, David Sze, and others.[104] QuestBridge was created in 2003 to connect disadvantaged students with elite colleges and helps place over 2,000 students per year.[104]
Psychedelic research[edit]
Ferriss has raised funds for psychedelic studies at institutions such as Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.[105] In 2016, Ferriss donated at least $100,000 to research psychedelic drugs for the treatment of major depression.[105]
Personal life[edit]
Ferriss lives in San Francisco, California.[106] He holds a Guinness World Record in Argentine tango.[107]
Ferriss has stated that prior to his writing career he won in the 165 lb. weight class at the 1999 USAWKF national Sanshou (Chinese kickboxing) championship through a process of shoving opponents out of the ring and by dramatically dehydrating himself before weigh in, and then rehydrating before the fight in order to compete several classes below his actual weight – a practice known as weight cutting.[108][108][109]

Early life[edit]
Ferriss grew up in East Hampton, New York and graduated from St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire. He received a degree in East Asian Studies from Princeton University in 2000.[15] After graduation, Ferriss worked in sales at a data storage company.[16] Ferriss began building his own Internet business, BrainQUICKEN, while still employed at the company.[16]
Career[edit]
BrainQUICKEN[edit]
In 2001, Ferriss founded BrainQUICKEN, an online nutritional supplements company which made a product that was marketed as both BodyQuick and Brain Quicken.[17] It was claimed that this product would dramatically increase short term memory and reaction speed, taking effect within 60 minutes.[18] In 2010, he sold the company to a London-based private equity firm.[19] It was the experiences Ferriss had running BrainQUICKEN that led him to write The 4-Hour Workweek.[3]
Television[edit]
In December 2008, Ferriss had a pilot on the History Channel called Trial by Fire, where he had one week to attempt to learn a skill normally learned over the course of many years. In the pilot episode he practiced yabusame, the Japanese art of horseback archery.[20] In December 2013, his television series The Tim Ferriss Experiment debuted on HLN. Although there were 13 episodes shot, only a portion of those were shown on television.[21] The show was released in its entirety on iTunes.[22]
Publishing[edit]
In November 2013, Ferriss began an audiobook publishing venture, Tim Ferriss Publishing.[23] The first book published was Vagabonding by Rolf Potts.[23] Other books include The Obstacle Is The Way by Ryan Holiday, Daily Rituals by Mason Currey, and What I Learned Losing A Million Dollars by Jim Paul and Brendan Moynihan.[24]
Investor and advisor[edit]
Ferriss is an angel investor and advisor to startups.[25] He has invested or advised in startups such as StumbleUpon, Posterous, Evernote, DailyBurn, Shopify, Reputation.com, Trippy, and TaskRabbit.[26] He is a pre-seed money advisor to Uber, a company co-founded by Garrett Camp, the founder of StumbleUpon, which Ferriss also advises.[27][28] In September 2013, Ferriss raised $250,000 in under an hour to invest in Shyp by forming a syndicate on AngelList.[29] Ferriss ended up raising over $500,000 through his backers and Shyp raised a total of $2.1 million.[30] The New York Times listed Ferriss among their "Notable Angel Investors" while CNN said he was "one of the planet's leading angel investors in technology."[31][32]
Author[edit]
Ferriss is the author of four books, The 4-Hour Workweek, The 4-Hour Body, The 4-Hour Chef, and Tools of Titans; the first two were No. 1 New York Times bestsellers and the third was a No. 1 Wall Street Journal bestseller.[4][9][33]
The 4-Hour Workweek[edit]
Main article: The 4-Hour Workweek
Ferriss developed the ideas present in The 4-Hour Workweek while working 14-hour days at BrainQUICKEN.[3][34]
The 4-Hour Workweek was rejected by 25 publishers.[35] In 2007, Random House, the 26th publisher, released the book through its Crown imprint.[36] Before release, Ferriss was an unknown.[37] He marketed the book heavily through bloggers with whom he created personal relationships.[37][37][38][39] The 4-Hour Workweek would reach No. 1 on the New York Times bestseller list, No. 1 on the Wall Street Journal bestseller list, and No. 1 on the BusinessWeek bestseller list.[40] It has currently sold over 1,350,000 copies and has spent nearly 4 years on the New York Times bestseller list.[4][5][41][42]
The book received both positive and negative reviews. Leslie Garner of The Telegraph noted that, "With a punchy writing style and a higher literacy level than most flash-in-the-pan gurus, Ferriss has struck a chord with his critique of workers's slavish devotion to corporations... Ferriss' book skillfully compartmentalises, then pathologises, workers's unhealthy relationships with office life."[43] Dylan Tweney of Wired wrote, "Nearly every idea taken to extreme. No sense of work being anything more than a paycheck."[44]
In 2009, The 4-Hour Workweek, Expanded and Updated was released by Random House and included multiple case studies authored by people who have utilized Ferriss's methods.[45]
The 4-Hour Body[edit]
Main article: The 4-Hour Body
In December 2010, Ferriss's second book, The 4-Hour Body: An Uncommon Guide to Rapid Fat-Loss, Incredible Sex, and Becoming Superhuman, was published by Crown.[46] The book covers more than 50 topics, including rapid fat loss, increasing strength, boosting endurance, and polyphasic sleep.[47] Ferriss also introduces his version of the Slow-Carb Diet, which involves the elimination of starches and anything sweet (including fruit and all artificial sweeteners) and a strong preference for lean protein, legumes, and vegetables.[48]
For the book, Ferriss interviewed more than 200 experts over a three-year period. The experts ranged from doctors to athletes to black-market drug salesmen.[49] He said that he had recorded every workout he had done since the age of 18, and from 2004 (three years before his first book was published) he had tracked a variety of blood chemistry measurements, including insulin levels, hemoglobin A1c, and free testosterone.[46] In the book, Ferriss wrote about using anabolic steroids, specifically "a number of low-dose therapies, including testosterone cypionate," under medical supervision following shoulder surgery, as well as using "stacks" consisting of testosterone enanthate, Sustanon 250, HGH, Deca-Durabolin, Cytomel, and other unnamed ingredients while training.[50]
The 4-Hour Body debuted at No. 1 on The New York Times Best Seller list.[9] It peaked at No. 4 on both the Wall Street Journal and USA Today's lists, and was one of Amazon.com's top 5 bestselling books for December 2010 and January 2011.[51][52][53] As part of the press for the book, Ferriss appeared as a guest on The Dr. Oz Show and ABC's The View.[54][55]
The 4-Hour Chef[edit]
Main article: The 4-Hour Chef
Ferriss's third book, The 4-Hour Chef: The Simple Path to Cooking Like a Pro, Learning Anything, and Living the Good Life was released by Amazon Publishing in November 2012.[56]The 4-Hour Chef contains practical cooking and recipe tips and uses the skill of cooking to explain his methods for accelerated learning, which he calls "meta-learning".[57][57][58]
The book reached No. 1 on the Wall Street Journal bestseller list in its first week of issue.[11] However, many brick and mortar bookstores including independents and Barnes & Noble chose to not stock the book due to their objections to the business practices of Amazon Publishing.[59] This required Ferriss to make arrangements with non-conventional partners, including BitTorrent, Panera Bread, and TaskRabbit in order to distribute the book.[60][61][62] In particular, Ferriss teamed up with BitTorrent to distribute an exclusive bundle of 4-Hour Chef content including excerpts from the book, photos, interviews and unpublished content,[63] which was downloaded over 300,000 times the first week after release.[64][65] The audiobook featured guest narration by Neil Gaiman.[61][66][67][68][69][70]
Tools of Titans[edit]
Ferriss' fourth book Tools of Titans was released on December 6, 2016 by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.[71] The book's content consists of tactics and routines from some of the most popular guests on The Tim Ferriss Show podcast.[72]
Tools of Titans debuted at #1 on the New York Times Bestseller list.[73][74] The book was the first podcast-based book to debut on the New York Times list.[75]
The Tim Ferriss Show[edit]
Ferriss has been called the "Oprah of Audio" due to the influence and reach of his podcast "The Tim Ferriss Show" which as of 2016 had over 80 million downloads.[71][76] It covers topics ranging from personal and character development, to exercise routines, acting, venture capital and metaphysics.[77] The show was voted “Best Podcast Episode of 2015” by users of Product Hunt in their "Golden Kitty Awards."[78]
Influence[edit]
The New Yorker described Ferriss as this generation's self-help guru, comparing Ferriss and his books to authors of similar influence of previous generations—Napoleon Hill, Norman Vincent Peale, Stephen Covey, and Spencer Johnson.[79] Wired called Ferriss “The Superman of Silicon Valley”.[80] The New York Times said Ferriss was "somewhere between [retired General Electric chairman and CEO] Jack Welch and a Buddhist monk."[16] In 2011, Newsweek declared Ferriss "The World's Best Guinea Pig".[81]
He has been named among Newsweek's Digital Power Index 100 as the seventh most powerful online personality, Fortune's "40 Under 40", one of Fast Company's "Most Innovative Business People of 2007", and a Henry Crown Fellow by the Aspen Institute.[82][83][84][85]
Both The 4-Hour Body and The 4-Hour Workweek are in the "10 Most Highlighted Books of All Time" on Amazon Kindle.[86][87]
In 2008, he was named Wired's "Greatest Self-Promoter of All Time."[88]
"The Tim Ferriss Effect"[edit]
In 2012, author Michael Ellsberg coined the phrase "The Tim Ferriss Effect" in a Forbes profile.[89] The phrase was used to describe the influence a blog post on Ferriss' site had on the sales of Ellsberg's book.[89][90] Ellsberg found that his post on Ferriss' blog sold more books than a piece in The New York Times and a three-minute segment on CNN.[89] Ryan Holiday, who had previously been hired by Ferriss to assist with the promotion of The 4-Hour Body and The 4-Hour Chef,[91] said this effect helped to sell 30,000 copies of his own book in the weeks following its release.[92] The clothing brand Mizzen+Main wrote about the effect on their clothing sales, stating that a mention on the podcast boosted exposure and sales for the brand more than a profile in The New York Times, an announcement in The Wall Street Journal, or a full page ad in Esquire.[93]
Philanthropy[edit]
Ferriss is a charity advocate and a member of the National Advisory Council of the public school nonprofit DonorsChoose.[94][95] His projects and donations have raised more than $250,000 for underfunded public school teachers and classroom projects, and his campaigns, such as dedicating his birthday to raising funds and heading LitLiberation to increase literacy worldwide, have impacted more than 60,000 students.[96][97][98][99] In March 2016, Ferriss flash funded 145 school projects posted on DonorsChoose.org in coordination with Stephen Colbert.[100][101]
In October 2014, BUILD Boston, a not-for-profit organization that uses entrepreneurship to equip Boston youth for high school and college success, honored Ferriss with the annual BUILDer Award for Innovation and Entrepreneurship for his work in education reform.[102][103]
Ferriss is also on the advisory board of the non-profit QuestBridge, along with LinkedIn Founder Reid Hoffman, David Sze, and others.[104] QuestBridge was created in 2003 to connect disadvantaged students with elite colleges and helps place over 2,000 students per year.[104]
Psychedelic research[edit]
Ferriss has raised funds for psychedelic studies at institutions such as Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.[105] In 2016, Ferriss donated at least $100,000 to research psychedelic drugs for the treatment of major depression.[105]
Personal life[edit]
Ferriss lives in San Francisco, California.[106] He holds a Guinness World Record in Argentine tango.[107]
Ferriss has stated that prior to his writing career he won in the 165 lb. weight class at the 1999 USAWKF national Sanshou (Chinese kickboxing) championship through a process of shoving opponents out of the ring and by dramatically dehydrating himself before weigh in, and then rehydrating before the fight in order to compete several classes below his actual weight – a practice known as weight cutting.[108][108][109]

Early life[edit]
Ferriss grew up in East Hampton, New York and graduated from St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire. He received a degree in East Asian Studies from Princeton University in 2000.[15] After graduation, Ferriss worked in sales at a data storage company.[16] Ferriss began building his own Internet business, BrainQUICKEN, while still employed at the company.[16]
Career[edit]
BrainQUICKEN[edit]
In 2001, Ferriss founded BrainQUICKEN, an online nutritional supplements company which made a product that was marketed as both BodyQuick and Brain Quicken.[17] It was claimed that this product would dramatically increase short term memory and reaction speed, taking effect within 60 minutes.[18] In 2010, he sold the company to a London-based private equity firm.[19] It was the experiences Ferriss had running BrainQUICKEN that led him to write The 4-Hour Workweek.[3]
Television[edit]
In December 2008, Ferriss had a pilot on the History Channel called Trial by Fire, where he had one week to attempt to learn a skill normally learned over the course of many years. In the pilot episode he practiced yabusame, the Japanese art of horseback archery.[20] In December 2013, his television series The Tim Ferriss Experiment debuted on HLN. Although there were 13 episodes shot, only a portion of those were shown on television.[21] The show was released in its entirety on iTunes.[22]
Publishing[edit]
In November 2013, Ferriss began an audiobook publishing venture, Tim Ferriss Publishing.[23] The first book published was Vagabonding by Rolf Potts.[23] Other books include The Obstacle Is The Way by Ryan Holiday, Daily Rituals by Mason Currey, and What I Learned Losing A Million Dollars by Jim Paul and Brendan Moynihan.[24]
Investor and advisor[edit]
Ferriss is an angel investor and advisor to startups.[25] He has invested or advised in startups such as StumbleUpon, Posterous, Evernote, DailyBurn, Shopify, Reputation.com, Trippy, and TaskRabbit.[26] He is a pre-seed money advisor to Uber, a company co-founded by Garrett Camp, the founder of StumbleUpon, which Ferriss also advises.[27][28] In September 2013, Ferriss raised $250,000 in under an hour to invest in Shyp by forming a syndicate on AngelList.[29] Ferriss ended up raising over $500,000 through his backers and Shyp raised a total of $2.1 million.[30] The New York Times listed Ferriss among their "Notable Angel Investors" while CNN said he was "one of the planet's leading angel investors in technology."[31][32]
Author[edit]
Ferriss is the author of four books, The 4-Hour Workweek, The 4-Hour Body, The 4-Hour Chef, and Tools of Titans; the first two were No. 1 New York Times bestsellers and the third was a No. 1 Wall Street Journal bestseller.[4][9][33]
The 4-Hour Workweek[edit]
Main article: The 4-Hour Workweek
Ferriss developed the ideas present in The 4-Hour Workweek while working 14-hour days at BrainQUICKEN.[3][34]
The 4-Hour Workweek was rejected by 25 publishers.[35] In 2007, Random House, the 26th publisher, released the book through its Crown imprint.[36] Before release, Ferriss was an unknown.[37] He marketed the book heavily through bloggers with whom he created personal relationships.[37][37][38][39] The 4-Hour Workweek would reach No. 1 on the New York Times bestseller list, No. 1 on the Wall Street Journal bestseller list, and No. 1 on the BusinessWeek bestseller list.[40] It has currently sold over 1,350,000 copies and has spent nearly 4 years on the New York Times bestseller list.[4][5][41][42]
The book received both positive and negative reviews. Leslie Garner of The Telegraph noted that, "With a punchy writing style and a higher literacy level than most flash-in-the-pan gurus, Ferriss has struck a chord with his critique of workers's slavish devotion to corporations... Ferriss' book skillfully compartmentalises, then pathologises, workers's unhealthy relationships with office life."[43] Dylan Tweney of Wired wrote, "Nearly every idea taken to extreme. No sense of work being anything more than a paycheck."[44]
In 2009, The 4-Hour Workweek, Expanded and Updated was released by Random House and included multiple case studies authored by people who have utilized Ferriss's methods.[45]
The 4-Hour Body[edit]
Main article: The 4-Hour Body
In December 2010, Ferriss's second book, The 4-Hour Body: An Uncommon Guide to Rapid Fat-Loss, Incredible Sex, and Becoming Superhuman, was published by Crown.[46] The book covers more than 50 topics, including rapid fat loss, increasing strength, boosting endurance, and polyphasic sleep.[47] Ferriss also introduces his version of the Slow-Carb Diet, which involves the elimination of starches and anything sweet (including fruit and all artificial sweeteners) and a strong preference for lean protein, legumes, and vegetables.[48]
For the book, Ferriss interviewed more than 200 experts over a three-year period. The experts ranged from doctors to athletes to black-market drug salesmen.[49] He said that he had recorded every workout he had done since the age of 18, and from 2004 (three years before his first book was published) he had tracked a variety of blood chemistry measurements, including insulin levels, hemoglobin A1c, and free testosterone.[46] In the book, Ferriss wrote about using anabolic steroids, specifically "a number of low-dose therapies, including testosterone cypionate," under medical supervision following shoulder surgery, as well as using "stacks" consisting of testosterone enanthate, Sustanon 250, HGH, Deca-Durabolin, Cytomel, and other unnamed ingredients while training.[50]
The 4-Hour Body debuted at No. 1 on The New York Times Best Seller list.[9] It peaked at No. 4 on both the Wall Street Journal and USA Today's lists, and was one of Amazon.com's top 5 bestselling books for December 2010 and January 2011.[51][52][53] As part of the press for the book, Ferriss appeared as a guest on The Dr. Oz Show and ABC's The View.[54][55]
The 4-Hour Chef[edit]
Main article: The 4-Hour Chef
Ferriss's third book, The 4-Hour Chef: The Simple Path to Cooking Like a Pro, Learning Anything, and Living the Good Life was released by Amazon Publishing in November 2012.[56]The 4-Hour Chef contains practical cooking and recipe tips and uses the skill of cooking to explain his methods for accelerated learning, which he calls "meta-learning".[57][57][58]
The book reached No. 1 on the Wall Street Journal bestseller list in its first week of issue.[11] However, many brick and mortar bookstores including independents and Barnes & Noble chose to not stock the book due to their objections to the business practices of Amazon Publishing.[59] This required Ferriss to make arrangements with non-conventional partners, including BitTorrent, Panera Bread, and TaskRabbit in order to distribute the book.[60][61][62] In particular, Ferriss teamed up with BitTorrent to distribute an exclusive bundle of 4-Hour Chef content including excerpts from the book, photos, interviews and unpublished content,[63] which was downloaded over 300,000 times the first week after release.[64][65] The audiobook featured guest narration by Neil Gaiman.[61][66][67][68][69][70]
Tools of Titans[edit]
Ferriss' fourth book Tools of Titans was released on December 6, 2016 by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.[71] The book's content consists of tactics and routines from some of the most popular guests on The Tim Ferriss Show podcast.[72]
Tools of Titans debuted at #1 on the New York Times Bestseller list.[73][74] The book was the first podcast-based book to debut on the New York Times list.[75]
The Tim Ferriss Show[edit]
Ferriss has been called the "Oprah of Audio" due to the influence and reach of his podcast "The Tim Ferriss Show" which as of 2016 had over 80 million downloads.[71][76] It covers topics ranging from personal and character development, to exercise routines, acting, venture capital and metaphysics.[77] The show was voted “Best Podcast Episode of 2015” by users of Product Hunt in their "Golden Kitty Awards."[78]
Influence[edit]
The New Yorker described Ferriss as this generation's self-help guru, comparing Ferriss and his books to authors of similar influence of previous generations—Napoleon Hill, Norman Vincent Peale, Stephen Covey, and Spencer Johnson.[79] Wired called Ferriss “The Superman of Silicon Valley”.[80] The New York Times said Ferriss was "somewhere between [retired General Electric chairman and CEO] Jack Welch and a Buddhist monk."[16] In 2011, Newsweek declared Ferriss "The World's Best Guinea Pig".[81]
He has been named among Newsweek's Digital Power Index 100 as the seventh most powerful online personality, Fortune's "40 Under 40", one of Fast Company's "Most Innovative Business People of 2007", and a Henry Crown Fellow by the Aspen Institute.[82][83][84][85]
Both The 4-Hour Body and The 4-Hour Workweek are in the "10 Most Highlighted Books of All Time" on Amazon Kindle.[86][87]
In 2008, he was named Wired's "Greatest Self-Promoter of All Time."[88]
"The Tim Ferriss Effect"[edit]
In 2012, author Michael Ellsberg coined the phrase "The Tim Ferriss Effect" in a Forbes profile.[89] The phrase was used to describe the influence a blog post on Ferriss' site had on the sales of Ellsberg's book.[89][90] Ellsberg found that his post on Ferriss' blog sold more books than a piece in The New York Times and a three-minute segment on CNN.[89] Ryan Holiday, who had previously been hired by Ferriss to assist with the promotion of The 4-Hour Body and The 4-Hour Chef,[91] said this effect helped to sell 30,000 copies of his own book in the weeks following its release.[92] The clothing brand Mizzen+Main wrote about the effect on their clothing sales, stating that a mention on the podcast boosted exposure and sales for the brand more than a profile in The New York Times, an announcement in The Wall Street Journal, or a full page ad in Esquire.[93]
Philanthropy[edit]
Ferriss is a charity advocate and a member of the National Advisory Council of the public school nonprofit DonorsChoose.[94][95] His projects and donations have raised more than $250,000 for underfunded public school teachers and classroom projects, and his campaigns, such as dedicating his birthday to raising funds and heading LitLiberation to increase literacy worldwide, have impacted more than 60,000 students.[96][97][98][99] In March 2016, Ferriss flash funded 145 school projects posted on DonorsChoose.org in coordination with Stephen Colbert.[100][101]
In October 2014, BUILD Boston, a not-for-profit organization that uses entrepreneurship to equip Boston youth for high school and college success, honored Ferriss with the annual BUILDer Award for Innovation and Entrepreneurship for his work in education reform.[102][103]
Ferriss is also on the advisory board of the non-profit QuestBridge, along with LinkedIn Founder Reid Hoffman, David Sze, and others.[104] QuestBridge was created in 2003 to connect disadvantaged students with elite colleges and helps place over 2,000 students per year.[104]
Psychedelic research[edit]
Ferriss has raised funds for psychedelic studies at institutions such as Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.[105] In 2016, Ferriss donated at least $100,000 to research psychedelic drugs for the treatment of major depression.[105]
Personal life[edit]
Ferriss lives in San Francisco, California.[106] He holds a Guinness World Record in Argentine tango.[107]
Ferriss has stated that prior to his writing career he won in the 165 lb. weight class at the 1999 USAWKF national Sanshou (Chinese kickboxing) championship through a process of shoving opponents out of the ring and by dramatically dehydrating himself before weigh in, and then rehydrating before the fight in order to compete several classes below his actual weight – a practice known as weight cutting.[108][108][109]

Early life[edit]
Ferriss grew up in East Hampton, New York and graduated from St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire. He received a degree in East Asian Studies from Princeton University in 2000.[15] After graduation, Ferriss worked in sales at a data storage company.[16] Ferriss began building his own Internet business, BrainQUICKEN, while still employed at the company.[16]
Career[edit]
BrainQUICKEN[edit]
In 2001, Ferriss founded BrainQUICKEN, an online nutritional supplements company which made a product that was marketed as both BodyQuick and Brain Quicken.[17] It was claimed that this product would dramatically increase short term memory and reaction speed, taking effect within 60 minutes.[18] In 2010, he sold the company to a London-based private equity firm.[19] It was the experiences Ferriss had running BrainQUICKEN that led him to write The 4-Hour Workweek.[3]
Television[edit]
In December 2008, Ferriss had a pilot on the History Channel called Trial by Fire, where he had one week to attempt to learn a skill normally learned over the course of many years. In the pilot episode he practiced yabusame, the Japanese art of horseback archery.[20] In December 2013, his television series The Tim Ferriss Experiment debuted on HLN. Although there were 13 episodes shot, only a portion of those were shown on television.[21] The show was released in its entirety on iTunes.[22]
Publishing[edit]
In November 2013, Ferriss began an audiobook publishing venture, Tim Ferriss Publishing.[23] The first book published was Vagabonding by Rolf Potts.[23] Other books include The Obstacle Is The Way by Ryan Holiday, Daily Rituals by Mason Currey, and What I Learned Losing A Million Dollars by Jim Paul and Brendan Moynihan.[24]
Investor and advisor[edit]
Ferriss is an angel investor and advisor to startups.[25] He has invested or advised in startups such as StumbleUpon, Posterous, Evernote, DailyBurn, Shopify, Reputation.com, Trippy, and TaskRabbit.[26] He is a pre-seed money advisor to Uber, a company co-founded by Garrett Camp, the founder of StumbleUpon, which Ferriss also advises.[27][28] In September 2013, Ferriss raised $250,000 in under an hour to invest in Shyp by forming a syndicate on AngelList.[29] Ferriss ended up raising over $500,000 through his backers and Shyp raised a total of $2.1 million.[30] The New York Times listed Ferriss among their "Notable Angel Investors" while CNN said he was "one of the planet's leading angel investors in technology."[31][32]
Author[edit]
Ferriss is the author of four books, The 4-Hour Workweek, The 4-Hour Body, The 4-Hour Chef, and Tools of Titans; the first two were No. 1 New York Times bestsellers and the third was a No. 1 Wall Street Journal bestseller.[4][9][33]
The 4-Hour Workweek[edit]
Main article: The 4-Hour Workweek
Ferriss developed the ideas present in The 4-Hour Workweek while working 14-hour days at BrainQUICKEN.[3][34]
The 4-Hour Workweek was rejected by 25 publishers.[35] In 2007, Random House, the 26th publisher, released the book through its Crown imprint.[36] Before release, Ferriss was an unknown.[37] He marketed the book heavily through bloggers with whom he created personal relationships.[37][37][38][39] The 4-Hour Workweek would reach No. 1 on the New York Times bestseller list, No. 1 on the Wall Street Journal bestseller list, and No. 1 on the BusinessWeek bestseller list.[40] It has currently sold over 1,350,000 copies and has spent nearly 4 years on the New York Times bestseller list.[4][5][41][42]
The book received both positive and negative reviews. Leslie Garner of The Telegraph noted that, "With a punchy writing style and a higher literacy level than most flash-in-the-pan gurus, Ferriss has struck a chord with his critique of workers's slavish devotion to corporations... Ferriss' book skillfully compartmentalises, then pathologises, workers's unhealthy relationships with office life."[43] Dylan Tweney of Wired wrote, "Nearly every idea taken to extreme. No sense of work being anything more than a paycheck."[44]
In 2009, The 4-Hour Workweek, Expanded and Updated was released by Random House and included multiple case studies authored by people who have utilized Ferriss's methods.[45]
The 4-Hour Body[edit]
Main article: The 4-Hour Body
In December 2010, Ferriss's second book, The 4-Hour Body: An Uncommon Guide to Rapid Fat-Loss, Incredible Sex, and Becoming Superhuman, was published by Crown.[46] The book covers more than 50 topics, including rapid fat loss, increasing strength, boosting endurance, and polyphasic sleep.[47] Ferriss also introduces his version of the Slow-Carb Diet, which involves the elimination of starches and anything sweet (including fruit and all artificial sweeteners) and a strong preference for lean protein, legumes, and vegetables.[48]
For the book, Ferriss interviewed more than 200 experts over a three-year period. The experts ranged from doctors to athletes to black-market drug salesmen.[49] He said that he had recorded every workout he had done since the age of 18, and from 2004 (three years before his first book was published) he had tracked a variety of blood chemistry measurements, including insulin levels, hemoglobin A1c, and free testosterone.[46] In the book, Ferriss wrote about using anabolic steroids, specifically "a number of low-dose therapies, including testosterone cypionate," under medical supervision following shoulder surgery, as well as using "stacks" consisting of testosterone enanthate, Sustanon 250, HGH, Deca-Durabolin, Cytomel, and other unnamed ingredients while training.[50]
The 4-Hour Body debuted at No. 1 on The New York Times Best Seller list.[9] It peaked at No. 4 on both the Wall Street Journal and USA Today's lists, and was one of Amazon.com's top 5 bestselling books for December 2010 and January 2011.[51][52][53] As part of the press for the book, Ferriss appeared as a guest on The Dr. Oz Show and ABC's The View.[54][55]
The 4-Hour Chef[edit]
Main article: The 4-Hour Chef
Ferriss's third book, The 4-Hour Chef: The Simple Path to Cooking Like a Pro, Learning Anything, and Living the Good Life was released by Amazon Publishing in November 2012.[56]The 4-Hour Chef contains practical cooking and recipe tips and uses the skill of cooking to explain his methods for accelerated learning, which he calls "meta-learning".[57][57][58]
The book reached No. 1 on the Wall Street Journal bestseller list in its first week of issue.[11] However, many brick and mortar bookstores including independents and Barnes & Noble chose to not stock the book due to their objections to the business practices of Amazon Publishing.[59] This required Ferriss to make arrangements with non-conventional partners, including BitTorrent, Panera Bread, and TaskRabbit in order to distribute the book.[60][61][62] In particular, Ferriss teamed up with BitTorrent to distribute an exclusive bundle of 4-Hour Chef content including excerpts from the book, photos, interviews and unpublished content,[63] which was downloaded over 300,000 times the first week after release.[64][65] The audiobook featured guest narration by Neil Gaiman.[61][66][67][68][69][70]
Tools of Titans[edit]
Ferriss' fourth book Tools of Titans was released on December 6, 2016 by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.[71] The book's content consists of tactics and routines from some of the most popular guests on The Tim Ferriss Show podcast.[72]
Tools of Titans debuted at #1 on the New York Times Bestseller list.[73][74] The book was the first podcast-based book to debut on the New York Times list.[75]
The Tim Ferriss Show[edit]
Ferriss has been called the "Oprah of Audio" due to the influence and reach of his podcast "The Tim Ferriss Show" which as of 2016 had over 80 million downloads.[71][76] It covers topics ranging from personal and character development, to exercise routines, acting, venture capital and metaphysics.[77] The show was voted “Best Podcast Episode of 2015” by users of Product Hunt in their "Golden Kitty Awards."[78]
Influence[edit]
The New Yorker described Ferriss as this generation's self-help guru, comparing Ferriss and his books to authors of similar influence of previous generations—Napoleon Hill, Norman Vincent Peale, Stephen Covey, and Spencer Johnson.[79] Wired called Ferriss “The Superman of Silicon Valley”.[80] The New York Times said Ferriss was "somewhere between [retired General Electric chairman and CEO] Jack Welch and a Buddhist monk."[16] In 2011, Newsweek declared Ferriss "The World's Best Guinea Pig".[81]
He has been named among Newsweek's Digital Power Index 100 as the seventh most powerful online personality, Fortune's "40 Under 40", one of Fast Company's "Most Innovative Business People of 2007", and a Henry Crown Fellow by the Aspen Institute.[82][83][84][85]
Both The 4-Hour Body and The 4-Hour Workweek are in the "10 Most Highlighted Books of All Time" on Amazon Kindle.[86][87]
In 2008, he was named Wired's "Greatest Self-Promoter of All Time."[88]
"The Tim Ferriss Effect"[edit]
In 2012, author Michael Ellsberg coined the phrase "The Tim Ferriss Effect" in a Forbes profile.[89] The phrase was used to describe the influence a blog post on Ferriss' site had on the sales of Ellsberg's book.[89][90] Ellsberg found that his post on Ferriss' blog sold more books than a piece in The New York Times and a three-minute segment on CNN.[89] Ryan Holiday, who had previously been hired by Ferriss to assist with the promotion of The 4-Hour Body and The 4-Hour Chef,[91] said this effect helped to sell 30,000 copies of his own book in the weeks following its release.[92] The clothing brand Mizzen+Main wrote about the effect on their clothing sales, stating that a mention on the podcast boosted exposure and sales for the brand more than a profile in The New York Times, an announcement in The Wall Street Journal, or a full page ad in Esquire.[93]
Philanthropy[edit]
Ferriss is a charity advocate and a member of the National Advisory Council of the public school nonprofit DonorsChoose.[94][95] His projects and donations have raised more than $250,000 for underfunded public school teachers and classroom projects, and his campaigns, such as dedicating his birthday to raising funds and heading LitLiberation to increase literacy worldwide, have impacted more than 60,000 students.[96][97][98][99] In March 2016, Ferriss flash funded 145 school projects posted on DonorsChoose.org in coordination with Stephen Colbert.[100][101]
In October 2014, BUILD Boston, a not-for-profit organization that uses entrepreneurship to equip Boston youth for high school and college success, honored Ferriss with the annual BUILDer Award for Innovation and Entrepreneurship for his work in education reform.[102][103]
Ferriss is also on the advisory board of the non-profit QuestBridge, along with LinkedIn Founder Reid Hoffman, David Sze, and others.[104] QuestBridge was created in 2003 to connect disadvantaged students with elite colleges and helps place over 2,000 students per year.[104]
Psychedelic research[edit]
Ferriss has raised funds for psychedelic studies at institutions such as Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.[105] In 2016, Ferriss donated at least $100,000 to research psychedelic drugs for the treatment of major depression.[105]
Personal life[edit]
Ferriss lives in San Francisco, California.[106] He holds a Guinness World Record in Argentine tango.[107]
Ferriss has stated that prior to his writing career he won in the 165 lb. weight class at the 1999 USAWKF national Sanshou (Chinese kickboxing) championship through a process of shoving opponents out of the ring and by dramatically dehydrating himself before weigh in, and then rehydrating before the fight in order to compete several classes below his actual weight – a practice known as weight cutting.[108][108][109]

Early life[edit]
Ferriss grew up in East Hampton, New York and graduated from St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire. He received a degree in East Asian Studies from Princeton University in 2000.[15] After graduation, Ferriss worked in sales at a data storage company.[16] Ferriss began building his own Internet business, BrainQUICKEN, while still employed at the company.[16]
Career[edit]
BrainQUICKEN[edit]
In 2001, Ferriss founded BrainQUICKEN, an online nutritional supplements company which made a product that was marketed as both BodyQuick and Brain Quicken.[17] It was claimed that this product would dramatically increase short term memory and reaction speed, taking effect within 60 minutes.[18] In 2010, he sold the company to a London-based private equity firm.[19] It was the experiences Ferriss had running BrainQUICKEN that led him to write The 4-Hour Workweek.[3]
Television[edit]
In December 2008, Ferriss had a pilot on the History Channel called Trial by Fire, where he had one week to attempt to learn a skill normally learned over the course of many years. In the pilot episode he practiced yabusame, the Japanese art of horseback archery.[20] In December 2013, his television series The Tim Ferriss Experiment debuted on HLN. Although there were 13 episodes shot, only a portion of those were shown on television.[21] The show was released in its entirety on iTunes.[22]
Publishing[edit]
In November 2013, Ferriss began an audiobook publishing venture, Tim Ferriss Publishing.[23] The first book published was Vagabonding by Rolf Potts.[23] Other books include The Obstacle Is The Way by Ryan Holiday, Daily Rituals by Mason Currey, and What I Learned Losing A Million Dollars by Jim Paul and Brendan Moynihan.[24]
Investor and advisor[edit]
Ferriss is an angel investor and advisor to startups.[25] He has invested or advised in startups such as StumbleUpon, Posterous, Evernote, DailyBurn, Shopify, Reputation.com, Trippy, and TaskRabbit.[26] He is a pre-seed money advisor to Uber, a company co-founded by Garrett Camp, the founder of StumbleUpon, which Ferriss also advises.[27][28] In September 2013, Ferriss raised $250,000 in under an hour to invest in Shyp by forming a syndicate on AngelList.[29] Ferriss ended up raising over $500,000 through his backers and Shyp raised a total of $2.1 million.[30] The New York Times listed Ferriss among their "Notable Angel Investors" while CNN said he was "one of the planet's leading angel investors in technology."[31][32]
Author[edit]
Ferriss is the author of four books, The 4-Hour Workweek, The 4-Hour Body, The 4-Hour Chef, and Tools of Titans; the first two were No. 1 New York Times bestsellers and the third was a No. 1 Wall Street Journal bestseller.[4][9][33]
The 4-Hour Workweek[edit]
Main article: The 4-Hour Workweek
Ferriss developed the ideas present in The 4-Hour Workweek while working 14-hour days at BrainQUICKEN.[3][34]
The 4-Hour Workweek was rejected by 25 publishers.[35] In 2007, Random House, the 26th publisher, released the book through its Crown imprint.[36] Before release, Ferriss was an unknown.[37] He marketed the book heavily through bloggers with whom he created personal relationships.[37][37][38][39] The 4-Hour Workweek would reach No. 1 on the New York Times bestseller list, No. 1 on the Wall Street Journal bestseller list, and No. 1 on the BusinessWeek bestseller list.[40] It has currently sold over 1,350,000 copies and has spent nearly 4 years on the New York Times bestseller list.[4][5][41][42]
The book received both positive and negative reviews. Leslie Garner of The Telegraph noted that, "With a punchy writing style and a higher literacy level than most flash-in-the-pan gurus, Ferriss has struck a chord with his critique of workers's slavish devotion to corporations... Ferriss' book skillfully compartmentalises, then pathologises, workers's unhealthy relationships with office life."[43] Dylan Tweney of Wired wrote, "Nearly every idea taken to extreme. No sense of work being anything more than a paycheck."[44]
In 2009, The 4-Hour Workweek, Expanded and Updated was released by Random House and included multiple case studies authored by people who have utilized Ferriss's methods.[45]
The 4-Hour Body[edit]
Main article: The 4-Hour Body
In December 2010, Ferriss's second book, The 4-Hour Body: An Uncommon Guide to Rapid Fat-Loss, Incredible Sex, and Becoming Superhuman, was published by Crown.[46] The book covers more than 50 topics, including rapid fat loss, increasing strength, boosting endurance, and polyphasic sleep.[47] Ferriss also introduces his version of the Slow-Carb Diet, which involves the elimination of starches and anything sweet (including fruit and all artificial sweeteners) and a strong preference for lean protein, legumes, and vegetables.[48]
For the book, Ferriss interviewed more than 200 experts over a three-year period. The experts ranged from doctors to athletes to black-market drug salesmen.[49] He said that he had recorded every workout he had done since the age of 18, and from 2004 (three years before his first book was published) he had tracked a variety of blood chemistry measurements, including insulin levels, hemoglobin A1c, and free testosterone.[46] In the book, Ferriss wrote about using anabolic steroids, specifically "a number of low-dose therapies, including testosterone cypionate," under medical supervision following shoulder surgery, as well as using "stacks" consisting of testosterone enanthate, Sustanon 250, HGH, Deca-Durabolin, Cytomel, and other unnamed ingredients while training.[50]
The 4-Hour Body debuted at No. 1 on The New York Times Best Seller list.[9] It peaked at No. 4 on both the Wall Street Journal and USA Today's lists, and was one of Amazon.com's top 5 bestselling books for December 2010 and January 2011.[51][52][53] As part of the press for the book, Ferriss appeared as a guest on The Dr. Oz Show and ABC's The View.[54][55]
The 4-Hour Chef[edit]
Main article: The 4-Hour Chef
Ferriss's third book, The 4-Hour Chef: The Simple Path to Cooking Like a Pro, Learning Anything, and Living the Good Life was released by Amazon Publishing in November 2012.[56]The 4-Hour Chef contains practical cooking and recipe tips and uses the skill of cooking to explain his methods for accelerated learning, which he calls "meta-learning".[57][57][58]
The book reached No. 1 on the Wall Street Journal bestseller list in its first week of issue.[11] However, many brick and mortar bookstores including independents and Barnes & Noble chose to not stock the book due to their objections to the business practices of Amazon Publishing.[59] This required Ferriss to make arrangements with non-conventional partners, including BitTorrent, Panera Bread, and TaskRabbit in order to distribute the book.[60][61][62] In particular, Ferriss teamed up with BitTorrent to distribute an exclusive bundle of 4-Hour Chef content including excerpts from the book, photos, interviews and unpublished content,[63] which was downloaded over 300,000 times the first week after release.[64][65] The audiobook featured guest narration by Neil Gaiman.[61][66][67][68][69][70]
Tools of Titans[edit]
Ferriss' fourth book Tools of Titans was released on December 6, 2016 by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.[71] The book's content consists of tactics and routines from some of the most popular guests on The Tim Ferriss Show podcast.[72]
Tools of Titans debuted at #1 on the New York Times Bestseller list.[73][74] The book was the first podcast-based book to debut on the New York Times list.[75]
The Tim Ferriss Show[edit]
Ferriss has been called the "Oprah of Audio" due to the influence and reach of his podcast "The Tim Ferriss Show" which as of 2016 had over 80 million downloads.[71][76] It covers topics ranging from personal and character development, to exercise routines, acting, venture capital and metaphysics.[77] The show was voted “Best Podcast Episode of 2015” by users of Product Hunt in their "Golden Kitty Awards."[78]
Influence[edit]
The New Yorker described Ferriss as this generation's self-help guru, comparing Ferriss and his books to authors of similar influence of previous generations—Napoleon Hill, Norman Vincent Peale, Stephen Covey, and Spencer Johnson.[79] Wired called Ferriss “The Superman of Silicon Valley”.[80] The New York Times said Ferriss was "somewhere between [retired General Electric chairman and CEO] Jack Welch and a Buddhist monk."[16] In 2011, Newsweek declared Ferriss "The World's Best Guinea Pig".[81]
He has been named among Newsweek's Digital Power Index 100 as the seventh most powerful online personality, Fortune's "40 Under 40", one of Fast Company's "Most Innovative Business People of 2007", and a Henry Crown Fellow by the Aspen Institute.[82][83][84][85]
Both The 4-Hour Body and The 4-Hour Workweek are in the "10 Most Highlighted Books of All Time" on Amazon Kindle.[86][87]
In 2008, he was named Wired's "Greatest Self-Promoter of All Time."[88]
"The Tim Ferriss Effect"[edit]
In 2012, author Michael Ellsberg coined the phrase "The Tim Ferriss Effect" in a Forbes profile.[89] The phrase was used to describe the influence a blog post on Ferriss' site had on the sales of Ellsberg's book.[89][90] Ellsberg found that his post on Ferriss' blog sold more books than a piece in The New York Times and a three-minute segment on CNN.[89] Ryan Holiday, who had previously been hired by Ferriss to assist with the promotion of The 4-Hour Body and The 4-Hour Chef,[91] said this effect helped to sell 30,000 copies of his own book in the weeks following its release.[92] The clothing brand Mizzen+Main wrote about the effect on their clothing sales, stating that a mention on the podcast boosted exposure and sales for the brand more than a profile in The New York Times, an announcement in The Wall Street Journal, or a full page ad in Esquire.[93]
Philanthropy[edit]
Ferriss is a charity advocate and a member of the National Advisory Council of the public school nonprofit DonorsChoose.[94][95] His projects and donations have raised more than $250,000 for underfunded public school teachers and classroom projects, and his campaigns, such as dedicating his birthday to raising funds and heading LitLiberation to increase literacy worldwide, have impacted more than 60,000 students.[96][97][98][99] In March 2016, Ferriss flash funded 145 school projects posted on DonorsChoose.org in coordination with Stephen Colbert.[100][101]
In October 2014, BUILD Boston, a not-for-profit organization that uses entrepreneurship to equip Boston youth for high school and college success, honored Ferriss with the annual BUILDer Award for Innovation and Entrepreneurship for his work in education reform.[102][103]
Ferriss is also on the advisory board of the non-profit QuestBridge, along with LinkedIn Founder Reid Hoffman, David Sze, and others.[104] QuestBridge was created in 2003 to connect disadvantaged students with elite colleges and helps place over 2,000 students per year.[104]
Psychedelic research[edit]
Ferriss has raised funds for psychedelic studies at institutions such as Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.[105] In 2016, Ferriss donated at least $100,000 to research psychedelic drugs for the treatment of major depression.[105]
Personal life[edit]
Ferriss lives in San Francisco, California.[106] He holds a Guinness World Record in Argentine tango.[107]
Ferriss has stated that prior to his writing career he won in the 165 lb. weight class at the 1999 USAWKF national Sanshou (Chinese kickboxing) championship through a process of shoving opponents out of the ring and by dramatically dehydrating himself before weigh in, and then rehydrating before the fight in order to compete several classes below his actual weight – a practice known as weight cutting.[108][108][109]

Early life[edit]
Ferriss grew up in East Hampton, New York and graduated from St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire. He received a degree in East Asian Studies from Princeton University in 2000.[15] After graduation, Ferriss worked in sales at a data storage company.[16] Ferriss began building his own Internet business, BrainQUICKEN, while still employed at the company.[16]
Career[edit]
BrainQUICKEN[edit]
In 2001, Ferriss founded BrainQUICKEN, an online nutritional supplements company which made a product that was marketed as both BodyQuick and Brain Quicken.[17] It was claimed that this product would dramatically increase short term memory and reaction speed, taking effect within 60 minutes.[18] In 2010, he sold the company to a London-based private equity firm.[19] It was the experiences Ferriss had running BrainQUICKEN that led him to write The 4-Hour Workweek.[3]
Television[edit]
In December 2008, Ferriss had a pilot on the History Channel called Trial by Fire, where he had one week to attempt to learn a skill normally learned over the course of many years. In the pilot episode he practiced yabusame, the Japanese art of horseback archery.[20] In December 2013, his television series The Tim Ferriss Experiment debuted on HLN. Although there were 13 episodes shot, only a portion of those were shown on television.[21] The show was released in its entirety on iTunes.[22]
Publishing[edit]
In November 2013, Ferriss began an audiobook publishing venture, Tim Ferriss Publishing.[23] The first book published was Vagabonding by Rolf Potts.[23] Other books include The Obstacle Is The Way by Ryan Holiday, Daily Rituals by Mason Currey, and What I Learned Losing A Million Dollars by Jim Paul and Brendan Moynihan.[24]
Investor and advisor[edit]
Ferriss is an angel investor and advisor to startups.[25] He has invested or advised in startups such as StumbleUpon, Posterous, Evernote, DailyBurn, Shopify, Reputation.com, Trippy, and TaskRabbit.[26] He is a pre-seed money advisor to Uber, a company co-founded by Garrett Camp, the founder of StumbleUpon, which Ferriss also advises.[27][28] In September 2013, Ferriss raised $250,000 in under an hour to invest in Shyp by forming a syndicate on AngelList.[29] Ferriss ended up raising over $500,000 through his backers and Shyp raised a total of $2.1 million.[30] The New York Times listed Ferriss among their "Notable Angel Investors" while CNN said he was "one of the planet's leading angel investors in technology."[31][32]
Author[edit]
Ferriss is the author of four books, The 4-Hour Workweek, The 4-Hour Body, The 4-Hour Chef, and Tools of Titans; the first two were No. 1 New York Times bestsellers and the third was a No. 1 Wall Street Journal bestseller.[4][9][33]
The 4-Hour Workweek[edit]
Main article: The 4-Hour Workweek
Ferriss developed the ideas present in The 4-Hour Workweek while working 14-hour days at BrainQUICKEN.[3][34]
The 4-Hour Workweek was rejected by 25 publishers.[35] In 2007, Random House, the 26th publisher, released the book through its Crown imprint.[36] Before release, Ferriss was an unknown.[37] He marketed the book heavily through bloggers with whom he created personal relationships.[37][37][38][39] The 4-Hour Workweek would reach No. 1 on the New York Times bestseller list, No. 1 on the Wall Street Journal bestseller list, and No. 1 on the BusinessWeek bestseller list.[40] It has currently sold over 1,350,000 copies and has spent nearly 4 years on the New York Times bestseller list.[4][5][41][42]
The book received both positive and negative reviews. Leslie Garner of The Telegraph noted that, "With a punchy writing style and a higher literacy level than most flash-in-the-pan gurus, Ferriss has struck a chord with his critique of workers's slavish devotion to corporations... Ferriss' book skillfully compartmentalises, then pathologises, workers's unhealthy relationships with office life."[43] Dylan Tweney of Wired wrote, "Nearly every idea taken to extreme. No sense of work being anything more than a paycheck."[44]
In 2009, The 4-Hour Workweek, Expanded and Updated was released by Random House and included multiple case studies authored by people who have utilized Ferriss's methods.[45]
The 4-Hour Body[edit]
Main article: The 4-Hour Body
In December 2010, Ferriss's second book, The 4-Hour Body: An Uncommon Guide to Rapid Fat-Loss, Incredible Sex, and Becoming Superhuman, was published by Crown.[46] The book covers more than 50 topics, including rapid fat loss, increasing strength, boosting endurance, and polyphasic sleep.[47] Ferriss also introduces his version of the Slow-Carb Diet, which involves the elimination of starches and anything sweet (including fruit and all artificial sweeteners) and a strong preference for lean protein, legumes, and vegetables.[48]
For the book, Ferriss interviewed more than 200 experts over a three-year period. The experts ranged from doctors to athletes to black-market drug salesmen.[49] He said that he had recorded every workout he had done since the age of 18, and from 2004 (three years before his first book was published) he had tracked a variety of blood chemistry measurements, including insulin levels, hemoglobin A1c, and free testosterone.[46] In the book, Ferriss wrote about using anabolic steroids, specifically "a number of low-dose therapies, including testosterone cypionate," under medical supervision following shoulder surgery, as well as using "stacks" consisting of testosterone enanthate, Sustanon 250, HGH, Deca-Durabolin, Cytomel, and other unnamed ingredients while training.[50]
The 4-Hour Body debuted at No. 1 on The New York Times Best Seller list.[9] It peaked at No. 4 on both the Wall Street Journal and USA Today's lists, and was one of Amazon.com's top 5 bestselling books for December 2010 and January 2011.[51][52][53] As part of the press for the book, Ferriss appeared as a guest on The Dr. Oz Show and ABC's The View.[54][55]
The 4-Hour Chef[edit]
Main article: The 4-Hour Chef
Ferriss's third book, The 4-Hour Chef: The Simple Path to Cooking Like a Pro, Learning Anything, and Living the Good Life was released by Amazon Publishing in November 2012.[56]The 4-Hour Chef contains practical cooking and recipe tips and uses the skill of cooking to explain his methods for accelerated learning, which he calls "meta-learning".[57][57][58]
The book reached No. 1 on the Wall Street Journal bestseller list in its first week of issue.[11] However, many brick and mortar bookstores including independents and Barnes & Noble chose to not stock the book due to their objections to the business practices of Amazon Publishing.[59] This required Ferriss to make arrangements with non-conventional partners, including BitTorrent, Panera Bread, and TaskRabbit in order to distribute the book.[60][61][62] In particular, Ferriss teamed up with BitTorrent to distribute an exclusive bundle of 4-Hour Chef content including excerpts from the book, photos, interviews and unpublished content,[63] which was downloaded over 300,000 times the first week after release.[64][65] The audiobook featured guest narration by Neil Gaiman.[61][66][67][68][69][70]
Tools of Titans[edit]
Ferriss' fourth book Tools of Titans was released on December 6, 2016 by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.[71] The book's content consists of tactics and routines from some of the most popular guests on The Tim Ferriss Show podcast.[72]
Tools of Titans debuted at #1 on the New York Times Bestseller list.[73][74] The book was the first podcast-based book to debut on the New York Times list.[75]
The Tim Ferriss Show[edit]
Ferriss has been called the "Oprah of Audio" due to the influence and reach of his podcast "The Tim Ferriss Show" which as of 2016 had over 80 million downloads.[71][76] It covers topics ranging from personal and character development, to exercise routines, acting, venture capital and metaphysics.[77] The show was voted “Best Podcast Episode of 2015” by users of Product Hunt in their "Golden Kitty Awards."[78]
Influence[edit]
The New Yorker described Ferriss as this generation's self-help guru, comparing Ferriss and his books to authors of similar influence of previous generations—Napoleon Hill, Norman Vincent Peale, Stephen Covey, and Spencer Johnson.[79] Wired called Ferriss “The Superman of Silicon Valley”.[80] The New York Times said Ferriss was "somewhere between [retired General Electric chairman and CEO] Jack Welch and a Buddhist monk."[16] In 2011, Newsweek declared Ferriss "The World's Best Guinea Pig".[81]
He has been named among Newsweek's Digital Power Index 100 as the seventh most powerful online personality, Fortune's "40 Under 40", one of Fast Company's "Most Innovative Business People of 2007", and a Henry Crown Fellow by the Aspen Institute.[82][83][84][85]
Both The 4-Hour Body and The 4-Hour Workweek are in the "10 Most Highlighted Books of All Time" on Amazon Kindle.[86][87]
In 2008, he was named Wired's "Greatest Self-Promoter of All Time."[88]
"The Tim Ferriss Effect"[edit]
In 2012, author Michael Ellsberg coined the phrase "The Tim Ferriss Effect" in a Forbes profile.[89] The phrase was used to describe the influence a blog post on Ferriss' site had on the sales of Ellsberg's book.[89][90] Ellsberg found that his post on Ferriss' blog sold more books than a piece in The New York Times and a three-minute segment on CNN.[89] Ryan Holiday, who had previously been hired by Ferriss to assist with the promotion of The 4-Hour Body and The 4-Hour Chef,[91] said this effect helped to sell 30,000 copies of his own book in the weeks following its release.[92] The clothing brand Mizzen+Main wrote about the effect on their clothing sales, stating that a mention on the podcast boosted exposure and sales for the brand more than a profile in The New York Times, an announcement in The Wall Street Journal, or a full page ad in Esquire.[93]
Philanthropy[edit]
Ferriss is a charity advocate and a member of the National Advisory Council of the public school nonprofit DonorsChoose.[94][95] His projects and donations have raised more than $250,000 for underfunded public school teachers and classroom projects, and his campaigns, such as dedicating his birthday to raising funds and heading LitLiberation to increase literacy worldwide, have impacted more than 60,000 students.[96][97][98][99] In March 2016, Ferriss flash funded 145 school projects posted on DonorsChoose.org in coordination with Stephen Colbert.[100][101]
In October 2014, BUILD Boston, a not-for-profit organization that uses entrepreneurship to equip Boston youth for high school and college success, honored Ferriss with the annual BUILDer Award for Innovation and Entrepreneurship for his work in education reform.[102][103]
Ferriss is also on the advisory board of the non-profit QuestBridge, along with LinkedIn Founder Reid Hoffman, David Sze, and others.[104] QuestBridge was created in 2003 to connect disadvantaged students with elite colleges and helps place over 2,000 students per year.[104]
Psychedelic research[edit]
Ferriss has raised funds for psychedelic studies at institutions such as Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.[105] In 2016, Ferriss donated at least $100,000 to research psychedelic drugs for the treatment of major depression.[105]
Personal life[edit]
Ferriss lives in San Francisco, California.[106] He holds a Guinness World Record in Argentine tango.[107]
Ferriss has stated that prior to his writing career he won in the 165 lb. weight class at the 1999 USAWKF national Sanshou (Chinese kickboxing) championship through a process of shoving opponents out of the ring and by dramatically dehydrating himself before weigh in, and then rehydrating before the fight in order to compete several classes below his actual weight – a practice known as weight cutting.[108][108][109]

Stephen Dubner — The Art of Storytelling and Facing Malcolm Gladwell in a Fist Fight

Written by Tim Ferriss

					Topics: The Tim Ferriss Show 




“Storytelling has a power that goes well beyond the sum of its parts.” 
– Stephen Dubner
Stephen J. Dubner (@Freakonomics) returns to the show. He is an award-winning author, journalist, and radio and TV personality. He is best-known for writing, along with the economist Steven D. Levitt, Freakonomics (2005), SuperFreakonomics (2009), and Think Like a Freak (2014), which have sold more than five million copies in 35 languages. He is the creator of the top-ranked Freakonomics Radio podcast.
His brand-new podcast, produced in collaboration with The New York Times, is Tell Me Something I Don’t Know It is equal parts game show, talk show, and brain-tease. I had a chance to experiment with this format as a “panelist” alongside Malcolm Gladwell. It’s a blast.
In this episode, we cover such diverse topics as:

Why cats wiggle their butts before they pounce
How to grow a podcast
If he thinks he could take Malcolm Gladwell in a fist fight
Economics and the President’s actual influence over the economy
How virtual reality might affect education
And much, much more

Please enjoy this round two with Stephen J. Dubner!

Dubner? — Listen to this early episode of The Tim Ferriss Show. In this episode, we discuss the craft of brainstorming, narrative storytelling, and how to avoid wasting mental energy on meaningless nonsense (stream below or right-click here to download):





















This podcast is brought to you by Wealthfront. Wealthfront is a massively disruptive (in a good way) set-it-and-forget-it investing service led by technologists from places like Apple. It has exploded in popularity in the last two years and now has more than $2.5B under management. Why? Because you can get services previously limited to the ultra-wealthy and only pay pennies on the dollar for them, and it’s all through smarter software instead of retail locations and bloated sales teams.
Check out wealthfront.com/tim, take their risk assessment quiz, which only takes 2-5 minutes, and they’ll show you for free the exact portfolio they’d put you in. If you want to just take their advice and do it yourself, you can. Well worth a few minutes to explore: wealthfront.com/tim.
This podcast is also brought to you by 99Designs, the world’s largest marketplace of graphic designers. I have used them for years to create some amazing designs. When your business needs a logo, website design, business card, or anything you can imagine, check out 99Designs.
I used them to rapid prototype the cover for The 4-Hour Body, and I’ve also had them help with display advertising and illustrations. If you want a more personalized approach, I recommend their 1-on-1 service. You get original designs from designers around the world. The best part? You provide your feedback, and then you end up with a product that you’re happy with or your money back. Click this link and get a free $99 upgrade. Give it a test run.

			9 comments on “Stephen Dubner — The Art of Storytelling and Facing Malcolm Gladwell in a Fist Fight”		





Hey Tim, are you going to do a 2016 version of the 4hour work week?

I think more likely a 2017 since it would be the 10th anniversary 😉

Stephen Dubner has a lot of interesting things to say but high pitch voices are neither soothing nor attractive. Listening to a podcast is a multi-sensorial experience that goes beyond great content and people’s voices matter.
Thank you for having a calming low pitch voice Tim. You are not a perfect podcaster but you have redeeming qualities. I’m glad I refrained from listening to CBCnews live instead of the podcast : Stephan’s ideas about education were worth it and I don’t like listening to the news.

Un mar de fuegos.  Eduardo Galeano
“Un hombre del pueblo de Neguá, en la costa de Colombia, pudo subir al alto cielo.
A la vuelta contó. Dijo que había contemplado desde arriba, la vida humana.
Y dijo que somos un mar de fueguitos.
-El mundo es eso -reveló- un montón de gente, un mar de fueguitos.
Cada persona brilla con luz propia entre todas las demás.
No hay dos fuegos iguales. Hay fuegos grandes y fuegos chicos y fuegos de todos los colores. Hay gente de fuego sereno, que ni se entera del viento, y gente de fuego loco que llena el aire de chispas. Algunos fuegos, fuegos bobos, no alumbran ni queman; pero otros arden la vida con tanta pasión que no se puede mirarlos sin parpadear, y quien se acerca se enciende”.
You are a fire.

The fundamental problem with storytelling science is that truth should never get in the way of a good story, whereas the opposite is true of good science. 
Let a quote from Steven Pinker – regarding the Freak ‘theory’  of crime reduction – explain
“Any hypothesis that comes out of left field to explain a massive social trend with a single overlooked event will almost certainly turn out to be wrong, even if it has some data supporting it at the time.”
Much of what Gladwell, Dubner and Co. promote is not science, and is unfortunately labelled as such. With that being said, they tell damn good stories, and I read them religiously!

Stamp collecting is a great hobby for young people. My dad who was the VP of BP Oil NA said he learned more from his stamps and that knowledge helped him in his job more than anything. It is all encompassing, politlcs,art ect.

Tim, I have been a listener for a while and now I am in school again. I find myself actively sending and recommending your podcasts to classmates, teachers and friends. It’s been a whirlwind adventure given that I am an adoptive son of San Francisco just as you are. I am preaching your message daily, and trying to deconstruct a problem in sports management. I would really appreciate a signal for a better way to contact you, to ask you some questions as I think it would be fruitful for both of us. I am just asking for a short dialogue, nothing that will take up brain calories. 
As to this podcast, Dubner really opened my eyes to how to got his feet wet in New York, just after being a musician. And an athlete. I can relate. I will find myself reading his recommended reading and surely become a better follower.
As Maija says, “Stephan’s ideas about education were worth it”. Truly fun way to cook my steak and eggs. Thanks Tim. 
Hope to hear back from you soon!

Sick and tired of people describing schools as an industry! Yes load load up those children up as cannon fodder for industry! Oh and thanks for telling us about the way schools should be run…wait they tried what is being suggested here back in the 1970s in the U.K.  It failed badly. Maybe it was because they didn’t have the internet back then!!!! Or virtual reality goggles?
I was looking forward to this episode and now I just think If he is this ill informed about education what value do his other comments have?
