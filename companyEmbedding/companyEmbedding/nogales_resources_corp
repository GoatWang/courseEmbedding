The net proceeds to us from the sale of up to 1,500,000 shares of common stock
offered at a public offering price of $0.0075 per share will vary depending upon
the total number of shares sold. The following table summarizes, in order of
priority the anticipated application of the proceeds we will receive from this
Offering if the maximum number of shares is sold:

                                      Amount Assuming        
                                      Maximum Offering       Percent of Maximum  
                                                                                 
    GROSS OFFERING                        $         11,250                 100.0%
    Commission 1                          $              -                   0.0%

    USE OF NET PROCEEDS                                                          
    Mineral exploration 2                 $         11,250                 100.0%
    TOTAL APPLICATION OF NET PROCEEDS     $         11,250                 100.0%

1 Commissions: Shares will be offered and sold by us without special 
  compensation or other remuneration for such efforts. We do not plan to enter 
  into agreements with finders or securities broker-dealers whereby the finders
  or broker-dealers would be involved in the sale of the Shares to the 
  investors. Shares will be sold directly by us, and no fee or commission will
  be paid. 

2 Mineral exploration: We intend to use the proceeds of this Offering for 
  mineral exploration. The projected costs of our initial mineral exploration 
  program are as follows: 

                  Mineral Exploration Costs          Amount    
                  Camp Charges                   $        2,013
                  Geochemical Assays             $        3,420
                  Transportation                  $         630
                  Personnel Costs                 $       4,725
                  Contingency funds               $       1,002
                  Total                           $      11,790

3 Legal and accounting: None of the proceeds of this Offering will be used to 
  pay legal, accounting, and related compliance costs to be incurred on a 
  periodic basis as a result of our exploration programs or becoming a public 
  company. Our legal expenses incurred in connection with this Offering will be
  paid from cash currently on hand. Other expenses associated with this 
  Offering will be paid from a combination of cash on hand and funds to be 
  received as-needed from our sole officer and director, Misael Aguirre.  
  Mr. Aguirre has offered to fund our basic legal and accounting compliance 
  expenses through additional infusions of debt capital on an as-needed basis, 
  although he is under no legal obligation to provide funding. This offer is 
  not the subject of a formal written agreement with us, and there are no 
  specific limits as to time or dollar amount. 

As set forth in more detail in the table and explanation below, if a small or 
de minimis amount of proceeds is received from the Offering, such proceeds 
would be reserved for working capital pending our ability to raise additional 
funds.

In the event that less than the maximum number of shares is sold we anticipate
application of the proceeds we will receive from this Offering, in order of
priority, will be as follows:

We have sufficient funds to complete the initial phase of our mineral
exploration program. Should we raise only 75% of the maximum offering, or if we
were we to incur unforeseen corporate expenses prior to the commencement of our
exploration program, Phase 1 of the planned exploration on our Mineral Claim can
be scaled back from $11,790 to $8,370 if the geochemical assay of our rock and
soil samples were delayed. Were funding in the form of Offering proceeds and/or
other funds in the amount of at least $8,370 not available at the time of the
commencement of our mineral exploration program, the recommended work program
would be deferred until such time as cash on hand were available and the
proceeds of the Offering would be reserved for working capital pending our
ability to raise additional funds.

The legal and accounting costs of this Offering will be paid from cash on hand
and/or through additional infusions of debt capital on an as-needed basis from
our sole officer and director, Mr. Aguirre. Mr. Aguirre has offered to fund our
basic legal and accounting compliance expenses through additional infusions of
equity or debt capital on an as-needed basis, although he is under no legal
obligation to provide funding.  This offer is not the subject of a formal
written agreement with us, and there are no specific limits as to time or dollar
amount.

We currently do not have any firm arrangements for financing in addition to the
financing contemplated by this prospectus. We may not be able to obtain
financing when required. Obtaining additional financing would be subject to a
number of factors, including the market prices for minerals and the costs of
exploring for or commercial production of this material.


The mineral exploration industry, in general, is intensely competitive and even
if commercial quantities of reserves are discovered, a ready market may not
exist for the sale of the reserves.

Most companies operating in this industry are more established and have greater
resources to engage in the production of mineral claims.  We were incorporated
on April 9, 2014 and our operations are not well-established.  Our resources at
the present time are limited.  We may exhaust all of our resources and be unable
to complete full exploration of our Mineral Claim.  There is also significant
competition to retain qualified personnel to assist in conducting mineral
exploration activities.  If a commercially viable deposit is found to exist and
we are unable to retain additional qualified personnel, we may be unable to
enter into production and achieve profitable operations.  These factors set
forth above could inhibit our ability to compete with other companies in the
industry and enter into production of the mineral claim if a commercial viable
deposit is found to exist.

Numerous factors beyond our control may affect the marketability of any
substances discovered.  These factors include market fluctuations, the proximity
and capacity of natural resource markets and processing equipment, government
regulations, including regulations relating to prices, taxes, royalties, land
tenure, land use, importing and exporting of minerals and environmental
protection.  The exact effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted,
but the combination of these factors may result in our not receiving an adequate
return on invested capital.


Company Description
We are an exploration stage mineral exploration company incorporated in Nevada
on April 9, 2014.  On May 8, 2014, we incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary,
NRC Exploration LLC in the state of Nevada, for the purposes of mineral
exploration. On May 20, 2014, our consulting geologist introduced us


 to an
attractive mineral property. We acquired an option on that property whereupon we
can acquire 100% legal and beneficial ownership interest in the Donald mineral
claim (hereafter the “Mineral Claim”). The Mineral Claim is located in the
Ominica Mining District located in the central part of the Province of British
Columbia, Canada. It is located on provincial lands administered by the Province
of British Columbia. The legal and ownership rights on the claim are limited to
the exploration and extraction of mineral deposits subject to applicable
regulations.  The Mineral Claim totals roughly 1,300 acres or 2.03 square miles
in size and is located approximately 59 miles northeast of the community of Fort
St. James, British Columbia.

The Mineral Claim comprises a rectangular shaped block of land of approximately
1.5 miles long by 1.3 miles wide and is located along the Pinchi Fault Zone.
Historic exploration work shows that the claims are located within an area that
has potential for copper mineralization.

Our currently planned exploration budget requires the expenditure of $11,790 in
the initial year of our mineral exploration program, plus the expenditure of an
additional amount in the second year of our mineral exploration program if
recommended by our consulting geologist. Further exploration activities beyond
our currently planned exploration program will be dependent upon a number of
factors, including our consulting geologist’s recommendations based upon the
exploration program results, and our available funds. In order to prove or
disprove the economic viability of our mineral claim our mineral exploration
costs plus our operating costs could amount to many millions of dollars.

The net proceeds to us from the sale of up to 1,500,000 shares of common stock
offered at a public offering price of $0.0075 per share will vary depending upon
the total number of shares sold. The following table summarizes, in order of
priority the anticipated application of the proceeds we will receive from this
Offering if the maximum number of shares is sold:

                                      Amount Assuming        
                                      Maximum Offering       Percent of Maximum  
                                                                                 
    GROSS OFFERING                        $         11,250                 100.0%

    TOTAL APPLICATION OF NET PROCEEDS     $         11,250                 100.0%

1 Commissions: Shares will be offered and sold by us without special 
  compensation or other remuneration for such efforts. We do not plan to enter 
  into agreements with finders or securities broker-dealers whereby the finders
  or broker-dealers would be involved in the sale of the Shares to the 
  investors. Shares will be sold directly by us, and no fee or commission will
  be paid. 

2 Mineral exploration: We intend to use the proceeds of this Offering for 
  mineral exploration. The projected costs of our initial mineral exploration 
  program are as follows: 

                  Mineral Exploration Costs          Amount    
                  Camp Charges                   $        2,013
                  Geochemical Assays             $        3,420
                  Transportation                  $         630
                  Personnel Costs                 $       4,725
                  Contingency funds               $       1,002
                  Total                           $      11,790

3 Legal and accounting: None of the proceeds of this Offering will be used to 
  pay legal, accounting, and related compliance costs to be incurred on a 
  periodic basis as a result of our exploration programs or becoming a public 
  company. Our legal expenses incurred in connection with this Offering will be
  paid from cash currently on hand. Other expenses associated with this 
  Offering will be paid from a combination of cash on hand and funds to be 
  received as-needed from our sole officer and director, Misael Aguirre.  
  Mr. Aguirre has offered to fund our basic legal and accounting compliance 
  expenses through additional infusions of debt capital on an as-needed basis, 
  although he is under no legal obligation to provide funding. This offer is 
  not the subject of a formal written agreement with us, and there are no 
  specific limits as to time or dollar amount. 

As set forth in more detail in the table and explanation below, if a small or 
de minimis amount of proceeds is received from the Offering, such proceeds 
would be reserved for working capital pending our ability to raise additional 
funds.

In the event that less than the maximum number of shares is sold we anticipate

and capacity of natural resource markets and processing equipment, government
regulations, including regulations relating to prices, taxes, royalties, land
tenure, land use, importing and exporting of minerals and environmental
protection.  The exact effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted,
but the combination of these factors may result in our not receiving an adequate
return on invested capital.


Company Description
We are an exploration stage mineral exploration company incorporated in Nevada
on April 9, 2014.  On May 8, 2014, we incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary,
NRC Exploration LLC in the state of Nevada, for the purposes of mineral
exploration. On May 20, 2014, our consulting geologist introduced us


 to an
attractive mineral property. We acquired an option on that property whereupon we
can acquire 100% legal and beneficial ownership interest in the Donald mineral
claim (hereafter the “Mineral Claim”). The Mineral Claim is located in the
Ominica Mining District located in the central part of the Province of British
Columbia, Canada. It is located on provincial lands administered by the Province
of British Columbia. The legal and ownership rights on the claim are limited to
the exploration and extraction of mineral deposits subject to applicable
regulations.  The Mineral Claim totals roughly 1,300 acres or 2.03 square miles
in size and is located approximately 59 miles northeast of the community of Fort
St. James, British Columbia.

The Mineral Claim comprises a rectangular shaped block of land of approximately
1.5 miles long by 1.3 miles wide and is located along the Pinchi Fault Zone.
Historic exploration work shows that the claims are located within an area that
has potential for copper mineralization.

Our currently planned exploration budget requires the expenditure of $11,790 in
the initial year of our mineral exploration program, plus the expenditure of an
additional amount in the second year of our mineral exploration program if
recommended by our consulting geologist. Further exploration activities beyond
our currently planned exploration program will be dependent upon a number of
factors, including our consulting geologist’s recommendations based upon the
exploration program results, and our available funds. In order to prove or
disprove the economic viability of our mineral claim our mineral exploration
costs plus our operating costs could amount to many millions of dollars.

Key Stock Data     ?    P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.

	Forward-Looking
	Statements






	 




	Certain
	statements, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans,
	objectives, and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are “forward-looking
	statements.” These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words “believes,” “project,”
	“expects,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” “intends,” “strategy,” “plan,”
	“may,” “will,” “would,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will likely
	result,” and similar expressions.  Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that
	are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.
	Our ability to predict results or the actual effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain.  Factors which
	could have a material adverse effect on our operations and future prospects on a consolidated basis include, but are not limited
	to: changes in economic conditions, legislative/regulatory changes, availability of capital, interest rates, competition, and
	generally accepted accounting principles. These risks and uncertainties should also be considered in evaluating forward-looking
	statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements.  




	 





	Company
	Overview





	 




	We
	are an exploration stage mineral exploration company incorporated in Nevada on April 9, 2014.  On May 8, 2014, we incorporated
	a wholly-owned subsidiary, NRC Exploration LLC in the state of Nevada, for the purposes of mineral exploration. On May 20, 2014,
	our consulting geologist introduced us to a mineral property and we acquired an option on that property whereupon we can acquire
	100% legal and beneficial ownership interest in a mineral claim known as the “Donald Mineral Claim.” The Donald Mineral
	Claim is located in the Ominica Mining District located in the central part of the Province of British Columbia, Canada.




	 




	In
	view of the current world wide depressed market for metals, we have chosen not to incur additional exploration cost on the Donald
	Mineral Claim at this time and are no longer pursuing exploration or development of the property.  Management is currently
	searching for other opportunities in the mineral exploration field.




	 





	Employees





	 




	We
	have no employees as of the date of this prospectus other than our president and CEO, Ms. Yang. We conduct our business largely
	through agreements with consultants and other independent third party vendors.




	 





	Research
	and Development Expenditures





	 




	We
	have not incurred any research or development expenditures since our incorporation.




	 





	Subsidiaries





	 




	On
	May 8, 2014, we incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary, NRC Exploration LLC in the State of Nevada for the purpose of conducting
	mineral exploration.




	 





	Patents
	and Trademarks





	 




	We
	do not own, either legally or beneficially, any patent or trademark.

	Penny
	Stock





	The
	SEC has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are
	generally equity securities with a market price of less than $5.00, other than securities registered on certain national securities
	exchanges or quoted on the NASDAQ system, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such
	securities is provided by the exchange or system. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny
	stock, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the SEC, that: (a) contains a description of the nature
	and level of risk in the market for penny stocks in both public offerings and secondary trading; (b) contains a description of
	the broker's or dealer's duties to the customer and of the rights and remedies available to the customer with respect to a violation
	of such duties or other requirements of the securities laws; (c) contains a brief, clear, narrative description of a dealer market,
	including bid and ask prices for penny stocks and the significance of the spread between the bid and ask price; (d) contains a
	toll-free telephone number for inquiries on disciplinary actions; (e) defines significant terms in the disclosure document or
	in the conduct of trading in penny stocks; and (f) contains such other information and is in such form, including language, type
	size and format, as the SEC shall require by rule or regulation.




	 




	The
	broker-dealer also must provide, prior to effecting any transaction in a penny stock, the customer with (a) bid and offer quotations
	for the penny stock; (b) the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction; (c) the number of shares
	to which such bid and ask prices apply, or other comparable information relating to the depth and liquidity of the market for
	such stock; and (d) a monthly account statement showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer's account.




	 




	In
	addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, the
	broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive
	the purchaser's written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement, a written agreement as to transactions involving
	penny stocks, and a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement.




	 




	These
	disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity for our common stock. Therefore, stockholders may
	have difficulty selling our securities.

	Stockholders
	of Our Common Shares





	 




	The
	Company has approximately 34 stockholders of record of its common stock. As of July 26, 2016, we had 2,790,000 shares of our
	common stock issued and outstanding.




	 





	Dividend
	Policy





	 




	We
	have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to
	finance the expansion of our business. As a result, we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.




	 









	Recent
	Sales of Unregistered Securities





	 




	During
	the last two fiscal years, we did not sell any equity securities in transactions that were not registered under the Securities
	Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”).

	Item
	7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.





	 





	Results
	of Operations for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2016 and 2015.





	 




	We
	have not earned any revenues since the inception of our current business operations. We incurred operating expenses in the amount
	of $41,507 for the year ended April 30, 2016 (2015 - 40,611). Our expenses during the year consisted of audit and accounting fees
	of $17,830 (2015 – $15,103), an $8 loss on foreign exchange (2015 – $921), legal fees of $15,363 (2015 – $12,382),
	office expenses of $2,896 ( 2015 – 3,476), transfer and filing fees of $5,410 (2015 – $5,579), and mineral property
	exploration costs of $nil (2015 – $2,000).  We also incurred interest expense of $2,025 (2015 – $1,388) and incurred
	a write-down of our former mineral property in the amount of $nil (2015 – $1,150).




	 




	Our
	losses are attributable to operating expenses together with a lack of any revenues.

	As
	of April 30, 2016, we had total current assets of $25,403, consisting of $20,403 cash and $5,000 in prepaid expenses. We had current
	liabilities of $48,978.  Accordingly, we had negative working capital of $23,575 as of April 30, 2016.




	 




	On
	April 28, 2014 our former officer and director Mr. Misael Aguirre loaned the Company $23,000 which is evidenced by a Promissory
	Note in the amount of $23,000 with interest accruing on the principal amount of 6% per annum and due on December 31, 2018.  In
	addition, we raised a total of $8,925 through our public offering closed December 18, 2014.




	 




	On
	June 29, 2015, Mr. Aguirre loaned an additional $7,000 to the Company under a Promissory Note due December 31, 2018, with interest
	accruing on the principal amount at an annual rate of 6%.




	 




	On
	August 26, 2015, Mr. Aguirre loaned an additional $3,600 to the Company under a Promissory Note due December 31, 2018, with interest
	accruing on the principal amount at an annual rate of 6%.

	On
	February 9, 2016, Mr. Aguirre loaned an additional $1,500 to the Company under a Promissory Note due December 31, 2018, with interest
	accruing on the principal amount at an annual rate of 6%.




	 




	As

	On
	April 6, 2016, an unrelated 3

	rd

	party loaned $23,978 to the Company under a Promissory Note due on demand, with interest
	accruing on the principal amount at an annual rate of 6%.




	 




	On
	April 30, 2016, an unrelated 3

	rd

	As
	of April 30, 2016, there were no off balance sheet arrangements.




	 





	Critical
	Accounting Policies





	 




	In
	December 2001, the SEC requested that all registrants list their most “critical accounting polices” in the Management
	Discussion and Analysis. The SEC indicated that a “critical accounting policy” is one which is both important to the
	portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results, and requires management’s most difficult, subjective or
	complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.
	Currently, we do not believe that any accounting policies fit this definition.




	 





	Recently
	Issued Accounting Pronouncements





	 




	We
	do not expect the adoption of any recently issued accounting pronouncements to have an impact on our results of operations or
	financial position.

	REPORT
	OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM






	 





	To
	the Board of Directors and Stockholders’




	Nogales
	Resources Corp.




	Hong Kong




	 




	We
	have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Nogales Resources Corp. and its subsidiary (collectively, the "Company")
	as of April 30, 2016 and 2015 and the consolidated related statements of operations, stockholders’ deficit and cash flow
	for the years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility
	is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.




	 




	We
	conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
	standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
	free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform an audit of its internal control
	over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing
	audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness
	of the Company’s internal control over the financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
	examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
	principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
	We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.




	 




	In
	our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
	of Nogales Resources Corp. and its subsidiary as of April 30, 2016 and 2015 and the results of their operations and their cash
	flow for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.




	 




	The
	accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
	in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations, which raise substantial doubt
	about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans regarding these matters are also described in Note
	1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	NOTES
	TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	April
	30, 2016 and 2015




	 




	Note

	Nature of Operations and Ability to Continue as a Going Concern





	 




	The
	Company was incorporated in the state of Nevada, United States of America on April 9, 2014. The Company was formed for the purpose
	of acquiring and developing mineral properties. The Company’s year-end is April 30.




	 




	These
	consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to
	a going concern, which assumes that the Company will be able to meet its obligations and continue its operations for its next
	fiscal year. Realization values may be substantially different from carrying values as shown and these financial statements do
	not give effect to adjustments that would be necessary to the carrying values and classification of assets and liabilities should
	the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The Company has yet to achieve profitable operations, has accumulated losses
	of $87,013 and expects to incur further losses in the development of its business, all of which casts substantial doubt about
	the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent
	upon its ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain the necessary financing from shareholders or other
	sources to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management
	has no formal plan in place to address this concern but considers that the Company will be able to obtain additional funds by
	equity financing and/or related party advances, however there is no assurance of additional funding being available or on acceptable
	terms, if at all. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification
	of recorded assets, or the amounts of and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event the Company cannot
	continue in existence.

	Use
	of Estimates





	 




	The
	consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
	in the United States of America and are stated in US dollars. Because a precise determination of many assets and liabilities is
	dependent upon future events, the preparation of financial statements for a period necessarily involves the use of estimates,
	which may have been made using careful judgment. Actual results may vary from these estimates.




	 




	The
	financial statements have, in management’s opinion, been properly prepared within the framework of the significant accounting
	policies summarized below:




	 





	Principles
	of Consolidation





	 










	These
	consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and NRC Exploration
	LLC., a wholly owned subsidiary incorporated in Nevada, USA on May 8, 2014. All significant
	inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated.

	– (cont’d)




	 





	Cash





	 




	Cash
	consists of all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to cash within 90 days when purchased.




	 





	Related
	party





	 




	The
	Company follows ASC 850, Related Party Disclosures, for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party
	transactions.




	 





	Mineral
	Property





	 




	The
	Company is primarily engaged in the acquisition, exploration and development of mineral properties.




	 




	Mineral
	property acquisition costs are capitalized in accordance with FASB ASC 930, “Extractive Activities-Mining,” when management
	has determined that probable future benefits consisting of a contribution to future cash inflows have been identified and adequate
	financial resources are available or are expected to be available as required to meet the terms of property acquisition and budgeted
	exploration and development expenditures. Mineral property acquisition costs are expensed as incurred if the criteria for capitalization
	are not met.




	 




	In
	the event that mineral property acquisition costs are paid with Company shares, those shares are recorded at the estimated fair
	value at the time the shares are due in accordance with the terms of the property agreements.




	 




	Mineral
	property exploration costs are expensed as incurred.




	 




	When
	it has been determined that a mineral property can be economically developed as a result of establishing proven and probable reserves
	and pre-feasibility, the costs incurred to develop such property are capitalized.




	 




	Estimated
	future removal and site restoration costs, when determinable are provided over the life of proven reserves on a units-of-production
	basis. Costs, which include production equipment removal and environmental remediation, are estimated each period by management
	based on current regulations, actual expenses incurred, and technology and industry standards.




	 




	Any
	charge is included in exploration expense or the provision for depletion and depreciation during the period and the actual restoration
	expenditures are charged to the accumulated provision amounts as incurred.




	 




	To
	date the Company has not established any proven or probable reserves on its mineral properties.




	 





	Asset
	Retirement Obligations





	 




	Asset
	retirement obligations (“ARO”) associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset, are recognized as liabilities
	in the period in which it is incurred and becomes determinable, with an offsetting increase in the carrying amount of the associated
	assets. The cost of tangible long-lived assets, including the initially recognized ARO, is amortized, such that the cost of the
	ARO is recognized over the useful life of the assets.

	Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

	– (cont’d)




	 





	Asset
	Retirement Obligations (cont’d)





	 




	The
	ARO is recorded at fair value, and accretion expense is recognized over time as the discounted fair value is accreted to the expected
	settlement value.




	 




	The
	fair value of the ARO is measured using expected future cash flow, discounted at the Company’s credit-adjusted risk-free
	interest rate. As of April 30, 2016 the Company has determined no provision for ARO’s is required.




	 





	Impairment
	of Long- Lived Assets





	 




	The
	Company reviews and evaluates long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related
	carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The assets are subject to impairment consideration under FASB ASC 360-10-35-17 if events
	or circumstances indicate that their carrying amount might not be recoverable. When the Company determines that an impairment
	analysis should be done, the analysis will be performed using the rules of FASB ASC 930-360-35, Asset Impairment, and 360-0 through
	15-5, Impairment or Disposal of Long- Lived Assets.




	 





	Foreign
	Currency Translation





	 




	The
	Company’s functional currency is the United States dollar. The Company uses the United States dollar as its reporting currency
	for consistency with registrants of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).




	 




	Assets
	and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date and
	capital accounts are translated at historical rates. Income statement accounts are translated at the average rates of exchange
	prevailing during the period. Translation adjustments from the use of different exchange rates from period to period are included
	in the Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income account in Stockholder’s Equity, if applicable. Transactions undertaken in
	currencies other than the functional currency of the entity are translated using the exchange rate in effect as of the transaction
	date. Any exchange gains and losses are included in the Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.




	 





	Income
	Taxes





	 




	The
	Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized
	for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing
	assets and liabilities and loss carry-forwards and their respective tax bases.




	 




	Deferred
	tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those
	temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.

	Income
	Taxes

	– (cont’d)




	 




	The
	effect of a change in tax rules on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in operations in the year of change. A valuation
	allowance is recorded when it is “more likely-than-not” that a deferred tax asset will not be realized.




	 





	Earnings
	per share





	 




	In
	accordance with accounting guidance now codified as FASB ASC Topic 260, “Earnings per Share,” basic earnings per share
	(“EPS”) is computed by dividing net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common
	shares outstanding during the period, excluding the effects of any potentially dilutive securities. Diluted EPS gives effect to
	all dilutive potential of shares of common stock outstanding during the period including stock options or warrants, using the
	treasury stock method (by using the average stock price for the period to determine the number of shares assumed to be purchased
	from the exercise of stock options or warrants), and convertible debt or convertible preferred stock, using the if-converted method.
	Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential of shares of common stock if their effect is anti-dilutive.




	 





	Newly
	Issued Accounting Pronouncements





	 




	In
	February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, “Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis,”
	which makes changes to both the variable interest model and the voting model. These changes will require re-evaluation of certain
	entities for consolidation and will require us to revise our documentation regarding the consolidation or deconsolidation of such
	entities. This ASU is effective for us on January 1, 2016 and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated results
	of operations, financial position or cash flow.




	 




	In
	November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740) Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Assets. This ASU
	is intended to simplify the presentation of deferred taxes on the balance sheet and will require an entity to present all deferred
	tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as non-current on the balance sheet. Under the current guidance, entities are required
	to separately present deferred taxes as current or non-current. Netting deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities by tax
	jurisdiction will still be required under the new guidance. This guidance will be effective for periods beginning in the first
	quarter of fiscal 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not believe this new accounting standard update will have
	a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

	In
	January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, "Financial Instruments--Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement
	of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities," This amendment intends to improve the recognition and measurement of financial
	instruments under U.S. GAAP. The exit price notion will be used to measure the fair value of the financial instruments of public
	business entities that are required to disclose the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost on their balance
	sheets. This amendment also requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category
	and form of financial asset on the balance sheet or in the accompanying notes to the financial statements. ASU 2016-01 is effective
	for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption of ASU 2016-01
	is not permitted. ASU 2016-01 requires the use of the modified retrospective method to all periods presented. The Company is evaluating
	the potential impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-01 on its consolidated financial statements.  




	 




	The
	Company has reviewed all other pronouncements and does not expect any other pronouncements to have an impact on its results of
	operations or financial position.




	 




	Note
	3	

	Financial Instruments





	 










	Fair
	value is defined as the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid upon
	transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the
	measurement date and in the principal or most advantageous market for that asset or liability.
	The fair value should be calculated based on assumptions that market participants would
	use in pricing the asset or liability, not on assumptions specific to the entity. In
	addition, the fair value of liabilities should include consideration of non-performance
	risk including our own credit risk.






	 




	In
	addition to defining fair value, the standard expands the disclosure requirements around fair value and establishes a fair value
	hierarchy for valuation inputs. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three levels based on the extent to which inputs used
	in measuring fair value are observable in the market.




	 




	Each
	fair value measurement is reported in one of the three levels which is determined by the lowest level input that is significant
	to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels are:




	 




	Level
	1 – inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets.




	 




	Level
	2 – inputs are based upon significant observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices
	for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant
	assumptions are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the
	assets or liabilities.




	 




	Level
	3 – inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimates of assumptions that market participants
	would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques that include
	option pricing models, discounted cash flow models, and similar techniques.






	 




	The
	carrying value of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities which consist of cash, prepaid expenses, short term loans,
	accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and due to related parties in management’s opinion approximate their fair value
	due to the short maturity of such instruments. These financial assets and liabilities are valued using level 3 inputs, except
	for cash which is at level 1. Unless otherwise noted, it is management’s opinion that the Company is not exposed to significant
	interest, exchange or credit risks arising from these financial instruments.

	At
	April 30, 2016, the Company has incurred accumulated net operating losses in the United States of America totalling approximately
	$87,013 which are available to reduce taxable income in future taxation years.




	 






	Section
	382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). Ownership changes may limit the amount of the NOL
	carry forwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income and tax, respectively.




	 




	These
	losses expire as follows:

	The
	amount taken into income as deferred tax assets must reflect that portion of the income tax loss carryforwards that is more-likely-than-not
	to be realized from future operations. The Company has chosen to provide an allowance of 100% against all available income tax
	loss carryforwards, regardless of their time of expiry.

	Item
	9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.





	 




	There
	are not and have not been any disagreements between the Company and its accountants on any matter of accounting principles, practices
	or financial statements disclosure.




	 




	On
	May 15, 2015 we dismissed DeJoya Griffith, LLC (the “Former Accountant”) as our independent auditor and we appointed
	Malone Bailey LLP as our new independent auditor. During the last two fiscal years, there was a “reportable event”
	(as defined in Item 304(a)(v) of Regulation S-K) in that the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting for those
	periods were not effective. We do not believe that these reportable events have been disclosed in a manner different than what
	the Former Accountant would have concluded was required.





	 









	Item
	9A. Controls and Procedures.





	 




	As
	required by Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, we have carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our
	disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report, April 30, 2016. This evaluation
	was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and
	Chief Financial Officer.




	 




	Disclosure
	controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
	in our reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within
	the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures
	include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our company’s reports filed
	under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer
	and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.




	 




	Based
	upon that evaluation, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have concluded that our disclosure
	controls and procedures were ineffective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report.




	 





	Management’s
	Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting





	 




	Our
	management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
	13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
	reporting as of April 30, 2016 based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
	of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As a result of this assessment, management concluded that, as of April
	30, 2016, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective. Our management identified the following material weaknesses
	in our internal control over financial reporting, which are typical of many small companies with small staff: (i) inadequate segregation
	of duties and effective risk assessment; and (ii) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting
	with respect to the requirements and application of both US GAAP and SEC guidelines.




	 




	We
	plan to take steps to enhance and improve the design of our internal control over financial reporting. During the period covered
	by this annual report on Form 10-K, we have not been able to remediate the material weaknesses identified above. To remediate
	such weaknesses, we hope to implement the following changes during our fiscal year ending April 30, 2017: (i) appoint additional
	qualified personnel to address inadequate segregation of duties and ineffective risk management; and (ii) adopt sufficient written
	policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting. The remediation efforts set out in (i) and (ii) are largely dependent
	upon our securing additional financing to cover the costs of implementing the changes required. If we are unsuccessful in securing
	such funds, remediation efforts may be adversely affected in a material manner.




	 




	This
	annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over
	financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant
	to Item 308(b) of Regulation S-K.

	Our
	executive officer and director and her age as of the date of this 10-K is as follows:




	 









	Name





	 




	 





	Age

	and Office(s) Held

	President, Chief Executive
	Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Director







	 




	Set
	forth below is a brief description of the background and business experience of our current executive officer and director.




	 





	Lei
	Yang,

	Ms. Yang, age 36, graduated from Nanjing University with a master’s degree in information management. Ms. Yang
	also obtained another master’s degree from Bentley University located in Massachusetts, where she majored in the field of
	accounting. Ms Yang has more than 10 years’ work experience in large companies, including China Mobile and Hisense Group.
	From 2004 to 2007, Ms. Yang served as a senior analyst at China Mobile, where she took charge of the service, valuation and requirements
	of high value customers in Shenzhen area. Thereafter, she worked as a product manager and was responsible for the design and promotion
	of data products. From 2011 to 2015, Ms. Yang served as an internal auditor in Hisense Group, with the responsibility of financial
	auditing of the subsidiary corporations and IT infrastructure in the whole Group.  Ms. Yang does not have any prior experience
	as a chief executive or as the head of a public company.




	 





	Term
	of Office





	 




	Our
	directors are appointed for a one-year term to hold office until the next annual general meeting of our shareholders or until
	they resign or are removed from office in accordance with our bylaws. Our officers are appointed by our board of directors and
	hold office until removed by the board.




	 





	Family
	Relationships





	 




	There
	are no family relationships between or among the directors, executive officers or persons nominated or chosen by us to become
	directors or executive officers.




	 





	Involvement
	in Certain Legal Proceedings





	 




	To
	the best of our knowledge, during the past ten years, none of the following occurred with respect to a present or former director,
	executive officer, or employee: (1) any bankruptcy petition filed by or against any business of which such person was a general
	partner or executive officer either at the time of the bankruptcy or within two years prior to that time; (2) any conviction in
	a criminal proceeding or being subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses);
	(3) being subject to any order, judgment or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended, vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction,
	permanently or temporarily enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise limiting his or her involvement in any type of business,
	securities or banking activities; (4) being found by a court of competent jurisdiction (in a civil action), the SEC or the Commodities
	Futures Trading Commission to have violated a federal or state securities or commodities law, and the judgment has not been reversed,
	suspended or vacated; and (5) being otherwise involved in any legal proceeding described in Item 401(f) of Regulation S-K.




	 





	Committees
	of the Board





	 




	Until
	further determination by the board, the full board of directors will undertake the duties of the Audit Committee, Compensation
	Committee, and Nominating Committee.




	 





	Audit
	Committee





	 




	We
	do not have a separately designated standing audit committee. The entire Board of Directors performs the functions of an audit
	committee, but no written charter governs the actions of the Board when performing the functions of what would generally be performed
	by an audit committee. The Board approves the selection of our independent accountants and meets and interacts with the independent
	accountants to discuss issues related to financial reporting. In addition, the Board reviews the scope and results of the audit
	with the independent accountants, reviews with management and the independent accountants our annual operating results, considers
	the adequacy of our internal accounting procedures and considers other auditing and accounting matters including fees to be paid
	to the independent auditor and the performance of the independent auditor. Our Board of Directors, which performs the functions
	of an audit committee, does not have a member who would qualify as an “audit committee financial expert” within the
	definition of Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K. We believe that, at our current size and stage of development, the addition
	of a special audit committee financial expert to the Board is not necessary.

	Nomination
	Committee





	 




	Our
	Board of Directors does not maintain a nominating committee. As a result, no written charter governs the director nomination process.
	Our size and the size of our Board, at this time, do not require a separate nominating committee.




	 




	When
	evaluating director nominees, our directors consider the following factors:




	 




	-The
	appropriate size of our Board of Directors;




	-Our
	needs with respect to the particular talents and experience of our directors;




	-The
	knowledge, skills and experience of nominees, including experience in finance, administration or public service, in light of prevailing
	business conditions and the knowledge, skills and experience already possessed by other members of the Board;




	-Experience
	in political affairs;




	-Experience
	with accounting rules and practices; and




	-The
	desire to balance the benefit of continuity with the periodic injection of the fresh perspective provided by new Board members.




	 




	Our
	goal is to assemble a Board that brings together a variety of perspectives and skills derived from high quality business and professional
	experience. In doing so, the Board will also consider candidates with appropriate non-business backgrounds.




	 




	Other
	than the foregoing, there are no stated minimum criteria for director nominees, although the Board may also consider such other
	factors as it may deem are in our best interests as well as our stockholders. In addition, the Board identifies nominees by first
	evaluating the current members of the Board willing to continue in service. Current members of the Board with skills and experience
	that are relevant to our business and who are willing to continue in service are considered for re-nomination. If any member of
	the Board does not wish to continue in service or if the Board decides not to re-nominate a member for re-election, the Board
	then identifies the desired skills and experience of a new nominee in light of the criteria above. Current members of the Board
	are polled for suggestions as to individuals meeting the criteria described above. The Board may also engage in research to identify
	qualified individuals. To date, we have not engaged third parties to identify or evaluate or assist in identifying potential nominees,
	although we reserve the right in the future to retain a third party search firm, if necessary. The Board does not typically consider
	shareholder nominees because it believes that its current nomination process is sufficient to identify directors who serve our
	best interests.




	 





	Code
	of Ethics





	 




	We
	currently have not adopted a code of ethics for the Board or our executive officers. As Ms. Yang is, and Mr. Aguirre previously
	was, our sole executive officer and director, we do not believe that the adoption of a Code of Ethics is warranted at this time.




	 





	Compliance
	with Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act





	 




	We
	do not have a class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”).
	As such, our directors, executive officers and beneficial owners of greater than 10% of our equity securities are not required
	to comply with the provisions of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act.

	Compensation
	Discussion and Analysis





	 




	We
	presently do not have employment agreements with our sole executive officer and we have not established a system of executive
	compensation or any fixed policies regarding compensation of executive officers.  Due to financial constraints typical of
	those faced by a development stage business, we have not paid any cash and/or stock compensation to our sole named executive officer.

	director, by each person known by us to beneficially own more than 5% of the our common stock and by the executive officers

	As
	used in this table, "beneficial ownership" means the sole or shared power to vote, or to direct the voting of, a security,
	or the sole or shared investment power with respect to a security (i.e., the power to dispose of, or to direct the disposition
	of, a security). In addition, for purposes of this table, a person is deemed, as of any date, to have "beneficial ownership"
	of any security that such person has the right to acquire within 60 days after such date.




	 




	The
	persons named above have full voting and investment power with respect to the shares indicated.  Under the rules of the Securities
	and Exchange Commission, a person (or group of persons) is deemed to be a "beneficial owner" of a security if he or
	she, directly or indirectly, has or shares the power to vote or to direct the voting of such security, or the power to dispose
	of or to direct the disposition of such security.  Accordingly, more than one person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner
	of the same security. A person is also deemed to be a beneficial owner of any security, which that person has the right to acquire
	within 60 days, such as options or warrants to purchase our common stock.
