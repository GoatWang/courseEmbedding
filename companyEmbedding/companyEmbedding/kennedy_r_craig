Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/23/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Canada on Wednesday greeted reports that U.S. President Donald Trump was leaning toward withdrawal from a pact on climate change by saying it would "keep marching on" with the rest of the world to combat global warming. If Trump does pull the United States out of the 195-nation Paris accord, it would be a blow to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

                                                    U.S. coal stocks fall; exit from climate deal may hurt, not help
                                                


                                                    Reuters – 
                                                    11:17 AM ET 05/31/2017
                                                


U.S. coal company shares dipped alongside renewable energy stocks on Wednesday after reports that President Donald Trump plans to pull the United States from a global accord on fighting climate change.

















                                                    "Green" mutual funds bounce back after Trump-induced retreat

After U.S. President Donald Trump's election last November, investors pulled nearly $68 million from so-called "green" mutual funds, reflecting fear that his pro-coal agenda would hurt renewable energy firms.

The U.S. government is auditing a foreign aid program that loaned almost $1 billion to renewable energy projects in Chile  including solar farms in such deep financial trouble that the loans may never be fully repaid, according to people familiar with the matter.
