Brian O’Neill’s practice focuses on broker-dealer and exchange regulatory compliance issues and advising companies on matters related to compliance with
SEC and self-regulatory organization (SRO) regulations. Brian counsels clients on a wide range of legal, regulatory and compliance matters, including
equity and options trading rules, listing of new equity and options products, options linkage, policies and procedures for trading systems development and
testing, sales practices, short sales, Regulation NMS, Regulation SCI, Form 1 exchange registration and amendments, Regulation ATS, market-making,
investment adviser regulation, SRO investigations, and development of compliance and testing programs. He also advises clients on equities and derivatives
market structure initiatives, including market access, market data, new products, transaction fees, and SEC policy initiatives.


Brian counsels broker-dealers, exchanges, alternative trading systems, clearinghouses and firms with market-making, proprietary trading and algorithmic
models. He also represents banks, asset managers and broker-dealers on regulatory requirements involving municipal advisors, investment advisers, and
securities-based swap dealers. In addition, he conducts independent compliance and technology reviews and audits related to enforcement action settlements.


Brian spent most of his legal career at regulators and SROs, including time at the SEC, FINRA, CFTC, NYSE Euronext, MIAX Options Exchange, and the state
regulator DISB. Over the course of his regulatory career, Brian has reviewed and/or drafted over 500 rules and corresponding 19b-4 rule filings for equity
and options exchanges. He managed the legal department of an exchange and served as lead regulatory counsel where he designed and drafted a Form 1 exchange
registration for a new equities exchange, and drafted comment letters, policies and procedures, and responses to regulatory inquiries. In addition, Brian
participated on industry-wide committees where he drafted model rules used by exchanges.


Prior to joining Bradley, Brian served as an executive director and compliance director at a large financial institution where he managed an international
team with responsibilities in APAC, EMEA, LATAM and North America. He created and managed a compliance program for investment management and wealth
management groups, developed policies and procedures, and designed risk controls to monitor and test the effectiveness of the new compliance program.


Brian is a former member of the Chicago Board of Trade, where he traded futures as a floor trader. He was also a Sergeant in the United States Marine
Corps, where he served as a heavy machine-gunner and Embassy Guard in Switzerland and Bangladesh.

Future of Music Coalition: Survey Data Portal for Artist Revenue Streams Project


Interactive app to visualize data on musicians' income


Product Designer, UX Consultant, UI Developer, Visual Designer, Responsive Design, Product Design, Mobile User Experience &middot View aggregated survey data… · More from over 5,000 US-based musicians showing income sources by role, musical genre, career length, and educational training. The site went live in Oct. 2015 and is in beta; feedback welcome! As a professional musician myself, I was extremely interested in this opportunity to visualize survey data directly about a very opaque topic: the revenue streams of working musicians. This was a pro-bono project I did for the FMC, and I helped the team form personas to steer the design, provided all design services from sketch through visual design, and implemented much of the front-end code (HTML/CSS and some JS/HighCharts). I also helped the team source engineering talent for the backend work.

About O’Neill
O'Neill, the original California surf, snow and youth lifestyle brand, was founded in 1952 when a young man named Jack O'Neill took his unstoppable passion for surfing and used it to beat Mother Nature at her own game. Pioneering the first neoprene surfing wetsuit, Jack had successfully found a way to extend his surf sessions in the bone-chilling breaks of Northern California. He opened up the garage doors to his first surf shop in Santa Cruz soon after.


O'Neill, the original California surf, snow and youth lifestyle brand, was founded in 1952 when a young man named Jack O'Neill took his unstoppable passion for surfing and used it to beat Mother Nature at her own game. Pioneering the first neoprene surfing wetsuit, Jack had successfully found a way to extend his surf sessions in the bone-chilling breaks of Northern California. He opened up the garage doors to his first surf shop in Santa Cruz soon after.

While many things have changed since those humble beginnings, Jack's initial vision of producing functional and innovative board riding products continues to lie at the core of everything the company does. O'Neill's core values—innovation in style and technology—have seen the brand devote itself wholeheartedly to the evolution of the action sports lifestyle. From the first line of surfing wetsuits and surf leash, to the world's first stitchless boardshorts, and range of groundbreaking wearable electronics, O'Neill's progressive spirit will always drive the company forward.
