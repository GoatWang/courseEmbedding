The Amazon founder’s net worth soared to $91 billion Thursday morning, but an afternoon pullback in Amazon stock meant he ended the day at $88.5 billion (and back below Bill Gates). Is it just a matter of time before he retakes the top spot? Judging by the size of the empire he’s amassed on his way to the top of the billionaires list, that could be a fair guess. Bezos’s empire encompasses not just e-commerce, but also news organizations, robotics companies and coupon sites. Oh, and ever heard of Google, Airbnb or Uber? Bezos is an investor in those companies, too. Here is a snapshot of his empire, as compiled by Visual Capitalist:LifestyleMarketWatch7 real ways for millennials to save money (not by brownbagging and skipping Starbucks)It seems young people get blamed for everything these days.
