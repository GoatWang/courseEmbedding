Conway Elected Chancellor of Elizabeth City State University
CHAPEL HILL, NC – Thomas E. H. Conway, Jr., who has served as interim chancellor of
                           Elizabeth City State University since January 1, 2016, has been elected to the position
                           on a permanent basis by the Board of Governors of the 17-campus University of North
                           Carolina. The appointment is effective immediately.
With the endorsement of the ECSU Board of Trustees, UNC Interim President Junius Gonzales
                           placed Conway’s name in nomination today (January 26) during a special meeting of the Board of Governors held in Chapel Hill.  Conway,
                           who had previously served as vice chancellor and chief of staff at Fayetteville State
                           University, succeeds Stacey Franklin Jones, who stepped down from the post on December
                           31.
In recommending Conway to the Board of Governors, Gonzales said:  “Thomas Conway is
                           a proud product of the University of North Carolina system, and he has devoted his
                           life’s work to it.  Over the past four decades, he has distinguished himself as senior
                           administrator on two other UNC campuses, and he brings to ECSU a deep understanding
                           of the mission, purpose, and promise of UNC’s historically minority institutions. 
                           I am convinced that he is the right individual to lead ECSU for the long haul, and
                           that belief has been enthusiastically affirmed by the ECSU Board of Trustees.  Dr.
                           Conway’s knowledge of the region, extensive administrative experience, and sound judgment
                           will be critical assets as we work together to ensure ECSU’s long-term success.  We
                           are most fortunate to retain a proven leader of such talent, integrity, and commitment.”
ECSU, which serves one of North Carolina’s most economically disadvantaged regions,
                           has faced a series of enrollment and financial challenges.  Over the past five years,
                           headcount enrollment has declined by more than 50%, and state appropriations and tuition
                           revenues have been reduced by nearly $10 million, or 21%.  Those losses would have
                           been greater without $3 million of short-term stabilization funding provided by the
                           2015 General Assembly. Contributing factors have included the implementation of tougher
                           UNC minimum admissions standards, state budget cuts throughout the recession, declining
                           tuition revenues, and reputational challenges stemming from key operational deficiencies.
Conway, 66, has served as vice chancellor and chief of staff at Fayetteville State
                           since 2008.  In that role, he has had primary responsibility for advancing university
                           priorities and coordinating and implementing the strategic planning process.
Prior to joining Fayetteville State’s senior leadership team, Conway served as dean
                           of undergraduate academic programs at NC State University (2005-08).  In that capacity,
                           he worked with faculty and administrators across all colleges and departments to enhance
                           the quality of the academic experience for NC State undergraduate students.
During his 32-year tenure at NC State, Conway also served as vice provost for enrollment
                           management and services (2002-05), associate vice provost for the Division of Undergraduate
                           Affairs (1998-2002); and director of the First Year College (1998-2000). He earlier
                           served as a counselor in NC State’s University Counseling Center, Trio Program director,
                           director of the academic support program for student athletes, and director of recruiting
                           and minority services for the College of Engineering. He also was a visiting lecturer
                           in the NC State College of Education’s department of counselor education.
 
Conway holds an undergraduate degree in agricultural education (1971) and a master’s
                           degree in guidance and counseling (1976) from NC A&T State University and earned a
                           Ph.D. in counselor education from NC State in 1994.
Active in a number of professional organizations, Conway has served as a consultant
                           for numerous historically minority institution and has written and spoken widely about
                           academic assessment, mentoring and leadership.  At the UNC system level, he has served
                           on the UNC Military Affairs Council and the UNC Task Force on Athletics and Academics.
A native of Louisburg, NC, Conway is married to the former Mychele Jenkins of Hollywood,
                           Florida, They have two adult children: Simon, a middle-school teacher in the Washington,

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/28/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.
