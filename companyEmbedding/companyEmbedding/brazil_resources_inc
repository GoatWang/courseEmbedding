Where applicable, a project is considered as such until the end of construction and ramp-up to full capacity (with the exception of mining projects, where the date of commissioning signifies the end of the project). Projects must have a:  a) Start date b) Estimate for completion c) Initial investment estimate  Data For state-owned projects, initial information about the start date and estimates for completion and investment are taken from original signed contracts, along with addendums and annexes. If original contracts cannot be obtained, information is taken from public documents, presentations, news articles from BNamericas archives, and external sources. In cases where contracts are subject to approval by legislators, the start date is the date of the law or legislative approval. In the case of private projects, information is taken from public sources, such as stock exchange filings, annual reports, company presentations, third party research and press releases. In judging the timing of investment decisions for private projects, great care was taken to differentiate between large projects receiving environmental approval and proceeding directly to construction, and smaller projects where the investment decision hinges on securing financing. Best care is taken to ensure that recorded data is correct at the time of entry and that each entry is backed with a relevant source. The greatest care possible was taken to ensure consistency of information in order make a like-for-like comparison in project costs. Insofar as the figures rely on disclosure by the organization or company responsible, the figures can be considered to be conservative in nature. No attempt was made to adjust figures for inflation during the course of research or for consideration of the time value of money. Validation In the case of state-owned projects, validation is carried out where possible with either a member of the consortium, EPC contractor, a relevant state agency or advisors to either party. Currency Projects costs are measured in US dollars. Where project costs are measured in a local currency, amounts are converted to US dollars at the date of the relevant announcement, signature or report.  Severity of deviation from original estimates The severity of deviation from original estimates is defined according to set criteria. Timing    Status Condition     Ahead of time 95% of original estimate or below (measured in months)   On time 95% to 105% of original estimate   Minor changes 105% to 120% of original estimate   Medium changes 120% to 160% of original estimate   Major changes Over 160% of original estimate    Budget    Status Condition     Ahead of budget 95% of original budget estimate or below   To budget 95% to 105% of original budget estimate   Minor changes 105% to 120% of original budget estimate   Medium changes 120% to 140% of original budget estimate   Major changes Over 140% of original budget estimate    Changes in Scope Changes in scope beyond the start date are not accounted for. Language definitions Where guidance is non-specific as to dates for completion, the following is used. Project to be completed by 2018 = December 31, 2017 Project to be completed in 2018 = December 31, 2018

VANCOUVER, May 22, 2014 /PRNewswire/ - Brazil Resources Inc. (the "Company" or "Brazil Resources") (TSX-V: BRI; OTCQX: BRIZF) is
 pleased to announce that it has submitted all necessary documents to
 Brazil's Department of Mining Production ("DNPM") in support of
 maintaining its mining license for the Company's Cachoeira Project in
 Para State, Brazil (the "Cachoeira Project"). The documents are also
 integral to the environmental licensing requirements described in the
 Company's news release dated April 7, 2014.


Stephen Swatton, President and CEO, stated, "The completion of this DNPM
 documentation is necessary to support the Company's right to mine the
 Cachoeira gold deposit and we expect it to form part of the foundation
 for a future preliminary economic assessment on the project."


As previously reported, the purpose of the submission is to extend the
 date for commencement of mining operations at the Cachoeira Project
 from April 2014 to June 2016. The documents submitted to the DNPM
 include required conceptual engineering studies and analysis, which the
 Company expects to incorporate into a future NI 43-101 preliminary
 economic assessment for the project. The documents submitted to the
 DNPM are not a preliminary economic assessment within the meaning of
 National Instrument 43-101 ("NI 43-101") and no production decision
 with respect to the Cachoeira Project has been made.


An updated NI 43-101 mineral resource estimate for the Cachoeira Project
 was released on April 18, 2013, as amended and re-stated October 2,
 2013 (the "Amended Report"), and is titled "Technical Report and
 Resource Estimate on the Cachoeira Property, Pará State, Brazil." The
 Amended Report was prepared by Greg Mosher, M.Sc., P.Geo., a qualified
 person and a Senior Geologist with Tetra Tech and independent from the
 Company, as defined under NI 43-101.  The Amended Report includes
 estimates of indicated mineral resources of 17.4 million tonnes at 1.40
 g/t Au or 786,737 ounces of gold and inferred resources of 15.6 million
 tonnes at 1.12 g/t Au, or 563,200 ounces of gold, at a 0.35 g/t cut-off
 grade.  For further information regarding the Company's Cachoeira
 Project, please refer to the Amended Report, a copy of which is
 available under the Company's profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.

Paulo Pereira, Brazil Resources' Vice President of Exploration has
 reviewed and approved the technical information contained in this news
 release. Mr. Pereira holds a Bachelor degree in Geology from
 Universidade do Amazonas in Brazil, is a qualified person as defined in
 NI 43-101 and is a member of the Association of Professional

Forward Looking Statements


This document contains certain forward-looking statements that reflect
 the current views and/or expectations of Brazil Resources with respect
 to its business and future events, including the Company's expectations
 respecting receiving an extension under its mining license for the
 Cachoeira Project and the planned completion of a preliminary economic
 assessment. Forward-looking statements are based on the then-current
 expectations, beliefs, assumptions, estimates and forecasts about the
 business and the markets in which Brazil Resources operates. Investors
 are cautioned that all forward-looking statements involve risks and
 uncertainties, including: the inherent risks involved in the
 exploration and development of mineral properties, the uncertainties
 involved in interpreting drill results and other exploration data, the
 uncertainties respecting historical resource estimates, the potential
 for delays in exploration or development activities, the geology, grade
 and continuity of mineral deposits, the possibility that future
 exploration, development or mining results will not be consistent with
 Brazil Resources' expectations, accidents, equipment breakdowns, title
 and permitting matters, labour disputes or other unanticipated
 difficulties with or interruptions in operations, fluctuating metal
 prices, unanticipated costs and expenses, uncertainties relating to the
 availability and costs of financing needed in the future, commodity
 price fluctuations, regulatory restrictions, including environmental
 regulatory restrictions, or any failure to integrate acquired companies
 and projects into the Company's existing business as planned. These
 risks, as well as others, including those set forth in Brazil
 Resources' filings with Canadian securities regulators, could cause
 actual results and events to vary significantly. Accordingly, readers
 should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements and
 information. There can be no assurance that forward-looking
 information, or the material factors or assumptions used to develop
 such forward looking information, will prove to be accurate. Brazil
 Resources does not undertake any obligations to release publicly any
 revisions for updating any voluntary forward-looking statements, except
 as required by applicable securities law.


Neither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider
 (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange)
 accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this news
 release.
