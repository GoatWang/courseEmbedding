How Can We Help?


















Jonathan R. Gdanski
Attorney


A trial attorney with Schlesinger Law Offices, P.A., Jonathan Gdanski focuses
	 on catastrophic personal injury cases, tobacco litigation, and products
	 liability lawsuits. Jonathan handled numerous cases that were established
	 after the Engle Tobacco Class Action. He managed more than 1,250 claims
	 that resulted in more than 10 million dollars in recovery on behalf of
	 his clients. In fact, he has recovered numerous multi-million dollar verdicts
	 for clients in the wake of the Engle Tobacco Class Action. Jonathan has
	 successfully handled cases in both State and Federal Court. Additionally,
	 Jonathan is lead Plaintiff’s liaison counsel in Broward County.
	 He also manages and oversees all the tobacco lawsuits that are pending
	 in Broward County.
Notable Case Results
Along with Crane Johnstone, Scott Schlesinger, and Steven Hammer, Jonathan
	 obtained a $75 million verdict against four major tobacco companies in
	 the U.S. This landmark case, Marvine Calloway as Personal Representative
	 of the Estate of Johnnie Calloway vs. R.J. Reynolds, et. al., is the first
	 in which punitive and compensatory damages were demanded from all four
	 tobacco companies. This is one of the largest awards in tobacco litigation history.
Another notable case involved a national class action against Toyota Motor
	 Sales. Along with Scott Schlesinger, Jonathan served as lead counsel in
	 a case involving a substantial defect in the 2007 Lexus ES350. A national
	 settlement that affected more than 100,000 vehicle owners was the result
	 of this certified class action.
Education and Personal Life
Prior to joining Schlesinger Law Offices, P.A., Jonathan was a clerk at
	 Stanley Rosenblatt P.A. in Miami. He graduated with honors from Yeshiva
	 College before obtaining his J.D. at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of
	 Law in New York. Jonathan is fluent in Hebrew.
Jonathan and his wife, Rachel, are parents to Eliora, Caleb, and Ezekiel.
	 The family lives in Miami Beach.

Wall Removed in Clean Bright Kitchen


The removal of walls has allowed for more space between the new island and the other side of the kitchen, giving the family the space to all be in the kitchen together. Brand new counter tops brighten up the space and give it a clean feel.

Updated Island


By knocking down one wall, Drew and Jonathan Scott were able to create a light, open atmosphere in this once cramped kitchen. A new island with a built-in sink and dishwasher is the perfect centerpiece, combining style and function.

Clear Sightline in First Floor


Jonathan and Drew removed the walls that closed off the Horsman house and have made the space open and inviting. Now, there is a clear sightline from the kitchen through the living room, allowing the Horsmans to keep an eye on their kids from anywhere on the first floor.

Reflective Chandelier in Formal Dining Room


Jonathan and Drew wanted to get rid of the old mismatched sofa and make room for a formal dining area in the Horsman home. The reflective chandelier creates more brightness in the room and the pop of color in the painting draws in your eye.

A wallpaper accent wall is much cleaner than the painted circus stripes this master bedroom used to have. The space feels brighter and cleaner as your eye is drawn through the space.

Light and Welcoming Living Room


Drew and Jonathan wanted to create a bright, open living room space. Light flows into the space from the huge window at the end of the room, while the light wall colors and neutral furniture help to reflect that light. Soft color can be found throughout the space in the accessories on the wall, furniture and tables.

Open Concept Kitchen with Breakfast Nook


After opening up and including the old family room area into kitchen, the new kitchen is almost twice as large as most other homes in the neighborhood. New paint, light colored custom cabinetry, a fireplace, stainless steel appliances, and a contemporary layout with large center island and breakfast nook make this new kitchen the central hub of the home.

Mature Modern Sitting Area


Hezekiyah and Nyahsa wanted a mature space to entertain friends, so Drew and Jonathan designed a contemporary space for the couple. By lightening up the wall shade, they were able to brighten the space, making it seem larger. Then, they brought in new, modern furniture that provides plenty of seating for a small gathering. The modern end table and lamp help to brighten up the space as the metallic water bar at the end of the space reflects light back into the rest of the room. Pillows and artwork adorn the space to add splashes of color.

Hezekiyah and Nyahsa's living room was dark and mismatched with different colored earth tone walls and large, dark furniture. Lightening the wall color and creating a defined seating area creates a mature and appealing living space.

Hezekiyah and Nyahsa's kitchen had a large table that overwhelmed the room. Replacing it with a smaller table and more streamlined chairs makes all the difference in creating a more functional space.

Modern Grown-Up Living Room


Cameron and Krystal wanted a grown up space to entertain their friends and family, so Drew and Jonathan brought in some modern furniture and updated the details of their outdated home. The neutral colors of the walls sofa, and chairs are complimented by natural elements around the doors and windows. The brothers then added color to the space by choosing warm blue and copper accent pillows and chrome candlesticks, chandelier and table lamps to help reflect light into the room.

This newly remodeled living room gets lots of light from the two large windows on the back wall of the room. Two full sofas give the space plenty of seating, while the end tables, coffee table, lamps, mirror and mantelpiece help tie together the contemporary style the hosts of Buying and Selling, Drew and Jonathan Scott, were hoping to achieve.

Clean Bright Bedroom


Drew and Jonathan Scott have designed a space that is bright and airy. Lots of natural light comes into the room through the large window to the right, while the reflective chandelier hanging from the ceiling helps to make the room even brighter. The bright feeling is aided even further by the metallic lamps that reflect light back into the room. The yellow accents bring to mind rays of sun, while the light walls and white furniture and carpet help give the space a clean look.

Small Bedroom from Converted Walk-In Closet


Noam and Ella needed more space in their home, so Drew and Jonathan turned the spacious master closet into a welcoming second bedroom. With plenty of natural light coming in through the large window and even more light emanating from the light fixture above, the space feels much larger than it is, and is very bright and inviting. The brothers used the daybed to draw the eye, with bright, luscious pillows and smart artwork above. The floating shelves and clock to the right help to break up the space and make it more personalized.

                                    Small House Needs a Full Curb Appeal Make-Over
                                  

Noam and Ela's suburban party pad suited their lifestyle when it was just the two of them. But with the arrival of a baby girl, they've got an all-new outlook and need a house that better suits their growing family. The problem is, they can't sell their current home for top dollar until the inside of their home gets a full make-over and their overgrown front garden gets some much-needed curb appeal. Jonathan and Drew are determined to solve the couple's real estate woes.  Drew sets  out to find them a sprawling budget-friendly income property and Jonathan's renovation plan includes turning a makeshift walk-in closet back into a bedroom. Meanwhile, the search for the couple's forever home proves trickier than expected. Ela throws Drew a serious curve ball as he struggles to match the couple's oversize wish list with their limited budget, but Drew is able to come up with a shrewd solution that puts a smile on everyone's face.

                                    Making Room for the Family
                                  

Francis and Juanita moved from India to Canada five years ago and bought the first house they could afford. They still love the property, but with two kids and a dream of reuniting their extended family under one roof, the house is now too small and they need to move fast. Drew and Jonathan step in to help, and the intervention starts with a complete overhaul of the family's cluttered interiors. In order to maximize the value of the property, Jonathan's goal is to make it look like a brand new home with an up-to-date kitchen and a total bathroom overhaul. Meanwhile, Drew leads the search for a sprawling and sophisticated new home, but with a limited budget and high demands, innovation is the name of the game.

Jeremy and Dayna's suburban bungalow was plenty big when it was just the two of them, but four kids later their crowded house is bursting at the seams. The couple has made several attempts to move on and even tried adding square footage with a new addition. But they've finally hit a wall and desperately need real estate therapy. The Property Brothers step in with a plan and while Jonathan tackles a laundry list of renos to increase the value of their current house, Drew leads the search for a spacious forever home. As the walls come down, Jonathan encourages an emotional Dayna to focus on the future. Meanwhile, Drew is determined to prove that change is good, but even after a 10-year house hunt, it seems Dayna's still not ready to make a move.

Sheryl and Frank's suburban neighborhood was a welcome change when they were looking to grow their young family, but with two soon-to-be teenagers, they're ready to find their forever home. The Property Brothers are determined to make it happen, but Frank has been burned before and doesn't trust agents or contractors, which could be a huge challenge. Superhero agent Drew pledges to be honest -- even if it hurts -- and is confident the results will speak for themselves. Meanwhile, Jonathan gets Sheryl and Frank on board for a budget makeover, but getting them to pitch in proves more difficult than he'd imagined.

Mini Bio (1)


          Andrew Alfred Scott, better known as Drew Scott, is an entrepreneur and entertainer. He is a well-known television personality, co-hosting HGTV's popular series Property Brothers (2011), along with his identical twin brother Jonathan Silver Scott. Property Brothers, which blends Drew's passions for real estate investment and TV production, focuses on helping families get into their dream homes without breaking their budget. As one of HGTV's highest-rated shows, it has several spin-off series, including Property Brothers at Home (2014), Property Brothers at Home on the Ranch, Buying and Selling (2012) and Brother vs. Brother (2013).Much like his brother Jonathan, Drew began acting in theater, improv and sketch comedy at a young age. His earlier television appearances have included roles on Smallville (2001), Breaker High (1997) and Madison (1993). Drew developed an interest in directing and producing while in high school, and to avoid being a struggling actor/director, he began investing in real estate as a means for funding their own productions. In 2004, after years of growing his successful real estate company, Drew decided to once again focus more energy on acting, directing and producing. As a young, driven filmmaker, Drew became heavily involved producing independent film. Drew and Jonathan founded their own production company that later evolved into Scott Brothers Entertainment, a multifaceted media entity creating scripted and unscripted productions. Over the years Drew has also produced film and TV events such as the Leo Film & TV Awards and the Producers Ball. Founded by Drew and Jonathan in 2011, the Producers Ball is an annual gala held during the Toronto International Film Festival. This highly exclusive gala honors the best of film, television and digital producers.Since Drew and Jonathan were approached with the television show concept for Property Brothers in 2009, the resounding success quickly led to multiple spin-offs, three of which are produced by their own Scott Brothers Entertainment: Brother vs Brother, Property Brothers at Home and Property Brothers at Home on the Ranch. The powerhouse producers continue to expand their reach behind the camera by producing multi-genre programming for numerous networks, starring other talent.In addition to both serving as Scott Brothers Entertainment's co-founder and executive producers, Drew and Jonathan showcased their longtime passion for music by releasing two country music songs on iTunes, "Hold On" and "Let The Night Shine In," in 2015. Their first book, Dream Home: The Property Brothers' Ultimate Guide To Finding And Fixing Your Perfect House, released April 4, 2016 and debuted on the New York Times Best-Seller List and Wall Street Journal Best-Seller List. The brothers have also expanded their furniture and decor line, Scott Living, into one of the largest and most recognized brands in the home space.Another passion for Drew is philanthropy. From working with the Children's Hospitals to coordinating initiatives to help underprivileged youth, he demonstrates the importance of giving back. Over the past few years, Drew has been collaborating with the network of artists involved in Paul Haggis Artists for Peace and Justice (APJ), a non-profit organization that supports communities in Haiti through programs in education and health. Drew has had the honor of helping raise millions of dollars and global awareness for APJ's efforts.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
