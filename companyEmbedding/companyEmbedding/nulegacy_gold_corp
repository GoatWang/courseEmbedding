              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.

NuLegacy Discovers New Gold Zone






 RENO, NEVADA--(Marketwired - July 25, 2017) - NuLegacy Gold Corporation (TSX VENTURE:NUG)(OTCQX:NULGF) reports that it has discovered a material new gold zone in a 'wildcat' step-out hole 375-meters (1,200 feet) west of the North zone of the Iceberg gold deposit. Location link: http://nulegacygold.com/i/pdf/GT072117.pdf
Drill hole IN17-03 encountered 125 meters (405 feet) of strongly brecciated jasperoid hosted in the Devonian Horse Canyon formation (an important host for gold in Carlin-type deposits) starting at a depth of 435 feet and extending to 840 feet. Within this formation an interval of:

85.4 meters (280 feet) returned assays of 0.64 grams/tonne of gold,
            
including 50.5 meters (165 feet) of 1.00 grams/tonne gold, and,
            
including 13.7 meters (45 feet) of 2.27 grams/tonne gold. 

"This new discovery is hosted in a long interval of the very favorable Horse Canyon formation located in a northwest striking cross-faulted structure (Location link), both of which are classic characteristics of the major gold deposits of the Cortez-trend, such as the neighboring Goldrush, Cortez Hills, and Pipeline deposits," said Derick Unger, Chief Geologist for NuLegacy Gold.
The target drilled in IN17-03 is at the structural intersection of the east-west striking Long fault and the recently located northwest striking "West Iceberg" fault located 500 meters west of and parallel to the Iceberg fault. The West Iceberg fault (not the be confused with the recently discovered Western Slope fault/anomaly some 500 meters further west - reported July 18, 2017) was identified in gravimetric and magnetic geophysics surveys and confirmed by recent CSAMT geophysics surveys. NuLegacy will promptly locate and drill several follow-up holes to better assess the magnitude of this discovery. 
As stated in our NR of Feb 28, 2017 NuLegacy's objectives for the spring/summer exploration program has been drilling 'wildcat' holes into several remote possibly high impact targets, as well as conducting extensive geophysical and geochemical surveys throughout the 98-sq. km (38-sq. mile) Red Hill property to find additional gold deposits (beyond the Iceberg); this new discovery is one of the results of that ongoing effort. 
Wildcat drilling of geophysical and/or geochemically generated targets throughout our 98-square km. property continues; additional significant results will be released as they are received. Drilling to further define and expand the gold content of the Iceberg gold deposit will resume in the fall. 
About NuLegacy Gold Corporation: NuLegacy is a Nevada exploration company focused on discovering additional Carlin-style gold deposits on its premier district scale 98-sq. km (38 sq. mile) Red Hill Project in the prolific Cortez gold trend of Nevada. 
To date NuLegacy has discovered the Icebergi and the Avocado Carlin-style gold deposits and has identified four more highly prospective exploration targets that are being drilled this year. 
NuLegacy's Red Hill Project is located on trend and adjacentiii to three multi-million ounce Carlin-type gold deposits (the Pipeline, Cortez Hills and Goldrush deposits) that are amongst Barrick Gold's largest, lowest cost and politically safest gold minesiii. 
Sampling Methodology, Chain of Custody, Quality Control and Quality Assurance: All sampling was conducted under the supervision of the Company's project geologists and the chain of custody from the project to the sample preparation facility was continuously monitored. A blank or certified reference material was inserted approximately every 20th sample. The samples were delivered to American Assay Labs' preparation facility in Sparks, NV. The samples were crushed, pulverized and sample pulps were analysed by American Assay Labs' certified laboratory in Sparks, NV. Pulps were digested and analyzed for gold using fire assay fusion and an atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) finish on a 30 gram split. All other elements were determined by ICP analysis. Data verification of the analytical results included a statistical analysis of the standards and blanks that must pass certain parameters for acceptance to ensure accurate and verifiable results. The reported intercepts are not necessarily true widths as there is insufficient data at this time with respect to the shape of the mineralization to calculate its true orientation.
i An established exploration target of 90-110 million tonnes of 0.9 to 1.1 grams of gold per tonne. These figures are conceptual in nature and derived from a compilation of 149 historic and 111 NuLegacy drill holes. To date, there has been insufficient exploration to define a mineral resource and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in the target being delineated as a mineral resource.
ii The similarity and proximity of these deposits in the Cortez Trend is not necessarily indicative of the gold mineralization in NuLegacy's Red Hill Project.
iii As extracted from Barrick's Q4-2013 and Q1-2014 reports.

			NuLegacy Gold Corp.		
 
NuLegacy Gold Corporation is an advanced stage Nevada exploration company focused on expanding its Carlin-style near-surface Iceberg oxide gold deposit with an established exploration target of 90-110 million tonnes of 0.9 to 1.1 grams of gold per tonne, and exploring for additional gold deposits on the 38-sq. mile (98-sq. km) Red Hill property located in the Cortez gold trend of Nevada.   The Iceberg gold deposit has similar geology to that of Barrick Gold's multi-million-ounce Pipeline deposit the discovery of which is credited to NuLegacy's Chief Geoscience Officer, Dr. Roger Steininger. The Iceberg is located on trend and adjacent to three of Barrick Gold's multi-million ounce Carlin-type gold deposits (the Pipeline, Cortez Hills and Goldrush deposits) that are amongst Barrick's lowest cost and politically safest gold assets.
