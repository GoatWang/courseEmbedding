Clinical Data
Peer-reviewed and published results from two Phase II clinical studies have demonstrated a significant decline in symptoms of depression following administration of D-cycloserine, one of the active ingredients in NRX-101 (Cyclurad™).
 
Findings from one of these studies, published in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, found that bipolar patients who were already receiving a 5-HT2a antagonist demonstrated more than a 50% reduction in symptoms of depression and a 75% reduction in suicidal ideation when ketamine and D-cycloserine were added to their treatment regimen. The therapeutic effect for these patients was sustained for eight weeks or longer.1
 
Findings from the other study were published in the International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology in 2013. These trial results provided the first proof of concept evidence that high doses of D-cycloserine induce antidepressant effects and reduces the severity of major depressive disorder.2
 
Additionally, preclinical data showing that the combination of Lurasidone (and other 5HT2a antagonists) and D-cycloserine led to a significant reduction in akathisia compared to control and to lurasidone alone. These findings are described in detail in several US and ex-US patent filings. Akathisia is defined as a state of agitation, distress, and restlessness that is an occasional side-effect of antipsychotic and antidepressant drugs.

Additional Indications
 
NeuroRx has the potential to build a pipeline of novel CNS-focused therapeutics. We believe that our leadership in the science of the N-methyl-D-asparate (NMDA) receptor, and how it may affect various disorders marked by depression, strongly positions us to pursue additional indications.
 
Our initial focus on Acute Suicidal Ideation/Behavior (ASIB) in Bipolar Depression. Thereafter the company plans to expand into ASIB in major depressive disorder (MDD). Other potential indications include chronic depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and bipolar depression marked by a less acute level of suicide risk.




Based on our scientific leadership around the NMDA receptor,
NeuroRx has the
potential to build a
pipeline of novel,
CNS-focused
therapeutics

Overview
 
 
 
NeuroRx’s lead drug candidate NRX-101 (Cyclurad™), if approved by the FDA, would be the first oral therapeutic for the treatment of Acute Suicidal Ideation/Behaviot (ASIB) in Bipolar Depression.  NRX-101 is a proprietary, oral-fixed dose combination of two FDA-approved drugs: D-cycloserine, an NMDA receptor modulator; and Lurasidone (Latuda®), a 5-HT2a receptor antagonist.
 
NeuroRx’s investigational treatment approach begins with a single infusion of ketamine, an FDA-approved anesthetic, followed by approximately six weeks of daily oral NRX-101.  The company expects to initiate a Phase 2b/3 clinical trial of NRX-101 for the treatment of ASIB in Bipolar Depression in early 2017.
 
NeuroRx believes that NRX-101, if successful, may offer a number of clinical advantages, including:
 

Specific Focus on Bipolar Patients:  Competitors’ pipeline products are focused on Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Treatment Resistant Depression (TRD).

 

Convenience: Unlike other treatments in development, NRX-101 (Cyclurad™) is expected to allow treatment on an outpatient basis after an initial stabilization with Ketamine in a clinical setting.

 

Not Expected To Be a Controlled Substance: Unlike Ketamine and its derivatives, the two active ingredients of Cyclurad™ are not controlled substances regulated by the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA).

 

Rapid Stabilization for Patients with a single dose of Ketamine: The NRX-101 treatment regimen will only require a single, initial administration of Ketamine which has shown an anti-suicidal benefit. Ketamine can cause dissociative effects (hallucinations); repeated administration could further increase this.

        Safety Considerations Known To Date of this Regimen:
        
Ketamine can cause dissociative effects (hallucinations); repeated administration could further increase this, vasovagous reactions.
Side effects for patients in a P2a combination study of D-cycloserine and 5HT2a included mild sedation, headaches and hypomania



 
 
 
 
 




NRX-101 (Cyclurad™) is being developed as the first oral, outpatient therapy for ASIB in Bipolar Depression, after initial stablization w/ ketamine.

NeuroRx, Inc. Company Profile

05:12 EDT 27th July 2017 | BioPortfolio











      NeuroRx, Inc. is a privately funded, clinical-stage pharmaceutical 
      company, developing NRX-101, the first oral therapeutic for the 
      treatment of Acute Suicidal Ideation and Behavior 
      (ASIB) in bipolar depression. NeuroRx draws upon 30 years of basic 
      science and clinical expertise in the role of the N-methyl-D-aspartate 
      (NMDA), a receptor that regulates human thought processes, particularly 
      depression and suicidality. Currently, there is no approved drug for 
      patients with suicidal ideation / behavior. Most antidepressants, 
      including the SSRI class, carry an FDA âblack boxâ warning for increased 
      risk of suicide, leaving hospitalization and electroconvulsive therapy 
      (ECT) as the standard-of-care for people with bipolar disorder 
      experiencing a suicidal episode. NeuroRx expects to start its phase 2b/3 
      clinical study of NRX-101 in a few months.

SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 4, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Biotech Showcase at the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference 








NeuroRx, a clinical stage biopharma company developing the first oral therapy for Acute Suicidal Ideation and Behavior (ASIB) in Bipolar Depression has received FDA clearance to proceed with its phase 2b/3 study protocol under an Investigational New Drug (IND) application and is now enrolling study sites for its clinical trial of NRX-101.  The clinical trial, details of which are posted on www.clinicaltrials.gov, seeks to demonstrate that NRX-101 is safe and effective in maintaining remission from ASIB and depression following initial stabilization with ketamine.
NRX-101 is a fixed dose combination of D-Cycloserine, a glycine site NMDA antagonist and lurasidone, a 5-HT2a antagonist.  The Mass General Clinical Trials Network and Institute will provide leadership for the clinical trial, and Prof. Andrew Nierenberg, M.D., Director of Bipolar Research in the department of Psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital will serve as the study's Principal Investigator.  Initial study sites will be posted shortly.
NRX-101 is the first oral drug to target ASIB, a life-threatening condition that kills more than 70 Americans a day and over 1,000 worldwide.  Today, there is no approved medicine to treat increased suicidal ideation; SSRI/SNRI's bear a warning about the risk of potential for increased suicidal ideation.  The current standard of care, as published by the American Psychiatric Association consists of voluntary or forced admission to a psychiatric hospital and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).  Although ECT is associated with a decrease in suicide deaths, it requires 6 – 10 sessions of general anesthesia and is known to cause memory loss and confusion. 
Ketamine – a potent NMDA blocker - is used off-label for Treatment Resistant Depression and Suicidal Ideation, but is known to cause hallucinations and other dissociative side effects. Recently released information on intranasal ketamine additionally showed a 20% incidence of vomiting.1 
Last month the FDA issued a warning about neurotoxicity associated with prolonged or repeated use of ketamine, particularly in those under 3 years of age and pregnant women.  NeuroRx recently completed a preclinical study in which NRX-101 showed no detectable neurotoxicity at any of the studied doses, meeting the requirement of at least a 10-fold safety margin of the maximum human dose. 
In the latest issue of the American Journal of Psychiatry information published by Dr. Joshua Kantrowitz and colleagues at the New York State Psychiatric Institute (NYSPI) showed that the neurochemical (i.e. biomarker) effect of NRX-101 can be evaluated using Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy to observe the levels of glutamate/glutamine (Glx) in the brain.  This non-invasive technique, akin to the MRI that is familiar to the public, has previously shown that patients with severe depression have markedly reduced levels of Glx in the brain.2  ECT has been associated with increased Glx levels in those who experience clinical remission from depression.  Comparable effects have not been seen with traditional SSRI antidepressants.  These findings in aggregate make Glx a potentially a promising biomarker to monitor the effect of NRX-101.
Kantrowitz and colleagues reported that D-cycloserine, a component of NRX-101 was shown to raise brain Glx levels in normal volunteers.3  This effect has similarly been demonstrated with ketamine, suggesting that drugs which target the brain's NMDA pathway, unlike SSRI antidepressants, may achieve some of the beneficial effects of ECT, without the undesirable side effects of ECT, such as memory loss.  In addition to the pivotal study just announced, ongoing studies will explore the effect of NRX-101 on brain Glx to demonstrate a biomarker effect consistent with the Congressional intent of the 21st Century Cures Act overwhelmingly passed by the House and Senate and signed into law this month.

About Bipolar Depression and Acute Suicidal Crisis
Bipolar disorder is characterized by significant changes in mood; one of the phases can be severe depression.  This phase can trigger thoughts of suicide.  For some patients these thoughts can become strong, creating an urge to develop a plan and/or act upon these thoughts, making Acute Suicidal Ideation and Behavior (ASIB) in Bipolar Depression a uniquely lethal disease. Approximately 100 Americans and more than 2,100 people worldwide end their lives each day., patients with bipolar disorder may account for up to 2/3's of all suicides. Those with acute suicidal crisis, as classified by FDA-recognized scales, have a 33% chance of death within six months. Despite the nature of acute suicidal crisis, many patients seek medical care or are brought to care by families and physicians. Yet, there is no currently approved therapy for the treatment of acute suicidal crisis and most commonly used antidepressants bear an FDA-mandated warning label identifying the potential to increase the risk of suicide.
About NRX-101 
NRX-101 is a potential rapid-onset and sustained treatment regimen that will be studied for Acute Suicidal Ideation and Behavior (ASIB) in patients with Bipolar Depression. The treatment, which is currently investigational and not approved for sale, is a patented, oral, fixed-dose combination of two FDA-approved drugs: D-Cycloserine, a N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor modulator; and lurasidone, a 5-HT2a receptor antagonist. NeuroRx's investigational treatment approach begins with a single dose of ketamine, an FDA-approved anesthetic, followed by approximately six weeks of daily oral NRX-101.  Results from two Phase II clinical studies, involving 26 and 8 patients respectively, have been published in peer-reviewed journals. Findings demonstrate more than a 50% reduction in symptoms of depression and a 75% reduction in suicidal ideation in bipolar patients treated with D-cycloserine, the active ingredient in NRX-101.
About NeuroRx, Inc.
NeuroRx, Inc. is developing NRX-101, the first oral therapeutic for the treatment of Acute Suicidal Ideation and Behavior (ASIB) in Bipolar Depression (ASIB).  Currently, there is no approved drug for patients with suicidal depression and current SSRI antidepressants bear an FDA warning about possible increased risk of suicide, leaving hospitalization and electroshock therapy as the only accepted treatment. The company is built upon 30 years of basic science and clinical expertise in understanding the role of the brain's NMDA receptor in regulating human thought processes, particularly depression and suicidality.  NeuroRx is currently initiating its Phase 2b/3 clinical trial of NRX-101.

NEW YORK, June 24, 2015 /PRNewswire/ --
NeuroRx, Inc., a clinical phase pharmaceutical company, reports first-in-man efficacy data for a newly-purposed class of drugs targeted towards rapidly reducing symptoms of depression and suicidality in patients with bipolar disorder and maintaining that effect over time. The peer-reviewed open label study in 8 patients, elements of which were published today in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, demonstrated a 50% reduction in symptoms of depression and a 75% reduction in suicidality in patients with treatment-resistant bipolar depression. While the use of ketamine for rapid reversal of depression is known, though not yet approved by FDA, its effect is known to be short-lived. This is the first clinical report showing that the ketamine effect can potentially be sustained for two months with additional agents. Elements of this study were presented earlier at the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology.
"Despite extensive evidence that 25% to 50% of those with bipolar depression attempt suicide and far too many succeed, there is currently no FDA-approved treatment for active suicidality in bipolar depression," said Jonathan Javitt, M.D., M.P.H., CEO. Javitt has previously been instrumental in developing high-impact drugs for Merck, Pfizer, Pharmacia, and Allergan and was appointed by Presidents Clinton and Bush to serve as a White House healthcare advisor.
"An FDA-approved treatment for bipolar depression with suicidality would address a critical unmet medical need and would bring hope to both patients and their loved ones around the world," said Wayne Pines, a former Associate Commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
The study was authored by Drs Kantrowitz, Halberstam, and Gangwisch, who were neither funded by nor associated with NeuroRx. As stated by the authors, "These findings provide proof-of-concept for further study of combined treatment with NMDAR antagonists and FDA-approved medications for bipolar depression."
Unlike most conventional antidepressant drugs which target the brain's serotonin pathway, ketamine and D-cycloserine target the brain NMDA receptor, a receptor first characterized by the inventor Prof. Daniel Javitt. M.D., Ph.D., in conjunction with psychiatric illness in 1991 and characterized over 25 years of academic research.
NeuroRx, Inc. is pioneering a staged treatment approach in which ketamine administration is followed by a combination of D-cycloserine and an FDA-approved mood stabilizer in order to maintain the ketamine effect. The combination is trademarked Cyclurad™ by the Company and was described in a patent application filed in 2013. This is the second peer-reviewed human study in which D-cycloserine has shown a statistically-significant antidepressant effect, but the first to use this compound to as a follow-on to ketamine.
"These first-in-man data are very encouraging.  If these findings can be confirmed in a larger scale study, Cyclurad could, if approved by FDA, potentially achieve important benefits for people with bipolar depression and suicidality," said Chaim Hurvitz, a founding investor and Director of NeuroRx.
The study was registered on ClinTrials.gov. The results describe an investigational therapy that is not currently marketed for human use. The individual elements of the treatment consist of drugs approved by FDA for other indications and that are being investigated for use in bipolar depression and suicidality. The next step is a larger scale clinical trial.
About bipolar depression 
More than 3 million Americans have bipolar depression, sometimes known as manic depression,[1] a subset of whom have active suicidality. Those with bipolar depression are more than twice as likely to commit suicide compared with patients who have other forms of depression.[2] Between 25% and 50% will attempt suicide at some point in their lives. Overall, patients with treatment resistant depression from all causes cost the healthcare system more than $120 billion annually.  
About NeuroRx, Inc. 
NeuroRx, Inc., is a privately-funded, clinical stage pharmaceutical company that is developing Cyclurad™, a proprietary formulation of D-cycloserine and Lurasidone, intended for the treatment of bipolar depression and suicidality. The Company is conducting R&D activities in the United States and Israel. More information at http://www.neurorxpharma.com
