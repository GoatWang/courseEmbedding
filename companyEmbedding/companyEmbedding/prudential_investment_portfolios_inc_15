How did we calculate this?
 To calculate how many years it might take to spend your guessed amount 
              in retirement, we used your age, years until retirement, and inflation rate 
              of 3%, and average spending data from the 2012 Expenditure Survey. 

Got it >



Based on national spending averages,
$1,500,000 will likely be spent by the age of 76.
How did we calculate this?
 Come up a little short? Guessing how much money you might
            need 
            to save for retirement that could last 30 or 40 years
            is pretty hard. 
            A good place to start: Think about how
            many years you may live in 
            retirement and how much income
            you'll need each year.

 What now?  


There are two steps you can take to help
            make sure your money lasts.




 1. Create a retirement income strategy 
 2. Maximize 
                  social security 




 Learn how annuities can help keep your money growing in 
                    retirement, and turn a lump sum into guaranteed income that 
                    lasts for as long as you live. See more → 
 If you are entitled to collect income from Social Security, 
                    there are steps you can take to help you maximize your benefit.

Source: Morningstar as of 3/31/17.
5. 9 out of 10 fixed income funds. Ranking based on Class Z share fixed income funds with 10-year history. Rankings for Class Z share fixed income funds that rank top 50% or better within their respective Morningstar Categories over the trailing 1-, 3-, & 5-year periods are 12/18 funds, 14/15 funds, and 11/13 funds, respectively. Source: Morningstar as of 3/31/17.
6. P&I/Towers Watson Top 300 Pension Funds ranking as of 12/31/16, published 9/30/16.
7. Based on U.S. Plan Sponsor rankings in Pensions & Investments as of 12/31/16.
Morningstar rankings are based on total return, do not include the effects of sales charges, and are calculated against all funds in each fund's respective Morningstar category. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Performance by share class may vary.
Star ratings shown are for Class Z shares, which are available to individual investors through certain retirement and wrap fee programs, and to institutions at an investment minimum of $5,000,000. Performance by share class may vary. In addition to the ones shown above, other classes, which contain either a sales load or a contingent deferred sales charge, are also available. These expenses will generally lower total fund return. Please see the prospectus for additional information about fees, expenses and investor eligibility requirements.
The risks associated with investing in these funds include but are not limited to: derivative securities, which may carry market, credit, and liquidity risks; short sales, which involve costs and the risk of potentially unlimited losses; leveraging, which may magnify losses; high yield (“junk”) bonds, which are subject to greater market risks; small/mid cap stocks which may be subject to more erratic market movements than large cap stocks; foreign securities, which are subject to currency fluctuation and political uncertainty; real estate, which poses certain risks related to overall and specific economic conditions as well as risks related to individual property, credit and interest-rate fluctuations; and mortgage-backed securities, which are subject to prepayment and extension risks. Sector funds and Specialty funds may not be suitable for all investors. Such funds are non-diversified, so a loss resulting from a particular security will have greater impact on the Fund's return. Fixed income investments are subject to interest rate risk, and their value will decline as interest rates rise. The risks associated with each fund are explained more fully in each fund's respective prospectus. There is no guarantee a fund's objectives will be achieved.
Some Morningstar Ratings may not be customarily based on adjusted historical returns. If so, an investment's independent Morningstar Rating metric is compared against the retail mutual fund universe breakpoints to determine its hypothetical rating for certain time periods. The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.
For the overall, 3-, 5- and 10-year periods, respectively, as of 3/31/17: Prudential Balanced Fund was rated 5 stars out of 721 funds, 5 stars out of 721 funds, and 5 stars out of 616 funds, and 4 out of 424 funds, respectively; Prudential High Yield Fund was rated 5 stars out of 596 funds, 5 stars out of 596 funds, 4 stars out of 471 funds, and 5 stars out of 318 funds, respectively; Prudential Short-Term Corporate Bond Fund, Inc. was rated 5 stars out of 444 funds, 4 stars out of 444 funds, 4 stars out of 359 funds, and 5 stars out of 257 funds, respectively; Prudential Total Return Bond Fund was rated 5 stars out of 851 funds, 5 stars out of 851 funds, 5 stars out of 750 funds, and 5 stars out of 538 funds, respectively; Prudential California Municipal Income Fund was rated 5 stars out of 69 funds, 5 stars out of 69 funds, 5 stars out of 65 funds, and 5 stars out of 52 funds, respectively; Prudential National Muni Fund was rated 5 stars out of 256 funds, 5 stars out of 256 funds, 5 stars out of 224 funds, and 5 stars out of 150 funds, respectively; Prudential QMA Small-Cap Value Fund was rated 5 stars out of 353 funds, 5 stars out of 353 funds, 4 stars out of 309 funds, and 5 stars out of 199 funds, respectively; Prudential Short Duration Multi-Sector Bond Fund was rated 5 stars out of 444 funds, and 5 stars out of 444 funds, respectively.

Investment Management
Insights, Strategies and Solutions
Our experienced professionals have expertise in a broad spectrum of traditional, alternative and non-financial assets.  We can work with you to develop and manage a portfolio tailored to your needs.






Portfolio Consulting
A collaborative dialogue with your portfolio manager
Your portfolio manager is a key member of your U.S. Trust relationship team and serves as your personal "chief investment officer." He or she will work with you to create an Investment Policy Statement, which serves as a blueprint for your portfolio by documenting your:

Objectives
Risk tolerance
Cash flow needs
 Tax situation
Wealth aspirations

Your portfolio manager's ongoing role is to incorporate our best strategic and tactical thinking, most relevant research analysis, current market insights and appropriate investment solutions into your portfolio. He or she will regularly monitor your portfolio to make sure it conforms to your Investment Policy Statement, which will be updated whenever there are significant changes in your life or goals.
Asset management
A more complete approach to asset allocation1
We analyze a wide range of asset classes, including hedge and private equity funds2 and global investment opportunities, as potential components of an asset allocation. In addition, we believe that true diversification requires managing for cash flows across and within asset classes in various market environments — not simply allocating according to a grid.
Your asset allocation will be based on the long-term expectations established for each asset class by our most senior investment professionals. Over the shorter term, however, your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks, and reflecting U.S. Trust insights about trends and themes relevant to you.
How you own your assets — personally or in trusts; in taxable or tax-exempt solutions — can have a material impact on the overall performance of your portfolio. At U.S. Trust we focus on this wealth structuring aspect of your portfolio in conjunction with managing the assets themselves.
Alternative Investments
SOPHISTICATED SOLUTIONS TO MEET YOUR NEEDS2
Alternative investments at U.S. Trust focus on non-traditional assets such as:

Hedge funds
Private equity
Real estate and tangible assets

Because performance is often differentiated from equity and fixed income markets, alternative investments may be an ideal complement to traditional investments. 
Through our access to the industry's premier managers, we are able to offer solutions that provide options for all client segments. And we support you every step of the way with knowledge built on our experience in alternatives, including industry-leading research, rigorous due diligence, and cutting-edge portfolio construction.
Drawing from the experience, resources and expertise of the firm, you and your portfolio manager can explore alternative investments that can help you pursue what matters most to you.
Specialty asset management
Expertise in nonfinancial assets3
Specialty asset management at U.S. Trust focuses on nonfinancial assets such as:

Farm and ranch land
Timberland
Oil and gas properties
Private businesses
Real estate

Our Specialty Asset Management team can work with your portfolio manager and wealth strategist, as appropriate, to integrate these real assets into your overall plan and portfolio.
We can help you realize your objectives with assets you already own, or help you acquire specific assets to take advantage of their capital growth and diversification potential — whether you own these assets outright or they are held in trust.
Our team of specialists can provide complete turnkey services including identifying and purchasing real property and providing ongoing management.
Capital markets
Sophisticated market-linked solutions4
Through our access to the resources of Merrill Lynch, one of the world's leading capital markets participants, we can tailor approaches to risks and opportunities in the foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity and equity markets. Derivative-based transactions target the risks you seek to hedge, and are designed to dovetail with your overall portfolio and wealth management strategies.

1 Asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
2 Alternative Investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds, and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity, and your tolerance for risk. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.
3 Nonfinancial assets, such as closely-held businesses, real estate, oil, gas and mineral properties, and timber, farm and ranch land, are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value.  Special risk considerations include natural events (for example, earthquakes or fires), complex tax considerations, and lack of liquidity.  Nonfinancial assets are not suitable for all investors.  Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager, and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax, or estate planning strategy.
4 Brokerage services are provided by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, a registered broker-dealer, Member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation.
Certain U.S. Trust associates are registered representatives with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S") and may assist you with investment products and services provided through MLPF&S and other nonbank investment affiliates.

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
Learn more about Philanthropy at U.S. Trust
Custody Services
Benefiting from the experience of dedicated custody specialists
U.S. Trust is the custodian of choice for many sophisticated investors with extensive and complex holdings. Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.

Information on share ownership of any class of the Fund is set forth in Exhibit E.
NEW SUBADVISORY AGREEMENT
On November�16, 2004, the Directors, including the Independent Directors, unanimously approved the Subadvisory Agreement and the recommendation by the Co-Managers of DAMI to replace State Street as the Fund's subadviser. At that time, the Directors also unanimously approved termination of the previous subadvisory agreement between the Co-Managers and State Street. The Directors decided to appoint DAMI as the Fund's new subadviser after the Co-Managers informed the Board that they no longer wished to retain State Street to provide investment advisory services to the Fund and notified State Street of their intention to terminate the subadvisory agreement for business reasons, as described below.
The Subadvisory Agreement contains terms and conditions similar to those of the subadvisory agreement with State Street, except as more fully described below under "Board Consideration of Subadvisory Agreement." See also "Terms of Subadvisory Agreement" below for a description of the new agreement. DAMI renders investment advice to the Fund in accordance with the investment objective and policies of the Fund as established by the Board and also makes investment decisions to purchase and sell securities on behalf of the Fund, subject to the supervision of the Co-Managers. The Co-Managers, not the Fund, pay an advisory fee to DAMI. Therefore, the change in subadviser does not mean any change in advisory fees paid by the Fund.
Section 15 of the Investment Company Act requires that a majority of a mutual fund's outstanding voting securities approve the fund's subadvisory agreements. However, on September�11, 1996, the SEC issued an order granting exemptive relief from certain requirements of Section 15 to PI and any future open-end management investment company managed by PI, provided that such investment company complies with the conditions of the order. According to the SEC's order, which is subject to a number of conditions, the Co-Managers may enter into subadvisory agreements on behalf of certain funds without receiving prior shareholder approval.
Board Consideration of Subadvisory Agreement
At a regular in-person meeting of the Board at which a majority of the Directors were in attendance (including a majority of the Independent Directors), the Board of Directors considered whether the approval of the Subadvisory Agreement was in the best interests of the Fund and its investors. Before approving the new 
2


Subadvisory Agreement, the Directors reviewed performance, compliance and organizational materials regarding DAMI and received formal presentations from the Co-Managers at their November�16, 2004 meeting. Representatives of DAMI participated in the discussions with the Directors at the meeting.
In making the determination to replace State Street with DAMI, the Directors, including the independent Directors advised by independent legal counsel, considered the following information:
���Nature, quality and extent of services to be provided.  The Board received and considered information regarding the nature and extent of services provided to the Fund by State Street under the current subadvisory agreements and those that would be provided to the Fund by DAMI under the new subadvisory agreement, noting that the nature and extent of services under the existing and new agreements were generally similar in that State Street and DAMI were each required to provide day-to-day portfolio management services and comply with all Fund policies and applicable rules and regulations. The Board also received and considered information regarding the nature and extent of services currently being provided by DAMI to other JennisonDryden or Strategic Partners mutual funds under existing
subadvisory agreements and those that would be provided to the Fund by DAMI under the new subadvisory agreement. The Board noted that the nature and extent of services under all of the agreements were generally similar in that DAMI was required to provide day-to-day portfolio management services and comply with all Fund policies and applicable rules and regulations.
��With respect to the quality of services, the Board considered, among other things, the background and experience of DAMI's senior management and the expertise of, and amount of attention expected to be given to the Fund by DAMI's portfolio management team. The Board reviewed the qualifications, backgrounds and responsibilities of the portfolio managers who would be responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund. The Board was also provided with information pertaining to DAMI's organizational structure, senior management, investment operations, and other relevant information pertaining to DAMI. The Board noted that it received favorable compliance reports from the Fund's Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) as to DAMI, summarizing his level of comfort from a compliance perspective with respect to the Manager's recommendation to hire DAMI.
��The Board concluded that it was satisfied with the nature, extent and quality of the investment subadvisory services anticipated to be provided to the Fund by DAMI and that there was a reasonable basis on which to conclude that the quality of investment subadvisory services to be provided by DAMI under the new subadvisory agreement should equal or exceed the quality of similar services provided by State Street under the existing subadvisory agreement.
���Investment performance of the Fund and DAMI.  The Board received and considered information about the Fund's historical performance. In particular, the Board considered comparative performance information of the Fund to that of Strategic Partners Small Cap Growth Fund (Small Cap Growth), another series of Strategic Partners Mutual Funds, Inc., in connection with the proposed reorganization of the Fund into Small Cap Growth. It was noted that DAMI is the subadviser of Small Cap Growth.
��This performance data reflected that Small Cap Growth outperformed the Fund by 1685 basis points, on a one-year basis. This data also reflected that the Morningstar Rating of Small Cap Growth was three stars, but that the rating of the Fund was one star, and that performance as of September�30, 2004 for the past three months, one, three, and five years, was �13.14%, �8.17%, �1.87%, and �7.38%, respectively, while the performance of Small Cap Growth as of September�30, 2004 for the past three months, one, and three years was �7.73%, 8.68%, 5.89%.
���Investment Subadvisory Fee Rates.  The Board considered the proposed subadvisory fee rate payable by the Co-Managers to DAMI under the proposed new subadvisory agreement. The Board noted, however, that any change in the investment subadvisory fee rate payable to DAMI would not impact Fund shareholders directly because those fees are payable by the Co-Managers and there was no change to the investment advisory fee rate payable by the Fund to the Co-Managers. As a result of the above 
3


considerations, the Board concluded that DAMI's proposed subadvisory fee rate under the new subadvisory agreement was reasonable.
���DAMI's Profitability.  Because the engagement of DAMI is new, there is no historical profitability with regard to its arrangements with the Fund. As a result, this factor was not considered by the Board. The Board noted that the Co-Managers pay the subadvisory fees, and therefore a change in the subadvisory fee will not change the fee paid by the Fund. Instead, any increase or decrease will increase or decrease, as applicable, the net fee rate retained by the Co-Managers.
���Economies of Scale.  The Board considered information about the potential of both the Co-Managers and DAMI to experience economies of scale as the Fund grows in size.
��The Board noted that the Co-Managers' advisory fee rate and DAMI's proposed subadvisory fee rate each contained breakpoints, and, accordingly, each reflected the potential to share economies of scale. Even though the asset levels at which breakpoints were provided in the subadvisory fee rate did not directly correspond to the asset levels at which breakpoints were provided in the advisory fee rate, the Board concluded that the breakpoint structure and levels established the potential for the sharing of economies of scale among the Co-Managers, DAMI and Fund shareholders as the Fund grows.
���Other Benefits to DAMI or its affiliates from serving as subadviser.  The Board considered potential "fall-out" or ancillary benefits anticipated to be received by DAMI and its affiliates as a result of DAMI's relationship with the Fund. The Board concluded that any potential benefits to be derived by DAMI included potential access to additional research resources, larger assets under management and reputational benefits, which were consistent with those generally derived by subadvisers to mutual funds.
The Board concluded that these reasons supported its selection of DAMI.
Information Concerning DAMI
DAMI was founded in 1838 as Morgan Grenfell Inc. and has provided asset management services since l953. As of December�31, 2004, DAMI managed approximately $37.9 billion in assets. The address of DAMI is 345 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10154.
Exhibit D contains information about the other mutual funds managed by DAMI with investment objectives and strategies similar to those of the Fund. Exhibit D also lists the principal executive officers and directors of DAMI.
Terms of the Subadvisory Agreement
The following summary of the Subadvisory Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the copy of the Subadvisory Agreement attached as Exhibit A to this information statement.
Under the Subadvisory Agreement, DAMI is compensated by the Co-Managers (and not the Fund) at an annual rate of 0.35% of the average daily net assets of the Fund not in excess of $100 million in assets; plus 0.30% of the portion over $100 million but not in excess of $300 million; plus 0.25% of the portion over $300�million but not in excess of $500 million; and plus 0.20% of the portion in excess of $500 million (the assets of the Fund are aggregated with the assets of other mutual funds managed by the Co-Managers for which DAMI serves as subadviser for purposes of calculating the fee). Under the previous subadvisory agreement, State Street was compensated by the Co-Managers (and not the Fund) at an annual rate of 0.50% of the average daily net assets of the Fund for the first $350 million of assets; and 0.45% over $350 million (the assets of the Fund are aggregated with the assets of other mutual funds managed
by the Co-Managers for which State Street serves as subadviser for purposes of calculating the fee).
The Subadvisory Agreement provides that, subject to Co-Managers' and the Board of Directors' supervision, DAMI is responsible for managing the investment operations of the Fund and for making 
4


investment decisions and placing orders to purchase and sell securities for the Fund, all in accordance with the investment objective and policies of the Fund as reflected in its current prospectus and statement of additional information and as may be adopted from time to time by the Board of Directors. In accordance with the requirements of the Investment Company Act, DAMI will provide the Co-Managers with all books and records relating to the transactions they execute and render to the Directors such periodic and special reports as the Board of Directors may reasonably request.
The Subadvisory Agreement will remain in full force and effect for a period of two years from the date of its execution, and will continue thereafter as long as its continuance is specifically approved at least annually by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities (as that term is defined in the Investment Company Act) of the Fund, or by the Board of Directors, including the approval by a majority of the Independent Directors, at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such approval; provided, however, that (1)�the Subadvisory Agreement may be terminated at any time without the payment of any penalty, either by vote of the Board of Directors or by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund, (2)�the Subadvisory Agreement will terminate immediately in the event of its assignment (within the meaning of the Investment Company Act) or upon the termination of the
Company's management agreement with the Co-Managers, and (3)�the Subadvisory Agreement may be terminated at any time by DAMI or the Co-Managers on not more than 60 days' nor less than 30 days' written notice to the other party to the Subadvisory Agreement.
The Subadvisory Agreement provides that, in the absence of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence in the performance of its duties, or reckless disregard of its obligations and duties thereunder, DAMI will not be liable for any act or omission in connection with its activities as subadviser to the Fund.
For the fiscal year ended October�31, 2004, State Street received $230,055 for advising the Fund.
Shareholder Proposals
As a Maryland corporation, the Company is not required to hold annual meetings of shareholders and the Directors currently do not intend to hold such meetings unless shareholder action is required in accordance with the Investment Company Act or the Company's Articles of Incorporation. A shareholder proposal intended to be presented at any meeting of shareholders of the Company must be received by the Company a reasonable time before the Directors' solicitation relating thereto is made
in order to be included in the Comapny's proxy statement and form of proxy relating to that meeting and presented at the meeting. The mere submission of a proposal by a shareholder does not guarantee that the proposal will be included in the proxy statement because certain rules under the federal securities laws must be complied with before inclusion of the proposal is required.

EXHIBIT A
STRATEGIC PARTNERS MUTUAL FUNDS, INC.
Strategic Partners Small Cap Growth Opportunity Fund
Subadvisory Agreement
Agreement made as of this 10th day of January, 2005 between Prudential Investments LLC (PI or the Manager), a New York limited liability company and Deutsche Asset Management, Inc. (DAMI or the Subadviser),
WHEREAS, the Manager has entered into a Management Agreement (the Management Agreement) dated May�1, 2003, with Strategic Partners Mutual Funds, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the Fund) and a diversified, open-end management investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 as amended (the 1940 Act), pursuant to which PI acts as Manager of the Fund; and
WHEREAS, the Manager desires to retain the Subadviser to provide investment advisory services to the Fund and one or more of its series as specified in Schedule A hereto (individually and collectively, with the Fund, referred to herein as the Fund) and to manage such portion of the Fund as the Manager shall from time to time direct, and the Subadviser is willing to render such investment advisory services; and
NOW, THEREFORE, the Parties agree as follows:
1.��(a)�Subject to the supervision of the Manager and the Board of Directors of the Fund, the Subadviser shall manage such portion of the Fund's portfolio, including the purchase, retention and disposition thereof, in accordance with the Fund's investment objectives, policies and restrictions as stated in its then current prospectus and statement of additional information (such Prospectus and Statement of Additional Information as currently in effect and as amended or supplemented from time to time, being herein called the "Prospectus"), and subject to the following understandings:
(i)��The Subadviser shall provide supervision of such portion of the Fund's investments as the Manager shall direct, and shall determine from time to time what investments and securities will be purchased, retained, sold or loaned by the Fund, and what portion of the assets will be invested or held uninvested as cash.
(ii)��In the performance of its duties and obligations under this Agreement, the Subadviser shall act in conformity with the copies of the Articles of Incorporation, By-Laws and Prospectus of the Fund provided to it by the Manager (the Fund Documents) and with the instructions and directions of the Manager and of the Board of Directors of the Fund, co-operate with the Manager's (or its designee's) personnel responsible for monitoring the Fund's compliance and will conform to and comply with the requirements of the 1940 Act, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and all other applicable federal and state laws and regulations. In connection therewith, the Subadviser shall, among other things, prepare and file such reports as are,
or may in the future be, required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission). The Manager shall provide Subadviser timely with copies of any updated Fund documents.
(iii)��The Subadviser shall determine the securities and futures contracts to be purchased or sold by such portion of the Fund's portfolio, as applicable, and will place orders with or through such persons, brokers, dealers or futures commission merchants (including but not limited to Prudential Securities Incorporated (or any broker or dealer affiliated with the Subadviser) to carry out the policy with respect to brokerage as set forth in the Fund's Prospectus or as the Board of Directors may direct from time to time. In providing the Fund with investment supervision, it is recognized that the Subadviser will give primary consideration to securing the most favorable price and efficient execution. Within the framework of this policy, the Subadviser may 
A-1


consider the financial responsibility, research and investment information and other services provided by brokers, dealers or futures commission merchants who may effect or be a party to any such transaction or other transactions to which the Subadviser's other clients may be a party. The Manager (or Subadviser) to the Fund each shall have discretion to effect investment transactions for the Fund through broker-dealers (including, to the extent legally permissible, broker-dealers affiliated with the Subadviser(s)) qualified to obtain best execution of such transactions who provide brokerage and/or research services, as such services are defined in Section 28(e)�of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"), and to cause the Fund to pay any such broker-dealers an amount of commission for effecting a portfolio transaction in excess of the amount of commission another broker-dealer would
have charged for effecting that transaction, if the brokerage or research services provided by such broker-dealer, viewed in light of either that particular investment transaction or the overall responsibilities of the Manager (or the Subadviser) with respect to the Fund and other accounts as to which they or it may exercise investment discretion (as such term is defined in Section�3(a)(35)�of the 1934 Act), are reasonable in relation to the amount of commission.
On occasions when the Subadviser deems the purchase or sale of a security or futures contract to be in the best interest of the Fund as well as other clients of the Subadviser, the Subadviser, to the extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations, may, but shall be under no obligation to, aggregate the securities or futures contracts to be sold or purchased in order to obtain the most favorable price or lower brokerage commissions and efficient execution. In such event, allocation of the securities or futures contracts so purchased or sold, as well as the expenses incurred in the transaction, will be made by the Subadviser in the manner
the Subadviser considers to be the most equitable and consistent with its fiduciary obligations to the Fund and to such other clients.
(iv)��The Subadviser shall maintain all books and records with respect to the Fund's portfolio transactions effected by it as required by subparagraphs (b)(5), (6), (7), (9), (10)�and (11)�and paragraph (f)�of Rule�31a-1 under the 1940 Act, and shall render to the Fund's Board of Directors such periodic and special reports as the Directors may reasonably request. The Subadviser shall make reasonably available its employees and officers for consultation with any of the Directors or officers or employees of the Fund with respect to any matter discussed herein, including, without limitation, the valuation of the Fund's securities.
(v)��The Subadviser or an affiliate shall provide the Fund's Custodian on each business day with information relating to all transactions concerning the portion of the Fund's assets it manages, and shall provide the Manager with such information upon request of the Manager.
(vi)��The investment management services provided by the Subadviser hereunder are not to be deemed exclusive, and the Subadviser shall be free to render similar services to others. Conversely, the Subadviser and Manager understand and agree that if the Manager manages the Fund in a "manager-of-managers" style, the Manager will, among other things, (i)�continually evaluate the performance of the Subadviser through quantitative and qualitative analysis and consultations with the Subadviser, (ii)�periodically make recommendations to the Fund's Board as to whether the contract with one or more subadvisers should be renewed, modified, or terminated, and (iii)�periodically report to the Fund's Board regarding the results of its evaluation and monitoring functions. The Subadviser recognizes that its services may be terminated
or modified pursuant to this process in accordance with this Agreement.
(vii)��The Subadviser acknowledges that the Manager and the Fund intend to rely on Rule�17a-10, Rule�10f-3, Rule�12d3-1 and Rule�17e-1 under the 1940 Act, and the Subadviser hereby agrees that it shall not consult with any other subadviser to the Fund with respect to transactions in securities for the Fund's portfolio or any other transactions of Fund assets.
A-2


(b)��The Subadviser shall authorize and permit, consistent with its internal policies and procedures, any of its directors, officers and employees who may be elected as Directors or officers of the Fund to serve in the capacities in which they are elected. Services to be furnished by the Subadviser under this Agreement may be furnished through the medium of any of such directors, officers or employees.
(c)��The Subadviser shall timely furnish to the Manager all information relating to the Subadviser's services hereunder reasonably required by the Manager to keep the other books and records of the Fund required by Rule�31a-1 under the 1940 Act or any successor regulation. The Subadviser agrees that all records which it maintains for the Fund are the property of the Fund, and the Subadviser will surrender promptly to the Fund any of such records upon the Fund's request, provided, however, that the Subadviser may retain a copy of such records. The Subadviser further agrees to preserve for the periods prescribed by Rule�31a-2 of the Commission under the 1940 Act or any successor regulation any such records as are required to be maintained by it pursuant to paragraph 1(a)�hereof.
(d)��In connection with its duties under this Agreement, the Subadviser agrees to maintain adequate compliance procedures to ensure its compliance with the 1940 Act, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, and other applicable state and federal regulations.
(e)��The Subadviser shall furnish to the Manager copies of all records prepared in connection with (i)�the performance of this Agreement and (ii)�the maintenance of compliance procedures pursuant to paragraph 1(d)�hereof, in each case as the Manager may reasonably request.
(f)��The Subadviser shall be responsible for the voting of all shareholder proxies with respect to the investments and securities held in the Fund's portfolio, subject to such reporting and other requirements as shall be established by the Manager.
(g)��Upon reasonable request from the Manager, the Subadviser (through a qualified person) will assist the valuation committee of the Fund or the Manager in valuing securities of the Fund as may be required from time to time, including making available information of which the Subadviser has knowledge related to the securities being valued.
2.��The Manager shall continue to have responsibility for all services to be provided to the Fund pursuant to the Management Agreement and, as more particularly discussed above, shall oversee and review the Subadviser's performance of its duties under this Agreement. The Manager shall provide (or cause the Fund's custodian to provide) timely information to the Subadviser regarding such matters as the composition of assets in the portion of the Fund managed by the Subadviser, cash requirements and cash available for investment in such portion of the Fund, and all other information as may be reasonably necessary for the Subadviser to perform its duties hereunder (including any excerpts of minutes of meetings of the Board of Directors of the Fund that affect the duties of the Subadviser).
3.��For the services provided and the expenses assumed pursuant to this Agreement, the Manager shall pay the Subadviser as full compensation therefor, a fee equal to the percentage of the Fund's average daily net assets of the portion of the Fund managed by the Subadviser as described in the attached Schedule A. Liability for payment of compensation by the Manager to the Subadviser under this Agreement is contingent upon the Manager's receipt of payment from the Fund for management services described under the Management Agreement between the Fund and the Manager. Expense caps or fee waivers for the Fund that may be agreed to by the Manager, but not agreed to by the Subadviser, shall not cause a reduction in the amount of the payment to the Subadviser by the Manager.
4.��The Subadviser shall not be liable for any error of judgment or for any loss suffered by the Fund or the Manager in connection with the matters to which this Agreement relates, except a loss resulting from willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence on the Subadviser's part in the performance of its duties or from its reckless disregard of its obligations and duties under this Agreement, provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to waive any rights the Manager or the Fund may have against the Subadviser under federal or state securities laws. The Manager shall indemnify the 
A-3


Subadviser, its affiliated persons, its officers, directors and employees, for any liability and expenses, including attorneys' fees, which may be sustained as a result of the Manager's willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence, reckless disregard of its duties hereunder or violation of applicable law, including, without limitation, the 1940 Act and federal and state securities laws. The Subadviser shall indemnify the Manager, its affiliated persons, its officers, directors and employees, for any liability and expenses, including attorneys' fees, which may be sustained as a result of the Subadviser's willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence, or reckless disregard of its duties hereunder or violation of applicable law, including, without limitation, the 1940 Act and federal and state securities laws.
5.��This Agreement shall continue in effect for a period of more than two years from the date hereof only so long as such continuance is specifically approved at least annually in conformity with the requirements of the 1940 Act; provided, however, that this Agreement may be terminated by the Fund at any time, without the payment of any penalty, by the Board of Directors of the Fund or by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the Fund, or by the Manager or the Subadviser at any time, without the payment of any penalty, on not more than 60 days' nor less than 30 days' written notice to the other party. This Agreement shall terminate automatically in the event of its assignment (as defined in the 1940 Act) or upon the termination of the Management Agreement. The Subadviser agrees that it will promptly notify the Fund and the Manager of the occurrence or anticipated
occurrence of any event that would result in the assignment (as defined in the 1940 Act) of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, a change or anticipated change in control (as defined in the 1940�Act) of the Subadviser; provided that the Subadviser need not provide notice of such an anticipated event before the anticipated event is a matter of public record.
Any notice or other communication required to be given pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed duly given if delivered or mailed by registered mail, postage prepaid, (1)�to the Manager at Gateway Center Three, 100 Mulberry Street, 4th Floor, Newark, NJ 07102-4077, Attention: Secretary; (2)�to the Fund at Gateway Center Three, 4th Floor, 100 Mulberry Street, Newark, NJ 07102-4077, Attention:
Secretary; or (3)�to the Subadviser at 280 Park Avenue, New York, NY 10017.
6.��Nothing in this Agreement shall limit or restrict the right of any of the Subadviser's directors, officers or employees who may also be a Trustee, officer or employee of the Fund to engage in any other business or to devote his or her time and attention in part to the management or other aspects of any business, whether of a similar or a dissimilar nature, nor limit or restrict the Subadviser's right to engage in any other business or to render services of any kind to any other corporation, firm, individual or association.
7.��During the term of this Agreement, the Manager agrees to furnish the Subadviser at its principal office all prospectuses, proxy statements, reports to shareholders, sales literature or other material prepared for distribution to shareholders of the Fund or the public, which refer to the Subadviser in any way, prior to use thereof and not to use material if the Subadviser reasonably objects in writing five business�days (or such other time as may be mutually agreed) after receipt thereof in advance of public distribution. Sales literature may be furnished to the Subadviser hereunder by first-class or overnight mail, facsimile transmission equipment or hand delivery.
8.��This Agreement may be amended by mutual consent, but the consent of the Fund must be obtained in conformity with the requirements of the 1940 Act.
9.��This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York.
10.��Any question of interpretation of any term or provision of this Agreement having a counterpart in or otherwise derived from a term or provision of the 1940 Act, shall be resolved by reference to such term or provision of the 1940 Act and to interpretations thereof, if any, by the United States courts or, in the absence of any controlling decision of any such court, by rules, regulations or orders of the Commission issued pursuant to the 1940 Act. In addition, where the effect of a requirement of the 1940�Act, reflected in any provision of this Agreement, is related by rules, regulation or order of the Commission, such provision shall be deemed to incorporate the effect of such rule, regulation or order.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The Board of Directors and Shareholders

Prudential Investment Portfolios, Inc. 17:


In planning and performing our audit of the financial
statements of Prudential Total Return Bond Fund (formerly
Prudential Total Return Bond Fund, Inc), a series of
Prudential Investment Portfolios, Inc. 17 (hereafter referred
to as the "Fund"), as of and for the year ended October 31,
2013, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered the
Fund's internal control over financial reporting, including
controls over safeguarding securities, as a basis for
designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of
expressing our opinion on the financial statements and to
comply with the requirements of Form N-SAR, but not for the
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Fund's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly,
we express no such opinion.


Management of the Fund is responsible for establishing and
maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting. In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and
judgments by management are required to assess the expected
benefits and related costs of controls. A company's internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;

(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection
of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
company's assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.


Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.


A deficiency in internal control over financial reporting
exists when the design or operation of a control does not
allow management or employees, in the normal course of
performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect
misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a
deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal
control over financial reporting, such that there is a
reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the
Fund's annual or interim financial statements will not be
prevented or detected on a timely basis.


Our consideration of the Fund's internal control over
financial reporting was for the limited purpose described in
the first paragraph and would not necessarily disclose all
deficiencies in internal control that might be material
weaknesses under standards established by the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). However, we noted
no deficiencies in the Fund's internal control over financial
reporting and its operation, including controls over
safeguarding securities, that we consider to be a material
weakness as defined above as of October 31, 2013.


This report is intended solely for the information and use of
management and the Board of Directors of the Fund and the
Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be
and should not be used by anyone other than these specified
parties.

----------------                                                                
*Filed herewith.                                                                

Item 25. Persons Controlled by or under Common Control with Registrant.         

None.                                                                 

Item 26. Number of Holders of Securities.                                       

    As of December 1, 1995 there were 98,939,  170,176 and 1,093 record  holders
of Class A, Class B and Class C shares of common stock,  respectively,  $.01 par
value per share, of the Registrant.                                             

Item 27. Indemnification.                                                       

    As permitted by Sections 17(h) and (i) of the Investment Company Act of 1940
(the 1940 Act) and  pursuant to Article VI of the Fund's  By-Laws  (Exhibit 2 to
the Registration Statement),  officers,  directors,  employees and agents of the
Registrant  will not be  liable to the  Registrant,  any  stockholder,  officer,
director,  employee,  agent or other  person  for any  action or failure to act,
except  for  bad  faith,  willful  misfeasance,  gross  negligence  or  reckless
disregard  of  duties,   and  those  individuals  may  be  indemnified   against
liabilities in connection with the Registrant,  subject to the same  exceptions.
Section 2-418 of Maryland  General  Corporation Law permits  indemnification  of
directors who acted in good faith and  reasonably  believed that the conduct was
in the best  interests of the  Registrant.  As permitted by Section 17(i) of the
1940 Act, pursuant to Section 10 of each Distribution  Agreement (Exhibits 6(b),
6(c) and 6(d) to the Registration Statement), each Distributor of the Registrant
may be indemnified  against  liabilities which it may incur,  except liabilities
arising  from bad faith,  gross  negligence,  willful  misfeasance  or  reckless
disregard of duties.                                                            

    Insofar as indemnification  for liabilities arising under the Securities Act
of 1933 (Securities Act) may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling
persons of the Registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions or otherwise, the
Registrant  has been advised that in the opinion of the  Securities and Exchange
Commission  such  indemnification  is against  public policy as expressed in the
1940  Act  and is,  therefore,  unenforceable.  In the  event  that a claim  for
indemnification  against  such  liabilities  (other  than  the  payment  by  the
Registrant of expenses  incurred or paid by a director,  officer or  controlling
person of the  Registrant  in  connection  with the  successful  defense  of any
action, suit or proceeding) is asserted against the Registrant by such director,
officer or controlling  person in connection  with the shares being  registered,
the  Registrant  will,  unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been
settled by controlling precedent,  submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction
the question  whether such  indemnification  by it is against  public  policy as
expressed in the 1940 Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such
issue.                                                                          

    The Registrant intends to purchase an insurance policy insuring its officers
and directors against liabilities, and certain costs of defending claims against
such officers and  directors,  to the extent such officers and directors are not
found to have committed

conduct  constituting  willful  misfeasance,  bad  faith,  gross  negligence  or
reckless disregard in the performance of their duties. The insurance policy also
insures the Registrant against the cost of indemnification  payments to officers
and directors under certain circumstances.                                      

    Section 9 of the  Management  Agreement  (Exhibit  5(a) to the  Registration
Statement)  and  Section 4 of the  Subadvisory  Agreement  (Exhibit  5(b) to the
Registration   Statement)   limit  the  liability  of  Prudential   Mutual  Fund
Management,   Inc.  (PMF)  and  The  Prudential  Investment  Corporation  (PIC),
respectively,  to  liabilities  arising from willful  misfeasance,  bad faith or
gross negligence in the performance of their respective  duties or from reckless
disregard  by  them  of  their  respective  obligations  and  duties  under  the
agreements.                                                                     

    The  Registrant  hereby  undertakes  that it will apply the  indemnification
provisions of its By-Laws and each Distribution Agreement in a manner consistent
with Release No. 11330 of the Securities and Exchange  Commission under the 1940
Act so long as the interpretation of Sections 17(h) and 17(i) of such Act remain
in effect and are consistently applied.

How did we calculate this?
 To calculate how many years it might take to spend your guessed amount 
              in retirement, we used your age, years until retirement, and inflation rate 
              of 3%, and average spending data from the 2012 Expenditure Survey. 

Got it >



Based on national spending averages,
$1,500,000 will likely be spent by the age of 76.
How did we calculate this?
 Come up a little short? Guessing how much money you might
            need 
            to save for retirement that could last 30 or 40 years
            is pretty hard. 
            A good place to start: Think about how
            many years you may live in 
            retirement and how much income
            you'll need each year.

There are two steps you can take to help
            make sure your money lasts.




 1. Create a retirement income strategy 
 2. Maximize 
                  social security 




 Learn how annuities can help keep your money growing in

Source: Morningstar as of 3/31/17.
5. 9 out of 10 fixed income funds. Ranking based on Class Z share fixed income funds with 10-year history. Rankings for Class Z share fixed income funds that rank top 50% or better within their respective Morningstar Categories over the trailing 1-, 3-, & 5-year periods are 12/18 funds, 14/15 funds, and 11/13 funds, respectively. Source: Morningstar as of 3/31/17.
6. P&I/Towers Watson Top 300 Pension Funds ranking as of 12/31/16, published 9/30/16.
7. Based on U.S. Plan Sponsor rankings in Pensions & Investments as of 12/31/16.
Morningstar rankings are based on total return, do not include the effects of sales charges, and are calculated against all funds in each fund's respective Morningstar category. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Performance by share class may vary.
Star ratings shown are for Class Z shares, which are available to individual investors through certain retirement and wrap fee programs, and to institutions at an investment minimum of $5,000,000. Performance by share class may vary. In addition to the ones shown above, other classes, which contain either a sales load or a contingent deferred sales charge, are also available. These expenses will generally lower total fund return. Please see the prospectus for additional information about fees, expenses and investor eligibility requirements.
The risks associated with investing in these funds include but are not limited to: derivative securities, which may carry market, credit, and liquidity risks; short sales, which involve costs and the risk of potentially unlimited losses; leveraging, which may magnify losses; high yield (“junk”) bonds, which are subject to greater market risks; small/mid cap stocks which may be subject to more erratic market movements than large cap stocks; foreign securities, which are subject to currency fluctuation and political uncertainty; real estate, which poses certain risks related to overall and specific economic conditions as well as risks related to individual property, credit and interest-rate fluctuations; and mortgage-backed securities, which are subject to prepayment and extension risks. Sector funds and Specialty funds may not be suitable for all investors. Such funds are non-diversified, so a loss resulting from a particular security will have greater impact on the Fund's return. Fixed income investments are subject to interest rate risk, and their value will decline as interest rates rise. The risks associated with each fund are explained more fully in each fund's respective prospectus. There is no guarantee a fund's objectives will be achieved.
Some Morningstar Ratings may not be customarily based on adjusted historical returns. If so, an investment's independent Morningstar Rating metric is compared against the retail mutual fund universe breakpoints to determine its hypothetical rating for certain time periods. The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.
For the overall, 3-, 5- and 10-year periods, respectively, as of 3/31/17: Prudential Balanced Fund was rated 5 stars out of 721 funds, 5 stars out of 721 funds, and 5 stars out of 616 funds, and 4 out of 424 funds, respectively; Prudential High Yield Fund was rated 5 stars out of 596 funds, 5 stars out of 596 funds, 4 stars out of 471 funds, and 5 stars out of 318 funds, respectively; Prudential Short-Term Corporate Bond Fund, Inc. was rated 5 stars out of 444 funds, 4 stars out of 444 funds, 4 stars out of 359 funds, and 5 stars out of 257 funds, respectively; Prudential Total Return Bond Fund was rated 5 stars out of 851 funds, 5 stars out of 851 funds, 5 stars out of 750 funds, and 5 stars out of 538 funds, respectively; Prudential California Municipal Income Fund was rated 5 stars out of 69 funds, 5 stars out of 69 funds, 5 stars out of 65 funds, and 5 stars out of 52 funds, respectively; Prudential National Muni Fund was rated 5 stars out of 256 funds, 5 stars out of 256 funds, 5 stars out of 224 funds, and 5 stars out of 150 funds, respectively; Prudential QMA Small-Cap Value Fund was rated 5 stars out of 353 funds, 5 stars out of 353 funds, 4 stars out of 309 funds, and 5 stars out of 199 funds, respectively; Prudential Short Duration Multi-Sector Bond Fund was rated 5 stars out of 444 funds, and 5 stars out of 444 funds, respectively.

 One Man's 9-Minute Secret to Retiring Rich  by Investing Daily Staff - May 1, 2017     Years ago Jim Fink knew he’d need to make a change if he was ever going to retire.
It's a similar problem a lot of Americans are dealing with as they approach retirement.
He had a good job, was squirreling away money in his IRA, and investing in stocks—but wasn’t really getting anywhere.
The piddly returns he was making that way seemed like a waste of time. He needed something better.
Luckily Jim worked at an office building in Chicago, close to the financial district.
One day he ran into a "trader" who shared an approach that would go on to change Jim's life forever.
So Jim started experimenting with the approach he learned...
Before long he was generating extra monthly income like $1,200, $1,800, and $2,100... and all in a matter of weeks!
His nest egg began to grow exponentially, and before long he had turned a mere $50,000 into a massive $5.3 million.
Now, years later, Jim trades full-time—and lets independent-minded investors follow the exact approach he's now perfected.
It’s an easy, step-by-step process that takes just 9 minutes to per week.
Best of all, unlike many risky approaches to making money, there's a built-in safety net unique to his strategy that can make it safer than traditional investing.
In fact, safety-loving Warren Buffett pulled in $4.7 billion following this exact approach not too long ago.
The full story behind how Jim makes his trades is right here.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
