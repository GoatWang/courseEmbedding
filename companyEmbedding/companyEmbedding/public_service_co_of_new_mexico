About PNM

	Shining a Light on Progress

	As New Mexicans who live and work here in the Land of Enchantment, we are committed to doing everyting we can to preserve our beautiful environment. Together, we can more our state foreward, powering progress that will make a difference for generations to come. 

	As the state's largest electricity provider, PNM serves more than 500,000 New Mexico residential and business customers in Greater Albuquerque, Rio Rancho, Los Lunas and Belen, Santa Fe, Las Vegas, Alamogordo, Ruidoso, Silver City, Deming, Bayard, Lordsburg and Clayton. We also serve the New Mexico tribal communities of the Tesuque, Cochiti, Santo Domingo, San Felipe, Santa Ana, Sandia, Isleta and Laguna Pueblos.

	Shining a light on the many steps we've taken together: 


		We've supported hundreds of clean energy jobs by building solar centers, harnessing the wind for power and supporting our customers' efforts to concern energy and save money by installing their own private solar energy systems. Jobs were also created to add environmental equipment to reduce emissions and help preserve bird habitats. 

		Through our $270 million investment in one million solar panels (and counting), we've helped New Mexico land in the top ten, nationally, for solar installations. 

		Our 15 (and counting) solar centers in New Mexico produce enough energy when the sun is shining to power approximately 40,000 homes. 

		We're generating enough wind power to support the energy needs of 73,000 homes. 

		By combining the solar, wind and geothermal generation PNM has installed, we produce enough clean, green energy to pwoer more than 154,000 homes. These sources together will save 400 million gallons of water per year and reduce air emissions by the same amount as produced by 201,000 cars on New Mexico's roads. 

		By working through the PNM Energy Efficieny program, we have reduced our power consumption equivalent to the energy consumed by 10,417 homes per year. Since 2007 our energy efficiency programs have reduced enough electricity to conserve more than 480 million gallons of water and prevent more than 900,000 metric tons of carbon emissions.  


	Proud to Provide Power for Nearly 100 years

	PNM was originally founded in 1917 as the Albuquerque Gas and Electric Company, but its roots can be traced to 1882 when electric and gas operations began in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Learn about Albuquerque's historic power plants. 

	We have deep roots in New Mexico and are proud to have been able to serve our community with safe, reliable power for the last 100 years. As our industry grows and changes, we look forward to new possibilities to better serve our customers in the next 100 years. Read More >>

Will using a credit card result in automatic payments?


					No. This is a one-time payment. You will have to return to the site next month if you want to pay online with a credit or debit card again.

FAQs: Billing



			Can I change my due date?
			

					Your due date is set by when your meter is read, so at this time, there is no way to change your due date.



			Why do my rates change?
			

					There are two ways your rates can change. The first is that they change seasonally. During the summer months of June, July and August, when demand and electricity costs are at their highest, higher rates will be in effect. Lower rates are in effect during the non-summer months of September through May, reflecting the lower cost of electricity at that time of year. The second way your electricity rate can change is that there are "blocks" or groupings of rates based on your monthly electricity usage. The less you use, the less you pay per average kilowatt hour.



			What are the different charges on page 2 of the bill?
			

					The different items on page 2 reflect the different charges the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission allows us to collect from customers, and these reflect the various costs associated with delivery of electricity to you.

Primary holdings[edit]



This section needs expansion with: more info on each subheader. You can help by adding to it. (January 2011)


Public Service Company of New Mexico (PNM)[edit]
Public Service Company of New Mexico is a corporation that is wholly owned by PNM Resources. In marketing material it is usually called PNM.
Headquartered in Albuquerque, it provides electricity to 413,000 customers in the urbanized or semi-urbanized areas in the northern half of the state. Elsewhere, rural electric cooperatives provide much of the power. PNM maintains approximately 2,000 miles (3,200 km), 2,282 miles (3,673 km) of electric transmission lines, and 7,594 electric distribution lines. PNM is a significant owner of the San Juan generation facility, a coal-fired plant located near Farmington, New Mexico, and a 10% owner in the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Facility near Phoenix, AZ. PNM also owns and operates several natural gas-fired plants throughout the state of New Mexico including Reeves Generating Station in Albuquerque, most of which are used to meet additional demand for electricity in the summer months. PNM employs approximately 2,000 people and has been noted as one of the top companies in the United States for minorities to work for.
Texas—New Mexico Power Company[edit]
Texas—New Mexico Power is a corporation that is wholly owned by PNM Resources. It is a regulated electric utility operating in Texas.
Corporate organization and history[edit]
PNM was founded in 1917 as the Albuquerque Gas and Electric Company. PNM sold the gas part of the business to Southern Union Gas Company of Dallas in 1949. These sold portions became the Gas Company of New Mexico. In 1985, however, PNM reacquired the Gas Company of New Mexico after Southern Union Gas Company reached a settlement stemming from federal anti-trust litigation. In 1994, both electric and gas operations began serving customers as PNM.
In May 2003, PNM Resources' utility subsidiary PNM was recognized by the American Wind Energy Association's Utility Leadership Award for PNM's role in creation of the New Mexico Wind Energy Center. The award was presented at the National Wind Energy Conference in Austin, Texas.[1]
In 2008, PNM sold New Mexico Gas to Continental Energy, a company backed by the private equity firm Lindsay Goldberg. It was later acquired by TECO Energy.[2] It will soon become a division of Halifax, Canada-based Emera when its acquisition of TECO Energy closes by mid-2016.[3]

Public Service Company of New Mexico (PNM)[edit]
Public Service Company of New Mexico is a corporation that is wholly owned by PNM Resources. In marketing material it is usually called PNM.
Headquartered in Albuquerque, it provides electricity to 413,000 customers in the urbanized or semi-urbanized areas in the northern half of the state. Elsewhere, rural electric cooperatives provide much of the power. PNM maintains approximately 2,000 miles (3,200 km), 2,282 miles (3,673 km) of electric transmission lines, and 7,594 electric distribution lines. PNM is a significant owner of the San Juan generation facility, a coal-fired plant located near Farmington, New Mexico, and a 10% owner in the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Facility near Phoenix, AZ. PNM also owns and operates several natural gas-fired plants throughout the state of New Mexico including Reeves Generating Station in Albuquerque, most of which are used to meet additional demand for electricity in the summer months. PNM employs approximately 2,000 people and has been noted as one of the top companies in the United States for minorities to work for.
Texas—New Mexico Power Company[edit]
Texas—New Mexico Power is a corporation that is wholly owned by PNM Resources. It is a regulated electric utility operating in Texas.
Corporate organization and history[edit]
PNM was founded in 1917 as the Albuquerque Gas and Electric Company. PNM sold the gas part of the business to Southern Union Gas Company of Dallas in 1949. These sold portions became the Gas Company of New Mexico. In 1985, however, PNM reacquired the Gas Company of New Mexico after Southern Union Gas Company reached a settlement stemming from federal anti-trust litigation. In 1994, both electric and gas operations began serving customers as PNM.
In May 2003, PNM Resources' utility subsidiary PNM was recognized by the American Wind Energy Association's Utility Leadership Award for PNM's role in creation of the New Mexico Wind Energy Center. The award was presented at the National Wind Energy Conference in Austin, Texas.[1]
In 2008, PNM sold New Mexico Gas to Continental Energy, a company backed by the private equity firm Lindsay Goldberg. It was later acquired by TECO Energy.[2] It will soon become a division of Halifax, Canada-based Emera when its acquisition of TECO Energy closes by mid-2016.[3]
