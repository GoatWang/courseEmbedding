Live music and games entertained parishioners of all ages and the pastor was in for a surprise.         Click on the article to see the photos form the events      New Priest!

His name is Fr. Yvon Hector Aurelien. He is a Haitian native and has knowledge of various languages, including English.In his own words he has said:“Being a priest means being available for them.”(“them” referring to the people of God)Fr.
