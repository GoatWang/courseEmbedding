Sales and marketing expenses were $26,604 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016. a decrease of 84% from sales and marketing expenses of $166,758 in the second quarter of 2016. The Company reduced marketing expenditures for Trophy Bingo as it repositioned its focus to Garfield's Bingo targeting North American, South American, and Asian markets. Licensed the rights to develop and publish Rooplay, an innovative education and entertainment platform for children."During the third quarter of 2016, the Company was focused on three objectives: enhance the monetization of Trophy Bingo, speed the development of Garfield's Bingo, and secure an exciting new product into our pipeline," commented Jason Williams, Shoal Games CEO.

Second, Garfield's Bingo was in rapid development for the entire quarter and is now scheduled for a Worldwide release on November 29th, 2016.

The rights to develop and publish Rooplay were secured from the London-based founders and the product is in active development.""Garfield's Bingo will be launched in the Apple, Google and Amazon app stores. The game is nearly 100% complete and will hopefully be a hit with the millions of Garfield fans worldwide. As the game is built using the successful Trophy Bingo system, we anticipate the Retention and Monetization Key Performance Indicators (KPI"s) for Garfield's Bingo will be high. As the mobile bingo category is one of the largest of all categories, and Garfield will be the first mega-brand to be featured in a bingo game, management is hopeful that the game will be a big success," commented Williams."Additionally, the third quarter was particularly exciting for the development of Shoal Games as we have begun development on a product which will see the company enter a new market. Management believes that opportunities exist for providing games and educational experiences for children and secured a license to an innovative new technology for a product called Rooplay. Rooplay is an educational games platform for children that enable InstantPlay opportunities to learn, create, and progress with personalized content. Rooplay will offer 1000's of curated games, both developed in house and licensed from others, accessible for a monthly subscription fee. Developed in partnership with the King's College of London, Rooplay will be the first system of its kind to offer personalized and child-led educational experiences. Shoal Games anticipates that Rooplay will be live in the App Stores in Q1 2017."Total revenue, net of platform fees to Apple, Google and Amazon, for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, was $52,758, an increase from revenue of $11,130 for third quarter of 2015 and a decrease from revenue of $77,821, in the second quarter of 2016. The increase in total revenue compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2015, is due to the Company launching a full global release of a feature complete Trophy Bingo in the Google Play and Apple App Store in the latter half of the third quarter of fiscal 2015 and an increase in players playing Trophy Bingo. The decrease in total revenue compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2016, is due to lower marketing spend whilst the Company completed the development of additional features for Trophy Bingo and finalized the development of Garfield's Bingo.Sales and marketing expenses were $26,044 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of 81% over expenses of $137,266 in the third quarter of 2015 and a decrease of 84% from sales and marketing expenses of $166,758 in the second quarter of 2016. This decrease in sales and marketing expenses in the quarter ended September 30, 2016, compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2015 and the second quarter of fiscal 2016, was due to a lower marketing spend for player acquisitions in Trophy Bingo whilst the Company prepared for the launch of planned new features in Trophy Bingo to meet active player demand and to complete the development of Garfield's Bingo. Selling and marketing expenses in the quarter ended September 30, 2016 principally included publishing services and user acquisition costs to acquire players for Trophy Bingo.Read MoreGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of premises costs for our offices, legal and professional fees, and other general corporate and office expenses. General and administrative expenses decreased to $65,601 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of 17% from costs of $79,398 for the third quarter of fiscal 2015 and an increase of 91% from costs of $34,410 in the second quarter of 2016. Effective July 2, 2015, the Company commenced trading on the TSX Venture Exchange as a tier 2 Technology Issuer under the trading symbol "SGW. This decrease in general and administrative expenses compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2015, is due to the fees incurred in listing the Company in the third quarter of 2015. The increase in general and administrative expenses compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2016, is due to hiring the staff to develop Trophy Bingo and Garfield's Bingo directly from Roadhouse Interactive Limited and establishing the new office for the new employees to work within.We expect to continue to incur general and administrative expenses to support the business, and there can be no assurances that we will be able to generate sufficient revenue to cover these expenses.Salaries, wages, consultants and benefits decreased to $97,626 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of 9% compared to salaries, wages, consultants and benefits of $107,633 in the third quarter of 2015 and a decrease of 8%, over salaries, wages, consultants and benefits of $105,887 in the second quarter of 2016. This decrease compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2015 and the second quarter of fiscal 2016, is due to lower consultant charges incurred. The salaries, wages, and consultants expenses related to the development of Trophy Bingo, Garfield's Bingo and Rooplay are expensed under development costs.Development and amortization costs - The Company expensed $387,068 in development costs during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 and amortized $120,503 of the capitalized development costs during the quarter ended September 30, 2016. This compares to $303,162 expensed development costs during the third quarter of 2015 and amortization of $120,503 of the capitalized development costs during the third quarter of 2015 and $251,534 expensed development costs during the second quarter of 2016 and amortization of $120,504 of the capitalized development costs during the second quarter of 2016. This increase of 28% in development costs compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2015 is due the increase of development expenses incurred in the development of Trophy Bingo, Garfield's Bingo and Rooplay. The increase of 54% in development costs compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2016 is due the increase of development expenses incurred in the development of new features for Trophy Bingo and the further development of Garfield's Bingo plus the addition of the development of Rooplay in the third quarter of 2016.In particular, the games contain systems for handling daily rewards, collections, gifting, an advanced spin wheel plus special events. Each of these features affects a particular performance statistic within the game and in combination it's expected that average retention and monetization will rise, while the average player acquisition cost (the average cost to generate one new install of the game) will fall. Daily rewards help to improve retention as players are inspired to come back to collect rewards. Whereas the collection and gifting system is designed to increase virality (reducing acquisition costs) and monetization as players interact more with their friends and spend more in-game currency trying to collect the special items.Loss on prepaid development costs - During the second quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company prepaid $863,660 in development costs to Roadhouse Interactive Limited. Effective August 31, 2016, Roadhouse Interactive Limited was placed in receivership. There was $498,791 in development expenses which had not been utilized. The Company immediately expensed this.The net loss after taxation for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, amounted to ($1,156,098), a loss of ($0.02) per share, compared to a net loss from continuing operations of ($758,611) or ($0.01) per share in the quarter ending September 30, 2015 and net loss of ($620,968), or ($0.01) per share in the second quarter of fiscal 2016.We had cash of $82,417 and working capital deficit of ($59,119) at September 30, 2016. This compares to cash of $570,086 and working capital of $454,447 at December 31, 2015.For full details of the Company's operations and financial results, please refer to the Securities and Exchange Commission website at www.sec.gov or the Shoal Games Ltd. corporate website at http://investor.shoalgames.com or on the www.sedar.com website.About Shoal Games Ltd.

Shoal Games anticipates that Rooplay will be live in the App Stores in Q1 2017."
Total revenue, net of platform fees to Apple, Google and Amazon, for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, was $52,758, an increase from revenue of $11,130 for third quarter of 2015 and a decrease from revenue of $77,821, in the second quarter of 2016. The increase in total revenue compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2015, is due to the Company launching a full global release of a feature complete Trophy Bingo in the Google Play and Apple App Store in the latter half of the third quarter of fiscal 2015 and an increase in players playing Trophy Bingo. The decrease in total revenue compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2016, is due to lower marketing spend whilst the Company completed the development of additional features for Trophy Bingo and finalized the development of Garfield's Bingo.
Sales and marketing expenses were $26,044 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of 81% over expenses of $137,266 in the third quarter of 2015 and a decrease of 84% from sales and marketing expenses of $166,758 in the second quarter of 2016. This decrease in sales and marketing expenses in the quarter ended September 30, 2016, compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2015 and the second quarter of fiscal 2016, was due to a lower marketing spend for player acquisitions in Trophy Bingo whilst the Company prepared for the launch of planned new features in Trophy Bingo to meet active player demand and to complete the development of Garfield's Bingo. Selling and marketing expenses in the quarter ended September 30, 2016 principally included publishing services and user acquisition costs to acquire players for Trophy Bingo.
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of premises costs for our offices, legal and professional fees, and other general corporate and office expenses. General and administrative expenses decreased to $65,601 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of 17% from costs of $79,398 for the third quarter of fiscal 2015 and an increase of 91% from costs of $34,410 in the second quarter of 2016. Effective July 2, 2015, the Company commenced trading on the TSX Venture Exchange as a tier 2 Technology Issuer under the trading symbol "SGW. This decrease in general and administrative expenses compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2015, is due to the fees incurred in listing the Company in the third quarter of 2015. The increase in general and administrative expenses compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2016, is due to hiring the staff to develop Trophy Bingo and Garfield's Bingo directly from Roadhouse Interactive Limited and establishing the new office for the new employees to work within.
We expect to continue to incur general and administrative expenses to support the business, and there can be no assurances that we will be able to generate sufficient revenue to cover these expenses.
Salaries, wages, consultants and benefits decreased to $97,626 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of 9% compared to salaries, wages, consultants and benefits of $107,633 in the third quarter of 2015 and a decrease of 8%, over salaries, wages, consultants and benefits of $105,887 in the second quarter of 2016. This decrease compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2015 and the second quarter of fiscal 2016, is due to lower consultant charges incurred. The salaries, wages, and consultants expenses related to the development of Trophy Bingo, Garfield's Bingo and Rooplay are expensed under development costs.
Development and amortization costs - The Company expensed $387,068 in development costs during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 and amortized $120,503 of the capitalized development costs during the quarter ended September 30, 2016. This compares to $303,162 expensed development costs during the third quarter of 2015 and amortization of $120,503 of the capitalized development costs during the third quarter of 2015 and $251,534 expensed development costs during the second quarter of 2016 and amortization of $120,504 of the capitalized development costs during the second quarter of 2016. This increase of 28% in development costs compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2015 is due the increase of development expenses incurred in the development of Trophy Bingo, Garfield's Bingo and Rooplay. The increase of 54% in development costs compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2016 is due the increase of development expenses incurred in the development of new features for Trophy Bingo and the further development of Garfield's Bingo plus the addition of the development of Rooplay in the third quarter of 2016.
In particular, the games contain systems for handling daily rewards, collections, gifting, an advanced spin wheel plus special events. Each of these features affects a particular performance statistic within the game and in combination it's expected that average retention and monetization will rise, while the average player acquisition cost (the average cost to generate one new install of the game) will fall. Daily rewards help to improve retention as players are inspired to come back to collect rewards. Whereas the collection and gifting system is designed to increase virality (reducing acquisition costs) and monetization as players interact more with their friends and spend more in-game currency trying to collect the special items.
Loss on prepaid development costs - During the second quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company prepaid $863,660 in development costs to Roadhouse Interactive Limited. Effective August 31, 2016, Roadhouse Interactive Limited was placed in receivership. There was $498,791 in development expenses which had not been utilized. The Company immediately expensed this.
The net loss after taxation for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, amounted to ($1,156,098), a loss of ($0.02) per share, compared to a net loss from continuing operations of ($758,611) or ($0.01) per share in the quarter ending September 30, 2015 and net loss of ($620,968), or ($0.01) per share in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. 
We had cash of $82,417 and working capital deficit of ($59,119) at September 30, 2016. This compares to cash of $570,086 and working capital of $454,447 at December 31, 2015.

Announces Fiscal 2016 ResultsMarketwiredApril 3, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareILLA, BRITISH WEST INDIES--(Marketwired - Apr 3, 2017) -  Shoal Games Ltd. (TSX VENTURE:SGW)(SGLDF) http://www.shoalgames.com ("the Company"), mobile software developer, publisher, and owner of Rooplay (http://www.rooplay.com), Trophy Bingo (http://www.trophybingo.com), and Garfield's Bingo (http://www.garfieldsbingo.com) today announced its financial results for the year ended December 31, 2016. All amounts are presented in United States dollars and in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.2016 and Recent Shoal Games Ltd. highlights include:Revenue of $278,921, an increase of 150% from revenue of $111,610, in fiscal 2015 Completion of two equity financings raising $1,643,428 net of issuance costs Successful establishment of Vancouver-based software development team Launch of Rooplay worldwide on Google Play in English Launch of Rooplay with first international partner Café Bazaar in Iran in native Farsi Launch of Garfield's Bingo in Apple, Google and Amazon App Stores "2016 was spent developing, marketing, and publishing mobile products to entertain the masses, while also having to regroup from the unfortunate collapse of our primary software developer," commented Jason Williams Shoal Games CEO. "Trophy Bingo and Garfield's Bingo have recorded more than 600,000 downloads to date with excellent retention and monetization results. However, mobile game developers, including Shoal Games, are challenged by the fact that in the current, rapidly changing, environment millions of apps are competing for downloads and marketing expenses are hard to recoup.With the knowledge that it would be costly to secure millions of users with the bingo products, we began developing a new product, Rooplay, in the latter half of 2016. Rooplay is a platform of children's games based on subscription. The Rooplay app is small (10mb), but contained within are more than 500 different games for kids to play. Each game is curated and contains no ads, no in-app purchases, no outbound links, no social networks, and no instant messaging. These characteristics make Rooplay completely safe for kids.Shoal Games aggregates, curates, and licenses content for the Rooplay platform, but it also makes its own exclusive games. The first four Rooplay Original productions feature Garfield and are titled Garfield Math Bingo, Garfield ABCs, Garfield Memory Match, and Garfield Coloring Book. All of these games will be released onto the Rooplay platform and as stand-alone apps in the Google Play store. The Rooplay Originals will help to deliver downloads to the Rooplay platform app as customers seek to unlock premium content.As Rooplay is a platform, and not a single game, it can create long-term customers that generate recurring revenue. Further, the Rooplay platform is easily localized into any language so Rooplay has global distribution potential through partnership arrangements. Rooplay is now live on Google Play in English and on Cafe Bazaar in Farsi (Iran) with our first localized version and first international partner. We are in discussions with a number of potential partners and hope to localize and launch Rooplay with partners in a number of international jurisdictions. It is our intention, primarily through cost effective partnerships, to grow Rooplay to millions of downloads and launch dozens of Rooplay Original titles over the coming months."Total revenue from continuing operations increased to $278,921 for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of 150% over revenue from continuing operations of $111,610 for the same period in the prior year. The increase in total revenue compared to fiscal 2015, is due to the Company launching a full global release of a feature complete Trophy Bingo in the Google Play and Apple App Store in the latter half of the third quarter of fiscal 2015 and an increase in players playing Trophy Bingo, despite limited marketing expenditures in the latter half of the year, and the launch of Garfield's Bingo in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.Sales and marketing expenses from continuing operations were $403,523 for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of 27% over expenses of $549,534 for the same period in the prior year. This decrease in sales and marketing expenses from continuing operations in fiscal 2016, compared to fiscal 2015, was due to a lower marketing spend in the latter half of 2016 for player acquisitions for Trophy Bingo in order to preserve cash and prepare for the launches of Rooplay and Garfield's Bingo. Selling and marketing expenses principally include publishing services and user acquisition costs to acquire players.Salaries, wages, consultants and benefits expenses, excluding salaries incurred for the development of our games decreased to $413,166 during the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of 4% over expenses of $429,072 for the previous year.Read MoreThe Company expensed $1,077,638 in development costs during the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of 12% over $1,230,216 of development costs in the prior year. This decrease in development costs is due to a smaller team developing Rooplay, Garfield's Bingo and Trophy Bingo compared to fiscal 2015.General and administrative expenses decreased to $231,404 for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of 35% over costs of $356,647 for the previous year. This decrease in general and administrative expenses compared to fiscal 2015, is largely due to the fees incurred in listing the Company on the TSX in 2015. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of legal and professional fees, premises costs for our offices, and other general corporate and office expenses.The net loss after taxation for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, amounted to ($3,156,302), a loss of ($0.05) per share, compared to a net loss of ($2,965,682), a loss of ($0.05) per share in the twelve months ending December 31, 2015. The increase in our 2016 net loss includes the $498,791 of prepaid development costs written off due to the unfortunate bankruptcy of our primary software development supplier.We had cash of $60,190 and working capital of $13,896 at December 31, 2016. This compares to cash of $570,086 and working capital of $454,447 at December 31, 2016.Effective December 2016, the Company granted 1,010,000 employee, director, and consultant share options with an exercise price of CAD$0.54 per share, of which 500,000 share options were to the Directors and Officers.For full details of the Company's operations and financial results, please refer to the Securities and Exchange Commission website at www.sec.gov or the Shoal Games Ltd. corporate website at http://investor.shoalgames.com or on the www.sedar.com website.About Shoal Games Ltd.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.
