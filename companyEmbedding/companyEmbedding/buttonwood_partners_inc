About Us


In the summer of 1990, a group of investment professionals who had worked together at E. F. Hutton, then The Milwaukee Company, and finally at Dain Bosworth decided that bigger wasn't necessarily better for them or, more importantly, for their clients.  Named after the Buttonwood Agreement (which created the first securities exchange and helped bring order to securities trading), Buttonwood Partners, Inc. is proud to carry on the tradition of the locally owned and operated securities firm. 
Our success is built on a foundation of superior client service, independent advice and experience.  Our representatives have the freedom to structure their business as they see fit, allowing them to offer personalized, expert advice.  Free from the constraints of major Wall Street firms and their "recommended" investment portfolios, we are able to provide advice with in you mind. 
Many of our advisors have over 35 years of professional experience in the financial services industry; the multi-generation relationships we have formed with our clients speak to the quality of client service we offer.
Buttonwood Partners, Inc. is compromised of unique teams.

Buttonwood Portfolio Management



Why Buttonwood Partners, Inc. is the right independent firm.
Buttonwood Partners success has been built on true independence. Our representatives work for themselves while sharing the benefits of a large office. They take the time to get to know you and tailor your portfolio to fit your comfort level of investing. We also have investment advisory services, if you want someone else to make your trading decisions for you based on your risk tolerance and investment objectives.
We have the resources to provide the services offered by much larger, less personal brokerage houses.  We are a full-service independent broker-dealer and registered investment advisor managing over $500 million in assets for clients in numerous states.  
We have partnered with National Financial Services (a Fidelity Investments company) to serve as our clearing firm and custodian, providing large-company benefits while maintaining a small-firm, customer focused approach.  In addition, we maintain our own trading, compliance and support services in-house. 
Our clearing firm maintains a local bank account allowing us the ability to take in your deposits and issue checks right from our home office location.  You don't have to lose precious interest waiting for your money to get through the mail to its final destination. We can also initiate electronic funds transfers from our office.
We trade individual stocks, corporate bonds, municipal bonds, treasuries, GNMA's, FNMA's, options, CD's, and Mutual funds of all types with a variety of companies.  
To protect your investments, National Financial provides unlimited insurance over and above SIPC coverage on your account through an independent source.






We are conveniently located on Madison's West side with easy access off Hwy 12/18 (the Beltline)'s Old Sauk Road exit, the majestic elk are a can't miss landmark that lets you know you are home.
