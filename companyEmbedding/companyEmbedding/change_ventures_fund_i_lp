Arthur Ventures Fund II



James Burgum


July 16, 2013





It’s finally here!  We are very pleased to announce that we have raised $45 million in Arthur Ventures Growth Fund II, L.P. from like-minded investors who believe in and support the mission of Arthur Ventures.  I would like to thank our entire partnership and team of Doug Burgum, Dave O’Hara, Lauris Molbert, Kathy Laney, Andy Christensen, Megan Lind, Pat Meenan, Kayleigh Biloki and Dennis Erdle for being such an investable group.  When an investor makes a commitment to this fund, they make a commitment to this team of people and entrust them to build and drive value with our Partner Companies.Most importantly, however, I would like to thank our entrepreneurs and teams that we partnered with in AVI.  Without their courage and dedication to build high-impact businesses we would not have been able to raise a 2nd fund.  In addition to our expanded team, the growth and momentum of the AVI Partner companies helped define our story and value proposition.  Thank you AVI Partners for allowing us to share your stories.  Our Partner Company success is paramount and their stories are why we are inspired to do what we do as venture capitalists.Our AVII investors are individuals and families that aligned and identified with our story and our mission.  I’m personally humbled to have an opportunity to serve such an accomplished and esteemed group.  More than any dollar amount we could have raised, the opportunity to work for this group of investors is an honor and we feel fortunate to be in partnership with them.  We are grateful for all of the support but now the real work begins on setting forth to seek out new Partners to continue our efforts of building high-impact companies.If you have a new business idea that leverages the power and magic of software please let us know, AVII is open for business.  We are seeking new Partners who share our values and have aspirations to change the world…while doing so with rock-solid business models, competitive differentiation, strong leadership teams, friction-less sales models, superior customer service, simple and powerful branding/messaging, large and fast growing markets, customer traction etc./etc. – did I mention customer traction?!

Clarke, 2010: Odyssey TwoGet in touch   Our VisionWe find, fund and support the best teams who are using Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Internet of Things to solve real world problems for next 6bn. Connect is the 7th senseBig wave is here...By 2020, 25 - 50 billion connected devices will store so much about us and our world to power seamless, almost sensory actions. This will lead to rewiring of products, processes and eventually entire industries, catalyzing trillions of dollars worth of unseen economic value. We will invest in such possibilities..India is innovating for next 6bnA country and startup ecosystem at an inflection...India is changing fast. Change leads to disruption, which in turn leads to new ideas and innovation. By 2050, India will be second largest economy after China. The combination of a large & growing self-contained market, a second-to-none talent pool, and an enormous amount of data has created ripe conditions for germination of global companies.We are entrepreneur firstWe are hungry and we love if you are hungry too..The true north of pi Ventures is a relentless focus on entrepreneurs. We believe that irrational ideas have the capability to change the world, provided they are backed by entrepreneurs with stellar problem-solving skills, and patient passion, refusing to give up against all odds. We have been entrepreneurs too, so we know the view from the trenches. We will support such dogged entrepreneurs with funding, talent and right ecosystem to help them succeed faster and better.   Investment ThesisWe are early stage investors focusing on disruptive ventures, solving real world problems,  that can turn into category leaders through Applied AI  Exploiting Data Growth50x growth in DataIndia is rapidly adopting smartphones, there would be close to 430 Million of them by 2019. India surpassed US in number of internet users in December 2015, majority of them through smartphones. Smartphones generate 4x data as compared to web; a connected devices 16x, as such, most of the business and personal workflows in India are getting or going to get impacted by data very rapidly.Leveraging Applied AI to differentiateCreating new category leadersWe are looking at companies that are leveraging big data (data coming out of enterprise systems), small data (personal data ) and dark data (data coming out due to devices) to make smarter decisions through machine learning and eventually becoming self learning. Mining this data through machine learning and AI & creating value is going to be key to creating new category leaders.We are looking for these category leaders.Global ThinkingSolving a big problem in globally unique wayOne of our critical criteria is if the teams are attacking big and fundamental problems on a global scale. While they might start in India, they have to think global. With our global network, we are in a unique place to help entrepreneurs realise their dream of building global companies.Patient PassionStrong desire to make a change with long half life...We are looking for strong teams, showcasing the grit to remain focused on the problem statement over a long period of time. We work very closely to build teams if we find gaps. However, the passion, fire and desire to build a lasting change is expected in the founders right from day one.

Sigtuple's first solution Shonit™ is a complete peripheral blood smear analyser solution which automates the routine tasks like differential counts. Additionally, it provides a screening solution for various parasitic infections like Malaria and disorders like Anaemia. It starts by capturing images of blood smear slides with a phone fitted on a microscope. The images are analysed on cloud using state of the art image processing and deep learning techniques. Finally it generates reports containing differential blood counts, visualisations on various blood metrics and suggestions about any abnormalities. The report can then be reviewed by pathologists on any net connected device, from anywhere in the world, making this product useful for areas having dearth of specialists.ten3T Health (Cicer)Intelligent Heart MonitoringCicer (ten3T) collects and integrates medical grade data in real-time through its self-contained wearable devices that it builds, deploys and manages. ten3T's devices included multiple sensors to collect continuously streaming clinical grade information on ECG, heart rate, respiratory rate, SpO2 and temperature - all gathered, analyzed and reported in real-time.The Cicer patch is small, light and unobtrusive, and has been designed with proprietary innovations in data acquisition, wireless transmission, and analytics to provide a seamless healthcare monitoring system.ZenatixMachine learning driven energy management for retailersZenatix was co-founded by alumni of IIT Delhi, IIM Ahmedabad and UCLA – Rahul Bhalla, Vishal Bansal and Dr. Amarjeet Singh.

Unlike other sector-agnostic funds, their aim was to focus on a few niche categories — AI, machine learning (ML), and Internet of things (IoT). Here is the story of pi Ventures, which is in the process of a closing a Rs 195 crore fund and has so far invested in three startups.An artificially intelligent pathologist bags India’s biggest funding in healthcare AIDeep learning to transform pathologyToday SigTuple, which uses computer vision and artificial intelligence for diagnosis, announced series A funding of US$5.8 million.

To enable this community building in AI, we started #chAI (AI over a cuppa). We believe with this series of #chAIs, we can enable collaboration on technology and talent; building depth in the AI community and thereby resulting in world class AI companies to come out of India.
