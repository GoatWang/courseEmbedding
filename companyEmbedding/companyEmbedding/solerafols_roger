Roger Solé joined Sprint in a dual role: senior vice president for the Hispanic market and senior vice president of Innovation. Solé, who will report to CEO Marcelo Claure, assumes a newly created role to lead all functions in Sprint’s new Hispanic business unit. Sprint sees the Hispanic market as one of the fastest growing segments of the U.S. population and an area where the company can gain leadership.
Solé also will assume the role as president of Sprint Puerto Rico. All business functions in Puerto Rico will report to Solé, including general manager Patricia Eaves. Puerto Rico will be the hub for Sprint’s Latin creativity and innovation.
Solé’s leadership over Innovation will center on creating products and services that allow Sprint to offer a unique, differentiated value proposition. His responsibilities include Pinsight Media, a Sprint division that specializes in mobile advertising, and the Sprint Accelerator, a mentorship-driven program for health care startups. Kevin McGinnis, vice president for Pinsight Media and executive sponsor for the Sprint Accelerator, will report directly to Solé.
Solé, educated in Spain, comes to Sprint from TIM Brasil, where he was the company’s chief marketing officer. Under his leadership, TIM, Telecom Italia’s mobile carrier in Brazil, emerged as that country’s fastest growing mobile operator by introducing new services, developing new apps and providing innovative ways for customers to get new smartphones. Solé grew TIM to become the No. 1 seller of smartphones in Brazil with 40 percent market share and nearly 71 million customers.
Prior to TIM Brasil, Solé led all innovation for six years at Vivo (Telefonica Brasil), the largest operator in Brazil. He was a key force in the turnaround of Vivo, focusing on building unique value propositions for the high-value customer segments.
