Biography[edit]
College career[edit]
Daniel was a 4-year letter winner playing offensive guard at Alabama State University.[1]
Coaching career[edit]
Daniel began his coaching career as an offensive line coach at Enterprise High School from 1974–1980 after graduating from Alabama State. He enjoyed a high level of success at the high school level, as during this five year time span eleven of his offensive linemen earned college scholarships.[2]
He moved to Auburn in 1981 to serve as the offensive line coach on head coach Pat Dye's staff from 1981 to 1992. During his 12-year tenure, the Tigers appeared in nine consecutive bowl games, four linemen were selected for All-American honours and several selected All-SEC.[2]
Daniel's first professional level coaching experience came as a part of the NFL's Minority Fellowship program, with the New Orleans Saints in 1988 and with the Denver Broncos in 1992 under head coach Dan Reeves.[3] He made his professional-level debut with the New York Giants, serving as tight end coach from 1993 to 1996. He moved to the Atlanta Falcons in 1997, serving in the same capacity from 1997 to 2003. Daniel was instrumental in the development of tight end Alge Crumpler, who led the Falcons in receptions in 2002 and 2003 and has earned four Pro Bowl selections as well as two All-Pro honours. Daniel also served as the offensive line coach in 2000.[2]
Daniel joined the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2004, replacing Ken Whisenhunt as tight ends coach after Whisenhunt was promoted to offensive coordinator. He has been instrumental in the development of tight end Heath Miller, guiding Miller to become an all-around player and a solid postseason contributor. Under Daniel's tutelage, Miller has earned a Pro Bowl selection while also setting team records for single-season receptions, postseason receptions, touchdowns, and yards for the tight end position.[2]
Personal life[edit]
Daniel and his wife, Myrtis, have no children.[2]

What MyClients Haveto Say



It has been a pleasure working with Daniel.  He is a true professional and pays attention to the smallest details.  My satisfaction is important to him, and it shows.'Andy KhouryAttorney, Longview, TXDaniel WiebrachtI have bought clothes from Daniel multiple times and have been pleased with each purchase.  The clothes are very good quality and I could not be happier.'Mike HolbertLouis Morgan, Longview, TXDaniel WiebrachtDaniel is a true professional in his approach to selling men's clothing.  He makes the process very easy and ensures you receive a product that looks and fits great.'Will AdamsonSabine Pipe, Kilgore, TXDaniel WiebrachtDaniel has done a tremendous job by providing quality clothing without the hassle of leaving my office.  He is great with follow up and taking care of any alterations if things are not just perfect.  I would highly recommend him to all.'Bruce SmithAttorney, Longview, TXDaniel WiebrachtI have been very pleased with the custom clothing fitted for me by Daniel. I have enjoyed excellent service and when there was a problem, he had it fixed immediately. I have several pairs of slacks which I wear almost daily to work and to church. Thanks, Daniel.'Charles R. MartinPulmonologist, Longview, TXDaniel WiebrachtWorking with Daniel has been a pleasure.  He is prompt, efficient, and my custom tailored clothes have arrived just as ordered.  Having clothes that are custom sized for me is second to none, and surprisingly comparable to what you would pay for comparable off the rack clothes.  I would highly recommend Daniel and Tom James to anyone looking for their business causal and better clothing needs.'Michael RunyanAttorney, Marshall, TXDaniel WiebrachtDaniel was referred to me by another attorney in the area and exceeded all of my expectations. He came to the office for the fitting, making the whole process more convenient. Daniel gave expert advice on the construction of a new suit for me and when it came in the suit fit perfectly. I would highly recommend Daniel to anyone looking for excellent fitting menswear.'Chapman BauerleinAttorney, Longview, TXDaniel WiebrachtMy Tom James's custom made suits are some of the best investments I have made in my career lately. The suits are a perfect fit and I always receive many compliments on their style and good taste. I feel very comfortable in my Tom James suit which has many extra features that you will not find in an 'off the rake' suite. I am extremely satisfied in my Tom James suits and they have exceeded my expectations. My wardrobe is greatly enhanced because of Tom James. David Wiebracht, my personal Tom James representative, could be a tailor at any fine men's clothier and he pays attention to every detail. The convenience of shopping in my office, the education of what a fine wardrobe should be and value received are some of many reasons I will remain a Tom James customer. I would give Daniel Wiebracht and Tom James my highest recommendation.'Ed MooreGreater Tyler Association of Realtors, Tyler, TXDaniel WiebrachtDaniel's been wonderful to work with over the past year for my clothing opportunities.  The clothes fit great and look sharp.  Best of all, Daniel comes to me for measurements and fittings, so the hassle of stores and lines is eliminated.   He's very knowledgeable and professional, and I'd certainly recommend him.'Darren GroceR. Lacy, Longview, TXDaniel WiebrachtMy experience with Tom James has been exceptional. The clothing is well made and the fitting process is easy and accurate. Daniel is always attentive to my requests and provides the level of service you would expect from a custom clothier.'Ryan HamiltonGuarantee Bond Bank, Longview, TXDaniel WiebrachtDaniel has been very receptive to my clothing needs. He knows the type of suits I like and he knows that ties are very important to me. My experience with Daniel has been great.'Mike NorthcuttSouthside Bank, Longview, TXDaniel WiebrachtDaniel has done an excellent job for me. He is courteous, attentive to detail and timely.  I have been very pleased with his service and his product.  What more can you ask for?'Glenn PerryAttorney, Longview, TXDaniel WiebrachtI am very satisfied with the suit Daniel sold me last year.  It fits very well and looks great.  His service is consistent and convenient.  Daniel has always been diligent about keeping me informed of clothing ideas while not being too pushy as some sales people are prone to do.  He mostly communicates by email which I prefer.  I will very likely purchase clothing from him in the future. .'Steve MillsTrinity Capital Management, Tyler, TXDaniel WiebrachtDaniel is a top-notch representative over at Tom James, and I have been very pleased with his approach and expertise.  What I most appreciate is his understanding of the time constraints on a busy client.  He is not a high-pressure salesman (which is a huge turnoff for so many of us) but rather a very knowledgeable consultant who can help you make decisions on what works and what doesn't.  His clothing is very good, reasonably priced, and it changes often.  I recommend Daniel very highly.'Michael ChuAttorney, ChicagoDaniel WiebrachtDaniel is a great guy who is passionate about what he does.  He is flexible and accommodating to my busy schedule and is someone I will be using for a long time due to his knowledge of the industry.  I appreciate all the work Daniel does for me and would highly recommend him to anyone interested in looking their best personally or professionally on a daily basis.'Mike LindbergFinancial Advisor, ChicagoDaniel WiebrachtI've bought several suits and ties from Daniel.  Always satisfied with the product and service.  Thanks Dan!'Devlin SchoopAttorney, ChicagoDaniel WiebrachtDaniel is an excellent clothier.  He will come to your office and outfit you with all your clothing needs.  He is very customer oriented and will respect your time.  If you are looking for great suits or other clothing and hate to shop, let Daniel do the work for you.'Jim McGovernAttorney, ChicagoDaniel WiebrachtWe were VERY pleased with the customer service from you on the items that we ordered.  It was such a pleasant experience for you to come to us for our needs for David.  After you delivered the suit and items that were made for him, we were even more impressed with the quality of the suits and clothing that came.   It was a GREAT purchase from you and we will always call you in the future for our custom clothing needs.'David & Delena DorganDiana, TXDaniel WiebrachtI was skeptical when I first met Daniel.  I do not like to overspend on clothing and was fearful that he might lead me to do that.  He did not.  He explained the benefits of using Tom James, especially the combination packages.  My clothes now fit perfectly and I believe I am getting great value for my clothing dollar.'Tom ProthroProthro, Wilhelmi & Co.  Tyler, TXDaniel WiebrachtDaniel Wiebracht is a bright young man who knows what kind of tastes his clients have. He always followed up at the right times too. Very knowledgeable of men's dress attire.'Todd TeftellerAttorney, Gilmer, TXDaniel WiebrachtThe three questions that I ask myself when working with other businesspeople are: 1) Are they nice? 2) Do they perform good work? 3) Are they available when I need them?  When I am talking about Daniel Wiebracht, the answer is yes to all three.'Patrick BriscoeOrthodontist, Longview, TXDaniel WiebrachtWhen I moved to East Texas, I was a 'blue jeans and boots' kind of guy. But as my new job required me to see more and more clients, I needed to look better. Daniel not only got me into custom-fitted clothes at great price, he assisted me in crafting the professional look I wanted to project for my clients. Knowledgeable in the current movements and trends in style, Daniel has been able to make me look sharp while maintaining a professional appearance. When the people in the office tell me how nice I look, I know Daniel is doing a great job!'Benton RossAttorney, Longview, TXDaniel WiebrachtDaniel provides excellent customer service and expertise.

He is easy in conversation and certainly not a high-pressure salesman.  He cares about your appearance and has shown no reluctance to remind me that my taste in attire is occasionally suspect or of another time!  His ideas on clothing and how best to display them is a valued and respected source for me.  It is without hesitation that I recommend him at every appropriate opportunity.'Jerry HarrisAttorney, Longview, TXDaniel WiebrachtDaniel with Tom James provides an exceptional wardrobe that spans from casual to elegant. The fit and workmanship is extraordinary. Daniel goes the extra mile to satisfy his customers. He takes ownership of any problems that may arise. He is focused on achieving high customer satisfaction while at the same time delivering a product that is fairly priced. I expect that even the most discriminating client will be happy with the attention to detail Daniel provides.'Andrei GasicGastroenterologist, Longview, TXDaniel WiebrachtI truly enjoy working with Daniel.  He provides me excellent customer service, and the clothing is wonderful.'Scott StevensAttorney, Longview, TXDaniel WiebrachtDaniel is a talented and dedicated clothier; I relied on his taste and recommendations for years.
