 Age: 33   Fortune: self made   Source: solar energy   Net Worth:  $2.5 bil    Country Of Citizenship:  China   Residence:  Xinyu

Started out with a trading company that blossomed into a family-run company that made safety products such as gloves and employed 12,000. He considered adding Chinese-made solar panels to his export wares when he realized that no Chinese company was producing wafers, a key component for solar cells that makes up 25% of their cost. In 2005 Peng began pouring $30 million of his own money and $80 million of venture financing into building factories in his native Jiangxi Province.

                    Born in Jiangxi province, Peng first founded Suzhou Liouxin Group, a manufacturer and exporter of work gloves, safety glasses, and other products. He wanted to include solar panels but couldn't, since no Chinese company made the wafers that went in them.
With the help of $80 million from venture capitalists, he founded LDK in 2005, took it public in 2007, and last year saw revenues more than triple to $1.6 billion. But this year LDK has faced big losses due to an inventory write-down. [+]
