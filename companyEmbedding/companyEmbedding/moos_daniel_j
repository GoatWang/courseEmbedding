Daniel J. Moos, President & CEO Of TCI Ranks Amongst The Nation's Top CEOs. (Photo: Business Wire)






Business Wire




Oct 20, 2014 8:00 AM EDT













 




























































  ExecRank has selected Daniel J. Moos, President & CEO at Transcontinental Realty Investors, Inc. ( NYSE: TCI), as a Top Chief Executive Officer at a Micro-Cap Company for 2014. These rankings are based on statistical and algorithmic analysis of executive and company performance and are the result of over 3 years of research and feedback from evaluation committees and top Chief Executives.   Daniel J. Moos, President & CEO of TCI ranks amongst the nation's top CEOs. (Photo: Business Wire)   According to Chris Beaver, Managing Director of ExecRank, “We were extremely impressed with the achievements of Mr. Daniel Moos. His work and reputation are highly regarded in the industry and amongst other Chief Financial Officers.”  Gene E. Phillips, advisor to the private company that Mr. Moos manages, is very happy to see this recognition of Mr. Moos by ExecRank. “We have been proud of the accomplishments that Mr. Moos has brought about to Transcontinental Realty Investors.”  ExecRank screened over 10,000 Chief Executive Officers in the United States. Only the very best are awarded the distinction of being a part of ExecRank’s Top Chief Executive Officers Ranking for 2014. As always, there was a premium on experience and track record when considering our rankings, but also on CEOs who took bold steps to help their companies maintain and grow market share in evolving industries. ExecRank weighed heavily the recommendations provided by the boards of directors of our finalists.  “Meeting and exceeding our business goals and striving to create value for our shareholders is far more important than any personal achievement. However, this ranking is a reflection of our great staff, business partners, and the overall shared commitment to excel,” commented Daniel J. Moos, President & CEO of TCI.
