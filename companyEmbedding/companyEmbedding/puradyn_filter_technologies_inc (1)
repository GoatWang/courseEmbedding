PRODUCTS \ product reviewsListen to what our customers have to say. . .  
“All of our rigs have incorporated the puraDYN System and because of it, we have been able to safely extend our oil drain intervals. Our new maintenance practices, with the help of the puraDYN Systems, allow extension of oil drain intervals to 5,000 hours from our previous practice of 1,000 hours. This reduces oil drains to virtually once per year, saving operating costs, and reducing the amount of waste oil generation. With the new Scan Vision Rig, as with all our rigs, we are focused on constantly improving our operating efficiency including improvements to maintenance, which this product assists.“It’s a win-win for our customers, the environment, and Scandrill.”
— Paul Mosvold, President & Chief Operating Officer
Scandrill, Inc.
 Houston, TX“We focus on providing outstanding service and value-added products to our customers.  One of the ways we do this is by providing our customers with a technology that allows their equipment to operate as effectively and efficiently as possible.  There is a reason we use Puradyn – it offers the best solution for keeping engines clean, safely extending oil drain intervals and reducing overall life-cycle costs, protecting substantial investments in the commercial marine and industrial industries.  With over 25 years of experience in bypass filtration, Puradyn was the natural choice to offer our customers.“The return on investment for the system is the cost of one to two oil changes.”
— Harry Lartigue, Jr., Power Generation, Marine and Industrial Sales Manager
 MnI Diesel, Inc.
 Corpus Christi, Texas
   “We had the M/V Sunrise built in 2002 with the puraDYN filtration system included.  It enables us to extend the oil drain intervals from our old standard of 250 hours to 3,000 hours.  This equates to a savings of 354 gallons of oil or $3,210 per year.  Another boat in our fleet, the M/V Southern Cross, has been able to exceed 65,000 hours prior to overhaul with the puraDYN filtration system installed. It’s nice to run across a product that actually does what it’s supposed to.  Keep up the good work!”
 – Captain Bill Clark
South Ferry Island
 Shelter Island, NY
“Considering that our fleet would normally require 30,000-mile oil drains, we calculate that by using the puraDYN System and running on the same oil over 100 million miles, we’ve saved over 60,000 gallons of oil. The engines remain clean, perform at peak level. . . and the overall maintenance costs have been drastically reduced.”“We’ve also performed extensive fuel consumption measurements and consistently achieve a 2% – 3% savings in fuel.”
 — Ross Hare
Hare Express, Inc.
 Troy, Michigan

Home» Oil & Gas ServicesAPPLICATIONS \ oil & gas servicesSave up to millions of dollars each year when you extend oil drain intervals.Oil rigs need to be fully self-sufficient with regards to energy, water, and electrical needs as well as the processes and equipment necessary for oil and gas production.  Equipment malfunction resulting in operational failure onboard a rig can easily result in days to weeks of downtime and heavy expenses related to repairs.The number of engines per oil rig varies greatly, from as low as three to well over eight, depending on drilling application and location.  These engines typically run 24/7 and require oil drains ranging from 500-1,000 hours, or (just under) 21-41 days, and the amount of oil needed to operate and maintain runs into millions of dollars in new oil purchases and waste oil disposal costs.Our largest oil filtration system, the MTS-240, is a workhorse that easily handles the 24/7 operational environments on engines with large oil sump capacities.  Unique in the industry, the MTS-240 will micro-filter an oil sump capacity of 85 gallons (322 Liters) and is designed to be used in multiples on oil rigs, where engines can hold up to 450 gallons (1,703 Liters) of oil.The puraDYN® systems utilized on the generators used on land and offshore oil drilling platforms are able to significantly reduce oil maintenance needs and costs by keeping engine oil continuously clean and in good working order.The resultant decrease in downtime and increased productivity make it ideal for use in remote locations on rigs possessing a high oil sump capacity and the necessity to be operable 24/7. There is no need to shut down the engine when changing the filter cartridge which must be changed in lieu of changing the oil.Additionally, the safe extension of oil drains translates to a significant reduction in the amount of oil being transported to and from remote locations, decreasing operating costs and lessening the amount of CO2 and NOx emitted into the atmosphere.  Likewise, due to the extension of oil drains, production of waste oil is also reduced, further diminishing the operator’s environmental impact.Natural Gas Pipeline Industry
The gas pipeline industry is another industry where it is crucial to keep engines running at all times.  Puradyn has worked for over five years with one natural gas pipeline operator that operates a fleet of natural gas compressors, made up of Waukesha and CAT engines.  Our customer specifically cites engine cleanliness from operating with oil kept constantly clean by the bypass oil filtration system as the determining factor in extending its engine overhaul intervals.  Since installing the System, the operating company changes oil, the puraDYN® replacement filter, and the engine filter every four months of 24/7 operations (or 2,600+ hours) with no maintenance issues.  In fact, due to the cleanliness of the engines and the efficient water removal through use of Puradyn’s micro-fine filtration technology, they have been able to extend engine overhauls by 10,000+ hours.Don’t forget! puraDYN systems work just as well to extend oil drain intervals on hydraulic systems which often cost more to maintain than engines.  Most companies already have the price of the puraDYN paid for in net savings they achieve, requiring no additional capital investment.Call toll free (in North America) 1 866 PURADYN (787-2396)  or +1 561 547 9499 (international)

Environmentally Responsible Benefits of  Bypass Oil Filtration
Responsible environmental use of natural resourcesEngines are critical to our way of life as they operate in almost every aspect of day-to-day living:  Transportation, habitat, food production, infrastructure, economic stability, and defense.  As long as engines are powered by oil, the environmental benefits of energy, oil, and natural resources conservation remain an important part of our national energy conversation.  It’s logical to assume that removal of a powerful and essential natural resource as oil might have an equally powerful effect upon the very source from which it’s being removed. Some of the current exploration and extraction methods used to produce ‘new’ oil remain controversial as they take a toll on the natural environment. Waste oil, recycled to be used as heating oil, heavy lubricant, and asphalt, contains its own set of issues in that these products still contain a substantial amount of harmful contaminants such as carbon, potassium, and lead, to name a few, as well as levels of antifreeze and gas.  Think about this:  One gallon of used oil, which contains impurities and toxins, can contaminate one million gallons of potable water if disposed of improperly. Oil spills, which can (and often do) occur during the transport of fossil fuels, wreak havoc on the underwater environment and affect the chemical balance and life species for decades.Environmental benefits of bypass oil filtrationThe good news is that engine and hydraulic oil can stay continuously clean for longer periods of time through the use of bypass oil filtration (similar in concept to blood being filtered through a kidney dialysis machine) and oil analysis.  This means lubricating oil can stay in play, extending the life of the oil by numerous oil drain cycles.  In some instances, the purchase of ‘new’ engine oil can be reduced by as much as 90%.  And when ‘new’ oil can be reduced, there is a subsequent reduction of waste oil. Bypass filtration technology extends the life of the oil by safely removing harmful solid, liquid, and gaseous contaminants.  It also extends the life of the engine which is now running on continuously clean oil, thereby reducing additional wear and pollution contributors to the engine components. Using bypass oil filtration to reduce significant oil consumption can minimize your company’s carbon footprint.

Causes of Engine Contamination
Foreign matter in lubricating oil is destined to end up as engine contamination and a costly maintenance fix, whether that cost is from taking equipment off-line for oil-related maintenance or wear from friction on engine components reducing the life of the engine.Dirty oil is created by the generation of solid and liquid contaminants from the engine combustion process, general oxidation and by outside contaminants entering the oil. The combustion process creates water, carbon particles and sulfur oxides. When combined with the ingress of dirt, dust, and foreign matter entering the lubrication system through blow-by, sludge, varnish and acids are formed, thereby adversely affecting the viscosity and lubricating properties of the oil.To begin covering the basic potential types of contaminant in lubricating oil, all petroleum products contain some amount of natural sulfur. In the engine combustion process, this natural sulfur becomes sulfur dioxide (SO2) which also contaminates the oil through blow-by past the piston rings. When mixed with water, SO2 produces sulfuric acid . This acid builds up in the oil causing corrosion and pitting of metal surfaces, which in turn can lead to engine contamination and premature engine wear.  SO2 is linked with a number of adverse effects on the respiratory system. The largest sources of SO2 emissions are from fossil fuel combustion at power plants (73%) and other industrial facilities (20%).  Smaller sources of SO2 emissions include industrial processes such as extracting metal from ore, and the burning of high sulfur containing fuels by locomotives, large ships, and non-road equipment.  Water in the oil is a natural by-product of the engine combustion process and is caused by condensation, as well. Excessive fuel, water or engine coolant dilution will seriously impair the lubricating properties of oil. Water is the most damaging because it leads to the formation of corrosive acids and sludge. Water can also cause up to an 80% loss of oil additives.Engine coolant can be introduced into the oil through leaking head gaskets, liner seals, and oil cooler seals causing corrosion and forming sludge.Puradyn technology is designed to remove nearly 100% of water, and solid contaminant to below one micron in lubricating oil thereby helping maintain the oil’s viscosity.Although solid contaminants formed from engine wear and chemical reactions are initially extremely small, they tend to agglomerate in suspension in the oil, increasing in size until they are large enough to fall out of suspension, forming layers of sludge and varnish.The Puradyn System captures and removes solid contaminants in the oil down to below 1 micron in size, which prevents them from creating internal engine wear in areas of extremely tight clearances, such as bearing and bushing surfaces and liner-ring clearance. It has been proven that filtering particles within oil down to 5 microns in size does not significantly reduce engine wear, whereas filtering down to 1 micron does significantly reduce engine wear. Continuously clean oil lubricating and cooling your engine while removing solid contaminant to below one micron is vital to extending engine life.The last phase of the fine filtration process to reduce engine wear is the replenishment of the base additive and the viscosity enhancer, which maintains the engine’s oil chemical balance and viscosity.  The combination of the three processes listed above provides the necessary steps to safely extending the engine’s oil life and reducing engine wear leading to extended engine life and better performance over the life of the engine.Regardless of oil price fluctuations, bypass oil filtration offers several benefits to end users, as well as being one of the single greatest technologies available for maintaining engine and hydraulic equipment at optimum performance.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
