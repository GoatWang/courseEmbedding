matters (which resolutions, when executed by any person authorized
as provided in this Section 3.3(c), each acting individually,
shall be deemed to have been adopted by the Managing Member, any
one or more Managers, the Company, BMA V, BCP V, BFIP V, BPP V or
any Blackstone Entity, as applicable, for all purposes).
The authority granted to any person
(other than the Managing Member) in this Section 3.3(c) may be
revoked at any time by the Managing Member by an instrument in
writing signed by the Managing Member.

3.4. Responsibilities of
Members . (a) Unless otherwise determined by the Managing
Member in a particular case, each Regular Member shall devote
substantially all his time and attention to the businesses of the
Company and its affiliates, and each Special Member shall not be
required to devote any time or attention to the businesses of the
Company or its affiliates.

(b) All outside business or
investment activities of the Members (including outside
directorships or trusteeships) shall be subject to such rules and
regulations as are established by the Managing Member from time to
time.

(c) The Managing Member may
from time to time establish such other rules and regulations
applicable to Members or other employees as the Managing Member
deems appropriate, including rules governing the authority of
Members or other employees to bind the Company to financial
commitments or other obligations.

3.5. Exculpation and
Indemnification . (a)  Liability to Members .
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, whether
express or implied, to the fullest extent permitted by law, no
Member nor any of such Member’s representatives, agents or
advisors nor any partner, member, officer, employee,
representative, agent or advisor of the Company or any of its
Affiliates (individually, a “ Covered Person ”
and collectively, the “ Covered Persons ”) shall
be liable to the Company or any other Member for any act or
omission (in relation to the Company, this Agreement, any related
document or any transaction or investment contemplated hereby or
thereby) taken or omitted by a Covered Person (other than any act
or omission constituting Cause), unless there is a final and
non-appealable judicial determination and/or determination of an
arbitrator that such Covered Person did not act in good faith and
in what such Covered Person reasonably believed to be in, or not
opposed to, the best interests of the Company and within the
authority granted to such Covered Person by this Agreement, and,
with respect to any criminal act or proceeding, had reasonable
cause to believe that such Covered Person’s conduct was
unlawful. Each Covered Person shall be entitled to rely in good
faith on the advice of legal counsel to the Company, accountants
and other experts or professional advisors, and no action taken by
any Covered Person in reliance on such advice shall in any event
subject such person to any liability to any Member or the Company.
To the extent that, at law or in equity, a Member has duties
(including fiduciary duties) and liabilities relating thereto to
the Company or to another Member, to the fullest extent permitted
by law, such Member acting under this Agreement shall not be liable
to the Company or to any such other Member for its good faith
reliance on the provisions of this Agreement. The provisions of
this Agreement, to the extent that they expand or restrict the
duties and liabilities of a Member otherwise existing at law or in
equity, are agreed by the Members, to the fullest extent permitted
by law, to modify to that extent such other duties and liabilities
of such Member.

(b) Indemnification .
To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Company shall indemnify
and hold harmless (but only to the extent of the Company’s
assets (including, without
 

22
 

limitation, the remaining capital
commitments of the Members) each Covered Person from and against
any and all claims, damages, losses, costs, expenses and
liabilities (including, without limitation, amounts paid in
satisfaction of judgments, in compromises and settlements, as fines
and penalties and legal or other costs and reasonable expenses of
investigating or defending against any claim or alleged claim),
joint and several, of any nature whatsoever, known or unknown,
liquidated or unliquidated (collectively, “ Losses
”), arising from any and all claims, demands, actions, suits
or proceedings, civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
in which the Covered Person may be involved, or threatened to be
involved, as a party or otherwise, by reason of such Covered
Person’s management of the affairs of the Company or which
relate to or arise out of or in connection with the Company, its
property, its business or affairs (other than claims, demands,
actions, suits or proceedings, civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of any act or omission of such Covered
Person constituting Cause); provided , that a Covered Person
shall not be entitled to indemnification under this Section with
respect to any claim, issue or matter if there is a final and
non-appealable judicial determination and/or determination of an
arbitrator that such Covered Person did not act in good faith and
in what such Covered Person reasonably believed to be in, or not
opposed to, the best interest of the Company and within the
authority granted to such Covered Person by this Agreement, and,
with respect to any criminal act or proceeding, had reasonable
cause to believe that such Covered Person’s conduct was
unlawful; provided further , that if such Covered Person is
a Member or a Withdrawn Member, such Covered Person shall bear its
share of such Losses in accordance with such Covered Person’s
GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage in the Company as of the time
of the actions or omissions that gave rise to such Losses. To the
fullest extent permitted by law, expenses (including legal fees)
incurred by a Covered Person (including, without limitation, the
Managing Member) in defending any claim, demand, action, suit or
proceeding may, with the approval of the Managing Member, from time
to time, be advanced by the Company prior to the final disposition
of such claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding upon receipt by
the Company of a written undertaking by or on behalf of the Covered
Person to repay such amount to the extent that it shall be
subsequently determined that the Covered Person is not entitled to
be indemnified as authorized in this Section, and the Company and
its Affiliates shall have a continuing right of offset against such
Covered Person’s interests/investments in the Company and
such Affiliates and shall have the right to withhold amounts
otherwise distributable to such Covered Person to satisfy such
repayment obligation. If a Member institutes litigation against a
Covered Person which gives rise to an indemnity obligation
hereunder, such Member shall be responsible, up to the amount of
such Member’s Interests and remaining capital commitment, for
such Member’s pro rata share of the Company’s expenses
related to such indemnity obligation, as determined by the Managing
Member. The Company may purchase insurance, to the extent available
at reasonable cost, to cover losses, claims, damages or liabilities
covered by the foregoing indemnification provisions. Members will
not be personally obligated with respect to indemnification
pursuant to this Section.

3.6. Representations of
Members . (a) Each Regular and Special Member by execution
of this Agreement (or by otherwise becoming bound by the terms and
conditions hereof as provided herein or in the LLC Act) represents
and warrants to every other Member and to the Company, except as
may be waived by the Managing Member, that such Member is acquiring
each of such Member’s Interests for such Member’s own
account for investment and not with a view to resell or distribute
the same or any part hereof, and that no other person has any
interest in any such Interest or in the rights of such Member
hereunder; provided, that a Member may choose to make
transfers for estate and charitable planning purposes (in
accordance with the terms hereof). Each Regular and Special Member
represents and warrants that such Member understands that the
Interests have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933
and therefore such Interests may not be resold without registration
under such Act or exemption from such registration, and that
accordingly such Member must bear the economic risk of an
investment in the Company for an indefinite period of time. Each
Regular and Special Member represents that such Member has such
knowledge and experience in financial and business matters, that
such Member is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of an
investment in the Company, and that
 

23
 

such Member is able to bear the economic
risk of such investment. Each Regular and Special Member represents
that such Member’s overall commitment to the Company and
other investments which are not readily marketable is not
disproportionate to the Member’s net worth and the Member has
no need for liquidity in the Member’s investment in
Interests. Each Regular and Special Member represents that to the
full satisfaction of the Member, the Member has been furnished any
materials that such Member has requested relating to the Company,
any Investment and the offering of Interests and has been afforded
the opportunity to ask questions of representatives of the Company
concerning the terms and conditions of the offering of Interests
and any matters pertaining to each Investment and to obtain any
other additional information relating thereto. Each Regular and
Special Member represents that the Member has consulted to the
extent deemed appropriate by the Member with the Member’s own
advisers as to the financial, tax, legal and related matters
concerning an investment in Interests and on that basis believes
that an investment in the Interests is suitable and appropriate for
the Member. Each Regular and Special Member (other than BCA V)
represents that such Member is a “qualified purchaser”
(as such term is used in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended (the “ 1940 Act ”)), for purposes, among
other things, of Section 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act.

(b) Each Regular and Special
Member agrees that the representations and warranties contained in
paragraph (a) above shall be true and correct as of any date
that such Member (1) makes a capital contribution to the
Company (whether as a result of Firm Advances made to such Member
or otherwise) with respect to any Investment, and such Member
hereby agrees that such capital contribution shall serve as
confirmation thereof and/or (2) repays any portion of the
principal amount of a Firm Advance, and such Member hereby agrees
that such repayment shall serve as confirmation thereof.

3.7. Tax Information .
Each Regular and Special Member certifies that (A) if the
Member is a United States person (as defined in the Code)
(x) (i) the Member’s name, social security number
(or, if applicable, employer identification number) and address
provided to the Company and its affiliates pursuant to an IRS Form
W-9, Payer’s Request for Taxpayer Identification Number
Certification (“ W-9 ”) or otherwise are correct
and (ii) the Member will complete and return a W-9, and
(y) (i) the Member is a United States person (as defined
in the Code) and (ii) the Member will notify the Company
within 60 days of a change to foreign (non-United States) status or
(B) if the Member is not a United States person (as defined in
the Code) (x) (i) the information on the completed IRS
Form W-8BEN, Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for
United States Tax Withholding (“ W-8BEN ”) or
other applicable form, including but not limited to IRS Form
W-8IMY, Certificate of Foreign Intermediary, Foreign Partnership,
or Certain U.S. Branches for United States Tax Withholding (“
W-8IMY ”), or otherwise is correct and (ii) the
Member will complete and return the applicable IRS form, including
but not limited to a W-8BEN or W-8IMY, and (y) (i) the
Member is not a United States person (as defined in the Code) and
(ii) the Member will notify the Company within 60 days of any
change of such status. The Member agrees to properly execute and
provide to the Company in a timely manner any tax documentation
that may be reasonably required by the Company or the Managing
Member.

ARTICLE IV

CAPITAL OF THE
COMPANY

4.1. Capital Contributions
by Members . (a) Except as agreed by the Managing Member
and a Regular Member, such Regular Member shall not be required to
make capital contributions to the Company (“ GP-Related
Capital Contributions ”) at such times and in such
amounts (the “ GP-Related Required Amounts ”) as
are required to satisfy the Company’s obligation to make
capital contributions to BMA V in respect of the GP-Related BMA V
Member Interest to fund BMA V’s capital contribution in
respect of any GP-Related BCP V Investment and as are otherwise
determined by the Managing Member from time to time;
provided , that additional GP-Related Capital Contributions
in
 

24
 

excess of the GP-Related Required
Amounts may be made pro rata among the Regular Members based upon
each Regular Member’s Carried Interest Sharing Percentage.
GP-Related Capital Contributions in excess of the GP-Related
Required Amounts which are to be used for ongoing business
operations (as distinct from financing, legal or other specific
liabilities of the Company (including those specifically set forth
in Sections 4.1(d) and 5.8(d)) shall be determined by the Managing
Member. Special Members shall not be required to make additional
GP-Related Capital Contributions to the Company in excess of the
GP-Related Required Amounts, except (i) as a condition of an
increase in such Special Member’s GP-Related Profit Sharing
Percentage or (ii) as specifically set forth in this
Agreement; provided , that the Managing Member and any
Special Member may agree from time to time that such Special Member
shall make an additional GP-Related Capital Contribution to the
Company; provided further , that each Investor Special
Member shall maintain its GP-Related Capital Accounts at an
aggregate level equal to the product of (i) its GP-Related
Profit Sharing Percentage from time to time and (ii) the total
capital of the Company.

(b) Each GP-Related Capital
Contribution by a Member shall be credited to the appropriate
GP-Related Capital Account of such Member in accordance with
Section 5.2.

(c) The Managing Member may
elect on a case by case basis to (i) cause the Company to loan
any Member (including any additional Member admitted to the Company
pursuant to Section 6.1 but excluding any Members that are
also executive officers of The Blackstone Group L.P.) the amount of
any GP-Related Capital Contribution required to be made by such
Member or (ii) permit any Member (including any additional
Member admitted to the Company pursuant to Section 6.1) to
make a required GP-Related Capital Contribution to the Company in
installments, in each case on terms determined by the Managing
Member.

(d) (i) The Members and the
Withdrawn Members have entered into the Trust Agreement, pursuant
to which certain amounts of Carried Interest will be paid to the
Trustee(s) for deposit in the Trust Account (such amounts to be
paid to the Trustee(s) for deposit in the Trust Account
constituting a “ Holdback ”). The Managing
Member shall determine, as set forth below, the percentage of
Carried Interest that shall be withheld for each Member Category
(such withheld percentage constituting such Member Category’s
“ Holdback Percentage ”). The applicable
Holdback Percentages initially shall be 0% for the Managing Member,
15% for Existing Members (other than the Managing Member), 21% for
Retaining Withdrawn Members and 24% for Deceased Members (the
“ Initial Holdback Percentages ”).

(ii) The Holdback Percentage
may not be reduced for any individual Member as compared to the
other Members in his Member Category (except as provided in clause
(iv) below). The Managing Member may only reduce the Holdback
Percentages among the Member Categories on a proportionate basis.
For example, if the Holdback Percentage for Existing Members is
decreased to 12.5%, the Holdback Percentage for Retaining Withdrawn
Members and Deceased Members shall be reduced to 17.5% and 20%,
respectively. Any reduction in the Holdback Percentage for any
Member shall apply only to distributions relating to Carried
Interest made after the date of such reduction.

(iii) The Holdback Percentage
may not be increased for any individual Member as compared to the
other Members in his Member Category (except as provided in clause
(iv) below). The Managing Member may not increase the
Retaining Withdrawn Members’ Holdback Percentage beyond 21%
unless the Managing Member concurrently increases the Existing
Members’ Holdback Percentage to the Holdback Percentage of
the Retaining Withdrawn Members. The Managing Member may not
increase the Deceased Members’ Holdback Percentage beyond 24%
unless the Managing Member increases the Holdback Percentage for
both Existing Members and Retaining Withdrawn Members to 24%. The
Managing Member may not increase the Holdback Percentage of any
Member Category beyond 24% unless such
 

25
 


increase applies equally to
all Member Categories. Any increase in the Holdback Percentage for
any Member shall apply only to distributions relating to Carried
Interest made after the date of such increase. The foregoing shall
in no way prevent the Managing Member from proportionately
increasing the Holdback Percentage of any Member Category
(following a reduction of the Holdback Percentages below the
Initial Holdback Percentages), if the resulting Holdback
Percentages are consistent with the above. For example, if the
Managing Member reduces the Holdback Percentages for Existing
Members, Retaining Withdrawn Members and Deceased Members to 12.5%,
17.5% and 20%, respectively, the Managing Member shall have the
right to subsequently increase the Holdback Percentages to the
Initial Holdback Percentages.

(iv) (A) Notwithstanding
anything contained herein to the contrary, the Company may increase
or decrease the Holdback Percentage for any Member in any Member
Category (in such capacity, the “ Subject Member
”) pursuant to a majority vote of the Regular Members (a
“ Holdback Vote ”); provided , that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the
Holdback Percentage applicable to the Managing Member shall not be
increased or decreased without its prior written consent;
provided further , that a Subject Member’s Holdback
Percentage shall not be (I) increased prior to such time as
such Subject Member (x) is notified by the Company of the
decision to increase such Subject Member’s Holdback
Percentage and (y) has, if requested by such Subject Member,
been given 30 days to gather and provide information to the Company
for consideration before a second Holdback Vote (requested by the
Subject Member) or (II) decreased unless such decrease occurs
subsequent to an increase in a Subject Member’s Holdback
Percentage pursuant to a Holdback Vote under this clause (iv);
provided further , that such decrease shall not
exceed an amount such that such Subject Member’s Holdback
Percentage is less than the prevailing Holdback Percentage for the
Member Category of such Subject Member; provided
further , that a Member shall not vote to increase a Subject
Member’s Holdback Percentage unless such voting Member
determines, in his good faith judgment, that the facts and
circumstances indicate that it is reasonably likely that such
Subject Member, or any of his successors or assigns (including his
estate or heirs) who at the time of such vote holds the Interest or
otherwise has the right to receive distributions relating thereto,
will not be capable of satisfying any Recontribution Amounts that
may become due.

 


 
(B)
A Holdback Vote shall take place at a Company meeting. Each
Regular Member shall be entitled to cast one vote with respect to
the Holdback Vote regardless of such Regular Member’s
interest in the Company. Such vote may be cast by any Regular
Member in person or by proxy.



 


 
(C)

If the result
of the second Holdback Vote is an increase in a Subject
Member’s Holdback Percentage, such Subject Member may submit
the decision to an arbitrator, the identity of which is mutually
agreed upon by both the Subject Member and the Company;
provided , that if the Company and the Subject Member cannot
agree upon a mutually satisfactory arbitrator within 10 days of the
second Holdback Vote, each of the Company and the Subject Member
shall request their candidate for arbitrator to select a third
arbitrator satisfactory to such candidates; provided
further , that if such candidates fail to agree upon a
mutually satisfactory arbitrator within 30 days of such request,
the then sitting President of the American Arbitration Association
shall unilaterally select the arbitrator. Each Subject Member that
submits the decision of the Company pursuant to the second Holdback
Vote to arbitration and the Company shall estimate their reasonably
projected out-of-pocket expenses relating thereto, and each such
party shall, to the satisfaction of the arbitrator and prior to any
determination being made by the arbitrator, pay the total of such
estimated



 

26
 



 

expenses (i.e., both the
Subject Member’s and the Company’s expenses) into an
escrow account to be controlled by Simpson Thacher &
Bartlett LLP, as escrow agent (or such other comparable law firm as
the Company and the Subject Member shall agree). The arbitrator
shall direct the escrow agent to pay out of such escrow account all
expenses associated with such arbitration (including costs leading
thereto) and to return to the “victorious” party the
entire amount of funds such party paid into such escrow account. If
the amount contributed to the escrow account by the losing party is
insufficient to cover the expenses of such arbitration, such
“losing” party shall then provide any additional funds
necessary to cover such costs to such “victorious”
party. For purposes hereof, the “victorious” party
shall be the Company if the Holdback Percentage ultimately
determined by the arbitrator is closer to the percentage determined
in the second Holdback Vote than it is to the prevailing Holdback
Percentage for the Subject Member’s Member Category;
otherwise, the Subject Member shall be the “victorious”
party. The party that is not the “victorious” party
shall be the “losing” party.




 


 
(D)
In the event of a decrease in a Subject Member’s Holdback
Percentage (1) pursuant to a Holdback Vote under this clause
(iv) or (2) pursuant to a decision of an arbitrator under
paragraph (C) of this clause (iv), the Company shall release
and distribute to such Subject Member any Trust Amounts (and the
Trust Income thereon (except as expressly provided herein with
respect to using Trust Income as Firm Collateral)) which exceed the
required Holdback of such Subject Member (in accordance with such
Subject Member’s reduced Holdback Percentage) as though such
reduced Holdback Percentage had applied since the increase of the
Subject Member’s Holdback Percentage pursuant to a previous
Holdback Vote under this clause (iv).



(v) (A) If a Member’s
Holdback Percentage exceeds 15% (such percentage in excess of 15%
constituting the “ Excess Holdback Percentage
”), such Member may satisfy the portion of his Holdback
obligation in respect of his Excess Holdback Percentage (such
portion constituting such Member’s “ Excess
Holdback ”), and such Member (or a Withdrawn Member with
respect to amounts contributed to the Trust Account while he was a
Member), to the extent his Excess Holdback obligation has
previously been satisfied in cash, may obtain the release of the
Trust Amounts (but not the Trust Income thereon which shall remain
in the Trust Account and allocated to such Member or Withdrawn
Member) satisfying such Member’s or Withdrawn Member’s
Excess Holdback obligation, by pledging or otherwise making
available to the Company, on a first priority basis (except as
provided below), all or any portion of his Firm Collateral in
satisfaction of his Excess Holdback obligation. Any Member seeking
to satisfy all or any portion of the Excess Holdback utilizing Firm
Collateral shall sign such documents and otherwise take such other
action as is necessary or appropriate (in the good faith judgment
of the Managing Member) to perfect a first priority security
interest in, and otherwise assure the ability of the Company to
realize on (if required), such Firm Collateral; provided ,
that, in the case of entities listed in the Company’s books
and records in which Members are permitted to pledge their
interests therein to finance all or a portion of their capital
contributions thereto (“ Pledgable Blackstone
Interests ”), to the extent a first priority security
interest is unavailable because of an existing lien on such Firm
Collateral, the Member or Withdrawn Member seeking to utilize such
Firm Collateral shall grant the Company a second priority security
interest therein in the manner provided above; provided
further , that (x) in the case of Pledgable Blackstone
Interests, to the extent that neither a first priority nor a second
priority security interest is available, or (y) if the
Managing Member otherwise determines in its good faith judgment
that a security interest in
 

27
 


Firm Collateral (and the
corresponding documents and actions) are not necessary or
appropriate, the Member or Withdrawn Member shall (in the case of
either clause (x) or (y) above) irrevocably instruct in
writing the relevant partnership, limited liability company or
other entity listed in the Company’s books and records to
remit any and all net proceeds resulting from a Firm Collateral
Realization on such Firm Collateral to the Trustee(s) as more fully
provided in clause (B) below. The Company shall, at the
request of any Member or Withdrawn Member, assist such Member or
Withdrawn Member in taking such action necessary to enable such
Member or Withdrawn Member to use Firm Collateral as provided
hereunder.

 


 
(B)
If upon a sale or other realization of all or any portion of
any Firm Collateral (a “ Firm Collateral Realization
”), the remaining Firm Collateral is insufficient to cover
any Member’s or Withdrawn Member’s Excess Holdback
requirement, then up to 100% of the net proceeds otherwise
distributable to such Member or Withdrawn Member from such Firm
Collateral Realization (including distributions subject to the
repayment of financing sources as in the case of Pledgable
Blackstone Interests) shall be paid into the Trust Account to fully
satisfy such Excess Holdback requirement (allocated to such Member
or Withdrawn Member) and shall be deemed to be Trust Amounts for
purposes hereunder. Any net proceeds from such Firm Collateral
Realization in excess of the amount necessary to satisfy such
Excess Holdback requirement shall be distributed to such Member or
Withdrawn Member.



 


 
(C)
Upon any valuation or revaluation of Firm Collateral that
results in a decreased valuation of such Firm Collateral so that
such Firm Collateral is insufficient to cover any Member’s or
Withdrawn Member’s Excess Holdback requirement (including
upon a Firm Collateral Realization, if net proceeds therefrom and
the remaining Firm Collateral are insufficient to cover any
Member’s or Withdrawn Member’s Excess Holdback
requirement), the Company shall provide notice of the foregoing to
such Member or Withdrawn Member and such Member or Withdrawn Member
shall, within 30 days of receiving such notice, contribute cash (or
additional Firm Collateral) to the Trust Account in an amount
necessary to satisfy his Excess Holdback requirement. If any such
Member or Withdrawn Member defaults upon his obligations under this
clause (C), then Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall apply thereto;
provided , that clause (A) of the first sentence of
Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be deemed inapplicable to a default
under this clause (C); provided further , that for
purposes of applying Section 5.8(d)(ii) to a default under
this clause (C): (I) the term “GP-Related Defaulting
Party” where such term appears in such
Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be construed as “defaulting
party” for purposes hereof and (II) the terms “Net
GP-Related Recontribution Amount” and “GP-Related
Recontribution Amount” where such terms appear in such
Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be construed as the amount due
pursuant to this clause (C).



(vi) Any Member or Withdrawn
Member may (A) obtain the release of any Trust Amounts (but
not the Trust Income thereon which shall remain in the Trust
Account and allocated to such Member or Withdrawn Member) or Firm
Collateral, in each case, held in the Trust Account for the benefit
of such Member or Withdrawn Member or (B) require the Company
to distribute all or any portion of amounts otherwise required to
be placed in the Trust Account (whether cash or Firm Collateral),
by obtaining a letter of credit (an “ L/C ”) for
the benefit of the Trustee(s) in such amounts. Any Member or
Withdrawn Member choosing to furnish an L/C to the Trustee(s) (in
such capacity, an “ L/C Member ”) shall deliver
to the Trustee(s) an unconditional and irrevocable L/C from a
commercial bank whose (x) short-term
 

28
 


deposits are rated at least
A-1 by S&P and P-1 by Moody’s (if the L/C is for a term
of 1 year or less), or (y) long-term deposits are rated at
least A+ by S&P or A1 by Moody’s (if the L/C is for a
term of 1 year or more) (each a “ Required Rating
”). If the relevant rating of the commercial bank issuing
such L/C drops below the relevant Required Rating, the L/C Member
shall supply to the Trustee(s), within 30 days of such occurrence,
a new L/C from a commercial bank whose relevant rating is at least
equal to the relevant Required Rating, in lieu of the insufficient
L/C. In addition, if the L/C has a term expiring on a date earlier
than the latest possible termination date of BCP V, the Trustee(s)
shall be permitted to drawdown on such L/C if the L/C Member fails
to provide a new L/C from a commercial bank whose relevant rating
is at least equal to the relevant Required Rating, at least 30 days
prior to the stated expiration date of such existing L/C. The
Trustee(s) shall notify an L/C Member 10 days prior to drawing on
any L/C. The Trustee(s) may (as directed by the Company in the case
of clause (I) below) draw down on an L/C only if (I) such
a drawdown is necessary to satisfy an L/C Member’s obligation
relating to the Company’s obligations under the Clawback
Provisions or (II) an L/C Member has not provided a new L/C from a
commercial bank whose relevant rating is at least equal to the
relevant Required Rating (or the requisite amount of cash and/or
Firm Collateral (to the extent permitted hereunder)), at least 30
days prior to the stated expiration of an existing L/C in
accordance with this clause (vi). The Trustee(s), as directed by
the Company, shall return to any L/C Member his L/C upon
(1) the termination of the Trust Account and satisfaction of
the Company’s obligations, if any, in respect of the Clawback
Provisions, (2) an L/C Member satisfying his entire Holdback
obligation in cash and Firm Collateral (to the extent permitted
hereunder), or (3) the release, by the Trustee(s), as directed
by the Company, of all amounts in the Trust Account to the Members
or Withdrawn Members. If an L/C Member satisfies a portion of his
Holdback obligation in cash and/or Firm Collateral (to the extent
permitted hereunder) or if the Trustee(s), as directed by the
Company, release a portion of the amounts in the Trust Account to
the Members or Withdrawn Members in the Member Category of such L/C
Member, the L/C of an L/C Member may be reduced by an amount
corresponding to such portion satisfied in cash and/or Firm
Collateral (to the extent permitted hereunder) or such portion
released by the Trustee(s), as directed by the Company;
provided , that in no way shall the general release of any
Trust Income cause an L/C Member to be permitted to reduce the
amount of an L/C by any amount.

(vii) (A) Any in-kind
distributions by the Company relating to Carried Interest shall be
made in accordance herewith as though such distributions consisted
of cash. The Company may direct the Trustee(s) to dispose of any
in-kind distributions held in the Trust Account at any time. The
net proceeds therefrom shall be treated as though initially
contributed to the Trust Account.

 


 
(B)
In lieu of the foregoing, any Existing Member may pledge with
respect to any in-kind distribution the Special Firm Collateral
referred to in asset category 5 on the Company’s books and
records; provided , that the initial contribution of such
Special Firm Collateral shall initially equal 130% of the required
Holdback Amount for a period of 90 days, and thereafter shall equal
at least 115% of the required Holdback Amount. Paragraphs
4.1(d)(viii)(C) and (D) shall apply to such Special Firm
Collateral. To the extent such Special Firm Collateral exceeds the
applicable minimum percentage of the required Holdback Amount
specified in the first sentence of this clause (vii)(B), the
related Member may obtain a release of such excess amount from the
Trust Account.



(viii) (A) Any Regular Member
or Withdrawn Member may satisfy all or any portion of his Holdback
(excluding any Excess Holdback), and such Member or a Withdrawn
Member may, to the extent his Holdback (excluding any Excess
Holdback) has been previously been
 

29
 


satisfied in cash or by the
use of an L/C as provided herein, obtain a release of Trust Amounts
(but not the Trust Income thereon which shall remain in the Trust
Account and allocated to such Member or Withdrawn Member) that
satisfy such Member’s or Withdrawn Member’s Holdback
(excluding any Excess Holdback) by pledging to the Trustee(s) on a
first priority basis all of his Special Firm Collateral in a
particular Qualifying Fund, which at all times must equal or exceed
the amount of the Holdback distributed to the Member or Withdrawn
Member (as more fully set forth below). Any Member seeking to
satisfy such Member’s Holdback utilizing Special Firm
Collateral shall sign such documents and otherwise take such other
action as is necessary or appropriate (in the good faith judgment
of the Managing Member) to perfect a first priority security
interest in, and otherwise assure the ability of the Trustee(s) to
realize on (if required), such Special Firm Collateral.

 


 
(B)
If upon a distribution, withdrawal, sale, liquidation or other
realization of all or any portion of any Special Firm Collateral (a
“ Special Firm Collateral Realization ”), the
remaining Special Firm Collateral (which shall not include the
amount of Firm Collateral that consists of a Qualifying Fund and is
being used in connection with an Excess Holdback) is insufficient
to cover any Member’s or Withdrawn Member’s Holdback
(when taken together with other means of satisfying the Holdback as
provided herein (i.e., cash contributed to the Trust Account or an
L/C in the Trust Account)), then up to 100% of the net proceeds
otherwise distributable to such Member or Withdrawn Member from
such Special Firm Collateral Realization (which shall not include
the amount of Firm Collateral that consists of a Qualifying Fund or
other asset and is being used in connection with an Excess
Holdback) shall be paid into the Trust (and allocated to such
Member or Withdrawn Member) to fully satisfy such Holdback and
shall be deemed thereafter to be Trust Amounts for purposes
hereunder. Any net proceeds from such Special Firm Collateral
Realization in excess of the amount necessary to satisfy such
Holdback (excluding any Excess Holdback) shall be distributed to
such Member or Withdrawn Member. To the extent a Qualifying Fund
distributes Securities to a Member or Withdrawn Member in
connection with a Special Firm Collateral Realization, such Member
or Withdrawn Member shall be required to promptly fund such
Member’s or Withdrawn Member’s deficiency with respect
to his Holdback in cash or an L/C.



 


 
(C)

Upon any
valuation or revaluation of the Special Firm Collateral and/or any
adjustment in the Applicable Collateral Percentage applicable to a
Qualifying Fund (as provided in the Company’s books and
records), if such Member’s or Withdrawn Member’s
Special Firm Collateral is valued at less than such Member’s
Holdback (excluding any Excess Holdback) as provided in the
Company’s books and records, taking into account other
permitted means of satisfying the Holdback hereunder, the Company
shall provide notice of the foregoing to such Member or Withdrawn
Member and, within 10 business days of receiving such notice, such
Member or Withdrawn Member shall contribute cash or additional
Special Firm Collateral to the Trust Account in an amount necessary
to make up such deficiency. If any such Member or Withdrawn Member
defaults upon his obligations under this clause (C), then
Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall apply thereto; provided , that
the first sentence of Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be deemed
inapplicable to such default; provided further , that
for purposes of applying Section 5.8(d)(ii) to a default under
this clause (C): (I) the term “GP-Related Defaulting
Party” where such term appears in such
Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be construed as “defaulting
party” for purposes hereof and (II) the terms



 

30
 



 

“Net GP-Related
Recontribution Amount” and “GP-Related Recontribution
Amount” where such terms appear in such
Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be construed as the amount due
pursuant to this clause (C).




 


 
(D)
Upon a Member becoming a Withdrawn Member, at any time
thereafter the Managing Member may revoke the ability of such
Withdrawn Member to use Special Firm Collateral as set forth in
this Section 4.1(d)(viii), notwithstanding anything else in
this Section 4.1(d)(viii). In that case the provisions of
clause (C) above shall apply to the Withdrawn Member’s
obligation to satisfy the Holdback (except that 30 days’
notice of such revocation shall be given), given that the Special
Firm Collateral is no longer available to satisfy any portion of
the Holdback (excluding any Excess Holdback).



 


 
(E)
Nothing in this Section 4.1(d)(viii) shall prevent any
Member or Withdrawn Member from using any amount of such
Member’s interest in a Qualifying Fund as Firm Collateral;
provided that at all times Section 4.1(d)(v) and this
Section 4.1(d)(viii) are each satisfied.



4.2. Interest .
Interest on the balances of the Members’ capital related to
the Members’ GP-Related Member Interests (excluding capital
invested in GP-Related Investments and, if deemed appropriate by
the Managing Member, capital invested in any other investment of
the Company) shall be credited to the Members’ GP-Related
Capital Accounts at the end of each accounting period pursuant to
Section 5.2, or at any other time as determined by the
Managing Member, at rates determined by the Managing Member from
time to time, and shall be charged as an expense of the
Company.

4.3. Withdrawals of
Capital . No Member may withdraw capital related to such
Member’s GP-Related Member Interest from the Company except
(i) for distributions of cash or other property pursuant to
Section 5.8, (ii) as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement or (iii) as determined by the Managing
Member.

ARTICLE V

PARTICIPATION IN PROFITS AND
LOSSES

Matters . (a) GP-Related Net Income (Loss) shall be
determined by the Managing Member at the end of each accounting

to the Company’s GP-Related BMA V Member Interest for any

otherwise disposed of means (i) the sum of the gross proceeds
from the sale or other disposition of such GP-Related Investment
and the gross amount of dividends, interest or other income
received by the Company from such GP-Related Investment during such
accounting period less (ii) the sum of the cost or other basis
to the Company of such GP-Related Investment and all expenses of
the Company for such accounting period that are allocable to such
GP-Related Investment.
GP-Related Net Income (Loss) shall be
determined in accordance with the accounting method used by the
Company for U.S. federal income tax purposes with the following
adjustments: (i) any income of the Company that is exempt from
U.S. federal income taxation and not otherwise taken into account
in computing GP-Related Net Income (L

party or otherwise, by reason of such Covered Person’s
management of the affairs of the Company or which relate to or
arise out of or in connection with the Company, its property, its
business or affairs (other than claims, demands, actions, suits or
proceedings, civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of any act or omission of such Covered Person
constituting Cause); provided , that a Covered Person shall

Covered Person did not act in good faith and in what such Covered
Person reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best
interest of the Company and within the authority granted to such
Covered Person by this Agreement, and, with respect to any criminal
act or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that such
Covered Person’s conduct was unlawful; provided

Withdrawn Member, such Covered Person shall bear its share of such
Losses in accordance with such Covered Person’s GP-Related

extent permitted by law, expenses (including legal fees) incurred
by a Covered Person (including, without limitation, the Managing
Member) in defending any claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding
may, with the approval of the Managing Member, from time to time,
be advanced by the Company prior to the final disposition of such
claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding upon receipt by the
Company of a written undertaking by or on behalf of the Covered
Person to repay such amount to the extent that it shall be
subsequently determined that the Covered Person is not entitled to
be indemnified as authorized in this Section, and the Company and
its Affiliates shall have a continuing right of offset against such
Covered Person’s interests/investments in the Company and
such Affiliates and shall have the right to withhold amounts
otherwise distributable to such Covered Person to satisfy such
repayment obligation. If a Member institutes litigation against a
Covered Person which gives rise to an indemnity obligation
hereunder, such Member shall be responsible, up to the amount of
such Member’s Interests and remaining capital commitment, for
such Member’s pro rata share of the Company’s expenses
related to such indemnity obligation, as determined by the Managing
Member. The Company may purchase insurance, to the extent available

each of such Member’s Interests for such Member’s own
account for investment and not with a view to resell or distribute
the same or any part hereof, and that no other person has any
interest in any such Interest or in the rights of such Member
hereunder; provided, that a Member may choose to make
transfers for estate and charitable planning purposes (in
accordance with the terms hereof). Each Regular or Special Member
represents and warrants that such Member understands that the
Interests have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933
and therefore such Interests may not be resold without registration
under such Act or exemption from such registration, and that
accordingly such Member must bear the economic risk of an
investment in the Company for an indefinite period of time. Each
Regular or Special Member represents that such Member has such
knowledge and experience in financial and business matters, that
such Member is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of an
investment in the Company, and that such Member is able to bear the
economic risk of such investment. Each Regular or Special Member
represents that such Member’s overall commitment to the
Company and other investments which are not readily marketable is
not disproportionate to the Member’s net worth and the Member
has no need for liquidity in the Member’s investment in
Interests. Each Regular or Special Member represents that to the
full satisfaction of the Member, the Member has been furnished any
materials that such Member has requested relating to the Company,
any Investment and the offering of Interests and has been afforded
the opportunity to ask questions of representatives of the Company
concerning the terms and conditions of the offering of Interests
and any matters pertaining to each Investment and to obtain any
other additional information relating thereto. Each Regular or
Special Member represents that the Member has consulted to the
extent deemed appropriate by the Member with the Member’s own
advisers as to the financial, tax, legal and related matters
concerning an investment in Interests and on that basis believes
that an investment in the Interests is suitable and appropriate for
the Member.

(b) Each Regular or Special Member
agrees that the representations and warranties contained in
paragraph (a) above shall be true and correct as of any date
that such Member (1) makes a capital contribution to the
Company (whether as a result of Firm Advances made to such Member
or otherwise) with respect to any Investment, and such Member
hereby agrees that such capital contribution shall serve as
confirmation thereof and/or (2) repays any portion of the
principal amount of a Firm Advance, and such Member hereby agrees
that such repayment shall serve as confirmation thereof.

3.7. Tax Information . Each
Regular or Special Member certifies that (A) if the Member is
a United States person (as defined in the Code)
(x) (i) the Member’s name, social security number
(or, if applicable, employer identification number) and address
provided to the Company and its affiliates pursuant to an IRS Form
W-9, Payer’s Request for Taxpayer Identification Number
Certification (“ W-9 ”) or otherwise are correct
and (ii) the Member will complete and return a W-9, and
(y) (i) the Member is a United States person (as defined
in the Code) and (ii) the Member will notify the Company
within 60 days of a change to foreign (non-United States) status or
(B) if the Member is not a United States person (as defined in
the Code) (x) (i) the information on the completed IRS
Form W-8BEN, Certificate of Foreign Status of Beneficial Owner for
United States Tax Withholding (“ W-8BEN ”) or
other applicable form, including but not limited to IRS Form
W-8IMY, Certificate of Foreign Intermediary, Foreign Partnership,
or Certain U.S. Branches for United States Tax Withholding (“
W-8IMY ”), or otherwise is correct and (ii) the
Member will complete and return the applicable IRS form, including
but not limited to a W-8BEN or W-8IMY, and (y) (i) the
Member is not a United States person (as defined in the Code) and
(ii) the Member will notify the Company within 60 days of any
change of such status. The Member agrees to properly execute and
provide to the Company in a timely manner any tax documentation
that may be reasonably required by the Company or the Managing
Member.

ARTICLE IV

CAPITAL OF THE COMPANY

4.1. Capital Contributions by
Members . (a) Except as agreed by the Managing Member and
a Regular Member, such Regular Member shall not be required to make
capital contributions to the Company (“ GP-Related Capital
Contributions ”) at such times and in such amounts (the
“ GP-Related Required Amounts ”) as are required
to satisfy the Company’s obligation to make capital
contributions to BMA VI in respect of the GP-Related BMA VI Member
Interest to fund BMA VI’s capital contribution in respect of
any GP-Related BCP VI Investment and as are otherwise determined by
the Managing Member from time to time or as may be set forth in
such Regular Member’s Commitment Agreement or SMD Agreement,
if any; provided , that additional GP-Related Capital
Contributions in excess of the GP-Related Required Amounts may be
made pro rata among the Regular Members based upon each Regular
Member’s Carried Interest Sharing Percentage. GP-Related
Capital Contributions in excess of the GP-Related Required Amounts
which are to be used for ongoing business operations (as distinct
from financing, legal or other specific liabilities of the Company
(including those specifically set forth in Sections 4.1(d) and
5.8(d)) shall be determined by the Managing Member. Special Members
shall not be required to make additional GP-Related Capital
Contributions to the Company in excess of the GP-Related Required
Amounts, except (i) as a condition of an increase in such
Special Member’s GP-Related Profit Sharing Percentage or
(ii) as specifically set forth in this Agreement;
provided , that the Managing Member and any Special Member
may agree from time to time that such Special Member shall make an
additional GP-Related Capital Contribution to the Company;
provided further , that each Investor Special Member
shall maintain its GP-Related Capital Accounts at an aggregate
level equal to the product of (i) its GP-Related Profit
Sharing Percentage from time to time and (ii) the total
capital of the Company.
 
24




(b) Each GP-Related Capital
Contribution by a Member shall be credited to the appropriate
GP-Related Capital Account of such Member in accordance with
Section 5.2.

(c) The Managing Member may elect on
a case by case basis to (i) cause the Company to loan any
Member (including any additional Member admitted to the Company
pursuant to Section 6.1 but excluding any Members that are
also executive officers of The Blackstone Group L.P.) the amount of
any GP-Related Capital Contribution required to be made by such
Member or (ii) permit any Member (including any additional
Member admitted to the Company pursuant to Section 6.1) to
make a required GP-Related Capital Contribution to the Company in
installments, in each case on terms determined by the Managing
Member.

(d) (i) The Members and the
Withdrawn Members have entered into the Trust Agreement, pursuant
to which certain amounts of Carried Interest will be paid to the
Trustee(s) for deposit in the Trust Account (such amounts to be
paid to the Trustee(s) for deposit in the Trust Account
constituting a “ Holdback ”). The Managing
Member shall determine, as set forth below, the percentage of
Carried Interest that shall be withheld for the Managing Member and
each Member Category (such withheld percentage constituting the
Managing Member’s and such Member Category’s “
Holdback Percentage ”). The applicable Holdback
Percentages initially shall be 0% for the Managing Member, 15% for
Existing Members (other than the Managing Member), 21% for
Retaining Withdrawn Members (other than the Managing Member) and
24% for Deceased Members (the “ Initial Holdback
Percentages ”). Any provision of this Agreement not the
contrary notwithstanding, the Holdback Percentage for the Managing
Member shall not be subject to change pursuant to clause (ii),
(iii) or (iv) of this Section 4.1(d).

(ii) The Holdback Percentage may not
be reduced for any individual Member as compared to the other
Members in his Member Category (except as provided in clause
(iv) below). The Managing Member may only reduce the Holdback
Percentages among the Member Categories on a proportionate basis.
For example, if the Holdback Percentage for Existing Members is
decreased to 12.5%, the Holdback Percentage for Retaining Withdrawn
Members and Deceased Members shall be reduced to 17.5% and 20%,
respectively. Any reduction in the Holdback Percentage for any
Member shall apply only to distributions relating to Carried
Interest made after the date of such reduction.

(iii) The Holdback Percentage may
not be increased for any individual Member as compared to the other
Members in his Member Category (except as provided in clause
(iv) below). The Managing Member may not increase the
Retaining Withdrawn Members’ Holdback Percentage beyond 21%
unless the Managing Member concurrently increases the Existing
Members’ Holdback Percentage to the Holdback Percentage of
the Retaining Withdrawn Members. The Managing Member may not
increase the Deceased Members’ Holdback Percentage beyond 24%
unless the Managing Member increases the Holdback Percentage for
both Existing Members and Retaining Withdrawn Members to 24%. The
Managing Member may not increase the Holdback Percentage of any
Member Category beyond 24% unless such increase applies equally to
all Member Categories. Any increase in the Holdback Percentage for
any Member shall apply only to distributions relating to Carried
Interest made after the date of such increase. The foregoing shall
in no way prevent the Managing Member from proportionately
increasing the Holdback Percentage of any Member Category
(following a reduction of the Holdback Percentages below the
Initial Holdback Percentages), if the resulting Holdback
Percentages are consistent with the above. For example, if the
Managing Member reduces the Holdback Percentages for Existing
Members, Retaining Withdrawn Members and Deceased Members to 12.5%,
17.5% and 20%, respectively, the Managing Member shall have the
right to subsequently increase the Holdback Percentages to the
Initial Holdback Percentages.
 
25




(iv) (A) Notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, the Company may increase or
decrease the Holdback Percentage for any Member in any Member
Category (in such capacity, the “ Subject Member
”) pursuant to a majority vote of the Regular Members (a
“ Holdback Vote ”); provided , that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the
Holdback Percentage applicable to the Managing Member shall not be
increased or decreased without its prior written consent;
provided further , that a Subject Member’s
Holdback Percentage shall not be (I) increased prior to such
time as such Subject Member (x) is notified by the Company of
the decision to increase such Subject Member’s Holdback
Percentage and (y) has, if requested by such Subject Member,
been given 30 days to gather and provide information to the Company
for consideration before a second Holdback Vote (requested by the
Subject Member) or (II) decreased unless such decrease occurs
subsequent to an increase in a Subject Member’s Holdback
Percentage pursuant to a Holdback Vote under this clause (iv);
provided further , that such decrease shall not
exceed an amount such that such Subject Member’s Holdback
Percentage is less than the prevailing Holdback Percentage for the
Member Category of such Subject Member; provided
further , that a Member shall not vote to increase a Subject
Member’s Holdback Percentage unless such voting Member
determines, in his good faith judgment, that the facts and
circumstances indicate that it is reasonably likely that such
Subject Member, or any of his successors or assigns (including his
estate or heirs) who at the time of such vote holds the GP-Related
Member Interest or otherwise has the right to receive distributions
relating thereto, will not be capable of satisfying any GP-Related
Recontribution Amounts that may become due.
 



 


(B)


A Holdback Vote
shall take place at a Company meeting. Each Regular Member shall be
entitled to cast one vote with respect to the Holdback Vote
regardless of such Regular Member’s interest in the Company.
Such vote may be cast by any Regular Member in person or by
proxy.



 



 


(C)


If the result of the second
Holdback Vote is an increase in a Subject Member’s Holdback
Percentage, such Subject Member may submit the decision to an
arbitrator, the identity of which is mutually agreed upon by both
the Subject Member and the Company; provided , that if the
Company and the Subject Member cannot agree upon a mutually
satisfactory arbitrator within 10 days of the second Holdback Vote,
each of the Company and the Subject Member shall request their
candidate for arbitrator to select a third arbitrator satisfactory
to such candidates; provided further , that if such
candidates fail to agree upon a mutually satisfactory arbitrator
within 30 days of such request, the then sitting President of the
American Arbitration Association shall unilaterally select the
arbitrator. Each Subject Member that submits the decision of the
Company pursuant to the second Holdback Vote to arbitration and the
Company shall estimate their reasonably projected out-of-pocket
expenses relating thereto, and each such party shall, to the
satisfaction of the arbitrator and prior to any determination being
made by the arbitrator, pay the total of such estimated expenses
(i.e., both the Subject Member’s and the Company’s
expenses) into an escrow account to be controlled by Simpson
Thacher & Bartlett LLP, as escrow agent (or such other
comparable law firm as the Company and the Subject Member shall
agree). The arbitrator shall direct the escrow agent to pay out of
such escrow account all expenses associated with such arbitration
(including costs leading thereto) and to return to the
“victorious” party the entire amount of funds such
party paid into such escrow account. If the amount contributed to
the escrow account by the losing party is insufficient to cover the
expenses of such arbitration, such “losing” party shall
then provide any additional funds necessary to cover such costs to
such “victorious” party. For purposes hereof,
the



 
26






 


“victorious” party
shall be the Company if the Holdback Percentage ultimately
determined by the arbitrator is closer to the percentage determined
in the second Holdback Vote than it is to the prevailing Holdback
Percentage for the Subject Member’s Member Category;
otherwise, the Subject Member shall be the “victorious”
party. The party that is not the “victorious” party
shall be the “losing” party.



 



 


(D)


In the event of
a decrease in a Subject Member’s Holdback Percentage
(1) pursuant to a Holdback Vote under this clause (iv) or
(2) pursuant to a decision of an arbitrator under paragraph
(C) of this clause (iv), the Company shall release and
distribute to such Subject Member any Trust Amounts (and the Trust
Income thereon (except as expressly provided herein with respect to
using Trust Income as Firm Collateral)) which exceed the required
Holdback of such Subject Member (in accordance with such Subject
Member’s reduced Holdback Percentage) as though such reduced
Holdback Percentage had applied since the increase of the Subject
Member’s Holdback Percentage pursuant to a previous Holdback
Vote under this clause (iv).




(v) (A) If a Member’s Holdback
Percentage exceeds 15% (such percentage in excess of 15%
constituting the “ Excess Holdback Percentage
”), such Member may satisfy the portion of his Holdback
obligation in respect of his Excess Holdback Percentage (such
portion constituting such Member’s “ Excess
Holdback ”), and such Member (or a Withdrawn Member with
respect to amounts contributed to the Trust Account while he was a
Member), to the extent his Excess Holdback obligation has
previously been satisfied in cash, may obtain the release of the
Trust Amounts (but not the Trust Income thereon which shall remain
in the Trust Account and allocated to such Member or Withdrawn
Member) satisfying such Member’s or Withdrawn Member’s
Excess Holdback obligation, by pledging or otherwise making
available to the Company, on a first priority basis (except as
provided below), all or any portion of his Firm Collateral in
satisfaction of his Excess Holdback obligation. Any Member seeking
to satisfy all or any portion of the Excess Holdback utilizing Firm
Collateral shall sign such documents and otherwise take such other
action as is necessary or appropriate (in the good faith judgment
of the Managing Member) to perfect a first priority security
interest in, and otherwise assure the ability of the Company to
realize on (if required), such Firm Collateral; provided ,
that, in the case of entities listed in the Company’s books
and records in which Members are permitted to pledge their
interests therein to finance all or a portion of their capital
contributions thereto (“ Pledgable Blackstone
Interests ”), to the extent a first priority security
interest is unavailable because of an existing lien on such Firm
Collateral, the Member or Withdrawn Member seeking to utilize such
Firm Collateral shall grant the Company a second priority security
interest therein in the manner provided above; provided
further , that (x) in the case of Pledgable Blackstone
Interests, to the extent that neither a first priority nor a second
priority security interest is available, or (y) if the
Managing Member otherwise determines in its good faith judgment
that a security interest in Firm Collateral (and the corresponding
documents and actions) are not necessary or appropriate, the Member
or Withdrawn Member shall (in the case of either clause (x) or
(y) above) irrevocably instruct in writing the relevant
partnership, limited liability company or other entity listed in
the Company’s books and records to remit any and all net
proceeds resulting from a Firm Collateral Realization on such Firm
Collateral to the Trustee(s) as more fully provided in clause
(B) below. The Company shall, at the request of any Member or
Withdrawn Member, assist such Member or Withdrawn Member in taking
such action necessary to enable such Member or Withdrawn Member to
use Firm Collateral as provided hereunder.
 
27






 


(B)


If upon a sale
or other realization of all or any portion of any Firm Collateral
(a “ Firm Collateral Realization ”), the
remaining Firm Collateral is insufficient to cover any
Member’s or Withdrawn Member’s Excess Holdback
requirement, then up to 100% of the net proceeds otherwise
distributable to such Member or Withdrawn Member from such Firm
Collateral Realization (including distributions subject to the
repayment of financing sources as in the case of Pledgable
Blackstone Interests) shall be paid into the Trust Account to fully
satisfy such Excess Holdback requirement (allocated to such Member
or Withdrawn Member) and shall be deemed to be Trust Amounts for
purposes hereunder. Any net proceeds from such Firm Collateral
Realization in excess of the amount necessary to satisfy such
Excess Holdback requirement shall be distributed to such Member or
Withdrawn Member.



 



 


(C)


Upon any
valuation or revaluation of Firm Collateral that results in a
decreased valuation of such Firm Collateral so that such Firm
Collateral is insufficient to cover any Member’s or Withdrawn
Member’s Excess Holdback requirement (including upon a Firm
Collateral Realization, if net proceeds therefrom and the remaining
Firm Collateral are insufficient to cover any Member’s or
Withdrawn Member’s Excess Holdback requirement), the Company
shall provide notice of the foregoing to such Member or Withdrawn
Member and such Member or Withdrawn Member shall, within 30 days of
receiving such notice, contribute cash (or additional Firm
Collateral) to the Trust Account in an amount necessary to satisfy
his Excess Holdback requirement. If any such Member or Withdrawn
Member defaults upon his obligations under this clause (C), then
Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall apply thereto; provided , that
clause (A) of the first sentence of Section 5.8(d)(ii)
shall be deemed inapplicable to a default under this clause (C);
provided further , that for purposes of applying
Section 5.8(d)(ii) to a default under this clause (C):
(I) the term “GP-Related Defaulting Party” where
such term appears in such Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be
construed as “defaulting party” for purposes hereof and
(II) the terms “Net GP-Related Recontribution Amount”
and “GP-Related Recontribution Amount” where such terms
appear in such Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be construed as the
amount due pursuant to this clause (C).




(vi) Any Member or Withdrawn Member
may (A) obtain the release of any Trust Amounts (but not the
Trust Income thereon which shall remain in the Trust Account and
allocated to such Member or Withdrawn Member) or Firm Collateral,
in each case, held in the Trust Account for the benefit of such
Member or Withdrawn Member or (B) require the Company to
distribute all or any portion of amounts otherwise required to be
placed in the Trust Account (whether cash or Firm Collateral), by
obtaining a letter of credit (an “ L/C ”) for
the benefit of the Trustee(s) in such amounts. Any Member or
Withdrawn Member choosing to furnish an L/C to the Trustee(s) (in
such capacity, an “ L/C Member ”) shall deliver
to the Trustee(s) an unconditional and irrevocable L/C from a
commercial bank whose (x) short-term deposits are rated at
least A-1 by S&P and P-1 by Moody’s (if the L/C is for a
term of 1 year or less), or (y) long-term deposits are rated
at least A+ by S&P or A1 by Moody’s (if the L/C is for a
term of 1 year or more) (each a “ Required Rating
”). If the relevant rating of the commercial bank issuing
such L/C drops below the relevant Required Rating, the L/C Member
shall supply to the Trustee(s), within 30 days of such occurrence,
a new L/C from a commercial bank whose relevant rating is at least
equal to the relevant Required Rating, in lieu of the insufficient
L/C. In addition, if the L/C has a term expiring on a date earlier
than the latest possible termination date of BCP VI, the Trustee(s)
shall be permitted to drawdown on such L/C if the L/C Member fails
to provide a new L/C from a commercial bank whose relevant rating
is at least equal to the relevant
 
28




Required Rating, at least 30 days
prior to the stated expiration date of such existing L/C. The
Trustee(s) shall notify an L/C Member 10 days prior to drawing on
any L/C. The Trustee(s) may (as directed by the Company in the case
of clause (I) below) draw down on an L/C only if (I) such
a drawdown is necessary to satisfy an L/C Member’s obligation
relating to the Company’s obligations under the Clawback
Provisions or (II) an L/C Member has not provided a new L/C from a
commercial bank whose relevant rating is at least equal to the
relevant Required Rating (or the requisite amount of cash and/or
Firm Collateral (to the extent permitted hereunder)), at least 30
days prior to the stated expiration of an existing L/C in
accordance with this clause (vi). The Trustee(s), as directed by
the Company, shall return to any L/C Member his L/C upon
(1) the termination of the Trust Account and satisfaction of
the Company’s obligations, if any, in respect of the Clawback
Provisions, (2) an L/C Member satisfying his entire Holdback
obligation in cash and Firm Collateral (to the extent permitted
hereunder), or (3) the release, by the Trustee(s), as directed
by the Company, of all amounts in the Trust Account to the Members
or Withdrawn Members. If an L/C Member satisfies a portion of his
Holdback obligation in cash and/or Firm Collateral (to the extent
permitted hereunder) or if the Trustee(s), as directed by the
Company, release a portion of the amounts in the Trust Account to
the Members or Withdrawn Members in the Member Category of such L/C
Member, the L/C of an L/C Member may be reduced by an amount
corresponding to such portion satisfied in cash and/or Firm
Collateral (to the extent permitted hereunder) or such portion
released by the Trustee(s), as directed by the Company;
provided , that in no way shall the general release of any
Trust Income cause an L/C Member to be permitted to reduce the
amount of an L/C by any amount.

(vii) (A) Any in-kind distributions
by the Company relating to Carried Interest shall be made in
accordance herewith as though such distributions consisted of cash.
The Company may direct the Trustee(s) to dispose of any in-kind
distributions held in the Trust Account at any time. The net
proceeds therefrom shall be treated as though initially contributed
to the Trust Account.
 



 


(B)


In lieu of the
foregoing, any Existing Member may pledge with respect to any
in-kind distribution the Special Firm Collateral referred to in
asset category 5 on the Company’s books and records;
provided , that the initial contribution of such Special
Firm Collateral shall initially equal 130% of the required Holdback
Amount for a period of 90 days, and thereafter shall equal at least
115% of the required Holdback Amount. Paragraphs 4.1(d)(viii)(C)
and (D) shall apply to such Special Firm Collateral. To the
extent such Special Firm Collateral exceeds the applicable minimum
percentage of the required Holdback Amount specified in the first
sentence of this clause (vii)(B), the related Member may obtain a
release of such excess amount from the Trust Account.




(viii) (A) Any Regular Member or
Withdrawn Member may satisfy all or any portion of his Holdback
(excluding any Excess Holdback), and such Member or a Withdrawn
Member may, to the extent his Holdback (excluding any Excess
Holdback) has been previously been satisfied in cash or by the use
of an L/C as provided herein, obtain a release of Trust Amounts
(but not the Trust Income thereon which shall remain in the Trust
Account and allocated to such Member or Withdrawn Member) that
satisfy such Member’s or Withdrawn Member’s Holdback
(excluding any Excess Holdback) by pledging to the Trustee(s) on a
first priority basis all of his Special Firm Collateral in a
particular Qualifying Fund, which at all times must equal or exceed
the amount of the Holdback distributed to the Member or Withdrawn
Member (as more fully set forth below). Any Member seeking to
satisfy such Member’s Holdback utilizing Special Firm
Collateral shall sign such documents and otherwise take such other
action as is necessary or appropriate (in the good faith judgment
of the Managing Member) to perfect a first priority security
interest in, and otherwise assure the ability of the Trustee(s) to
realize on (if required), such Special Firm Collateral.
 
29






 


(B)


If upon a
distribution, withdrawal, sale, liquidation or other realization of
all or any portion of any Special Firm Collateral (a “
Special Firm Collateral Realization ”), the remaining
Special Firm Collateral (which shall not include the amount of Firm
Collateral that consists of a Qualifying Fund and is being used in
connection with an Excess Holdback) is insufficient to cover any
Member’s or Withdrawn Member’s Holdback (when taken
together with other means of satisfying the Holdback as provided
herein (i.e., cash contributed to the Trust Account or an L/C in
the Trust Account)), then up to 100% of the net proceeds otherwise
distributable to such Member or Withdrawn Member from such Special
Firm Collateral Realization (which shall not include the amount of
Firm Collateral that consists of a Qualifying Fund or other asset
and is being used in connection with an Excess Holdback) shall be
paid into the Trust (and allocated to such Member or Withdrawn
Member) to fully satisfy such Holdback and shall be deemed
thereafter to be Trust Amounts for purposes hereunder. Any net
proceeds from such Special Firm Collateral Realization in excess of
the amount necessary to satisfy such Holdback (excluding any Excess
Holdback) shall be distributed to such Member or Withdrawn Member.
To the extent a Qualifying Fund distributes Securities to a Member
or Withdrawn Member in connection with a Special Firm Collateral
Realization, such Member or Withdrawn Member shall be required to
promptly fund such Member’s or Withdrawn Member’s
deficiency with respect to his Holdback in cash or an
L/C.



 



 


(C)


Upon any
valuation or revaluation of the Special Firm Collateral and/or any
adjustment in the Applicable Collateral Percentage applicable to a
Qualifying Fund (as provided in the Company’s books and
records), if such Member’s or Withdrawn Member’s
Special Firm Collateral is valued at less than such Member’s
Holdback (excluding any Excess Holdback) as provided in the
Company’s books and records, taking into account other
permitted means of satisfying the Holdback hereunder, the Company
shall provide notice of the foregoing to such Member or Withdrawn
Member and, within 10 business days of receiving such notice, such
Member or Withdrawn Member shall contribute cash or additional
Special Firm Collateral to the Trust Account in an amount necessary
to make up such deficiency. If any such Member or Withdrawn Member
defaults upon his obligations under this clause (C), then
Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall apply thereto; provided , that
the first sentence of Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be deemed
inapplicable to such default; provided further , that
for purposes of applying Section 5.8(d)(ii) to a default under
this clause (C): (I) the term “GP-Related Defaulting
Party” where such term appears in such
Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be construed as “defaulting
party” for purposes hereof and (II) the terms “Net
GP-Related Recontribution Amount” and “GP-Related
Recontribution Amount” where such terms appear in such
Section 5.8(d)(ii) shall be construed as the amount due
pursuant to this clause (C).



 



 


(D)


Upon a Member
becoming a Withdrawn Member, at any time thereafter the Managing
Member may revoke the ability of such Withdrawn Member to use
Special Firm Collateral as set forth in this
Section 4.1(d)(viii), notwithstanding anything else in this
Section 4.1(d)(viii). In that case the provisions of clause
(C) above shall apply to the Withdrawn Member’s
obligation to satisfy the Holdback (except that 30 days’
notice of such revocation shall be given), given that the Special
Firm Collateral is no longer available to satisfy any portion of
the Holdback (excluding any Excess Holdback).



 
30






 


(E)


Nothing in this
Section 4.1(d)(viii) shall prevent any Member or Withdrawn
Member from using any amount of such Member’s interest in a
Qualifying Fund as Firm Collateral; provided that at all
times Section 4.1(d)(v) and this Section 4.1(d)(viii) are
each satisfied.
