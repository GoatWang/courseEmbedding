I purchased three at that time and now am in need of more so here I am. The first ones I purchased worked fine and I will continue to use them as long as they perform as well as the first ones did.

With this order, I ordered more cartridges and received them the next day via USPS.  I was very surprised.  It seems that LD products listened to my previous comments and reacted appropriately.  That was amazing.  For any company to change how they do ship items based on feedback shows good customer support.  I am very happy with the cartridges and will be using many more of their cartridges in the future.

I was a General Appraiser and she a Residential Appraiser. We used LD Products for most of the Time we had our office at home. I have been well satisfied with LD products. Over time we accumulated a number of used cartridges.   When we used original Xerox cartridges they could be shipped back to them without our paying the cost of shipping. I don't know your current policy in that regard.    I plan to print out my order and mail payment probably prior to the 11th of July.

Note from Drone.VC


Note that we will be moving our syndicate investment off of AngelList; if you are an interested accredited investor, please visit invest.weekly.org.Drone.VC Syndicate: This is a domain-specific syndicate built to discover and invest in prototype-phase companies working with drones. Investments are intended to be early money in to these companies, often as early as time of incorporation. Applications are expected to cover a very wide range of geographies and industries, including farming, oil and gas, real estate, retail/delivery, and security/surveillance. We do not plan on investing in military-focused applications or weaponized platforms. We do not invest in media-centric plays (e.g. networks of contract drone videographers) or business plans in need of a technical cofounder.If you are a founder who has something working and wants a hand bringing it to market / accelerating your progress, we want to talk to you - fill out a company application at apply.drone.vc. We'd love to add you to our portfolio of awesome companies bringing our airspace into the 21st century. Bonus points if there's a female on your founding team. (Such companies outperform!)ABOUT THE FOUNDER (David Weekly): As the founder of the world's largest hackerspace, Hacker Dojo, and Mexico's first seed fund for tech entreprenurs (Mexican.VC), David is well-connected to the global startup community. As an award-winning startup mentor, David has a rich history in mentoring successful startups, including naming Sean Parker's Plaxo (exit to Comcast for >$150m), acting as the lead advisor for Attassa ($Xmm to YouSendIt), advising Like.com (exit to Google for >$100m), and dozens of others.You can view a copy of the Drone.VC Prospectus at https://quip.com/KSFvAbz9yB7a

Fully Integrated Circuit Design Aihara's Chaotic Neuron ModelJiman Kim , Jinwoo Jung, Bomin Kwon, Juhong Park, Namtae Kim*, Yongsu Park**, Jewon Lee and Hanjung SongDepartment of Nano Engeering, Inje University*Department of Electronics and Intelligent Robotics Engineering ,Inje University**Department of Electronics, Chungcheong Universityhjsong@inje.ac.krAbstract- This paper presents design of the integrated chaotic neuron using 0.8 ศ single poly CMOS technology, its dynamical behavior analysis. Proposed chaotic neuron consists of several op-amps, sample and hold circuits, a nonlinear function block for chaotic signal generation, a two-phase clock circuits and sigmoid output function block. From HSPICE simulation results of the circuit, approximated empirical equations is induced. Then the dynamical responses of the chaotic neuron such as bifurcation diagram, time series, Lyapunov exponent, and average firing rate are calculated with numerical analysis.I. INTRODUCTIONIn 1943, since McCulloch and Pitts proposed the neuron model for the first time, during last several decades, there have been many remarkable studies about artificial neural network in various areas[1-3]. However, in case of most artificial neural networks, it was a essential limits that use simple neuron models which don't include the more complicated dynamic behavior of the biological neuron. In 1990, A chaotic model in considering dynamic behavior of the real neuron was proposed by Aihara[4-5]. During last two decades, the various mathematical modeling, theoretical analysis and hardware realization about chaotic neuron model continuously has been reported[6-7]. In this paper, we designed a fully-integratedchaotic neuron which consists of several op-amps, S/H circuits, a nonlinear function block and sigmoid output function block using 0.8 ໃ single poly CMOS technology. And we present various dynamical responses of the proposed circuit by numerical analysisII. CIRCUIT DESIGN OF THE AIHARA'S CHAOTIC NEURON MODELThe block diagram for integrated circuit realization of the proposed chaotic is shown in Fig. 1. As shown in the figure, the proposed circuit consists of two sample-holds, several op-amps, a nonlinear function block and a two-phase clock generator. Two sample-hold blocks are used as a delay element for feedback of the state x(t). Several resistors and two op-amps form an adder.Inje Univ., Eobang-dong ,Gimhae-si, Gyeongsangnam-do, Korea*Contacting Author: Hanjung Song  is with the Department of Nano Engeering, Inje University (phone:+82-55-320-3873; email : hjsong@inje.ac.kr)Fig. 1.

Next-Generation Low Power Static Checking 



SoC designs use low power design techniques to enable support for advanced power management required in many of today’s electronic products, from mobile device to servers and networking. Advanced low power techniques such as Power Gating, Retention, Low-Vdd Standby, and Dynamic Voltage Scaling (DVS) employ voltage control to enable fine-grained power management, and are seeing increasingly prevalent adoption. Due to the nature of low power design architectures and behavior, low power verification complexity is exponentially more challenging than for always-on verification. Native low power simulation and advanced low power static verification and signoff must manage this increased complexity, and still attain all verification objectives.

Static Checking Challenges for Low Power Designs



Advanced intent-driven low power design flows requires complete and rapid checking of low power implementation and behavior validity at every stage in the flow. In addition, analyzing, debugging and fixing violations must be easy and efficient, in order to effectively enable designers to eliminate possibly design-killing low power bugs early in the design flow.
 
Low power SoC designs are partitioned into power domains that can be separately controlled by one or more low power design techniques, and verification complexity increases exponentially with the number of power domains. Also, increasingly stringent power requirements have necessitated the use of multiple supply voltages, adding another dimension to verification complexity. Finally, low power designs typically operate in multiple modes, with each mode corresponding to one or more power states—yet a third dimension of additional complexity. Comprehensive verification of low power designs requires verification not just in all the power domains, all combinations of supply voltages, and all power states and modes, but also of the specified transitions and transition order within these power states as the design moves from one operating mode to another. A single bug in any of these incredibly complex scenarios may cause functional failures in silicon.
 
Low power design techniques add new design elements at different stages of the design flow. Architectural design bugs that violate the principles of low power design may exist even at RTL. Isolation cells are typically synthesized automatically. Retention register connections need to be validated after synthesis and again after place and route. Multi-voltage designs require the appropriate power and ground pins to be connected to the specified supply rails. Low power static checking must operate comprehensively in all stages of the design flow in order to accurately verify correct implementation and behavior in all of these cases. 









Features and Benefits




Power Intent Consistency Checks: Syntax and semantic checks on UPF that help validate the consistency of UPF prior to implementation. Incorrect power intent will result in incorrect low power design implementation. The UPF consistency checks ensure that the power intent specification driving low power implementation is syntactically and semantically correct.


Architectural Checks: Global checks at RTL for signals violating power architecture rules. VC LP validates the design in its entirety and checks the critical signal networks in the design for the various power modes. These checks help find connectivity related bugs, which would cause functional issues very early in the design cycle.


Structural and Power and Ground (PG) Checks: Validation of insertion and connection of isolation cells, power switches, level shifters, retention registers and always-on cells throughout the implementation flow, from initial synthesis to place and route.


Functional Checks: Checks the correct functionality of isolation cells and power switches. The most accurate and production-proven support for industry-standard IEEE 1801 Unified Power Format (UPF) power intent.


Hierarchical Power State Analysis: Designs with a large number of power domains benefit from the automatic derivation of a hierarchical power- state table. VC LP understands the power intent and is able to prune a large number of power states to a few distinct ones, thus reducing the effort involved to specify and then verify all the power states, transitions and sequences.


Complex Power State Table Debug: Related to hierarchical power state analysis, VC LP provides users the ability to understand and if necessary, debug the resulting complex power state tables.

Previous studies demonstrate two L5 pyramid types: cortico-cortical (CC) and cortico-subcortical (CS). We characterize connectivity and function of these cell types in mouse primary visual cortex and reveal a new subtype. Unlike previously described L5 CC and CS neurons, this new subtype does not project to striatum [cortico-cortical, non-striatal (CC-NS)] and has distinct morphology, physiology, and visual responses. Monosynaptic rabies tracing reveals that CC neurons preferentially receive input from higher visual areas, while CS neurons receive more input from structures implicated in top-down modulation of brain states. CS neurons are also more direction-selective and prefer faster stimuli than CC neurons. These differences suggest distinct roles as specialized output channels, with CS neurons integrating information and generating responses more relevant to movement control and CC neurons being more important in visual perception.Received: June 26, 2015; Received in revised form: September 18, 2015; Accepted: October 22, 2015; Published: December 3, 2015© 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Limited Partner Secondaries and Signals of Defaults








February 8, 2016



As featured in Secondaries Investor (Subscription) on 2/8/16
 
The recent stock market correction and ongoing volatility signal that another cycle of increased secondary volume driven by Limited Partner (“LP”) sales may be imminent.  It has been over seven years since the industry has experienced defaults in any meaningful volume, and we are now starting to see an increase in this activity.  This primer identifies the market dynamics that lead to LP defaults and the criteria that GPs employ to fill in the gaps with appropriate, valuable investors.
How the LP Secondary Market Works
Transactions in the secondary market for company shares and limited partnership interests are much less public than in the primary venture market.  When a VC invests in a company, both the company and the venture fund typically promote the investment via social media and a press release.  Secondary transactions seldom get announced, and one-off LP interest transfers are never publicized by venture capital funds.  It’s not surprising that general partners and their respective limited partners want to keep this activity quiet - an LP interest transfer resulting from a very practical reason could unnecessarily be misconstrued as a vote of no confidence by the LP or a signal of an LP’s poor financial health. Contrary to popular belief, almost every venture capital fund experiences LP transfers.
LP Defaults on the Rise and Transfers
Like a VC-backed company has investors, a venture fund has investors (i.e. the Limited Partners or “LPs”) who sign Limited Partnership Agreements (“LPAs”) that legally bind them to fund a certain amount of money (i.e. commitment amount).  Unlike VC-backed companies, limited partners do not fund the entire commitment amount on day one.   Typically, the general partner of a venture fund draws down capital over a three to seven year period on an as-needed basis.  LPAs usually state that if a limited partner does not fund a capital call (i.e. a request for part of the commitment amount as part of an investment in the portfolio), then the limited partner may be placed in default.  When an LP default occurs, the general partner will seek to find a new limited partner to buy out the defaulting LP and take over the unfunded liabilities.
The secondary market typically experiences increased selling and transfer activity in venture funds after a public market correction or a liquidity crunch (i.e. the current energy market crisis).  When investors lose large amounts of capital in the public market (e.g. more than a -15 to -30% correction in the NASDAQ), individual and non-traditional limited partners in venture funds traditionally start to sell or reduce their stakes to reduce or eliminate their unfunded liabilities (i.e. future capital calls). 
Suitable Secondary LPs
What type of new limited partner does a venture fund want? Assessing over 200 venture capital fund secondary transfers where our firm acquired interests, we identified several criteria that venture capital managers use to find a new limited partner:
1. A stable balance sheet and understanding of the asset class and company risk levels
2. A  long-term capital source with prior experience in the asset class
3. An existing limited partner relationship with the desire to increase fund ownership
4. Ability and pre-disposition to invest into new partnerships in the future
5. Ability to help portfolio companies with value-added introductions, strategic advice, and direct co-investment dollars
6. Straightforward internal processes
7. A proven commitment to the asset class through both up- and down-cycles
8. Diversified capital sources (i.e. not only invested in one area)
9. Prior experience with secondary transactions 
Quickly identifying appropriate LPs can help minimize the inevitable negative impact of defaults on venture capital funds and portfolio company management teams.  Working with an experienced and trusted partner solves this problem, and allows the industry to function in a healthy way regardless of fluctuating market cycles.

Share











		Industry Ventures was formed in 2000 by Hans Swildens to make seed stage investments in start-up technology companies. Shortly after making our first investments the NASDAQ collapsed and the venture business entered a very difficult liquidity period. In 2001, we pivoted the investment focus to purchase shares in venture backed companies in secondary transactions.
	

		Our first secondary investment was the purchase of shares in Speedera Networks from a publicly traded corporation. Hans helped his brother Eric start Speedera Networks with Rich Day and Ajit Gupta (together the "ERA"). Speedera Networks was acquired by Akamai in 2005. Prior to Speedera, Eric and Hans founded Microline Software after Eric wrote various user interface components of Netscape Navigator 1.0 in 1994. Microline was acquired in 1997 by Neuron Data and the combined company rebranded Blaze Software. Blaze went public in 2000 and was subsequently acquired by Fair Isaac.
	

		A few months after buying part of Speedera, the firm acquired the venture capital division of Electronic Data Systems (EDS). During the period of 2002-2004, the firm acquired over $200 million of invested capital from various sellers of venture capital portfolios including Bowman Capital, Enron Broadband Ventures and Infospace. This investment activity was instrumental in the early formation of the secondary market for venture capital investments. 
	

		In 2008, we launched our fund of funds effort with the acquisition of Little Hawk Capital Management. We saw inefficiencies and investment outperformance in small venture capital funds. We have subsequently built a portfolio of over twenty small venture capital funds with leading early stage investors. Today we co-invest alongside these funds in their high-growth businesses.
	

		Over the last decade, the firm evolved from being a pioneer of secondary investments into the leading provider of liquidity for the venture capital market.  We manage over $2 billion from institutional investors and operate with one of the largest investment teams in the market.
