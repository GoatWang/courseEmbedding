2017 Investment Outlook


































The Long Cycle Continues





We expect the long post-crisis economic recovery to continue in 2017. As a base case, we think growth is poised to broaden out to more countries, with the global economy drawing on more sources of strength than at any point since 2010.
From an investment perspective, our base case view is broadly supportive for risk assets. We prefer equities over credit and credit over rates, but we expect low returns from these traditional exposures given 1) elevated valuations, 2) limited upside for corporate earnings from current levels and 3) limits to economic growth potential. Broadening exposure beyond conventional stocks and bonds, identifying opportunities in emerging markets and deploying more dynamic asset allocation strategies are some ways to adapt.
In some respects, our outlook represents an extension of the same long cycle we envisioned heading into 2016. The key difference for 2017 revolves around four emerging transitions. Populism is challenging globalism and creating new tail risks. Concerns about low growth are giving way to concerns about inflation. Years of focus on monetary policy are giving way to a close watch over fiscal policy. And concerns about new regulation are acceding to hopes for de-regulation.
Transition will be an evolving theme in 2017, and we will be re-visiting it in our publications throughout the year. In this Investment Outlook, we highlight specific signposts we will be watching, both to gauge the pace of transition and to test our base case view on the key investment questions.









Three Key Questions







Is it time to de-risk?
Is it time to de-risk?
No. We think de-risking would be premature, at
least from a purely return-generating standpoint. We
expect the macro environment to remain supportive
of risk assets during 2017 amid a slow-but-steady
expansion in developed markets and an acceleration
of growth in some emerging markets.

What’s driving the expansion?
What’s driving the expansion?
We believe this is a slow-growth recovery best
explained by cyclical economic drivers. We believe
the concerns about the developed world being mired
in a pattern of underinvestment and stalled growth—
so-called secular stagnation—are overdone.

Where do we see opportunities?
Where do we see opportunities?
In a low-return world, we look for sources of
return beyond conventional stock and bond market
approaches. We also think range-bound or volatile
markets create opportunities for more dynamic
investment strategies.

Transitions We’re Watching in 2017


















												Globalism to Populism
											



The biggest transition in the current environment is a shift away from globalism to a rising populist trend.















												Stagnation to Inflation
											



We expect concerns around potential secular stagnation to give way to a more inflationary paradigm in the US.















												Monetary to Fiscal Policy
											



The focus for stimulus is shifting toward fiscal spending, as central banks are stretching toward the limits of their easing ability.
















												Regulation to De-Regulation
											



We see the potential for greater regulatory divergence globally and the potential for competitive de-regulation.

High Yield Overview





We have been employing the same investment strategy in dedicated High Yield portfolios through multiple business cycles since 1998, and since 1994 in a cross-over portfolio.Additional High Yield MaterialsDetailed Philosophy and Strategy PresentationGIPS PresentationHigh Yield ProductsActive ManagementWe are active managers. We do not circle around an index, making minor tweaks to industry weightings. There are several industries where our portfolio is very underweight or has no representation at all because their cyclical nature makes high leverage inappropriate, or because the industry is in long-term secular decline. We are more focused than most managers, historically holding not much more than 100 issuers in the portfolio. Our turnover ratio tends to be lower than average, since our strategy leads us to longer time horizons in our investments.The Core PortfolioWe build a core portfolio around long-term secular trends. Some examples of these are demographics, technology, globalization, regulatory trends, and fiscal and monetary policy. Alignment with these trends can give companies the support of a strong tailwind. This, in combination with our industry focus, leads to a more robust portfolio.








Industry FirstIn analyzing a company we first seek to gain an understanding of the industry and its long-term trends. Our experience is that this constitutes more than half of the investment process. Most often it boils down to the basic question of Econ 101: Are supply and demand in balance? If not, what will bring them into balance?Analyze as a CFO WouldWe analyze companies as a good CFO would, making sure there is adequate return on capital, cash flow, and liquidity, and that the company reinvests enough to sustain the business.Out-of-Favor Industries/SectorsWe supplement the core portfolio first by investing in out-of-favor sectors. Not simply contrarians, we invest in out-of-favor sectors that have long-term viability and where our industry analysis tells us that supply and demand are on a path to rebalancing, usually through a cleansing of excess supply. That rebalancing can take two or more years, so analyzing companies as a CFO is important in identifying the survivors. The great thing about high yield bonds, as opposed to stock, is that you can get rewarded by collecting high interest income while the industry turnaround works itself out.Non-Traditional High YieldThe second strategy we employ to supplement the core portfolio is to invest in non-traditional high yield securities that have fallen out of favor. Some examples of these are Emerging Market debt, convertible bonds, preferreds, and REITs. These sectors have select groups of natural buyers that periodically abandon them. When these sectors of the capital market lose their natural buyers, their yields can become very competitive to high yield. The advantage of these sectors is that they not only offer competitive yields, but their lower correlation to traditional high yield serves to reduce overall risk of the portfolio.Risk Control Inherent in the StrategyWe wait for out-of-favor opportunities to present themselves to us and screen them for viable investments. Towards the end of the business cycle investors chase every bit of extra yield they can find and very little tends to be out-of-favor. In that environment the lack of opportunities “forces” us back into our core portfolio. Late in the cycle yield spreads are tight overall, thus minimizing the cost of being in that more conservative, less cyclical portfolio. With our “horns pulled in”, we tend to be better situated for a downturn and for the out-of-favor opportunities that will arise from it.

2017 Investment Outlook


































The Long Cycle Continues





We expect the long post-crisis economic recovery to continue in 2017. As a base case, we think growth is poised to broaden out to more countries, with the global economy drawing on more sources of strength than at any point since 2010.
From an investment perspective, our base case view is broadly supportive for risk assets. We prefer equities over credit and credit over rates, but we expect low returns from these traditional exposures given 1) elevated valuations, 2) limited upside for corporate earnings from current levels and 3) limits to economic growth potential. Broadening exposure beyond conventional stocks and bonds, identifying opportunities in emerging markets and deploying more dynamic asset allocation strategies are some ways to adapt.
In some respects, our outlook represents an extension of the same long cycle we envisioned heading into 2016. The key difference for 2017 revolves around four emerging transitions. Populism is challenging globalism and creating new tail risks. Concerns about low growth are giving way to concerns about inflation. Years of focus on monetary policy are giving way to a close watch over fiscal policy. And concerns about new regulation are acceding to hopes for de-regulation.
Transition will be an evolving theme in 2017, and we will be re-visiting it in our publications throughout the year. In this Investment Outlook, we highlight specific signposts we will be watching, both to gauge the pace of transition and to test our base case view on the key investment questions.









Three Key Questions







Is it time to de-risk?
Is it time to de-risk?
No. We think de-risking would be premature, at
least from a purely return-generating standpoint. We
expect the macro environment to remain supportive
of risk assets during 2017 amid a slow-but-steady
expansion in developed markets and an acceleration
of growth in some emerging markets.

What’s driving the expansion?
What’s driving the expansion?
We believe this is a slow-growth recovery best
explained by cyclical economic drivers. We believe
the concerns about the developed world being mired
in a pattern of underinvestment and stalled growth—
so-called secular stagnation—are overdone.

Where do we see opportunities?
Where do we see opportunities?
In a low-return world, we look for sources of
return beyond conventional stock and bond market
approaches. We also think range-bound or volatile
markets create opportunities for more dynamic
investment strategies.

Transitions We’re Watching in 2017


















												Globalism to Populism
											



The biggest transition in the current environment is a shift away from globalism to a rising populist trend.















												Stagnation to Inflation
											



We expect concerns around potential secular stagnation to give way to a more inflationary paradigm in the US.















												Monetary to Fiscal Policy
											



The focus for stimulus is shifting toward fiscal spending, as central banks are stretching toward the limits of their easing ability.
















												Regulation to De-Regulation
											



We see the potential for greater regulatory divergence globally and the potential for competitive de-regulation.









2017 GDP Forecasts by Country, Region and Market (%)
